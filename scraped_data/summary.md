# Chris Chan: A Comprehensive Biographical Summary

## Early Life & Background (1982-2000)

**Christopher Weston Chandler** was born on February 24, 1982, at Martha Jefferson Hospital in Charlottesville, Virginia, to Robert Franklin Chandler Jr. (Bob) and Barbara Ann Weston. His parents had met in 1979 at a Richmond pub, where Barbara was reportedly smitten by Bob's singing. The couple married in June 1980, with Barbara later admitting she married Bob "because he owned a house."

### Family Background

Chris's family situation was complex from the start. His father Bob, born in 1927, was an elderly parent who had previously been married. Barbara, born in 1941, had a complicated romantic history including previous marriages to Ran Coleman Yeatts and Jerry Harmon. She had a son from her first marriage, Cole Smithey, who would later become a film critic and maintain a distant relationship with the family.

### Early Development and Autism

At approximately 18 months old, Chris allegedly experienced trauma when an abusive babysitter with the surname Roach locked him in a room, which Chris later blamed for his autism and muteness. He remained largely non-verbal until age seven, when he began speaking again while reading a GoBots package. Around age five or six, Chris received an official autism diagnosis, later confirmed by a 2004 psychiatric evaluation.

### Education and Creative Beginnings

Chris attended various schools throughout his childhood, including Greene County Primary School and later Manchester High School (1996-2000) in Midlothian, Virginia. His family moved frequently due to educational disputes, with Bob even homeschooling Chris for fifth grade after conflicts with the Greene County school system.

During his teenage years, Chris developed several interests that would define his later life:
- **Video Games**: He won a $1,000 Sonic the Hedgehog sweepstakes in 1993, gaining local news attention
- **Creative Expression**: He made various videos and creative projects, including a homemade Nintendo Power magazine in 1998
- **Early Internet Presence**: He created multiple websites starting in 1999, including CWC's Pokésite

### The Birth of Sonichu

The most significant moment of Chris's creative life occurred on **March 17, 2000**, during his senior year at Manchester High School. For a computer graphics class assignment requiring a CD cover design, Chris was told he couldn't use copyrighted characters. His solution was to combine Sonic the Hedgehog with Pokémon's Pikachu, creating **Sonichu**—a character that would dominate the rest of his life.

## The Sonichu Creation & Love Quest Era (2000-2007)

### Post-High School Transition

Chris graduated from Manchester High School in May 2000, though the ceremony was emotional as he felt overlooked for artistic recognition. He then enrolled at Piedmont Virginia Community College (PVCC), initially studying marketing before switching to Computer-Aided Drafting and Design (CADD) at his father's suggestion.

### The Love Quest Begins

Chris's 21st birthday on February 24, 2003, marked a turning point. After being kicked out of his college English class, he experienced what he described as his "worst birthday"—no friends, no gifts, just academic failure. This traumatic event catalyzed his "**Love Quest**"—an obsessive search for a "boyfriend-free girl" that would consume the next several years.

### Early Romantic Failures

Chris's approach to finding romance was unconventional and problematic:
- **Attraction Signs**: He created signs advertising himself as seeking an 18-21 year old single female companion
- **Campus Activities**: Dean Mary Lee Walsh at PVCC repeatedly confronted Chris about his disruptive courtship methods
- **The Confrontation**: In October 2003, Walsh confiscated Chris's sign and allegedly told him "You're NOT ALLOWED TO FIND TRUE LOVE HERE," an event Chris considered traumatic

### Creative Output Explosion

Between 2003-2007, Chris's creative productivity peaked:
- **Music**: He recorded "Christian and the Hedgehog Boys" album in 2003, featuring songs like "So Need a Cute Girl"
- **Comics**: He began developing Sonichu comics and lore extensively
- **Videos**: He created numerous videos documenting his life and promoting his work

### Legal Troubles

Chris's Love Quest activities led to escalating legal issues:
- **2004**: Arrested at Target for disorderly conduct and trespassing while looking for girlfriend prospects
- **2005**: Banned from Fashion Square Mall after a trolling incident with a fake admirer named Hanna

### The Megan Schroeder Relationship

One of Chris's most significant relationships during this period was with **Megan Schroeder**, whom he met at The GAMe PLACe in 2004-2005. Chris developed an intense obsession with Megan, creating the character "Sailor Megtune" in her honor and constantly pursuing her romantically despite her clear disinterest. This relationship would end disastrously in 2008 when Megan discovered inappropriate artwork Chris had created of her.

## Internet Discovery & Trolling Begins (2007-2010)
