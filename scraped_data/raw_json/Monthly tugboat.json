Chris is known to have belonged to this system since at least <a href=\"/cwcki/2007\" title=\"2007\">2007</a>, before he was <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_in_the_media#Something_Awful\" title=\"Chris in the media\">discovered</a> by the <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_the_Internet\" title=\"Chris and the Internet\">Internet</a>. In the <a href=\"/cwcki/Father_Call\" title=\"Father Call\">Father Call</a>, Chris claimed that his disability check was \"a stepping-stone in the right direction of [him] moving out.\" Given Chris's tendency to waste his free money on <a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_toys\" title=\"List of toys\">frivolous junk</a> rather than put it towards anything that might improve his life, he was probably just telling Matt what he thought he wanted to hear.\n</p><p>Contrary to popular belief, Chris's check is not need-based, but is awarded on eligibility alone. Most US Americans have to work a decade to qualify.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup> Chris, on the other hand, has only been employed for six months (three at <a href=\"/cwcki/Wendy%27s\" title=\"Wendy's\">Wendy's</a>, three in a <a href=\"/cwcki/Cutco\" title=\"Cutco\">pyramid scheme</a>). However, <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler\" title=\"Bob Chandler\">Bob</a> earned retirement insurance in his years at General Electric, and Social Security also lets retirees' dependent disabled children get payments, even if they have never worked themselves, so long as they were disabled before turning 22.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup> As long as Chris earns less than $1220 a month,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup> and stays unmarried (to <a href=\"/cwcki/Polyamorous_marriage\" title=\"Polyamorous marriage\">someone real</a>, at least) and <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_the_law\" title=\"Chris and the law\">out of jail</a>, he will continue to receive his monthly tugboat unimpeded.\n</p><p>In <a href=\"/cwcki/2010\" title=\"2010\">2010</a>, Chris received $809 each month, with $580 going to his parents for room, board, and to pay toward his credit card debt.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-7\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">[7]</a></sup> After <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bob\" title=\"Bob\">his father</a>'s death in <a href=\"/cwcki/September_2011\" title=\"September 2011\">September 2011</a>, Chris's tugboat increased.

Your tax dollars at work, gentlemen.</div></div></div>\n<h3><span id=\"Chris.27s_economic_logic\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris's_economic_logic\">Chris's economic logic</span></h3>\n<p>Challenged by a correspondent in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag\" title=\"Mailbag\">Mailbag</a>, Chris claimed that he is not wasting taxpayer funds, because he is putting that money back into the economy and indirectly paying the tugboats of others. According to Chris's <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">logic</a>, by purchasing useless commercial goods, he is paying sales tax, which the government puts directly back into the hands of the needy.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-9\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">[9]</a></sup> This is irrefutably false; sales taxes go towards state and local governments, but SSDI is funded by <i>federal</i> <i><b>payroll</b></i> tax (FICA), which Chris has never contributed to for all but a few months of his life. \n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_argument_against_Chris_supporting_the_economy\">The argument against Chris supporting the economy</span></h4>\n<p>One can take into consideration that not all of Chris's benefits will stay in the U.S. economy. Chris spends quite a bit of his tugboat on imported products. For example, <a href=\"/cwcki/Nintendo\" title=\"Nintendo\">Nintendo</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Sony\" title=\"Sony\">Sony</a> are Japanese corporations, and Chris's beloved <a href=\"/cwcki/Lego\" title=\"Lego\">Lego</a> is a product of Denmark. These companies do have U.S. bases, and a small amount of R&amp;D occurs stateside (this is mostly true of Sony, which may as well be an honorary American business). But at the end of the day, most of it occurs overseas. Let's not forget that the majority of Chris's <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Toys\" title=\"Toys\">toys</a>, electronics, and other products were most likely made in some sweatshop in <a href=\"/cwcki/China\" title=\"China\">China</a>, though to be fair, much of the revenue from American-designed Chinese electronics is overhead for the engineers and company in general. \n</p><p>In short, a good chunk of the tugboat ends up overseas, so if anything, he's supporting the world economy and furthering globalization. He's far from being alone at that, seeing the complexity of supply chains and international media popularity, but a good chunk of what Chris doesn't spend on food is spent on foreign electronics and toys. \n</p><p>Ironically, if Chris bought a <a href=\"/cwcki/HEXBox\" title=\"HEXBox\">HEXBox</a> earlier (instead of boycotting it until 2017), the majority of money spent on it and on many of its games would be put back into the U.S. economy, as Microsoft is headquartered in Redmond, Washington, which only receives a sliver of what Chris has spent on Nintendo games.\n</p><p>Chris arguably also did his part in funding industries that cost people in the long run, such as fast food.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References_by_Chris\">References by Chris</span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:202px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:StatementforViv01,2010-2.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"262\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/1/10/StatementforViv01%2C2010-2.jpg/200px-StatementforViv01%2C2010-2.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/1/10/StatementforViv01%2C2010-2.jpg/300px-StatementforViv01%2C2010-2.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/1/10/StatementforViv01%2C2010-2.jpg/400px-StatementforViv01%2C2010-2.jpg 2x\" width=\"200\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:StatementforViv01,2010-2.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Chris's bank statement, showing a payment from SSDI on the 3rd of the month.</div></div></div>\n<p>Chris does not even understand <i>which program he is on</i>.
