In the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jackie_e-mails\" title=\"Jackie e-mails\">Jackie e-mails</a>, Chris claimed that he had been thrown out of the store much earlier than Mimms indicates, in June 2008. It was in this month, according to Chris, that Michael Snyder forced him to stop hogging the TV for his Wii. Doing this apparently caused a number of kids to miss out on obtaining a few trade-only evolution Pokémon. Chris got angry, and snatched a card box to write \"Michael Snyder Loves the 'F' out of <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Mary Lee Walsh</a>\" on it. This so-called \"Wii incident,\" Chris claimed, was Michael's last straw which precipitated the ban. This account is <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/List_of_Chris%27s_Lies\" title=\"List of Chris's Lies\">almost certainly false</a>; apart from contradicting Mimms' more objective account, Chris predictably tried to paint himself as getting one up on Snyder, and assumed that Mike would know or care who Mary was.\n</p><p>On another occasion, however, Chris claimed that \"Michael was scared of me and and uh, he was afrai- and he was uh, preoccupied with his crackpot theory of me scaring his- scaring his... customers away, so he banned me from the store.\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-11\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">[11]</a></sup> In December 2013, his explanation was, \"he has his hangups against me (still has them); he's either frightened or angry at me for the one or two times I let out a loud shout when there was too much going on at the time and I couldn't take it anymore.\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-12\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">[12]</a></sup> At other times, he has assumed that Mike is prejudiced against autistic individuals, and had discriminated against him. In any case, while Chris has sometimes admitted that he caused some small problems, he has not felt that they justified a permanent ban, and he blames Snyder's overreaction on an irrational hatred.\n</p><p>Even worse, from Chris's perspective, Michael refused to accept his numerous apologies and lift the ban. In March 2009, Chris made a clearly self-serving <a href=\"/cwcki/YouTube\" title=\"YouTube\">YouTube</a> video apology to Michael and asked to be readmitted to the PLACe. The following month he tried again, posting an apology on the sidebar of another video. Yet again in October 2010, Chris made a bogus YouTube apology in order to look better to his <a href=\"/cwcki/Jackie\" title=\"Jackie\">girlfriend</a>. None of them had any effect. On 12 April 2010, Chris trespassed to pay a personal visit to Michael at the PLACe, and <a href=\"/cwcki/Michael_Snyder_is_ColdHearted_and_Mean\" title=\"Michael Snyder is ColdHearted and Mean\">tried to apologize</a> in an attempt to get the ban lifted. Michael said no. Chris quickly dissolved into fury, <a href=\"/cwcki/South_Park\" title=\"South Park\">yelling \"Jew\"</a> as an insult and flipping him off. Michael attempted to get the fuzz, but by the time they got there Chris had already scrammed.\n</p><p>Unable to comprehend Michael's actions, Chris came to suspect that some greater conspiracy was at work. As the organized trolling of Chris shifted into high gear, Chris wondered if Michael was somehow behind it all. \"What are you, A CONFIRMED INTERNET TROLL?!!!,\" he asked in July 2009. In May 2010, he put forth the theory that Greene County, Virginia school board officials had persuaded Michael to ban him, for no other reason than to make his life miserable. Perhaps because of this conspiratorial mindset, Chris seems to have jumped to his conclusion that Michael was Jewish on account of his last name. In <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/100_2178\" title=\"100 2178\">his May 2010 video</a>, Chris called Michael \"GOD-DAMN, GREEDY... SNYDER,\" seeming to restrain himself from calling Snyder a \"greedy Jew.\" In fact, \"Schneider\" is a German surname meaning \"tailor\" (and \"Snyder\" [or \"Sneijder\"] descends from the Dutch word for \"cutter\"). While some Eastern European and Russian Jews might have wound up with the name by anglicizing \"Shnaider\" (Шнайдер) or \"Sznajder,\" it doesn't necessarily denote Jewish heritage at all. The bottom line is that Michael is not Jewish.\n</p><p><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Matthew_Noble_call\" title=\"Matthew Noble call\">A phone call</a> on 10 August 2010 indicated that <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler\" title=\"Bob Chandler\">Bob</a> (and, presumably, Barb as well) shared Chris's idea of the GAMe PLACe as Troll Central:\n</p>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">Mike's been <a href=\"/cwcki/Kick_the_Autistic\" title=\"Kick the Autistic\">persecuting him</a> for years and I don't like Mike.

When several people came out of the store to confront him, Chris got back in his car and attempted to flee, nearly hitting Snyder twice as he attempted to block Chris's escape. Two <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jerkops\" title=\"Jerkops\">police officers</a> present at the shopping center stopped the fracas. At that moment Michael appeared on YouTube and commented \"Christian is in my parking lot right now being grilled by the police.

They witness this, and I bet they still do nothing about it.\" The officers listened to both sides, and then let Chris off with a warning after making him delete the pictures he'd taken. To present his side of the story, Chris posted an incredibly delusional <a href=\"/cwcki/6_June_2010\" title=\"6 June 2010\">video</a> in which he claimed that Michael had jumped on top of his hood and shouted, \"YOU'RE DEAD! YOU'RE DEAD!\" He admitted to trying to flee from the police, and saw nothing wrong with his actions. Chris told a very similar fanciful story of <a href=\"/cwcki/26_December_2014\" title=\"26 December 2014\">another assault</a> four years later.

Chris and Barb both hit the proprietor with their vehicle and injured him. They were arrested near the scene and spent a day in jail. Both faced felony charges for failure to stop after an accident, while Chris also had trespassing and misdemeanor assault, and Barb had a second felony charge for assault on a <a href=\"/cwcki/Jerkop\" title=\"Jerkop\">law enforcement official</a>. Mike filed a civil suit against them both.\n</p><p>The plea bargain hearing was held on 10 July 2012. Despite his past history with the Chandlers, Snyder magnanimously pushed for leniency in the court case, as he did not want Chris to get a felony on his record. As part of the plea bargain, however, he apparently insisted on his medical bills being paid in full by the Chandlers. This prompted Chris to openly refer to Snyder as a \"thieving liar\" <b>in court</b> (though Snyder himself was not in attendance), showing a complete lack of gratitude to a man who had showed an amazing level of kindness considering the circumstances.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-20\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">[20]</a></sup>\n</p><p>In September 2013, Chris's felony charge was amended to a misdemeanor, and his sentence was suspended.\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_hatred_continues\">The hatred continues</span></h2>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">I hate Snyder with a passion for destroying my life the way he did.\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:11px; padding:0 0 0 16px; vertical-align:bottom; width:20px\">”\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\" style=\"font-size:smaller; padding:8px 36px; text-align:right;\"><cite>Chris following the plea bargain hearing.</cite>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Sept13_Imgur_30.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"402\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/a/af/Sept13_Imgur_30.jpg/300px-Sept13_Imgur_30.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/a/af/Sept13_Imgur_30.jpg/450px-Sept13_Imgur_30.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/a/af/Sept13_Imgur_30.jpg/600px-Sept13_Imgur_30.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Sept13_Imgur_30.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Chris's <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/LEGO\" title=\"LEGO\">LEGO</a> voodoo doll of Snyder.

As with the previous run-in, Chris related an extremely distorted account of the incident immediately after the fact. \"Mike twice made his own deliberate leg scars, rubbing his legs on our bumper, banged our hood and fell backwards; we had NOT moved our van at either instance of him faking his falls.\" What's more, according to Chris, Mike had set a \"trap\" by posting a sign saying that there was a \"new owner,\" inducing him and his mother to enter the store. Chris has never deviated from this interpretation. The fact that Michael actually won the court case shocked Chris, and he saw this as a theft by Michael. \n</p><p>As Chris continued to dwell on these issues, he came up with a new conspiracy to explain his original ban. In this version, <a href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Schroeder\" title=\"Megan Schroeder\">Megan</a> had recruited Michael into a conspiracy to destroy his life. Just as Chris and his parents had been coming close to discovering this Game PLACe conspiracy in 2008, Michael had banned him. Furthermore, as part of the \"trap\" Michael had laid on 28 October 2011, he had bribed the police to beat him up and falsify their reports. By September 2013, he regarded Michael, Megan and <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Mary Lee Walsh</a> as some sort of axis of evil, \"the Top Three Fiends and Enemies of my lifetime; the ones who actually have Devastated my Heart, my Soul, my Reputation Online AND in Person/Real Life, my Emotions, AND my Life in General all-around.\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-21\"><a href=\"#cite_note-21\">[21]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Chris claimed that he randomly encountered Snyder in public some time in August 2013:\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>WTH...

He also displayed his characteristic ignorance of <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_the_law\" title=\"Chris and the law\">the law</a> - Chris was required to keep away from Snyder, not vice versa. This is Snyder's last known interaction in regards to Chris.\n</p><p>By June 2014, Cville's Hobbies, Games and Toys had been closed for unknown reasons. Chris took some comfort from this, assuming that Michael's \"get-rich-quick scheme\" of filing the civil suit had somehow failed.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-23\"><a href=\"#cite_note-23\">[23]</a></sup> Whether Michael succumbed to Chris's curses, emigrated to Israel, or met some other fate is unclear and due to chris not saying anything recent about him, we may never know.\n</p><p>As of August 2017, Chris not only still believes Mike Snyder set him up, but also blames him for <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_money\" title=\"Chris and money\">blowing all of Bob's pension</a> during the <a href=\"/cwcki/This_is_how_the_Trial_went\" title=\"This is how the Trial went\">2012 plea bargain hearing</a>.

On <a href=\"/cwcki/6_June_2010\" title=\"6 June 2010\">6 June 2010</a>, TheRcholic posted a YouTube comment claiming to have had an encounter with Chris \"right now\", and the comment was apparently followed by a video Chris uploaded giving details on the encounter. However, Chris and TheRcholic give different dates for when the encounter occurred, with Chris saying it took place days beforehand. TheRcholic's comment was also not properly archived, so timestamps cannot be compared. In August 2010, a self-identified Chris troll apparently called The GAMe PLACe to interview Michael, who said that he was working on posting a YouTube comment as TheRcholic.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-25\"><a href=\"#cite_note-25\">[25]</a></sup> Notably, the apparent call occurred at Michael's place of work, and involved Michael using company time to gossip about Chris with one of his trolls.
