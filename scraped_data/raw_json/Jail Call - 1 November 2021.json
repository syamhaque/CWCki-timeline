  "html_content": "<div class=\"mw-body-content mw-content-ltr\" dir=\"ltr\" id=\"mw-content-text\" lang=\"en\"><div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p>On 1 <a href=\"/cwcki/November_2021\" title=\"November 2021\">November 2021</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler\">Chris</a> made a <b>phone call from jail</b> to a fan named <b>Cory Allison</b>, who had previously sent him a letter. Cory uploaded a heavily edited version of the call to <a href=\"/cwcki/YouTube\" title=\"YouTube\">YouTube</a> on 19 November. He uploaded a second version of the call on 26 November which is comparatively less edited, although it still omits most of Cory's side of the conversation.\n</p><p>According to the video description and replies to comments by Cory, this was the second of two calls which he had with Chris in jail. The first call was not recorded and concerned, among other things, Chris's intention to make <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\">Sonichu</a></i> comics about his jail experience when he is released.\n</p><p>Notably, Chris continues to obfuscate about <a href=\"/cwcki/Affair_with_Mother\" title=\"Affair with Mother\">his incest with his mom</a>, talking about a spiritual, healing event rather than the depraved, potentially traumatic act that it was. Also of interest is how Chris compares his family's move from <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ruckersville\" title=\"Ruckersville\">Ruckersville</a> to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Richmond\" title=\"Richmond\">Midlothian</a> to escape the <a href=\"/cwcki/Nathanael_Greene_Elementary_School\" title=\"Nathanael Greene Elementary School\">Greene County school system</a> to the Biblical <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_into_Egypt\" title=\"wikipedia:Flight into Egypt\">Flight into Egypt</a>, when Joseph took Mary and the baby Jesus from Bethlehem to Egypt to escape the persecution of Herod.\n</p><p>Chris mentions that he is keeping an \"address book\" of those who contact him while he's in jail.\n</p><p>Although Chris claims in the call that his phone calls are limited to 10 minutes, <a href=\"/cwcki/Jail_Call_-_10_January_2022\" title=\"Jail Call - 10 January 2022\">a later recorded call</a> would show that the actual limit is 15 minutes. This explains how Chris's side of the conversation can last nearly 10 minutes on its own.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Full_Call\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Full Call</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Transcript\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Transcript</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Original_Upload\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Original Upload</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Transcript_2\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Transcript</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Subtitled_Version\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Subtitled Version</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Background\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Background</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#See_Also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See Also</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Full_Call\">Full Call</span></h2>\n<p>The November 26 upload contains presumably everything Chris said, with Cory's side still removed.\n</p>\n<center>\n<table style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa;

I received a generous donation recently and I've been- I've been enjoying soup, I figured out how to make NOODLE SOUP in a BOTTLE. A 20-ounce bottle.

I mean, the worst time I was abused just essentially if you don't count the theoretical <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Gal_pals\" title=\"Gal pals\">exes</a>, all those <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">fakers and haters</a> online, it would have to be the <a href=\"/cwcki/Nathanael_Greene_Elementary_School\" title=\"Nathanael Greene Elementary School\">pin-me-down event in fourth grade</a>.\n</p><p><b>Chris:</b> Oh, well long story short, the-uh teachers did not- the teachers and staff at Greene- Nathanael Greene Elementary did not know how to treat or tend to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Autistic\" title=\"Autistic\">autistic</a> individuals, so it might have been five against me, four of them, including the principal and the guidance councilor, the teacher, the uh teachers aid, they all- pinned me down on the floor, held me by my, held me- pinned me down on my ribs, and my ankles, and... even my neck and the audio recorded my screams and crying on <i>tape</i>, they's just like, trying to label me as crazy or something, that's stupid.\n</p><p><b>Chris:</b> Yeah I know, they almost had- they almost had me in a <a href=\"/cwcki/Nathanael_Greene_Elementary_School#The_.22institution.22\" title=\"Nathanael Greene Elementary School\">mental institution in Winchester</a>, instead my- instead <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bob\" title=\"Bob\">Bob</a> and Barbara they-uh were like \"nope, we're moving to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Midlothian\" title=\"Midlothian\">Midlothian</a>!\" for their schooling and all that, so that's how... that happened, and eventually moved back here 'cause it was safer in 2000- [unintelligible] if you look- if you read the Bible where, <a href=\"/cwcki/Jesus_Christ\" title=\"Jesus Christ\">in my past life</a>, um, my mom and Mary and Joseph and uh, and I, we w- very swiftly quickly moved from... eh- from Isreal to Egypt because there were like... these guys hunting all over the place from Egypt, years later when the <i>[unintelligble]</i> of the angles told us it was safe to return then we moved back.\n</p><p><b>Chris:</b> Yeah, history repeats, yeah-mean, eh- you take the events of my life and compare 'em with what was recorded and chronicled with the descriptions of the Bible, and yeah, you got a lot of similarities and history repeats like that one I just gave ya.\n</p><p><b>Chris:</b> Um, yeah more th- more than half the time I was like uh- in my room, but yeah close- close enough to my parents growing up.\n</p><p><b>Chris:</b> Uh, okay well essentially uh- [cut off by editing]\n</p><p><b>Chris:</b> Anything they offer is essentially the line paper, and that's the only thing offered in the commissary as well for their letter pads the ones with the lines, \n</p><p><b>Cory:</b> Oh-\n</p><p><b>Chris:</b> I like drawing on ones that are blank without any lines, [unintelligible] like who wants to interfere with any drawing?\n</p><p><b>Cory:</b> Ye- \n</p><p><b>Chris:</b> Okay well, just letting you know you can send up to three sheets of paper. So that's up to, front and back, fit- <i>[unintelligible]</i>- pages, so it'd be like, if you use one sheet of paper, both sides to write a letter, you can have two blank sheets.\n</p><p><b>Chris:</b> I think they allow up to three, for all incoming mail, they do check and they photocopy everything. They destroy the originals, I well- I don't know what they do w- they keep the blank paper, 'cause they have given me the blank paper that was included with some of the letters I've received so far.\n</p><p><b>Chris:</b> Yeah a majority of them have been nice, I've uh- been- I've been keeping count as well, I've also written a little address book, which uh- I've also written your- both your address and your phone number on there as well. So uh, so I kind of like, so, 32, 34 good fans, um, actually, uh a couple of them were like- just- like- 2.. percen-  just like around two of them. But like- rather cruel or just seem <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jerk\" title=\"Jerk\">jerk</a>-ish, because there were three that just did not list their names or anything on the enve- on the envelope and like, uh, just whatever images, and uh, one of w- pretended to be my- pretended to be <a href=\"/cwcki/Robertchu\" title=\"Robertchu\">Robertchu</a> my dad... \n</p><p><b>Cory:</b> Wow...\n</p><p><b>Chris:</b> And, you know, so, [unintelligible] I saw it coming from a mile away, my foresight did, it's just like you know- a lot of it was just like you know just read the part the first sentences- I just shred that letter, and flush it into the toilet.\n</p><p><b>Chris:</b> Well I mean that's not surprising t- that's not surprising to me..

It was a 10 minute phone call which is all thats allowed. also he has to call you you cant call him.  for the people annoyed I dont have my questions in the video its because recording him on speaker made his voice super quiet and mine was extremely loud so I had to enhance his audio making my voice even louder and obnoxious and I wanted the video to be about him and what he had to say. his talking is all there is and I in no way manipulate you to believe anything about chris chan with my video.  Besides that this video is edited because we discussed personal details like my address and things noone would get without reading my letter; small talk. i edited it down to only the interesting parts strangers would get or want to know. thank you\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_Also\">See Also</span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/cwcki/2014_Jail_calls\" title=\"2014 Jail calls\">2014 Jail calls</a></li></ul>\n<p><br/>\n</p>\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"navbox\" style=\";\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"padding:2px;\">\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"nowraplinks collapsible mw-collapsed mw-collapsible\" style=\"width:100%;background:transparent;color:inherit;;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<th class=\"navbox-title\" colspan=\"2\" style=\";background:#BFBFBF;\"><div style=\"float:left; width:6em;text-align:left;\"> <span class=\"noprint plainlinksneverexpand\" style=\"white-space:nowrap; font-weight:normal; font-size:xx-small; ;background:#BFBFBF;;border:none;;\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Template:JailLetter\" title=\"Template:JailLetter\"><span style=\";background:#BFBFBF;;border:none;;\" title=\"View this template\">v</span></a> <span style=\"font-size:80%;\">•</span> <a class=\"new\" href=\"/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:JailLetter&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" title=\"Template talk:JailLetter (page does not exist)\"><span style=\"color:#002bb8;;background:#BFBFBF;;border:none;;\" title=\"Discussion about this template\">d</span></a> <span style=\"font-size:80%;\">•</span> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"//sonichu.com/w/index.php?title=Template:JailLetter&amp;action=edit\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#002bb8;;background:#BFBFBF;;border:none;;\" title=\"You can edit this template.
