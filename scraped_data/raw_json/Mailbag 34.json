He didn't seem to realize that he was using a mediawiki website, and that therefore everything he did would be recorded forever in the page history, where anybody could see it. The two letters he deleted were from <a href=\"/cwcki/Asperchu\" title=\"Asperchu\">Asperchu</a> creator Alec Benson Leary (who was quickly reaching <a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris\" title=\"Liquid Chris\">Liquid Chris</a> levels of awesome), and a letter from a group of concerned mothers who (rightfully) believed that <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\">Sonichu</a> was inappropriate for children.\n</p><p>The remainder of the letters were just Chris being the opinionated hateful moron we all know and love. Perhaps his most outlandish response was to add another qualification for potential sweethearts: she must be willing for the entire internet to watch Chris fucking her. Other highlights included Chris failing at rationalizing his <a href=\"/cwcki/Monthly_tugboat\" title=\"Monthly tugboat\">monthly tugboat</a>, claiming that his \"special abilities\" would take far too long to list, and totally failing to argue that <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a> is not a dictatorship. Apparently, the one thing that makes it not a dictatorship is that the mayoral position is hereditary in nature.
