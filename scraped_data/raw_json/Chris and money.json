title=\"Tugboat\">tugboat</a>\" that he received from the U.S. federal government every month. In 2009, the payout was $809 a month, placing his annual income at $9,708. After Bob's death, Chris was given a survivor's benefit – increasing the amount to $1,300 per month and making his annual income $15,600. Barb's income, from Social Security and a pension, is around $1,200 per month or $14,400 per year.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Chris's parents originally took $450 to pay for room and board;<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-Miyamoto_5-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Miyamoto-5\">[5]</a></sup> this payment was later increased to $565, and then to $580, after Bob paid off Chris's enormous credit card debt.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-7\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">[7]</a></sup> The rest of the tugboat generally went towards <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/List_of_Chris%27s_games\" title=\"List of Chris's games\">video games</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/McDonald%27s\" title=\"McDonald's\">junk food</a>, or <a href=\"/cwcki/Sex_toys\" title=\"Sex toys\">other frivolous purchases</a>. However, $229 per month (about $7.50 per day) was (and is) nowhere near enough to satisfy Chris's need for electronic entertainment, pornography, <a href=\"/cwcki/PlayStation_Network\" title=\"PlayStation Network\">PlayStation Network</a> downloads, a constant supply of <a href=\"/cwcki/McDonald%27s\" title=\"McDonald's\">Chicken McNuggets</a>, gallons of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Coke\" title=\"Coke\">Coke</a>, and, since the summer of <a href=\"/cwcki/2009\" title=\"2009\">2009</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Alcohol\" title=\"Alcohol\">alcohol</a>. As of <a href=\"/cwcki/January_2010\" title=\"January 2010\">January 2010</a>, he owed roughly $3,500 in credit card debt, some on cards of his own and some on cards he stole from his parents. Indeed, according to one of his bank statements,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-8\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">[8]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-9\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">[9]</a></sup> at the end of one month he had fewer than $3 left in his account. Even more, just by straight spending and no other extra income, he put himself $452.57 in the red. How much he got to keep later on isn't known.\n</p>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">My father helped me get my Social Security set up; I get more a month than I could at a job.

And yet, astoundingly, he's still gone out of his way to buy <i>all</i> available downloadable content for <i>every</i> single <a href=\"/cwcki/PlayStation_3\" title=\"PlayStation 3\">PlayStation 3</a> game that he's ever purchased, and even for <i>games he doesn't own</i>, and he also further promoted his <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_brand_loyalty\" title=\"Chris and brand loyalty\">Sony fanboyism</a> by later buying a Sony LCD HDTV for his bedroom which likely cost about $1,000-$1,500. All the while, Chris bought his <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_fashion\" title=\"Chris and fashion\">clothes</a> at second-hand discount thrift stores. Usually, children are taught the value of money at a very young age – not in Chris's case, apparently.\n</p><p>In <a href=\"/cwcki/September_2013\" title=\"September 2013\">September 2013</a>, Chris complained about he and his mom going through \"emotionally depressing, and Financial Downfall to the depths of Greatly Poor and Just Getting By\", making it clear that the family income dipped after Bob's passing. However, these supposedly lean times were apparently not enough to motivate Chris to get a job, or even to stop buying games, as evidenced by him racking up over $1,000 in game purchases on <i>The Simpsons: Tapped Out</i>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-11\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">[11]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Throughout the summer of 2014, Chris continued to spend thousands of dollars on <a href=\"/cwcki/Lego\" title=\"Lego\">Lego</a> and other frivolities, all while whining and complaining on Facebook about the family's poor finances. Chris financed this spending primarily with money from selling custom arts and crafts on his eBay account. Offering free shipping to customers, Chris would receive money from customers, and then pay for shipping out of his own pocket. However, Chris would immediately spend money as soon as it was deposited into his account, often leaving him unable to ship products to customers who had already paid him because of his own financial irresponsibility and negligence. \n</p><p>When several of Chris's eBay customers filed complaints against him because Chris failed to ship a order as promised and obligated, Chris responded by harassing and trolling the customers, posting their personal information in a public post on his Facebook account. In light of this, you would think most prospective future customers probably wouldn't want to risk being harassed or scammed by Chris. Unfortunately, many more still purchase from Chris on a daily basis.\n</p><p>All the while, even as Chris's credit card debt continued to spiral out of control, Chris continued to buy thousands of dollars of video games, Lego, and other frivolities. As if this were not bad enough, just days after putting his and Barb's cars up for sale (at exorbitant prices), Chris went out and bought a 2010 Ford Focus, stating on Facebook that he had been approved for a loan, probably at a high interest rate. He also stated that paying for insurance on his new car was \"killing\" him, implying that either the insurance payment was costly, that he was having trouble paying it, or both.\n</p><p>In January 2015, it was <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCki_Forums\" title=\"CWCki Forums\">leaked</a> that Chris had spent an absurd amount of money on Nintendo consoles and games, racking up <b>585</b> transactions in the last 4.5 years,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-12\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">[12]</a></sup> a list which includes useless shovelware, hoards of 1st-party Nintendo software, Virtual Console games and <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_Boom_Protests\" title=\"Sonic Boom Protests\">both versions of a game he doesn't even like</a>. 276 of these purchases are known to be handheld games, 8 are known to be video game consoles (buying <b>4</b> DSs and DSis), and 75 which are known to be console games. The grand total cost of all Chris's <b>listed</b> purchases is <b>$7460.43</b> or <b>$1657.87/year</b>. Keep in mind 39% of purchases Chris has on his account are not yet specified, meaning that their cost is not included in this already insanely high number. This information comes on the heels of Chris begging people for money to fix his mother's cavities, as well as the financial worries that his trials will undoubtedly cause.\n</p><p>In <a href=\"/cwcki/July_2016\" title=\"July 2016\">July 2016</a>, a field agent provided the following account of Chris, in a painfully awkward situation where he did not have enough cash to pay for his junk food at a gas station:<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-13\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">[13]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>My friend walks into a gas station/convenience store on the northern edge of Charlottesville.\n<p>Chris is trying to buy $7 or so of junk food type stuff, but he only has $5 in cash.\nThe cashier tries to make understand he owes $2 more. Chris seems to understand, but is slow to process what to do about it.\nMy friend who is second in line, picks out two ones, says \"here you go\" and puts them on the counter.\nChris, it seems more out of stupidity and confusion than malice, picks up the $2 and his purchases and makes to leave.\nMy friend and the cashier, both object and yell that he has to leave the $2 with the cashier.\nChris doesn't seem to react.\nA dude who was behind both of them in line is between Chris and the door. As Chris passes him, he taps him to get his attention, and says something like \"Hey buddy ...\"\nChris makes a get-away-from-me hand wavy gesture without looking at any of the three of them, and fairly loudly says \"It's Miss!\" and hurries out the door.\nChris continues to his car in a half run, half walk, as all three of the people in the store watch confused and amused.\nChris pulls out of the parking spot, but for some reason heads towards the back of the lot, where there is no exit.\nAs Chris gets to the back of the lot, he stops, backs up a few feet, tries to turn the car around, doesn't make it, backs up again, and finally gets around. Essentially making a 5 point turn in a fairly large empty parking lot.\nChris drives past the store again not looking inside, and finally drives off.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>One dreads to imagine how his financial incompetence will affect him once Barb is dead - knowing Chris, and while it is quite tragic, he'll probably continue in his destructive spending patterns until he loses everything he has, and even then, he'll <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ego\" title=\"Ego\">learn nothing</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Chris.27s_parental_enabling\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris's_parental_enabling\">Chris's parental enabling</span></h3>\n<p>Bob encouraged his son to remain unemployed, since he believed that Chris would earn more money from his monthly tugboat than he would have from getting a job. However, this assumption was and is inaccurate. Minimum wage in the state of <a href=\"/cwcki/Virginia\" title=\"Virginia\">Virginia</a> is $7.25 an hour. If Chris were to somehow do a complete 180° on his life and begin working a full 40-hour week, his monthly payment before taxes and payment for room and board would be about $1,260: that's $15,100 annually. Subtracting the money he pays his mom every month to live, as well as the 5% tax his income range mandates in the state of Virginia, Chris could very likely be left with a ridiculous $8,000, which knowing Chris, would be spent on yet more frivolities. Contrast this with the $2,748 Chris pulled in annually from the government after paying off his parents, and it becomes clear that Bob's encouragement came from either thinking Chris would lose his social security if employed (which he wouldn't) or the more accurate notion that his son is a useless failure.\n</p><p>A very likely explanation for Chris's reckless spending is that his parents are at fault (to a degree at least).

Chris exhorted his alleged European <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">fanbase</a> to donate €1,000 in order to remove troll ads from the CWCipedia. \n</p><p>In 2014, after his house <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Destruction_Of_Chris%27s_House\" title=\"Destruction Of Chris's House\">caught fire</a>, Chris again resorted to e-begging for money, placing extra emphasis on <i>\"My mother and I really need the money,\"</i> despite dropping more than <b>$5,000</b> on expensive <a href=\"/cwcki/Lego\" title=\"Lego\">Lego</a> sets to feed his worsening addiction. One would think that Chris would have wised up to the fact that his wanton spending and lack of gainful employment are contributing to his woes, but one glance at his <a href=\"/cwcki/May_2014_Facebook_Posts\" title=\"May 2014 Facebook Posts\">May 2014 Facebook Posts</a> could easily tell you that he's seeing his situation as an avenue to get stuff from people, the most ridiculous of which being a \"$300 Sea Cow\" on his wish list, which would not benefit anybody but himself in the slightest.\n</p><p>In 2016, Chris's e-begging drastically increased, as a result of the Chandlers' stubborn refusal to live within their means. That year saw Chris spend over $1,000 on toys, while both Chris and Barb had court cases resolved which penalized them with steep costs. In addition, Barb joined in to the begging, appearing in three videos so far.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-40\"><a href=\"#cite_note-40\">[40]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-41\"><a href=\"#cite_note-41\">[41]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-42\"><a href=\"#cite_note-42\">[42]</a></sup>\n</p><p>He asked for donations, or at least mentioned them, in many of the posts and videos he made in 2015 through 2016. At first, this was supposedly to fund his production of Sonichu merchandise, but he later shifted to saying that he and Barb needed help with paying the bills and buying groceries. While it's entirely possible that Chris was simply lying to get more money for <a href=\"/cwcki/Lego\" title=\"Lego\">useless</a> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Video_games\" title=\"Video games\">crap</a>, this indicates that the financial hardships,  which <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/White_knights\" title=\"White knights\">many</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">people</a> have warned him about, have finally arrived.

As far back as 2009, if not before, Chris would steal increasingly larger sums of money from his mother's purse for personal use, and use both of his parents' credit cards to finance his gaming addiction as revealed by the <a href=\"/cwcki/Ivy_Q%26A\" title=\"Ivy Q&amp;A\">Ivy Q&amp;A</a>. Despite Chris insisting that this behaviour was 'in the past', he would engage in it with apparent reckless abandon regardless, stopping only when forced to after Barb discovered just how much he had purloined. Years later, Chris would rob his mother again - <a href=\"/cwcki/Affair_with_Mother\" title=\"Affair with Mother\">in much darker and far more damning circumstances</a>.\n</p><p>On 30 <a href=\"/cwcki/July_2021\" title=\"July 2021\">July 2021</a>, after Chris was served an <a href=\"/cwcki/Emergency_Protective_Order\" title=\"Emergency Protective Order\">Emergency Protective Order</a> temporarily forbidding him from his home, he stole $750 from Barb's bank account. Some of this money was spent immediately - Chris' bank account was 200 dollars in debt. Much of what remained was spent on lodging in <a href=\"/cwcki/Regency_Inn_Richmond\" title=\"Regency Inn Richmond\">Regency Inn Richmond</a>, and the leftover money was swiftly spent on what can be assumed to be assorted frivolities and food. <i>Two days</i> after this money was withdrawn, <a href=\"/cwcki/Null\" title=\"Null\">Null</a> - who at that point could still view the emails from Chris's bank - posted an image of a low balance notice from Chris's Bank of America account on the <a href=\"/cwcki/Kiwi_Farms\" title=\"Kiwi Farms\">Kiwi Farms</a>, confirming that Chris had $1.03 remaining in his account.\n</p><p>In a letter he relayed to Null a couple of months later, he claims to have sent his $150 Patreon payout back to Barb, as compensation for stealing the money.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-43\"><a href=\"#cite_note-43\">[43]</a></sup>\n</p><p>This is predictably a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Lie\" title=\"Lie\">lie</a> since not only did Chris's Patreon get shut down very quickly after the leaks were made, but even if it wasn't, Chris would be forced to wait until the next Monday due to their pay-out waiting period of 1-3 business days (something that Chris himself acknowledges in the same letter).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"In_the_comic\">In the comic</span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:252px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Cwccash.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"84\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/9/95/Cwccash.jpg/250px-Cwccash.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/9/95/Cwccash.jpg 1.5x\" width=\"250\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Cwccash.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div><a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a> currency.</div></div></div>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">What the?

This means that, in <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a>, there are around 1,500 homeless people left outside.

One of his demands was the show should not have any commercial breaks, either showing a distinct lack of understanding as to how a TV station makes money, or perhaps he plans to sell the advertising fees to a single company so that they can play a long ad in the beginning of the air time and leave the rest of the show uninterrupted, <i>à-la</i> the season premieres of <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_Series)\" title=\"wikipedia:24 (TV Series)\"><i>24</i></a>.

To show his further ignorance of simple economics, Chris proposed a chain of state-run brothels where this shockingly inexpensive fee would not only pay women for sex, pay the salary of a pimp, pay for STD testing for the prostitutes, but would also pay for free <a href=\"/cwcki/Dating_education\" title=\"Dating education\">Sex Ed classes</a> for <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Virgin\" title=\"Virgin\">virgins</a>. \n</p><p>In real life, according to Chris, he tried to scam his way out of paying for sex with a Craigslist <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_sex#Prostitution\" title=\"Chris and sex\">prostitute</a> who was charging $100 per hour by telling her about the trolls, his life story, and his many personal problems. He said the prostitute then hung up on him.\n</p><p>Chris also proves us that, in the possibility of being part of a family, he wouldn't be the main purveyor.

Even then, he portrays himself doing \"hard work\" like <a href=\"/cwcki/DIRTY,_CRAPPED_BRIEFS\" title=\"DIRTY, CRAPPED BRIEFS\">changing diapers</a> and watching over the kids. In this last role, he's so incompetent that he needs to recruit his <a href=\"/cwcki/Crystal\" title=\"Crystal\">preschool daughter</a> to watch over <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Reginald_Chandler\" title=\"Reginald Chandler\">his son</a> while he's shopping. This is paralleled by his real life situation - with <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bob\" title=\"Bob\">Bob</a> gone, one would assume that he'd be the \"man of the house\" and assume some responsibility for once. Unfortunately, as evidenced by his <a href=\"/cwcki/This_is_how_the_Trial_went\" title=\"This is how the Trial went\">admission in court,</a> Barb is still pulling his ass out of any such concept by paying his court fees.
