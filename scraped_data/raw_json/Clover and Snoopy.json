This has been documented to be traumatizing for animals, causing social and behavioral issues down the line.\n</p><p>On 6 <a href=\"/cwcki/August_2013\" title=\"August 2013\">August 2013</a>, Chris posted on Facebook a picture of dog urine on a newspaper.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-10\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">[10]</a></sup> In <a href=\"/cwcki/December_2014\" title=\"December 2014\">December 2014</a>, a statement released by <a href=\"/cwcki/Catherine\" title=\"Catherine\">Catherine</a> (who manipulated Chris into inviting her to the Chandler's <a href=\"/cwcki/Rental_House\" title=\"Rental House\">Rental House</a>) confirmed that the dogs are not house-trained, are aggressive towards strangers, and are severely <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Obese\" title=\"Obese\">obese</a>. This was especially apparent in a series of photos released in <a href=\"/cwcki/November_2015\" title=\"November 2015\">November 2015</a>. The dogs were still relieving themselves on newspaper in April 2018, evidenced when Chris filmed a paid request video which showed a newspaper with dog shit on it in the background.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-11\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">[11]</a></sup>\n</p><p>In the <a href=\"/cwcki/Rental_House_Tour\" title=\"Rental House Tour\">Rental House Tour</a>, Barbara can be heard attempting to justify her gross neglect of the dogs by complaining about how she's too old to take them out to relieve themselves (despite having only gotten the dogs two years prior). A hole in the fence in the backyard, which the Chandlers never bothered to fix, also may have contributed to Barbara's decision to let their dogs piss and shit on the newspapers within the home. Barbara was very likely only being defensive about her neglect, as alternative methods of potty-training dogs whose owners genuinely cannot take them outside could easily have been used such as litter boxes.\n</p><p>When Chris reflected on Snoopy's life, he noted that he'd regularly sleep on the couch with the puppies until January 2014. They also would regularly play in a \"mountain of clothes\" from Barbara's hoard from which Snoopy fell and injured his left back leg, an injury which he would never fully recover from, making it difficult to traverse stairs. Chris also admitted that he and Barbara could have walked the dogs more often, using Snoopy's leg condition as an excuse for why they had not.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-eulogy_4-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-eulogy-4\">[4]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:202px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Snoopy,_7_December_2018.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"267\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/8/89/Snoopy%2C_7_December_2018.jpg/200px-Snoopy%2C_7_December_2018.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/8/89/Snoopy%2C_7_December_2018.jpg/300px-Snoopy%2C_7_December_2018.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/8/89/Snoopy%2C_7_December_2018.jpg/400px-Snoopy%2C_7_December_2018.jpg 2x\" width=\"200\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Snoopy,_7_December_2018.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>An overweight Snoopy, pictured in December 2018.
