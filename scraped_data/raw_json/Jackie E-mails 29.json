We'll be staying the whole weekend in a hotel there, touring around the capitol's landmarks, and then seeing the huge parade they do on the 4th. You can come meet us for that!! I wanted to let you know right away as soon as I found out because it's still about three weeks away, so that should give you plenty of time to make sure you can go.

D.C. That is a stretch for me, but I think after discussion of details between us, it may be doable for me to make the trip.\n</p><p>Firstly, I'll need more details, like which hotel y'all be staying in; if I may bunk with y'all, and I really would appreciate one day of in-person face time in C-Ville, maybe one day next week or weekend.\n</p><p>I want to feel comfirmed of me having a place to stay at on the weekend, which was an issue recectly a few months ago with <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAGFest\" title=\"wikipedia:MAGFest\">MagFest</a>.  \nI'd really like to feel I can go without <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Barb\" title=\"Barb\">my mom</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bob\" title=\"Bob\">dad</a> going crazy.  \nI'll tell you more in another e-mail later today; I have a father-son outting in a few minutes.\n</p><p>TTYL.\n&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3\nChristian.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>June 17, 2011 8:06pm\n<p>First, let me point out that during this time, you have gone back to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Lars\" title=\"Lars\">Lars</a>.\n</p><p>So, this was about <a href=\"/cwcki/November_2010\" title=\"November 2010\">last November</a> (or was it <a href=\"/cwcki/October_2010\" title=\"October 2010\">October</a>). I had pre-registered myself for MagFest a month beforehand. Dana gave me an extra incentive for going, her female cousin was visiting; some <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Hanky-panky\" title=\"Hanky-panky\">hey-hey fun</a> was a possibility. But, I was unable to afford a hotel or motel room, even with the M.F. discount. I was pretty much going for broke there.\n</p><p>I inform my mom and dad of the trip to MagFest only, and I told them I'd be either sleeping in the lobby or in <a href=\"/cwcki/Son-Chu\" title=\"Son-Chu\">my car</a>. I felt totally at unease to tell them of the \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_sex\" title=\"Chris and sex\">bonus round</a>\" (to put it in a p.c. phrase).  \nMy mother insisted I Not go, because of the crime risk and chilly temperatures. And to nail a deep nail into the coffin, she threatened that if I went, I would not be allowed entry back into the house; Lock Change included. Come push to shove; I stay home that weekend; <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_money\" title=\"Chris and money\">$40 down the drain</a>, and a missed opportunity. I needed to be sure I had a Point A to return to, and that there was actually a solid Point B for me to arrive at.\n</p><p>Factor in what happened years ago in <a href=\"/cwcki/Ohio_trip\" title=\"Ohio trip\">my road trip to Ohio</a> on how Both my parents reacted; putting a police bounty on my head among all of the emotinal trauma-dramas. I did not feel at ease to put them and myself through that again.\n</p><p>So, that is Why I need all of the details here; If I make this trip on the whim, I risk not having my Home to return to, and I need \nconfirmation on the Solid destination(s). And I Can Not afford at all costs to put my mom and dad at their ages through soo much <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress\" title=\"Stress\">stress</a> and trauma... it could spell DEATH for one or Both of them. And I would be homeless, out on the streets, within a few months. This Cinderella situation saddens me greatly. Do you understand what I am telling you here? As much as I need you in my life, in person, I can not be so reckless. [:_(\n</p><p>*sigh*\n</p><p>I await the details in your reply.

You've always been good at doing things for our relationship, like coming to visit me when I asked you to, or cleaning your bathroom when I asked you to, or making a comic when I asked you to, or remembering my name when I asked you to. Oh wait, you never did any of those things like I asked, and you lied to me about at the bulk of them. Seriously, what do you ever offer? When did you ever care all the times I told you about how your lies and apathy were making ME feel neglected?\n</p><p>What has ME so preoccupied that I can't check in? Why can't YOU get off your ass and write an email? Oh, you must be too busy playing games again. Well anyway, I have the hotel information ready and for two nights it would cost $180 a piece for each person, including you. Don't worry about getting the money to me right away, just bring a check with you when we meet up. The hotel is in <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington,_Virginia\" title=\"wikipedia:Arlington, Virginia\">Arlington</a>, the plan is to meet there Sunday afternoon, then check in and stay the night of the 3rd and the 4th, then head out Tuesday morning.\n</p><p>By the way, one of my cousins drank herself stupid a few days ago and decided to go for a joyride in her car. She got clipped by a garbage truck and was in a coma for three days. She's woken up again - off and on - but thanks to the tubes sticking in her chest she can't really talk all that much. So yes, actually, there was something preoccupying me over the past few days. I was thinking it would be nice to see you over the 4th to take my mind off things, but you better leave that 'tude at home. I mean, it would have been nice to have you checking in with me, talking to me. But just because I was too busy to write back, you just shut down and waited for me, and then assumed the worst and attacked me like I bear all the responsibility for keeping this relationship going. Last I checked, showing effort was YOUR weak point, not mine.\n</p><p>Well I'm sorry if I sound in a bad mood but I don't really feel like talking about that anymore.

I do not like to\nthink of how sickly and whatnot my mom and dad are, yet I am constantly\nreminded of it, along with my rut. I pray for your cousin's full\nrecovery.\n</p><p>For your information, yes, I was waiting and waiting for your message\nthe past week. If I had known of your recent trauma, I would not have\nreacted so coldly. But I had no idea, and I have been checking my\ne-mail daily the past week for one from you; not finding one made me\nfeel crestfallen and questioning. But now I do know, so it is cool,\nand I apologize for the attitude in my last message.\n</p><p>Let's talk about the date. $180 for both nights is too much for me at\nthis time with my limited finances. But I think I have a solution, I\ncan leave the early morning of the 4th, meet up with y'all at your\nhotel before leaving for the fireworks, we spend the day together and\nsee if we end up spending the 4th night together, and I will pay my 90\nfor the night then. After that, we can evaluate how we feel about each\nother and estimate better where this relationship is going. :)\n</p><p>But I still need the address and name of the hotel in Arlington, so I can get directions on MapQuest and better estimate my departure and arrival times, I'm thinking of getting there at 8 or 9 am.\n</p><p>Please reply swiftly.\n</p><p>Stay Safe, Sweetie.\n&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3\nChristian\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #B48246; padding:5px; background-color:#FCC\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>June 28, 2011 10:07pm\n<p>Hey Chris,\n</p><p>Thanks for writing back.

My mom is being all fussy about calling you, she says she doesn't want to do it, and my dad is kind of in agreement with her. I spent over an hour talking to them about why they wouldn't, but I couldn't get much out of either one of them. My mom basically just kept saying that she had mixed feelings about you, because you don't have a job or a place of your own and stuff like that. She kept trying to talk me into going back with Lars because of his fancy new job (he got a job as a speedboat mechanic, did I ever mention that? He sent me a postcard from <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabo_San_Lucas\" title=\"wikipedia:Cabo San Lucas\">Cabo San Lucas</a> where he's living now); I kept trying to tell her to drop Lars and just call you but she kept getting more and more emotional and flabbergasted, I finally just gave up.\n</p><p>Anyway, we are staying at the Embassy Suites in D.C.

It's not even a 2-hour trip, that'd be dirt-cheap. But no, mommy says no, and that's all there is to it.\n</p><p>No Chris, I am serious about the relationship. I'm not the one who has anything to prove. You're the one who's on thin ice. You need to prove this to me. Just upload the video to mediafire. It will be between you and me. You can't worry about incriminating yourself because it's just between you and me. Refusing to do this tells me you don't trust me. I'm not the one whose trust is under question.\n</p><p>I really want this to work out. You need to do your part. You won't come to DC. And you asked me to come to Charlottesville on a whim, I can't just change my plans, they're my friend's plans too. You say why can't we come \"closer\" to Staunton, completely ignoring the concept that maybe Staunton isn't convenient for me or my friends right now. It's always all about what's most convenient for you and you alone. After the fourth I might come down, but you really need to prove it to me that it'll be worth my while.\n</p><p>If you won't come to DC, you need to do the video. One or the other. This is on you.\n</p><p>Jackie\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>July 4, 2011 3:10pm\n<p>Firstly, I got those two pieces of software for 10 apiece; one from a\nYard Sale and the other was on big sale at <a href=\"/cwcki/Best_Buy\" title=\"Best Buy\">Best Buy</a>.\n</p><p>I trust you, Jacklyn; it is the security of the internet all-around And\nthe other people who hack and abuse it I do not trust.

You just say \"have a good time\" and that's it.

Washington DC is our nation's capitol, do you have any idea how amazing the celebration and show here is going to be? Way better than Staunton. And it's less than two hours away from you. And yet you can't be bothered to try.\n</p><p>Lars is the one who caused problems before. He's out of the picture. He's in fucking Mexico. None of your trolls would have any idea where to look for a video if you secretly sent it to me, nor would they have any reason to go looking for it because they wouldn't even know it exists.\n</p><p>It's too late for you to come to DC now I guess, unless you left immediately. So do the video. Do the video. Do the video.
