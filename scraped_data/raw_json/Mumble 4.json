Why... why do you drop women on the...just you know, on the tip of the hat? I mean, you and whatshername, <a href=\"/cwcki/PandaHalo\" title=\"PandaHalo\">Sarah... Cassandra Mackenzie</a>. I-I mean God, You said yourself you were like, really close for months and months.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> And you drop her on the, just drop it right there and you didn't go to <a href=\"/cwcki/Nintendo\" title=\"Nintendo\">Nintendo</a>. You didn't do anything. Why didn't you do a thing?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hmmm...Uh... hmm...Well, because I felt uncertain of a lot of details. Like I wasn't totally sure I was talking to the real Mr. MAIyamoto. And plus I didn't have my family's support. And uh I really did not have the money to make the trip.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> You just blew your chance, Chris. You know- you know that whatever you say will be taken as crazy talk but you know I'm already working with uh, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Reggie\" title=\"Reggie\">Reggie</a> right? It's not going to happen for quite a few months in fact. But be prepared, be prepared.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> For what?\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> You know, Rabbichoso. Come on.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I bet it'll go straight to $9.99 bin.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> [laughs] Of course, because it's being priced at $9.99. It's not a full-priced game. You know that. You know, it's going to be on like PlayStation Network. Well it's probably not. It's probably just gonna be on Wii Ware. Still good, it'll be just like <i><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_Story\" title=\"wikipedia:Cave Story\">Cave Story</a></i>. You ever play <i>Cave Story</i>?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> No.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> Do you play any good games? I mean, Christ. You spent over $1,000 on the PlayStation Network...why would you spend so much <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Money\" title=\"Money\">money</a>?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I play a lot of good <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Games\" title=\"Games\">games</a>.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> N-never mind about the good games part, that's irrelevant bullshit. Why would you spend over $1,000 on the PlayStation network?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> How do you know I spent over $1,000 on the PlayStation Network? Because that could be an obvious exaggeration right there.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> It's not an obvious exaggeration.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Okay.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> I have your records detailing your intimate history from March <a href=\"/cwcki/2007\" title=\"2007\">'07</a> to <a href=\"/cwcki/January_2009\" title=\"January 2009\">January '09</a> of every single purchase you ever made. I calculated it. It's over $1,000.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> You don't have-You don't even have to track the history you could just go to my download list and then figure out which ones are demos-\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> Exactly, it's been over $1,000 Chris.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Alright fine, woopty freakin' doo, $1,000. But it's only a little bit at a time over a long period of time.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> Chris, you don't know anything about saving money. How much have you spent on games?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hmm... well I spend a lot.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> How much do you think you spent over the last nine years?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Nine... well, yup. Mmmm...I'd say estimate, uh, taking a rough guess here. Fine, $10,000. I'm just taking a guess.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> Ugh, Christ, man. If you can't afford the money then you can't afford to save anything for your future; for <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Daughter\" title=\"Daughter\">your future children</a>; for <a href=\"/cwcki/Lovely_Weather\" title=\"Lovely Weather\">your future wife</a>. You don't think about the future do you? You just think about now; you just think about what you want now; what you want- \n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Fine well I'm not- well, I'll admit I'm not- I wasn't very good at money, I was compulsive on spending.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> You still are.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I'm recovering. Hey at least I'm not that far gone to admit it that I have a problem with spending and I admit the problem, that's the first step to recovery.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> That's far from the first step, you have to do something.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I am, I'm taking initiative to save.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> And how much have you saved?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Ugh, well I have bills to- I have credit card bills to pay!\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> For the past five years, I've been working on a little egg to save money. I spent- I've dipped into it a bit. This is- ain't, from my parents inheritance, this is all of on my own. I got 15,000 saved Chris, for the past five years Chris.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Well good for you, I praise you for that.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> I'm saying you can't even save $100. What makes you think you can support a family?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>sigh</i>]\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Julie\" title=\"Julie\">Julie</a>, why would you want to be with this man? He can't support a family, he can't support you!\n<br/><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Because I love him.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Not right away- but, but give me time.\n<br/><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Because I truly love him.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. The power of love and God- and God- and power of prayer and God's help and enough time, it can work.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> And what will you do if you're homeless? What will you do?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hmm, homeless. That diff- that's a tough one. Well, there's a thing called family. I have good people in my family.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> Julie, are you going to take this? You're going to accept living without a home? Really?\n<br/><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> If it's with Chris, yes.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> Oh my god, you two are going to die faster than I can say autistic. Christ! You- I can't believe it. You would accept being homeless.\n<br/><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Yes, I would.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> Enjoy your death, enjoy your death.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hey, you don't know what-\n<br/><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Chris will never be homeless.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah and besides- besides Clyde, you don't know- you don't know what kind of lifestyle Julie had to gre-grew up with. I mean she came from a poor country.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> [<i>interrupts</i>] And this is what you're going to treat her to, is the same-the same old life she had before. That's very gentlemen-like Chris.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Now I'm gonna tr- I'm gonna do my best to try to give her a mor- a much more comfortable life, I'll do my best.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> Chris, when your parents die, what's gonna happen to your house, what's going to happen?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> You're asking me when my parents die, what's going to happen to my house?\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> Yes.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Slow_in_the_mind\" title=\"Slow in the mind\">Well, I assume the house is still gonna be on the land it was built upon.</a>\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> Oh, so it's not yours anymore, interesting. Interesting.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Well actually they're leaving it to me. So there.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> So you've got a house, that's decent. Tell me, name five bills associated with, you know, maintaining the house. Can you even name five?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Five bills associated with maintaining the house. Alright, there's the electricity, the water...abuhbuhbuhbuhbuh [<i>muttering</i>]... food, clothing-\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> Food and clothing are not part of the house. That's part of the, you know, daily life. I'm talking about the actual house.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>sigh</i>] Okay, there's, uh, hardware like-\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> What hardware? For what?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Like for roofing. For one thing.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> Do your parents even own the house?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yes, they own the house.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> Do they have a mortgage on it? What, anything?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> They do not have a mortgage on it.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> Oh, so-so they own the house. Legally. Interesting. Well, you got one thing going for you, you at least have a house. But I don't know, man if you can actually survive in it.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Tsk-tsk. You are so quick to under- to undermine a person. And underestimate them.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> I'm not being quick to undermine a person. I'm thinking of what a family man should do, okay? \n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>Sudden awful </i><a href=\"/cwcki/Family_Guy\" title=\"Family Guy\">Family Guy</a><i> impersonation</i>] Hey listen, Peter Griffin, he's a family guy and he's retarded and yet look at his life!

And every time I say I love you I have my heart behind me.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> [<i>laughs</i>] Every time you say “I love you”!

That's a little- ehh, you know, you're treading some dangerous ground there.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hey, I can't help it if they all moved on with their lives. They didn't- couldn't stick around. That doesn't mean I'm not- I'm gonna hold it against them. I still care about them individually. I mean that, from my heart.

Very much.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> You don't know what love is, do you Chris?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I know that love takes a lot of hard work and deep emotions.

She did shit that most women never do. She was a wild one. Did sports, dropped out of school, did drugs. She killed herself.

You still don't know what love is. You move on from woman to woman. If one is out of your reach, you just move on to the next one. You ditched the prospect of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sarah_Hammer\" title=\"Sarah Hammer\">Sarah Hammer</a> just for Megan and [<i>microphone cuts out</i>].\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I- did not ditch her. I mean I tell ya. I was so hurting in my heart and my soul that I had to lose her to you. Really hurt me. It wasn't an immediate decision for me to move on. I had to make myself emotionally stable. [<i>starts stammering</i>] And build up the- and build up so much in my head sorting all the details out at my own pace. It was hard. Very hard. [<i>sigh</i>] But then I have- but then I have to realize I have like- I mean besides I haven't heard from Sarah in a long time. I could- I didn't even know what- I couldn't- I guess I just never really knew from her point of view. I mean I had to hear it from- I have to hear it from her own mouth that she is going to be with you. But I never heard so [<i>voice cracks</i>] heartbreak.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> Alright I'll tell you the truth. Ever since the move, I haven't heard from her either. I fear she might be dead.\n<br/>[<i>Long pause</i>]\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I see.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> I don't know where she is or what she's doing. She hasn't responded to me either. I had some nice pictures, I announced the wedding, but, ahh it's... I dunno. It's all gone. At least for now. She's supposedly in America right now, you know that, right? Could she be searching for you? [<i>laughs</i>] I doubt it.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Well I don't know. Can't say for sure, because yes, I have not heard from her.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> Looks like she's probably moved on from both of us. I don't know what's going to happen to my child. [<i>sighs; mutters something inaudible under his breath</i>] Now, I just want to ask you a few questions about- about your past life. You know there's this, You know there's this person called <a href=\"/cwcki/Wes_Iseli\" title=\"Wes Iseli\">Wes Iseli</a>? [<i>pronounces it \"ih-sell-ee\"</i>] You seen- you know he's on YouTube? He's married now, you know that?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uh, I'm sorry. Could you repeat his name please?\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> Wes Iseli, [<i>pronounces it \"eye-sell-ee\"</i>] you know, the magician?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Oh. Wes EYES-LEE.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> I don't know how to pronounce it.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah well, okay- yeah, okay, so he's married. Is that what you just said?\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> Yeah, he's married now. Not to whatever-her-face was but, he's married, he's still successful and he's doing charity work. He's a very impressive man.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Well, good for him.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> How could you hate a man like that?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>sigh</i>] I was jealous. Jealousy got the best of me then.  \n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> But what made you think that Sarah wanted you in any way?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> She and I were childhood friends.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> Is that it?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> We were very close. She was my- we were literally next door neighbors.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> Then welcome to the <a href=\"/cwcki/Friend_zone\" title=\"Friend zone\">friend zone</a>! Where you'll be friends forever and never be anything beyond that.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hey, I saw the movie <i><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_Friends\" title=\"wikipedia:Just Friends\">Just Friends</a></i>.  \n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> You know romantic comedies are just... bullshit.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Romantic comedies build hope for true romances. And they build up for stronger romances. Though, I think I have a good general understanding of how to keep a romance true and strong.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> No you don't. All you know is what's on TV and what's on movies and whatever. And they're lies, Chris, those are lies. And they've influenced you to a point where you just believe romance is saying \"I love you\" over and over and over. Like you're fated to be with a lover or something.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I- it- it- it's a lot more than just saying I love you over and over again. It's a lot more than that. It's about building so many memories with the woma- with the person the- uh- person of the opposite gender that you truly love and care about. Growing fond memories, being close together. So many priceless- priceless. So close.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> Memories. That- that's not what love is about.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> And those- Those memories build towards the true love. And honest- in the honest emotions that have to occur during that relationship. Because without the emo- because without the true love and honest emotions, it's just about as meaningless... as... sex with a prostitute.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> Why don't you <a href=\"/cwcki/Mia_Hamm\" title=\"Mia Hamm\">do that</a>? I mean, come on man.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Because I desire meaning. I take it to heart.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> Look, I mean, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Fuck_Quest\" title=\"Fuck Quest\">all you want is sex</a>. It's pointless to argue.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> You're wrong! You are absolutely wrong! I don't just want sex! I want the true honest relationship that goes along with that. If I just wanted sex I would have <a href=\"/cwcki/Mia_Hamm\" title=\"Mia Hamm\">hired a prostitute</a> and gotten an STD years ago.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> So you have an STD. Interesting.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> No. I said I would have hired a prostitute and got an STD. I do not have an STD.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> And it looks like you'll never get one for your entire life. I mean, what do you look for in a woman.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I look for ten- I look for caring personality, and strong emotions, strong willed. All around personality. Woman who will be good to me. And is not afraid to uh- to uh things to uh, to keep the relationship strong and alive, But also- Hmmm. Somebody also this woman who will just love me for me. And I will love her mutually. Her for her. And for who she is, and she love me for who I am.  \n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> Oh come on! I saw that, whatever you, that one myspace thing, you say you're looking for, blonde woman, not black, not a policewoman, not autistic, you know, under some weight. Come on man!\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> So I was a bit more picky back then! And plus I wasn't, plus I wasn't sure if all the total details. I mean- I mean I've learned! That it gets more beyond the physical attributes. But still, call me <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_race\" title=\"Chris and race\">old-fashioned</a> but, I'd rather be- I would not- I'd uh- I'd definitely wouldn't uh... <a href=\"/cwcki/Niggos\" title=\"Niggos\"><b>NOT BLACK.</b> Not black</a>.

Come on! You blatantly said \"not black!\" Not black, come on.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I mean, I am willing to have- I mean I would care- I would care about a black woman as a friend. Honestly. But you know, not b- I would not want beyond just friendship.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> You still have a lot to learn. That's about looks. Not about personality. You're still being racist.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>Sudden <b>amazingly racist</b> imitation of a Jamaican person</i>] Hey don't you play for me no fool man.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> What...

Britney Spears- No, no, I'm sorry. Pamela Anderson's <i>Star</i>. That's five. I'd include that. [<i>Names another book, sounds like \"Bobbitt's Town\", I don't know</i>] And um, I know I got another one on the tip of my tongue... Give me a moment...

I'll let that go, because I've read that book too, and I think it's a fantastic piece of literature.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> The majority of-\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> Alright, here's the deal. Because you have so much stuff, I hope to see tons of that in garbage bags, for sale, at a garage sale. I want to see you at least make a thousand dollars, with all that stuff you can sell. Or, destroy all the stuff, either you destroy it, or make a thousand dollars, that's what I want to see.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Gonna take a lot of time...\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> I'm giving you three days.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hm.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> You can either destroy all your stuff to prove yourself to Julie, or you can make money.

I'm asking you... to give up material possessions. Okay, let's see what I have... I got a computer, I got a TV, what else do I got... I've got a printer. Uh, I've got speakers... Man, I've got... a drawing. What else... I really don't got much, to be honest- I got clothes, but everyone needs clothes. You own TOO MUCH shit, Chris. WAY too much. You need to give up some of that, MOST of it, in fact... Give up everything that ISN'T necessary for your survival. And prove to Julie that you are a man... You are a real man, because men don't play with fucking action figures, and... God, I don't know what else you do. Play... card games... It's a children's card game. For children. It's not for 26 year-olds. It's not for 21 year-olds. It's not even for 18 year-olds. I mean, wouldn't you like a nice, empty room, where you and Julie can spend a lot of time together, just thinking? Thinking about the future, thinking about life... I would love a girl who would, you know, just to chat about... whatever goes in the world, and... ride a motorcycle with me. Travel... I would love that.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Alright, well listen... I'll go through everything I have and I'll think- I will give it great consideration... Hmmm... Just, please, leave Jul- I prom- Look, I promise. I'll go through everything and I'll deci- and I'll decide for myself... And it's gonna take me quite a bit... definitely quite a bit of time... I'll make out a list... I'll do- I'll list a bunch of it on eBay or... some- yeah, yeah I'll list some of it on eBay. Just, uh, please. Promise me you'll leave Julie alone.\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> Alright, I just hope to see a video of you just... tossing most of that stuff away, into a dumpster or something. Because most of that stuff isn't sellable. You don't need it. It's worthless, it's nothing. Mere trinkets, in a land that has so much more to offer.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. Alright...\n<br/><font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde:</b></font> I give you three days.
