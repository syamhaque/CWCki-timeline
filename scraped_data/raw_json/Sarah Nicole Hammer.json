In <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_%2B_Sarah%27s_Life-Shares\" title=\"Chris + Sarah's Life-Shares\">Chris + Sarah's Life-Shares</a>, Chris recounts a story in which Sarah told Chris that Casper the friendly ghost was hiding under the house. Chris, being as <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">childish</a> as he's always known to be, fell for it and went to search for him. When Chris entered the crawlspace, Sarah locked him in and left. Eventually, Sarah's father had to come and get him out.\n</p><p>Sarah also tried to convince Chris to put a honeysuckle in his mouth. Specifically the tip, which is sometimes alleged to be poisonous. Chris almost fell for this one, but his parents caught him and warned him of its \"dangers\". And you know what they say: a girl that tries to kill you isn't really your friend.\n</p><p>Sarah and Chris were the same age and attended the same elementary school, but Chris moved to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Richmond\" title=\"Richmond\">Richmond</a> to attend middle school<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup> and would not see Sarah again until after he returned to Ruckersville on June <a href=\"/cwcki/2000\" title=\"2000\">2000</a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-LifeShares10_4-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-LifeShares10-4\">[4]</a></sup> In <a href=\"/cwcki/Mario_Kart_64_Lego_Raceway\" title=\"Mario Kart 64 Lego Raceway\">Mario Kart 64 Lego Raceway</a>, made on 4 June 1998, Chris named one of the characters after Sarah, suggesting that he was still thinking about her at the time.\n</p><p>Chris has suggested that he did not originally view Sarah as a potential <a href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart\" title=\"Sweetheart\">sweetheart</a>; this decision apparently came later, most likely due to autism and a sheltered upbringing.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Adulthood\">Adulthood</span></h3>\n<p>Chris returned to Ruckersville on 20 June 2000.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup> Between that year and <a href=\"/cwcki/2003\" title=\"2003\">2003</a> Sarah grew up and shed her old image, and became so attractive to Chris that he later called her \"a spittin' image of <a href=\"/cwcki/Britney_Spears\" title=\"Britney Spears\">Britney Spears</a>.\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]</a></sup> How much they two had kept in touch as adults is not fully clear. In <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_%2B_Sarah%27s_Life-Shares\" title=\"Chris + Sarah's Life-Shares\">Chris + Sarah's Life-Shares</a>, which was completed on on 21 July 2003,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-7\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">[7]</a></sup> Chris notes that since moving to Ruckersville he \"was not able to interact with Sarah as much as he used to\".<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-LifeShares10_4-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-LifeShares10-4\">[4]</a></sup> With that being said, some contact was apparently kept between Sarah and Chris, as she did visit the Chandlers on Christmas 2003. The following Christmas Chris had hoped that Sarah will come again and had even made a present for her,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-8\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">[8]</a></sup> but to his disappointment Sarah spent Christmas elsewhere on that year.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-9\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">[9]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"With_Wes_Iseli\">With Wes Iseli</span></h4>\n<p>By Chris's admission, he hadn't had much contact with Sarah after he moved to Richmond, although at some point he apparently concluded that they were destined to be lovers. Unfortunately for him, at a certain point Sarah started dating local magician/heart-throb <a href=\"/cwcki/Wes_Iseli\" title=\"Wes Iseli\">Wes Iseli</a>, eventually moving in with him at some point prior to July <a href=\"/cwcki/2000\" title=\"2000\">2000</a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-10\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">[10]</a></sup> Learning about this development was clearly traumatic for Chris. On one occasion Chris saw Sarah sitting in Wes's lap, which made Chris visibly jealous; this incident was important enough (to Chris, anyway) to document in his <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\">comics</a>. A similar freak out occurred when Chris saw Megan sitting on the lap of one of her male friends around the time he was discovered by <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/4chan\" title=\"4chan\">/v/</a>, and he still gets insanely jealous whenever he sees a girl sitting on the lap of any other man, likely because it reminds him of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Infinitely-High_Boyfriend-Factor\" title=\"Infinitely-High Boyfriend-Factor\">Infinitely-High Boyfriend-Factor</a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-11\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">[11]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Chris regards losing Sarah to Wes as one of the two reasons he launched his <a href=\"/cwcki/Love_Quest\" title=\"Love Quest\">Love Quest</a>. Although this event technically changed nothing—Chris had never had a girlfriend and still did not—it spurred him to action, giving him a reason to actively seek out and obtain a <a href=\"/cwcki/Boyfriend-free_girl\" title=\"Boyfriend-free girl\">Boyfriend-free girl</a>.\n</p><p>The lyrics of Christian's song \"<a href=\"/cwcki/BFF%27s_(Best_Friends_Forever)\" title=\"BFF's (Best Friends Forever)\">BFF's (Best Friends Forever)</a>\" seem to be addressing Sarah, with Chris conceding the impossibility of romantic love and seeking greater fulfillment in a <a href=\"/cwcki/Friend_zone\" title=\"Friend zone\">closer platonic friendship</a>. His comparison of \"your boyfriend\" (presumably Wes) to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Black_Sonichu\" title=\"Black Sonichu\">Black Sonichu</a> recast himself and the couple into the hero-lover-rival <i>troika</i> that he developed for <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a>, and then further refined by featuring Wes as <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Wes-Li_Sonichu\" title=\"Wes-Li Sonichu\">an evil hedgehog</a> in his own right. Thankfully, Wes's career proved resilient enough to survive the trauma.\n</p><p>To this day, no records exist of what Sarah's reaction to any of this insanity was, not even in Chris's recounting of the events.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"With_William_Spicer\">With William Spicer</span></h4>\n<p>Eventually, Sarah broke up with Wes. We can infer that the break-up had happened no later than 31 March 2005, as it was noted by Chris on that date when he updated <a href=\"/cwcki/Story_of_My_Current_Days\" title=\"Story of My Current Days\">Story of My Current Days</a>. Chris mentions of having learned of the break-up from Wes himself rather than Sarah. Chris also noted in his update that Sarah had started a romantic relationship with another man named <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/William_Spicer\" title=\"William Spicer\">William Spicer</a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-12\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">[12]</a></sup> She eventually married and has since had two children with him. The ups and downs of how Chris took this news are captured in how the fictional Chris reacted in <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_2\" title=\"Sonichu 2\"><i>Sonichu</i> #2</a> after Sarah tells him, and in <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_5\" title=\"Sonichu 5\"><i>Sonichu #5</i></a> when Chris made a comic adaptation of her wedding. Chris knew so little about Spicer, probably having never met him, that in the comic he decided to depict the groom as a <a href=\"/cwcki/Yu-Gi-Oh!\" title=\"Yu-Gi-Oh!\">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a> character so that he wouldn't have to draw the actual person. If the comic is anything to go by, Chris did not attend the wedding in real life, but quietly accepted Sarah's decision anyway. In the videobook version of the story, Chris even explicitly states he was not invited;<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-13\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">[13]</a></sup> it is not unlikely that this statement applies to reality as well as fiction. William Spicer was spared the fate of being made into a one dimensional Sonichu villain like his predecessor was however, though not because Wes had done wrong while William had not, but rather because Wes was unlucky enough to have dated Sarah while Chris was interested in her, while by the time William was marrying her, Chris had already moved on to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Megan\" title=\"Megan\">Megan</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Epilogue\">Epilogue</span></h3>\n<p>In a chat from 16 <a href=\"/cwcki/April_2009\" title=\"April 2009\">April 2009</a>, Chris mentioned that the last time he had seen Sarah was shortly after her wedding. He had heard little of her afterwards except for a few updates from her father and <a href=\"/cwcki/Joshua_Martinez\" title=\"Joshua Martinez\">Joshua Martinez</a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-14\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">[14]</a></sup> On 18 <a href=\"/cwcki/April_2010\" title=\"April 2010\">April 2010</a> Chris again stated that he had lost touch with Sarah after her marriage.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-15\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">[15]</a></sup> On 14 <a href=\"/cwcki/March_2010\" title=\"March 2010\">March 2010</a>, shortly after the CWCki instituted <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCki:The_Wallflower\" title=\"CWCki:The Wallflower\">The Wallflower policy</a>, Chris wrote a blog post asking that the CWCki erase from its pages all the references to various people he cares about, Sarah among them.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-16\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">[16]</a></sup> In a chat from 1 <a href=\"/cwcki/February_2021\" title=\"February 2021\">February 2021</a>, Chris described a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Daydream\" title=\"Daydream\">daydream</a> about ancestors of Sarah and Wes being wizards alongside <a class=\"new\" href=\"/w/index.php?title=Merlin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" title=\"Merlin (page does not exist)\">Merlin</a> and guided by Chris.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-17\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">[17]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sarah_in_the_comic\">Sarah in the comic</span></h2>\n<table class=\"infobox\" style=\"width: 21em; font-size: 90%;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<th colspan=\"2\"><i><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\">Sonichu</a></i> character\n</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:299-SarahHammer.jpg\"><img alt=\"299-SarahHammer.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"366\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/d/db/299-SarahHammer.jpg/200px-299-SarahHammer.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/d/db/299-SarahHammer.jpg/300px-299-SarahHammer.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/d/db/299-SarahHammer.jpg 2x\" width=\"200\"/></a>\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<th colspan=\"2\">Sarah Hammer / Nicole Rammer\n</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Date of birth</b>\n</td>\n<td><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_chronology#1982\" title=\"Sonichu chronology\">13 October 1982</a>\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Gender</b>\n</td>\n<td>Female\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Species</b>\n</td>\n<td>Human\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Evolves into</b>\n</td>\n<td>Saramah Rosechu\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>Christian first hints at Sarah's involvement in the Sonichu comics in <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_0\" title=\"Sonichu 0\"><i>Sonichu #0</i></a>, where he alludes to three mysterious electric hedgehogs: <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris-Chan_Sonichu\" title=\"Chris-Chan Sonichu\">Chris-Chan Sonichu</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Wes-Li_Sonichu\" title=\"Wes-Li Sonichu\">Wes-Li Sonichu</a>, and Saramah Rosechu.

Using the bracelets Sarah could transform into Saramah Rosechu, whose role in the prophecy would be to maintain the balance between Chris-Chan and Wes-Li.  \n</p><p>When Sarah discovered these two hedgehogs, they were already locked in battle. Although at first she didn't know who Chris-Chan and Wes-Li were, Saramah quickly learned that the hedgehogs were also her old friend Christian and her recent boyfriend <a href=\"/cwcki/Wes_Iseli\" title=\"Wes Iseli\">Wes Iseli</a>. Forced to choose between these two men, Saramah <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_Ego\" title=\"Chris and his Ego\">remembered who was writing the comic</a>, so she impaled Wes-Li against a tree and broke up with him, citing his cruelty toward Christian. Saramah actually spent more time dressing down Wes than she did battling <a href=\"/cwcki/Count_Graduon\" title=\"Count Graduon\">Count Graduon</a>, the evil she and the others were prognosticated to defeat.\n</p><p>With Wes quickly departing, Chris and Sarah returned to their human forms and caught up on old times. Chris believed he now had an easy path to becoming Sarah's <a href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart\" title=\"Sweetheart\">sweetheart</a>, but unfortunately for him she was already interested in another man, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/William_Spicer\" title=\"William Spicer\">William Spicer</a>.\n</p><p>Though Sarah technically did not appear again until <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_5\" title=\"Sonichu 5\"><i>Sonichu #5</i></a>, she did appear in one of the Classic Sonichu Strips from <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_0\" title=\"Sonichu 0\"><i>Sonichu #0</i></a>. The one which she appeared in was reprinted in <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_4\" title=\"Sonichu 4\"><i>Sonichu #4</i></a> and established as having taken place a few weeks before the events of Sub-Episode 7.\n</p><p>Later, in <i>Sonichu #5</i>, Chris would invisibly attend Sarah's wedding to William Spicer, being on-hand for Wes-Li's attempt to kidnap her. Using his Chris-Chan Sonichu powers and <a href=\"/cwcki/Yu-Gi-Oh!\" title=\"Yu-Gi-Oh!\">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a> cards, Chris rescued Sarah, who then rewarded him by tossing him the bouquet and wished him luck in his pursuit of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Megan\" title=\"Megan\">Megan</a>. In spite of this issue being based around Sarah's wedding and being intended as a sendoff to her character, she did remarkably little in this story, just <a href=\"/cwcki/Women%27s_rights\" title=\"Women's rights\">filling the role of the kidnapped princess</a>.\n</p><p>Sarah was not seen in the comic for a long time afterwards, but she did appear again in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_Special_2\" title=\"Sonichu Special 2\">Sonichu Special 2</a>, also known as the Wedding Comic. In this comic, she attends Chris's ill fated marriage to <a href=\"/cwcki/Ivy\" title=\"Ivy\">Ivy</a>, dressing <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tomgirl\" title=\"Tomgirl\">in drag</a> and acting as the best man, since Chris doesn't actually have any friends other than her who could fill that role other than <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">fictional characters</a> or possibly <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler\" title=\"Bob Chandler\">his father</a>. One can't shake the feeling that he'd probably ask Sarah to do this in a real life wedding too.\n</p><p>Thanks to the efforts of <a href=\"/cwcki/Nintendo\" title=\"Nintendo\">Nintendo</a> lawyer <a href=\"/cwcki/Jay_Z\" title=\"Jay Z\">Jay Z</a> during the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Miyamoto_Saga\" title=\"Miyamoto Saga\">Miyamoto Saga</a>, Sarah later became one of many characters who had their names <a href=\"/cwcki/Retroactive_continuity_in_Sonichu\" title=\"Retroactive continuity in Sonichu\">retconned</a> in the story, due to being based on real life people. As such, in the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_Videobooks\" title=\"Sonichu Videobooks\">Sonichu Videobooks</a>, Sarah Hammer instead became Nicole <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Dildo\" title=\"Dildo\">Rammer</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Saramah_Rosechu\">Saramah Rosechu</span></h3>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">Sarhamah's [sic] origin is unknown but her radiance shines brighter than the sun.

She has no actual personality beyond asserting her deep, abiding friendship with Christian, which again suggests that he knows nothing about this person except what he likes to think she feels about him. Sarah is able to activate this form through use of the Lightning Bracelets, which act as her own equivalent to Chris's <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_Medallion\" title=\"Sonichu Medallion\">Sonichu Medallion</a> or Wes Iseli's Fireshock Pendant.\n</p><p>Prior to the retcon, Saramah Rosechu was a much more sensible name for Sarah's Sonichu form, even if still slightly weird. Since the change however, new readers of the comic who are not aware of the background of the character are just left baffled by the strange notion that a woman named \"Nicole\" transforms into a hedgehog and is then named \"Sarah\" for some reason. If Chris had not left this glaring oversight out, she would have been called \"Nicomar Rosechu\".\n</p><p>Due to her lack of a large role in the comics, Saramah Rosechu doesn't have many powers compared to the other two chosen ones of the prophecy. While Chris and Wes both use weird <a href=\"/cwcki/Pok%C3%A9mon\" title=\"Pokémon\">Pokémon</a> related attacks or <a href=\"/cwcki/Yu-Gi-Oh!\" title=\"Yu-Gi-Oh!\">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a> cards to fight, aside from the retarded Team Blast attack ripped off from <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog\" title=\"Sonic the Hedgehog\">Sonic Heroes</a></i>, Sarah is only ever seen using her bow and arrow to fight with. Both the bow and arrow are lightning bolt-shaped. They may or may not be literally made of electricity. <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_art\" title=\"Chris and art\">It's hard to tell with Chris's art</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Queen_of_the_Cherokian_Clan\">Queen of the Cherokian Clan</span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:102px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Queen_of_the_Cherokian_Clan.PNG\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"177\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/7/76/Queen_of_the_Cherokian_Clan.PNG/100px-Queen_of_the_Cherokian_Clan.PNG\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/7/76/Queen_of_the_Cherokian_Clan.PNG/150px-Queen_of_the_Cherokian_Clan.PNG 1.5x, /w/images/7/76/Queen_of_the_Cherokian_Clan.PNG 2x\" width=\"100\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Queen_of_the_Cherokian_Clan.PNG\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>The only picture of her to this date.</div></div></div>\n<p>Wife of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Ancient_leader_of_the_Cherokee_Clan\" title=\"Ancient leader of the Cherokee Clan\">ancient leader of the Cherokee Clan</a>, and the <a href=\"/cwcki/Cherokian_Clan\" title=\"Cherokian Clan\">Cherokian Clan</a>'s queen.\n</p><p>Little is established about the queen except that she was the object of a rivalry between her husband and his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Wasabi_Rival\" title=\"Wasabi Rival\">Wasabi Rival</a>.

This is a good example of how Chris's female characters exist only to motivate his male ones and/or be fap material. The <a href=\"/cwcki/Anchuent_Prophecy\" title=\"Anchuent Prophecy\">Anchuent Prophecy</a> caused Sarah to learn of her past life and thereby gain the powers of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Saramah_Rosechu\" title=\"Saramah Rosechu\">Saramah Rosechu</a>, which she was tutored in using by a vision of the Queen.\n</p><p>The queen hasn't shown up since that single appearance, and considering that Sarah/Saramah has been absent from the comic since getting married in <i>Sonichu #5</i> save for her brief cameo at Chris's wedding,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-18\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">[18]</a></sup> it's highly unlikely she'll ever show up again.\n</p><p>Oddly enough, of the three ancestors, she is the only one who actually looks something like a Native American; although she's still blonde and blue-eyed, she's wearing a dress that could be made of deerskin, which is the stereotypical way of dressing Native ladies in works of fiction. At least Chris got that part right.\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Gallery\">Gallery</span></h2>\n<center>\n<ul class=\"gallery
