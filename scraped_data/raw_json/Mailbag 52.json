I'm never letting my daughter read your comics again, she was heartbroken at first because she was your biggest fan, but after I showed her Asperchu, she fell in love with his touching story. I don't care if you have \"suffered\" more than Alec has because that doesn't make your comic better.

No offense, but they are bad. It is really hard to tell what things are some times, there is very little definition, you can't seem to draw elbows correctly, and you don't seem to have scale down very well. There is one drawing where <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a> is carrying <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu\" title=\"Rosechu\">Rosechu</a> and it looks like he is 10 feet tall carrying a 4 foot tall person.\n</p><p>My question on your <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Art\" title=\"Art\">art</a> is, are you physically handicapped at all? Are your hands deformed or do you have poor control over your fine motor skills?

You don't seem to have any concept of keeping continuity or story arcs correct. Like when <a href=\"/cwcki/Crystal_Weston_Chandler_(sister)\" title=\"Crystal Weston Chandler (sister)\">CWC's sister</a> is trapped in limbo and CWC needed to track down the <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_Balls\" title=\"Sonichu Balls\">Chaos Emeralds</a>, but then CWC turns into <a href=\"/cwcki/Collosal_Chan\" title=\"Collosal Chan\">Colossal Chris</a> he simply, and anti-climatically, opens a magical doorway and pulls her out. Why? You would have had so many opportunities for adventure and excitement if you had started a quest to get the Emeralds.\n</p><p>Also, the dialog. Dude, what the heck is up with all the rambling monologues confusing speech?\n</p><p>Have you considered hiring a ghost writer to help you with your story lines, making the dialog more straightforward and exciting to read?\n</p><p>And finally, your characters are really two-dimensional and bland.

Honestly they seem like the same exact character, <a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey\" title=\"Kacey\">with the same exact</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Jackie\" title=\"Jackie\">way of talking</a>, but with different colors and slightly different powers.\n</p><p>Maybe the ghost writer you hire could help you develop your characters and give them more depth?\n</p><p>Perhaps you could have Alec Benson Leary help you out with the writing and stories? His comics are very rich and exciting with lots of humor and excitement and very well thought out. I know he looks up to you so he would probably be willing to do it.\n</p><p>One last note, I think you need to get rid of Simonlia Rosechu.

We loyal fans have been citizens of Cwcville for nearly decade, and we deserve to have our voices heard. Have the CWCipedia sysop hold an election on-line.\n</p><p>Second, we want to see daily updates. Once a day, seven days a week. None of this \"well, I drew the comic, but I won't upload it until later\" phooey.\n</p><p>Third, no more lying. There's no such thing as a little white lie, and they all pile up against you until the people around you can't trust you any more. Honestly, I've been a fan since the start, but now I can't even watch a Youtube video by you or read anything you write without thinking I'm being lied to, and it hurts, because it's disrespectful to lie to people.\n</p><p>Fourth, no more fan service. No more Rosechu panties. No more sex scenes. I asked the other fans, and none of us appreciate it. Plus, it isn't TV-Y7. The last time I saw a panty shot in your comic, I vomited on my keyboard. I'm not attracted to animal people, and none of your fans are, so stop that nonsense for us.\n</p><p>Fifth, cut down the cast. You're taking a step in the right direction by removing yourself from the comic (if that isn't another lie), but there are still too many chiefs and not enough injuns. The Sonichu Comic should be about Sonichu. Not <a href=\"/cwcki/Wild_Sonichu\" title=\"Wild Sonichu\">Wild Sonichu</a>. Not <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Punchy\" title=\"Punchy\">Punchy</a>. Not <a href=\"/cwcki/Blake\" title=\"Blake\">Blake</a>. Just Sonichu. It's okay if they cameo from time to time, but they should never be the main focus, even for a second. The best solution is to kill off some of the characters, or at least retire them from the comic as well.\n</p><p>Sixth, respect other artists. Simonla isn't your creation. Evan created Simonchu/Simonla. Evan no longer wants you using that character, and you should respect his wishes. Otherwise, you can't expect others artists (like Alec) to respect you, nor can you really expect respect from your fans.\n</p><p>Seventh, never insult our intelligences again by creating fake emails like you did in mailbag 50 ever again. You're a naive fool if you think anyone would buy those as real emails.\n</p><p>These are seven things you could easily do to regain your true fans, which you've lost. If you cannot do them, then consider I and the last few true Sonichu fans lost. Your <a href=\"/cwcki/Heart_level\" title=\"Heart level\">fan level</a> is currently shattered at 1%. I've given you the seven tools to restore it, but it's up to you to take this advice. Please do.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Your letter has been read fully, and your thoughts have been inputed and accepted for better improvement.

Sadly Mike passed away earlier this morning around midnight. He was found slumped over in his chair with a bottle of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Alcohol\" title=\"Alcohol\">alcohol</a> and a mostly empty bottle of <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zolpidem\" title=\"wikipedia:Zolpidem\">ambien</a>. Until we have the autopsy on Monday, there is no way of knowing if this is suicide or if it was accidental.\n</p><p>I am putting my husband's affairs in order, one of which was you. I am tempted to scream at you and call you all sorts of names as I feel that YOU are the reason Mike committed suicide. One look at your filthy little page shows me that you've driven more than one person to suicide. He reached out to you in a moment of trouble and you were too busy to help him, despite your promises to.\n</p><p>But that would not have made Mike happy. Mike was a good <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Honest\" title=\"Honest\">honest</a> soul who truly believed the best of everyone. He would have been happy to know that our son has come home, although it is on a sad note. I had managed to get in contact with him shortly after I found his father's still and cold body in the living room. His wife Debbie has been an unexpected stronghold of compassion during this time and I'm truly sorry that Mike never got a chance to really know her.\n</p><p>Because Mike thought so highly of you, I am letting you know of his passing and I am letting you see his obituary. But rest assured, none of my children NOR their friends will EVER visit your site again. They may visit Asperchu's site, but never yours. I will never be able to forgive you for ruining our family's life forever.\n</p><p>Marie Jackson\n</p><p><a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.christianmemorials.com/tributes/mike-jackson/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.christianmemorials.com/tributes/mike-jackson/</a>\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Your letter has been read fully, and your thoughts have been inputed and accepted for better improvement.

I have tried to come to a reasonable compromise with you, but to no avail. You refuse all attempts I make to have a serious discussion with you (I suggest that you take me more seriously when I try to talk to you from now on, because I am losing interest in holding back Evan's wrath). So I have no choice but to return to your mailbag, full of <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_censorship\" title=\"Chris and censorship\">CENSORSHIP</a> and LIES though I know it to be. Although you probably won't read this because it is too difficult to Comprehend, perhaps your readers will find some value in it.\n</p><p>Let us take an examination of your <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_48#10_Reasons\" title=\"Mailbag 48\">Ten Reasons</a>, and then I will submit my own Ten Reasons (As I received the same request for them as you).\n</p><p>\"1) Because my Sonichu Comics are THE Original.\"\n</p><p>Are they now? How can you say Sonichu is THE original when you PLAGIARIZE ideas and characters from <a href=\"/cwcki/Nintendo\" title=\"Nintendo\">NINTENDO</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Sega\" title=\"Sega\">SEGA</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Transformers\" title=\"Transformers\">HASBRO</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Family_Guy\" title=\"Family Guy\">SETH MCFARLANE</a>, and all the other ORIGINAL creators. Considering how much STRESS these questions give you, I do not know Why you do not simply show why writing Meg into your story is a FILTHY <a href=\"/cwcki/Parody\" title=\"Parody\">PARODY</a> of the kind you DESPISE.\n</p><p>\"2) Alec admits he got HIS ideas from MY Characters and Comics.\"\n</p><p>See above. You got YOUR ideas from NINTENDO'S <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Pikachu\" title=\"Pikachu\">Pikachu</a> and SEGA's <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog\" title=\"Sonic the Hedgehog\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>. Also, as we discussed, EVAN WANTS HIS SIMONCHU, AND ALL DERIVATIVE CHARACTERS, OUT OF YOUR COMIC. You are using them to SPITE Evan, you TROLL.\n</p><p>\"3) Sonichu has been around for ALMOST Ten Years Now; Asperchu has been around only a few months.\"\n</p><p>ASPERCHU has been around exactly 59 days as of this writing, and I completed my first issue within the first 7 days of that. You have been around ten years, yet it took you the first FIVE YEARS of that to complete <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_0\" title=\"Sonichu 0\">your FIRST issue</a>. Judging by ratios alone, ASPERCHU is better.\n</p><p>\"4) I do not draw <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_10\" title=\"Sonichu 10\">gore</a>, and I rarely draw <a href=\"/cwcki/Nudes\" title=\"Nudes\">nudity</a> or references, so you are less likely to feel queasy in comparison.\"\n</p><p>I would perhaps submit some of my fan letters to show how much fans love my artwork, but you can read all about it in my mailbags anyway, which you obviously don't do.\n</p><p>\"5) It is a <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">Straight</a>-Oriented Comic Series.\"\n</p><p>Which alienates your gay fans. Having no such rigid boundaries in my comic allows people of ALL orientations to find something they like in ASPERCHU.\n</p><p>\"6) Some of the events around ME were based from My Real-Life Expierences.\"\n</p><p>So not only do you plagiarize other creators, you plagiarize your OWN LIFE? ASPERCHU contains ORIGINAL plotlines.\n</p><p>\"7) I have suffered more than Alec has as an individual in life.\"\n</p><p>So readers should give you pity-fame? I don't use my condition as a crutch to gain sympathy; I rely on my good artwork and storytelling alone to bring in fans.\n</p><p>\"8) I've had to work a lot harder in life to cope with those trials and tortures.\"\n</p><p>Once again, you fail to talk about anything but YOURSELF, even when you are asked to speak of something else (Just like your unsatisfactory \"apology\" video, most of which you spent demanding unwarranted concessions from me rather than apologizing for your atrocious behavior). The question was about why SONICHU IS A BETTER COMIC THAN ASPERCHU, not why YOU DESERVE MORE PITY THAN ME. Although I'll grant you that one, you do deserve pity. But I am the one who deserves fans.\n</p><p>I keep ASPERCHU, about ASPERCHU. I do NOT use myself as a surrogate character within its pages. If people want to hear about my problems, such as the trolling I receive from YOU, they are free to ask me; when they read my comic, they just want an entertaining story.\n</p><p>\"9) The comic pages are ALL Originally Hand-Drawn; ONLY the text gets fixed in photoshop for better reading.\"\n</p><p>So you ignored me when I told you my works are hand-drawn as well? This point too is void.\n</p><p>\"10)I have had way over a million fans worldwide since I went online in before <a href=\"/cwcki/2000\" title=\"2000\">2000</a>.\"\n</p><p>I have, as of this morning, just broken 21,000 fans. If this rate keeps up, I will surpass one million fans in less than eight years, not ten. But the rate won't keep up, it will actually increase. In a few short MONTHS, ASPERCHU has achieved a popularity on par with, then EXCEEDING Sonichu itself.\n</p><p>Now for my own TEN REASONS, which will mirror yours:\n</p><p>1.) ASPERCHU is THE original Electric-Aspergers Hedgehog.\n</p><p>2.) I got my ideas from ME. You won't find MY comic littered with stolen Transformers characters, personality-lacking hedgehog recolors, and out-of-context Family Guy jokes.\n</p><p>3.) ASPERCHU features heartbreaking themes. The good guys don't always <a href=\"/cwcki/Ultra_Sonichu\" title=\"Ultra Sonichu\">win perfectly</a>, and the bad guys don't always get defeated. It's that suspense of never knowing what's around the corner that makes a good story.\n</p><p>4.) I include my fans in the creative process. When a fan sends their idea and requests I use it, I make a full effort to do so. What the fans want is what they get.\n</p><p>5.) ASPERCHU includes peoples of all races, ethnicities, creeds, and orientations. Even if I had some reason to be offended by the harmless existence of gays, which I DON'T, I would not exclude them from being a part of the ASPERCHU Experience.\n</p><p>6.) Rather than using my own boring life experiences as direct storylines, I create ORIGINAL stories to grip and hold the reader's attention. I do NOT use my comic as a vehicle to gain pity and sympathy from people who expect a comic to entertain them.\n</p><p>7.) ASPERCHU is ALWAYS on time. Nary a day has passed without updates, because I understand that Fans will feel unappreciated if they are not given consistency.\n</p><p>8.) ASPERCHU is painstakingly drawn to be a good work of art. Whenever I make a mistake, I spend good time and energy in Photoshop to correct it and make it easier for the viewer to understand my artistic emphasis, as well as just easier on the eyes. (All those smudgemarks and marker streaks just look unprofessional, I find.)\n</p><p>9.) I'll say it once again, because it is such an important point... ASPERCHU is ALWAYS, ALWAYS on time. Since ASPERCHU is my SERIOUS FRANCHISE, I don't let silly things like being TIRED or STRESSED get in the way of uploading new pages.\n</p><p>10.) ASPERCHU brings love to people, rather than hate and trolling.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Your letter has been read fully, and your thoughts have been inputed and accepted for better improvement.

You lost. Alec won. You know it. Even your voice in the video has a defeated tone to it. You just made this half-assed apology because you wanted something, not because your genuinely sorry for acting like a jerk. That's the only reason you ever apologize for anything. It's pathetic really, and only makes more people flock to Alec's Asperchu.\n</p><p>And your attempt to be nicer in the mailbag is laughable. In one email you told someone your a loving and caring individual. Then like two letters down, you told all gays to die in an explosion. Do you even know <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_hypocrisy\" title=\"Chris and hypocrisy\">hypocrite</a> means? Here this might help;\n</p><p>Hypocrite\n</p><p>Noun\n</p><p>1. a person who pretends to have virtues, moral or religious beliefs, principles, etc., that he or she does not actually possess, esp. a person whose actions belie stated beliefs.\n</p><p>2. a person who feigns some desirable or publicly approved attitude, esp. one whose private life, opinions, or statements belie his or her public statements.\n</p><p>Those two definitions describe you almost perfectly. Just because you don't want to believe it doesn't mean isn't true.\n</p><p>One last thing. Numerous times you've stated that you have to try to be straight. Does this imply that you have trouble with being a heterosexual? You also tell people to stay on the straight path. The thing is Chris, true and honest heterosexuals don't fall off the straight path. They don't have to try to be straight. Sometimes people pretend to be straight because that's what their parents and community expects of them (i.e. hypocrites). I expect your probably one of those people, since you've openly admitted having to work at being a heterosexual.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Your letter has been read fully, and your thoughts have been inputed and accepted for better improvement.
