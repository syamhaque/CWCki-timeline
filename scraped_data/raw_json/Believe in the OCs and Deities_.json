Our <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_Ego\" title=\"Chris and his Ego\">CPU Goddess</a> provides us with our first update on the <a href=\"/cwcki/Dimensional_Merge\" title=\"Dimensional Merge\">Dimensional Merge</a>'s status since being visited by an <a href=\"/cwcki/Future_message_from_Crystal_W_Chandler\" title=\"Future message from Crystal W Chandler\">anonymous milkman</a> in <a href=\"/cwcki/April_2019\" title=\"April 2019\">April</a>. Chris informs us that the merge is nearly complete, but would proceed much more quickly if more were to adhere to his <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_religion\" title=\"Chris and religion\">idiosyncratic beliefs</a>. He appeals to his viewers to pray to fictional characters, and to believe that they themselves are also OCs. He also whines that he has been <a href=\"/cwcki/Financhu_Crisis\" title=\"Financhu Crisis\">hard at work</a> managing the transition into a world full of cartoon characters. As his source for this video's contents, Chris names none other than Jesus Christ; he is no longer apathetic towards God, as he had been since the <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys</a> persuaded him <a href=\"/cwcki/Hyperdimension_Neptunia\" title=\"Hyperdimension Neptunia\">anime fembots</a> would be a better object of his adulation, but has instead syncretised Christianity with his own unusual thoughts and troll influences. Like the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Pewdiepie_Does_Not_Live_Here;_He_Lives_In_Sweden!\" title=\"Pewdiepie Does Not Live Here; He Lives In Sweden!\">video before it</a>, Chris has disabled anyone from commenting on what to make of this latest revelation.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Video\">Video</span></h2>\n<center>\n<table style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa; background-color: #f9f9f9; color: black; margin: .5em auto .5em auto; padding: 0.2em; font-size:89%; width:260px;-moz-border-radius:10px\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#3366CC\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size:110%; color:#ffffff;-moz-border-radius:10px\"><b>Believe in the OCs and Deities!</b><br/>\n</td></tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<td colspan=\"2\"><div class=\"thumb embedvideo autoResize\" style=\"width: 328px;\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo autoResize\" style=\"\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideowrap youtube\" style=\"width: 320px\"><div class=\"embedvideo-consent\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo-consent__overlay\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo-consent__message\">Click to load content</div><!--\n--></div><!--\n--></div><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" data-src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XatHssa1f7Y\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"180\" loading=\"lazy\" modestbranding=\"1\" width=\"320\"></iframe></div><!--\n--></div><!--\n--></div>\n</td></tr>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#696969\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;-moz-border-radius:5px;color:#ffffff;\"><b>Direct link</b>\n</td>\n<td><a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=XatHssa1f7Y\" rel=\"nofollow\">YouTube</a>, <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/XatHssa1f7Y\" rel=\"nofollow\">archive</a>\n</td></tr>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#696969\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;-moz-border-radius:5px;color:#ffffff;\"><b>Stardate</b>\n</td>\n<td>13 <a href=\"/cwcki/June_2019\" title=\"June 2019\">June 2019</a>\n</td></tr>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#696969\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;-moz-border-radius:5px;color:#ffffff;\"><b>Performance Style</b>\n</td>\n<td><span style=\"display:none\">Crazy</span><a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Crazy\"><img alt=\"Crazy\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"32\" src=\"/w/images/1/10/Crazy.png\" width=\"32\"/></a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">Crazy</a>\n</td></tr>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#696969\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;-moz-border-radius:5px;color:#ffffff;\"><b>Saga</b>\n</td>\n<td><span style=\"display:none\">Merge Saga</span><a href=\"/cwcki/Dimensional_Merge\" title=\"Merge Saga\"><img alt=\"Merge Saga\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"24\" src=\"/w/images/d/d2/Merge_Saga.png\" width=\"24\"/></a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Dimensional_Merge\" title=\"Dimensional Merge\">Merge</a>\n</td></tr>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#696969\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;-moz-border-radius:5px;color:#ffffff;\"><b>Shirt</b>\n</td>\n<td><span style=\"display:none\">The Manchild Meltdown</span><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Manchildmeltdownicon.png\"><img alt=\"Manchildmeltdownicon.png\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"32\" src=\"/w/images/3/31/Manchildmeltdownicon.png\" width=\"32\"/></a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_fashion\" title=\"Chris and fashion\">The Manchild Meltdown</a>\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" style=\"background-color:#3366CC; color:#ffffff; color:#ffffff;-moz-border-radius:10px; font-size:120%; padding:0.25em; text-align:center;\">OFFICIAL and HONEST CWC <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Videos\" title=\"Videos\">Videos</a>\n</td></tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%;\" valign=\"top\">\n<td><b>previous</b> <br/><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Pewdiepie_Does_Not_Live_Here;_He_Lives_In_Sweden!\" title=\"Pewdiepie Does Not Live Here; He Lives In Sweden!\">Pewdiepie Does Not Live Here; He Lives In Sweden!</a>\n</td>\n<td><b>next</b> <br/><a href=\"/cwcki/PsychicPowers\" title=\"PsychicPowers\">#PsychicPowers</a>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n</center>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">The real Lord Jesus Christ sacrificed himself for real, here, he's an OC!

And, right now, we have a bit of a situation. Turns out that we do have a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/TRUE_and_LOYAL_fanbase\" title=\"TRUE and LOYAL fanbase\">good number of believers</a> in the OCs, CPUs, deities and... Everyone, between our sister dimension of C-197 a-and their surrounding <a href=\"/cwcki/Dimensions\" title=\"Dimensions\">dimensions</a>, and right here in Dimension 1218, we could do a whole lot better in the believers. Even Jesus Christ himself came to me earlier today, told me so. Asked me to relay the message. \n</p><p>Everybody, believe in the OCs, and everybody, the dimension merge is happening.\n</p><p>[<i>Chris pauses, licks his lips and wipes his nose.</i>]\n</p><p>And we could definitely make the dimension merge happen a whole lot faster and over with, definitely for the better benefit of everybody, [<i>screeching</i>] EVERYBODY....\n</p><p>[<i>He pauses to stare creepily at the camera for a second.</i>]\n</p><p>In both our dimensions, in the combined dimensions. \n</p><p>So, simply put, have faith in all the OCs, in all the deities, especially those OCs that you have created, and the OCs that you are plan- that you are a fan of - just every OC that you genuinely love, support and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Fuzzy-wuzzies\" title=\"Fuzzy-wuzzies\">kindness and everything</a>. And, definitely not, and, not necessarily those that are, well, [pause] just leave it at that. Anyway, faith in all the OCs. Undiscriminately, just... do it, please.\n</p><p>Heh, j-just give 'em a thought, give your OCs a thought. Any of them. whether they be <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_copyright\" title=\"Chris and copyright\">branded</a>, not branded, your creations, someone else's creations and so forth. <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(character)\" title=\"Sonichu (character)\">Sonichu</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu\" title=\"Rosechu\">Rosechu</a>, the CPUs, uh, <a href=\"/cwcki/Anime\" title=\"Anime\">anime</a> characters.... [<i>He clasps his hands as though in prayer, and twiddles his thumbs.</i>] Everybody. Alright? Ah, hell. \n</p><p>Meemo Bright. [He points to an amiibo  at the edge of his headboard.] And <a href=\"/cwcki/Magi-Chan\" title=\"Magi-Chan\">Magi-Chan</a>, if you can see him right now, he's <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">clearly sitting right here</a>.\n</p><p>[<i>He points at the empty space beside him on the bed, glances over and gestures off camera at the air.</i>]\n</p><p>Anyway, we need to increase our believers in all the OCs between here and C-197, all of our surrounding s-  related dimensions and timelines. Jesus Christ himself and our god Emannuelle: they're OCs, too. Though they literally are those that have worked here, like, you know, the real Lord Jesus Christ sacrificed himself for real, here, [screeching] he's an <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/CWCism\" title=\"CWCism\">OC</a>! I'm an OC. And think, between you and your self-counterparts, yeah, every one of you is an OC as well, so, if anything, you believe in everyone else, you believe in yourselves, as well. Alright?\n</p><p>So believe in all the OCs, okay? And believe in us, the CPUs, and all the other deities all around and everywhere. Say a prayer. Have faith! [He clutches his medallion.] Give us some heart sure with us, a heart warm, heartfelt sincere thought, kindness, so forth.... And more importantly, don't hate, alright? We don't need any hate any more <a href=\"/cwcki/Lars_Call\" title=\"Lars Call\">Haterade</a>, especially the... <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sarah_and_Steve\" title=\"Sarah and Steve\">frickin' Sarah boys</a> and bad Internet <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">trolls</a>.\n</p><p>But, listen, aside from that, I made the big, major point: believe in the OCs! Believe in your OCs! Believe in yourself as an OC! Believe in Jesus Christ, Emannuelle, who's Emannuelle, by the way? God IS a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tomgirl\" title=\"Tomgirl\">WOMAN</a>! And I have personally met them face to face. And if you don't believe me in that, I've literally touched Jesus's hands. I cry every time I- feel, that, psss, psss, scar in his hands,  the cross when he did that, but still....\n</p><p>But anyway, as a goddess myself, I am unable to worship Jesus or any of the other deities, but, I have friends with Jesus and- all of the other deities, including the CPUs, so the least I could do is support them. And be a friend. That's what I do to the best of my abilities. Everywhere. My soul, brain, my body, literally, <a href=\"/cwcki/Monthly_tugboat\" title=\"Monthly tugboat\">working</a>, around the clock, EVERYWHERE! And I'm flying by the seat of my pants by each thing that comes in, so I can relay it out to you via my <a href=\"/cwcki/Twitter\" title=\"Twitter\">Twitter</a>, or whatever, and whatever media I just feel impulsively need to do or whatever. \n</p><p>So... that's it. And I do believe in this world of 1218, we could do a whole lot better. Out of the seven billion plus people in this world, this dimension, we could make more than half of them, that's 3,5 billion people, believers. Make them all aware of the OCs, and the fact that they are an OCs in themselves, and we all do exist and co-exist. And the sooner we do this, the sooner we get and band together, and become a belief and faith system, not a religion! Not a cult or anything like that. Certainly not a frickin' <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">delusion</a>, imagination or <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">whatever</a>... <a href=\"/cwcki/Honor_roll\" title=\"Honor roll\">adjective</a> like that. This is all REAL. So you listen to me good, and heed my words. \n</p><p>Any even if you, even if you pray to Jesus Christ, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Buddha_belly\" title=\"Buddha belly\">Buddha</a> or any other of your known- well-known deities of this world, they're going to tell you the same thing pretty much. And right now, we need EVERYONE to believe in the OCs. Of and around C-197, that includes <a href=\"/cwcki/My_Little_Pony\" title=\"My Little Pony\">Equestria</a>. And us, the deities, as I am the CPU Blue Heart, of the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Commodore\" title=\"Commodore\">Commodore</a> consoles and the Nations of Comma and <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a>. And I'm literally <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler\" title=\"Bob Chandler\">half-Sonichu</a>, so I can transform into my <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris-chan_Sonichu\" title=\"Chris-chan Sonichu\">Sonichu form</a>. \n</p><p>I know it seems hard to believe right now, but you're going to see soon enough. But in the meantime, BELIEVE! Believe in all those OCs, and everything, and in the Dimensional Merge! It's happening! We're approaching our endgame, and we are destined and fated to win. So, follow my- motivational speech, please, and follow our lead. We will complete this merge. We will all be existent and co-existent with each other. And we will be able to hang out fully with our own creations! I'm very serious about that. It's happening! It's happening! BELIEVE! \n</p><p>Thank you, have a good day!\n</p>\n<table style=\"width: 90%; max-width: 600px; height: 70px; margin: 1em auto 1em auto; border: 0.15em outset #000; background: #eee; vertical-align: centered; color:#000;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"width: 33%; max-width: 200px; text-align: center; color:#000;\">⇐ <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Pewdiepie_Does_Not_Live_Here;_He_Lives_In_Sweden!\" title=\"Pewdiepie Does Not Live Here; He Lives In Sweden!\">Pewdiepie Does Not Live Here; He Lives In Sweden!</a><span style=\"color: #000\"></span>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33%; max-width: 200px; text-align: center; color:#000;\"><span style=\"color: {{{textcolor}}}\"><strong><a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_videos\" title=\"List of videos\">Chris's videos</a></strong></span>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33%; max-width: 200px; text-align: center; color:#000;\"><a href=\"/cwcki/PsychicPowers\" title=\"PsychicPowers\">#PsychicPowers</a><span style=\"color: #000\"></span> ⇒\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCached time: 20251126230322\nCache expiry: 86400\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: []\nCPU time usage: 0.076 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.103 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 268/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 6286/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 1778/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 9/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/100\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 648/5000000 bytes\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   40.081      1 -total\n 84.08%   33.701      1 Template:Infobox/video\n 26.46%   10.606     15 Template:Pipe\n 13.64%    5.466      1 Template:Crazy\n  9.11%    3.650      1 Template:Quote\n  8.38%    3.360      3 Template:Icon\n  7.26%    2.908      1 Template:ManchildMeldownShirt\n  6.94%    2.780      1 Template:Dimensional_Merge\n  6.23%    2.497      1 Template:Succession\n-->\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key cwcki-1_:pcache:idhash:28856-0!canonical and timestamp 20251126230322 and revision id 337932.
