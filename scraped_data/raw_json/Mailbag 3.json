Again, the vast majority of the answers are just Chris stroking his own <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_Ego\" title=\"Chris and his Ego\">unfathomably huge ego</a>. Highlights include him telling a self-loathing <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Homosexual\" title=\"Homosexual\">homosexual</a> to hypnotize himself into straightness, <i>almost</i> adequately explaining the <a href=\"/cwcki/Sex_toys\" title=\"Sex toys\">fake boobs</a>, and revealing some of <a href=\"/cwcki/Pedofork\" title=\"Pedofork\">pedofork</a> tendencies when talking about reducing the legal age of consent. His famous hypocrisy makes an appearance when he claims that calling someone's fan art \"retarded\" was constructive criticism, and then proceeds to delete messages that offer him actual constructive criticism.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\"

I've been always fascinated with the characters you create. You depict their personalities so vividly, I can always relate to them. That's what defines a true artist's work, in my opinion! My question is about the villains in your comics.
