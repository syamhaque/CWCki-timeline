They were written for pmwiki originally, but our <a href=\"/cwcki/User:Tyranogre\" title=\"User:Tyranogre\">crack team of monkeys</a> fixed them to look better on MediaWiki.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Just_Bugs_Me\">Just Bugs Me</span></h2>\n<ul><li>As the comic has shown, Chris' portrayal in the comic is highly idealized to the point of being a complete <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mary Sue</a>. Likewise, in the comic, Chris is essentially the mayor of his own City of Sue (<a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForPun\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Suepreme ruler of the Sueniverse</a>, if you will) where anything he wants, goes...so why can't Chris' comic version find a boyfriend-free girl either? It's his universe - if he wanted, he could essentially create an entire harem for himself out of nowhere, and even then, being mayor of a city would probably give him better ways to find women than loitering around shopping malls waiting for someone to show up. And what kind of mayor does nothing but loiter around the city's shopping malls anyway?\n<ul><li>My guess: that's what you have when \"Write What You Know\" collides with \"The Nice Guy Syndrome\". He's so used to not being in a relationship that he just can't write a relationship even if his life depended on it. So he keeps his comic version pathetically single, but keeps throwing the \"it's not his fault\" card. That's just a guess from someone who used to have quite an Author-Sue in his (fortunately) never written neverending saga...\n<ul><li>Not that not being able to write a relationship has stopped him before, as far as Sonichu and Rosechu's romance goes...which also serves as proof why Chris should never write romance in the first place.</li>\n<li>Didn't he once say that he considers the romance to be the best part of <i>Sonichu</i>?</li>\n<li>Yes, the <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleThirtyFour\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"ro</a><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotWant\" rel=\"nofollow\">man</a><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouFailBiologyForever\" rel=\"nofollow\">ce\"</a></li></ul></li>\n<li>It is entirely possible that he portrays his author avatar as single in the hope that a female will read the comic, see that he's available, and track him down. If the fictional CWC was shown in a relationship, his readers would assume that the real-life CWC was in one as well, thus denying him a chance to grind up a girlfriend.\n<ul><li>Considering the comic itself is just one giant advertisement for himself on his Love-Quest, this sounds plausible...it's just that the comic doesn't exactly flatter Chris in the way he intended.\n<ul><li>Or in any other way, for that matter.</li></ul></li></ul></li>\n<li>It's also likely that he's so set on his \"Men can passively attract women\" mindset that he expects his comic characters to follow it as well. Notice that in pretty much every relationship in the comic, the guy doesn't really <i>do</i> anything to win the girl; as the CWCki points out, Rosechu pretty much just falls for Sonichu because he exists.\n<ul><li>Disregard the above: Looks like Lovely Weather is basically Chris' own make-believe wife now.</li>\n<li>Which he cheated on with Meg Griffin of <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyGuy\" rel=\"nofollow\">Family Guy</a>, <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoYeah\" rel=\"nofollow\">So Yeah</a>....\n<ul><li>I think this could demonstrate that on the miracle chance Chris-chan actually got a girlfriend, he'd cheat on her without a second thought and not understand if she got angry.\n<ul><li>Good thing the odds are against that opportunity ever presenting itself. It's highly improbable CWC will ever have a TRUE and HONEST girlfriend, but the chances of him finding TWO women who are interested in him? Just ain't happening.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li>Why did Chris record the part where Bob comes in for the \"This is my house video\".\n<ul><li>I don't think he's got video editing software.</li>\n<li>No, he definitely does. Have you seen his <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParappaTheRapper\" rel=\"nofollow\">Parappa The Rapper</a> contest entry? It was full of camera effects and edits. Plus, if you watch the original there is a jumpcut. Why would he even bother recording something like this. He wasn't going to show it to anybody, he could've just deleted it. He appeared to turn something off when Bob came in. But apparently a camera was still running.\n<ul><li>I think he lost access to his video editing software.</li></ul></li>\n<li>Maybe he just turned off the TV and forgot to stop the recording? (This is Chris we're talking about, he's capable of doing something that improbably stupid.) In any case, it's a good thing that such a lulzfest managed to get caught on camera.</li>\n<li>I don't know. Something bugs me about this, it just seems unlikely.</li>\n<li>Accidentally recording it and then posting it seems likely, since I'm pretty sure Chris doesn't actually watch his videos before posting them online.</li>\n<li>Simple. Bob comes in mid-video and tells Chris to \"Shut that goddamn thing off!\", refering to the camera. Chris shuts off the TV, assuming that it will turn off the PSEye he was using. When he uploads the video, he looks at the mid-video still and sees Bob. He immediately deletes the video, edits it, then reuploads it. However, it's too late, trolls already have it archived.</li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li>In the infamous Sonichu 10, Ultra Sonichu meets Asperchu who asks him to \"cure\" him of his Aspergers and find a girlfriend, and Ultra Sonichu does so through a <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam\" rel=\"nofollow\">EXTREME ELECTRIC MAKEOVER</a><sup>tm</sup>, which somehow also gives him nice blue eyes, long blonde hair and a liposuction. If Ultra Sonichu has this power, why didn't he ever use it to, you know, help his \"father\"?\n<ul><li>You mean why Sonichu didn't \"cure\" Chris of his autism? Well... Maybe it's because autism is Christian's favourite excuse for refusing to do anything with his life, and thus Chris doesn't actually want to get rid of it. Or, more likely, it's because Chris <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.cogsdev.org/cwcki/Sonichu_10#Ultra_Sonichu_and_Collosal_Chan\" rel=\"nofollow\">was too busy exacting his idiotic \"revenge\" on Alec Benson Leary</a> to be bothered with something as trivial as putting any thought into his writings.</li>\n<li>Not to mention he is convinced that he doesn't need any of that stuff: He thinks he's handsome because his mom says he is.</li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li>It bugs me that they didn't keep the guy who did Sonichu 11. Vivian is a fine riffer and all, but season 2 isn't really funny. Maybe it'll get better but this new comics just seems dull.\n<ul><li>At the time of this writing (5 June) fan-made Sonichu 11 is back on CWCipedia.</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p><br/>\n</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><br/>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Wild_Mass_Guessing\">Wild Mass Guessing</span></h2>\n<h2><span id=\"Mayor_and_frequent_loiterer_Christian_Weston_Chandler_is_Chris-Chan_Sonichu.21\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Mayor_and_frequent_loiterer_Christian_Weston_Chandler_is_Chris-Chan_Sonichu!\">Mayor and frequent loiterer Christian Weston Chandler is Chris-Chan Sonichu!</span></h2>\n<p>It would explain why CWC is always hanging around with the Sonichus and Rosechus, why he wears that medallion around his neck, and why their names sounds so similar. They're the same person! (Sorry, I had to do this, tradition and all.)\n</p>\n<ul><li>Man, you crazy. You so crazy.</li></ul>\n<p><br/>\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"CWC_.28the_comic_character.29_is_in_an_insane_asylum.2C_and_Sonichu_is_an_account_of_his_fantasies\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"CWC_(the_comic_character)_is_in_an_insane_asylum,_and_Sonichu_is_an_account_of_his_fantasies\">CWC (the comic character) is in an insane asylum, and Sonichu is an account of his fantasies</span></h2>\n<p>The comic can't seem to figure out what 'level' of reality it works on, as within the comic itself, Sonichu is a fictional character, an <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedActors\" rel=\"nofollow\">Animated Actor</a> (being 'married' outside of 'the pages' but not within?), a real being, a being created though the will of CWC, and they can cross between CWCville and the 'real world' despite CWCville supposedly located in the real-world state of Virginia. The incongruities of the entire comic just screams madness.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"The_entire_comic_is_actually_how_Comic.21Chris_sees_the_world_of_Quickville\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_entire_comic_is_actually_how_Comic!Chris_sees_the_world_of_Quickville\">The entire comic is actually how Comic!Chris sees the world of <i>Quick</i>ville</span></h2>\n<p>Let's look at the facts. Allison Amber pretty much does everything a Mayor ought to do while Chris dicks around with hedgehog pokemon. Odds are, Comic!Bob was the previous mayor of the city, which is really named Quickville(He sees it as CWCville in his mind), and Allison lets him hang around her office and pretend to be mayor out of pity.\n</p><p>Chris likely follows Sonichu and company around and is certain that they all love him. He can't transform, but he wishes he could so he could be as awesome as his hero is. All the relationships have actual depth, but since Chris is the naive manchild he is in the real world, he assumes that they are all based around sex and proving your heterosexuality.\n</p><p>The retconning of Mary Lee Walsh to Slaweel Ryam? That's her actual name, Sonichu got sick of Chrissy calling her Mary and tried to explain that the two were different people. Chris being Chris, he took this to mean that Slaweel was impersonating Mary. Sonichu gave up after that.\n</p>\n<ul><li>But than, why did Darkbind help out against the \"Jerkops\"?\n<ul><li>Chris was actually loitering around an enemy base that he thought was a McDonalds inside a Wal-Mart. Darkbind had to save him from the three giant robots Slaweel had hidden there, and Chris later decided that the robots were the managers of said Wal-Mart. He then decided that he'd fought them all off. It explains why this is the only time \"Mecha-Jerkops\" appear.</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p><br/>\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\".22Solid_Chris.22.2C_.22Liquid_Chris.22_and_Solidius_Chris_.28better_known_as_David_Gonterman.29_are_all_clones_of_the_same_original_sample:_Ed_Wood\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id='\"Solid_Chris\",_\"Liquid_Chris\"_and_Solidius_Chris_(better_known_as_David_Gonterman)_are_all_clones_of_the_same_original_sample:_Ed_Wood'>\"Solid Chris\", \"Liquid Chris\" and Solidius Chris (better known as <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DavidGonterman\" rel=\"nofollow\">David Gonterman</a>) are all clones of the same original sample: <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EdWood\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ed Wood</a></span></h2>\n<p>This one explains itself. Liquid Chris somehow got the better part of the deal. David Gonterman appears older due to advanced aging. Solid Chris appears to have a fondness for wearing panties, much like Ed Wood.\n</p><p>But why were clones of Ed Wood made? There are several possibilities:\n</p>\n<ul><li>The scientists involved were huge fans of <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteryScienceTheater3000\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a> and bad movies, and wished that bad movies on the level of Plan 9 would continue to be produced. It backfired, as none of them went into film.</li>\n<li>It was a government experiment to see if writing bad fiction was genetic. There may be more clones, and they're writing generic pulp fantasy and science fiction novels. <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UweBoll\" rel=\"nofollow\">Uwe Boll</a> may be one as well.</li>\n<li>It was actually <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ed Wood's plan</a> to have spare bodies for him to possess from beyond the grave. Chris's latest video (with him talking to himself in two different voices) seems to indicate that the plan has come to fruition.</li></ul>\n<p>Solid Chris seems to be affected by an advanced form of the FOXDIEYOU virus. In his appearances between 2007 and today his hairline has receded, he appears to have gained lots of weight and in general he just appears older.\n</p>\n<ul><li>Evidence against: Ed Wood was charming, hard-working, and by all accounts, a sweet guy who just had no talent. Considering how rarely Chris updates his comic, his hateful views on gay people (I don't know how he feels about transvestites like Wood, and remember, those panties were not his idea), and his generally asinine personality, he has little in common with Wood except lack of talent. If he is a clone of Wood, then that's all that carried across.\n<ul><li>Solid Chris is the <i>evil</i>, corrupted clone whose DNA sample was corrupted by the dark fizzy substance that is cherry cola, and had poor parenting who further warped the pitiful creature. Liquid Chris is the <i>good</i> clone, raised in a loving home and inherited Ed Wood's good qualities. Gonterman is somewhere in between. (additionally, Chris now wears a sports bra out of his own free will)\n<ul><li>Obviously, Solid Chris got all the recessive genes.</li></ul></li>\n<li>Perhaps Solidus Chris is <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/ChristianHumberReloaded\" rel=\"nofollow\">Christan Humber</a> instead.\n<ul><li>But won't there still be a possibility of Solid Chris defeating Liquid.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>\n<h2><span id=\"Cly.28de.29_Cash_and_most.2C_if_not_all_the_trolls.2C_are_really_an_advanced-but-insane_A.I.\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cly(de)_Cash_and_most,_if_not_all_the_trolls,_are_really_an_advanced-but-insane_A.I.\">Cly(de) Cash and most, if not all the trolls, are really an advanced-but-insane A.I.</span></h2>\n<p>Clyde Cash and the other trolls are not real human beings, but rather an A.I. that's gone rogue, but instead of trying to take over the world, it just trolls people on the internet.

This moment of enlightenment extends his consciousness across time and space and he contacts the various Electric Hedgehog Pokemon, including Sonichu and Rosechu (even though Sonichu and Rosechu no longer exist in the true sense). He asks for their power, but they tell him that he doesn't need their power... as he was the one who created them; he only forgot that he was God of CWC<i>World</i> due to his memory being altered by the AI Clyde Cash so that he was just the 'Mayor' of CWCVille in an effort to harness his awesome power. He is, however, still a clone of Ed Wood. We're not sure how this works.\n</p><p>With this, Chris' memory as a god of his fictional realm reawakened, and the answers all falling into place, he will transform into Collossal Chan, and battles the gigantic naked Mary Lee Walsh.

The land in which they battled becomes a literal sea of blood.\n</p><p>We are then treated to CWC's mental journey as he explores how he had selfishly twisted the world, and how he does not deserve his godhood, but neither wants to give it up, but also ponders cosmic suicide, and we never learn his decision.\n</p><p>At the end, Liquid Chris is lying on a beach at the edge of the sea of blood, confused as to why he's still alive when Wild had just killed him.

It also includes other entirely fictional creations such as Family Guy, Pokemon, Transformers, and god only knows what else.

It's linked very closely with Chris' thought process. Here the characters seen in the second reality (that of the comics) are thier \"real\" selves- essentially actors. The comics, except for a few blurbs where the 'actors' break character (similar to how Superman used to shill for fruit pies), are considered to be a fictional creation that the characters make as part of thier job, like a play or television show, just told in comic form. Similar to Chris, though, the 'actors' have trouble keeping thier creations and thier reality seperated, leading to a large degree of crossover. While the characters don't exist in the real world (except as godawful comics), they ARE aware of it and what happens to Chris in it. Whenever they act like they're not, they're doing it for the sake of Expospeak.\n</p><p>Chris' mind and the two sub-universes are basically the same thing, as evidenced by him pretty much just putting down a bunch of stream-of-consciousness stuff and calling it a comic. To him, all three universes are equally real, but he finds himself stuck in this one and seems to beleive that getting a girlfriend and losing his virginity will make his real life essentially the same as that of the comics (or maybe he thinks something entirely different, but I'm pretty sure he beleives that getting laid will solve all of his problems instantly.)\n</p><p><br/>\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Chris-Chan.27s_nightmare_of_people_being_destroyed_in_a_factory_ISN.27T_a_nightmare.2C_but_a_subconscious_desire.\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris-Chan's_nightmare_of_people_being_destroyed_in_a_factory_ISN'T_a_nightmare,_but_a_subconscious_desire.\">Chris-Chan's nightmare of people being destroyed in a factory ISN'T a nightmare, but a subconscious desire.</span></h2>\n<p>Given the brutality in his recent comics, it's likely Chris would like to see everyone he sees as undesirable destroyed.

But one day he will finally decide to release issue 11, (or 12, it depends on whether or not he will remember the whole \"10 Year Aniversery\" thing) he will want to create a great cross over for his return. So another artist who either doesn't know of him, takes pity on him, wants to teach him to be better and uses this turtoring excersise, or is trolling him will decide to let him help with a crossover. Since Sonichu is an action comic (in the loosest since of the word0, and chris hates losing at anything ever he will blow up when the other author says he wants Sonich to lose one fight or says he doesn't like the way his characters are portrayed in Chris's comic. Than the trolls will sit back and watch as the other author gets his or her character's stolen by chris and files a lawsuit. In it, more details will come to light to the general public about CWC, and eventually he will be forced by sega or nintendo to stop Sonichu. NOTE: I don't expect this to actually happen.

What if he's elevating them to <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad\" rel=\"nofollow\">Big Bad</a> status on purpose? Think about it - a good chunk of his view of the world is based on video games and cartoons. He likes to depict himself as a typical heroic type, who always gets the girl and saves the day. So, what does every hero need? A villain, of course! Perhaps on some level, he knows that people who lecture him or troll him aren't really criminals or villains - but, for him, it makes things more interesting if he thinks they are. Hell, he's been doing this ever since the whole Mary Lee Walsh incident.\n</p>\n<ul><li>If he's been doing this since then, wouldn't he have left Mary Lee Walsh's name in the comic after she didn't except his apology.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris_is_some_sort_of_Adept.\">Chris is <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnknownArmies\" rel=\"nofollow\">some sort of Adept</a>.</span></h2>\n<p>Chris would be right at home in the Occult Underground. He's got the unhealthy obsession with his craft that all Adepts have, and the inability to interact with normal people that comes with it. If the rumor that he is an elaborate actor is true, then he may be an Iracimancer, a magician who gets their power from being hated. We cannot allow him to become any more well-known, or he may gather enough power to do something terrible.\n</p>\n<ul><li><ul><li>Iracimancers are forbidden from becoming angry themselves, which Chris fails at. What you are thinking of is a Personamancer, someone who gains power from other people believing his disguise. <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Understatement\" rel=\"nofollow\">He's pretty good</a>.</li>\n<li>Alternatively, maybe he is some sort of Avatar. I can't really think of any good one right now, but I am sure that whatever he is, he is unbelievably close to Ascension. Drastic measures must be taken now, for the sake of whole humanity. If there is someone out there who should really, really, REALLY stay out of the Invisible Clergy, that's Chris.</li></ul></li></ul>\n<h2><span id=\"The_sysop_was_directly_responsible_for_not_just_uploading_but_drawing_and_writing_the_.22fan.22-created_Sonichu_11_pages.\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id='The_sysop_was_directly_responsible_for_not_just_uploading_but_drawing_and_writing_the_\"fan\"-created_Sonichu_11_pages.'>The sysop was directly responsible for not just uploading but drawing and writing the \"fan\"-created Sonichu 11 pages.</span></h2>\n<p>If you've seen them, they're a pretty decent imitation of Chris's own art style, even though the background coloring is off.
