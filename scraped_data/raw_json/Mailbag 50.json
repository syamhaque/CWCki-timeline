It was the first mailbag not uploaded by the Sysop. Oddly, none of the \"letters\" were actually emails; Chris simply responded to a conversation a group of <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">users</a> had on a <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_Forum\" title=\"Sonichu Forum\">Sonichu fan forum</a>. \n</p><p>As such, Chris didn't so much respond to individual letters, as lines of conversation. Although these letters were all cherry-picked by Chris to focus on how <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">awesome</a> he was, or to support his war against <a href=\"/cwcki/Asperchu\" title=\"Asperchu\">Asperchu</a>, there were still plenty of letters that sarcastically mocked him, with Chris <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Naive\" title=\"Naive\">none the wiser</a>. The funniest was probably Dr. <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cthulhu\" title=\"wikipedia:Cthulhu\">Cthulhu</a>, who outright mocked Chris's entire life, but in such a way as to stroke his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ego\" title=\"Ego\">ego</a> enough for Chris to thank him for his input. Chris also bolded parts of most of the letters to put focus on specific points, or to downplay the negative things people had been saying about him (or positive things they had been saying about Asperchu). The note at the top implies that Chris had deliberately chosen a few harsh letters so he wouldn't seem like such a pussy.\n</p><p>Highlights include two <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">homophobic</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_religion\" title=\"Chris and religion\">\"Holier Than Thou\"</a> cretins believing that ads saying \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Family_Guy\" title=\"Family Guy\">Seth MacFarlane</a> supports gay marriage\" would <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tomgirl_Saga\" title=\"Tomgirl Saga\">\"Turn</a> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Gaybian\" title=\"Gaybian\">them gay\"</a>, people who DEFINITELY aren't Chris showering him with utter praise to the point of <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_religion\" title=\"Chris and religion\">worship</a>, while expressing hate for <a href=\"/cwcki/Asperchu\" title=\"Asperchu\">Asperchu</a> so exaggerated it becomes comical, someone defending the <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_art\" title=\"Chris and art\">artwork</a> of <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a>, something that nobody other than Chris himself, would do, and more <a href=\"/cwcki/Duck\" title=\"Duck\">duck-sucking</a> comments.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Special_note\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Special note</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Letters\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Letters</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Asperchu_causes_homosexuality\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Asperchu causes homosexuality</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Especially_in_children\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Especially in children</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#The_beauty_of_dickless_ads\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The beauty of dickless ads</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Straight_girls_hate_dicks\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Straight girls hate dicks</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Retarded_chimpanzee_colors\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Retarded chimpanzee colors</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Chris_the_humble\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris the humble</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#The_&quot;Chris's_art_sucks_on_purpose&quot;_emails\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The \"Chris's art sucks on purpose\" emails</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Good_writing_sucks\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Good writing sucks</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#Yay,_Max!\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Yay, Max!</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#Obviously_they_didn't_notice_Inos\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Obviously they didn't notice Inos</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-13\"><a href=\"#And_in_closing...\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">And in closing...</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-14\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Special_note\">Special note</span></h2>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>This mailbag is one that I have personally put together to show EVERYONE the BEST examples of how Letters in the Mailbag Should be phrased, thought and written.
