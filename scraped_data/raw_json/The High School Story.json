She is accused of being a <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">lesbian</a> even though she is STRAIGHT, and all because <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">she has more male friends</a> than <a href=\"/cwcki/Gal_pal\" title=\"Gal pal\">gal-pals</a>, showing us that <a href=\"/cwcki/Honor_roll\" title=\"Honor roll\">Chris has no idea how lesbians act in</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">real life</a>, and was <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_Ego\" title=\"Chris and his Ego\">drawing inspiration from his own high school life</a>. Despite supposedly being bullied, anyone who accuses her of lesbianism is beaten up by \"a nearby homophobe\". With little transition beyond establishing a <a href=\"/cwcki/JERKS\" title=\"JERKS\">guy-pal</a> with a suspiciously feminine name, Chris retells the story of his \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Manchester_High_School#Seinor_Prom\" title=\"Manchester High School\">seinor prom</a>\" inexplicably fused with <a href=\"/cwcki/Manchester_High_School#Graduation\" title=\"Manchester High School\">his graduation</a>.\n</p><p>Like Chris in his own real-life graduation, Terrah receives no special awards despite the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_Ego#Unwarranted_self-importance\" title=\"Chris and his Ego\">high quality</a> of <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_art\" title=\"Chris and art\">her artwork</a>. She reacts rather unreasonably by exploding the high school, killing everyone there. She is thereafter cursed to wander the halls for eternity, although how there even <i>are</i> halls for her to haunt is a bit of a mystery since she just annihilated the entire fucking building. \n</p>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">PRAISE MY CREATIVITY!\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:11px; padding:0 0 0 16px; vertical-align:bottom; width:20px\">”\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\" style=\"font-size:smaller; padding:8px 36px; text-align:right;\"><cite>Terrah LeAnne Yowman, AND NOT CHRIS AT HIS GRADUATION</cite>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Text\">Text</span></h2>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>The High School used to be the respectable school, known as <a href=\"/cwcki/Manchester_High_School\" title=\"Manchester High School\">Menchi-Nasu High</a>. It was left behind and abandoned, because of lack of funds for that one school. Then the students left, and the \"students\" bummed around. There was an accident that happened at a <a href=\"/cwcki/Manchester_High_School#Seinor_Prom\" title=\"Manchester High School\">Seinor Prom</a> in <a href=\"/cwcki/1999\" title=\"1999\">1999</a>; a <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">High-Functioning Autistic</a> individual with Psychic Powers, <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler\">Terrah LeAnne Yowman</a>, roamed the halls with growing social outreachings; she had a number of good guy-pals, and a few <a href=\"/cwcki/Gal_pal\" title=\"Gal pal\">gal-pals</a>. She was constantly ridiculed with being labeled a <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">Lesbian</a>, because she hung out with MORE DUDES Mutually.\n<p>She felt angry when she heard \"Lesbian\"; when called that, she would leave the bully <a href=\"/cwcki/Creepy_stare\" title=\"Creepy stare\">an intimidating glare</a> with a purple glow from her green eyes. Then <a href=\"/cwcki/Curse-ye-ha-me-ha\" title=\"Curse-ye-ha-me-ha\">soon after</a>, a <a href=\"/cwcki/Power\" title=\"Power\">Strong</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Straight\" title=\"Straight\">Straight</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">Homophobe</a> would <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_Fighter\" title=\"CWC Fighter\">attack that bully</a> with No Mercy; beat the crap out of that person.\n</p><p>Come her Seinor Prom in 1999, she asked her Best Guy-Pal, <a href=\"/cwcki/Tiffany_Gowen\" title=\"Tiffany Gowen\">Tippanston Gowen</a>, to the Prom. And even though she felt nervous at first, he asked her to dance. She replied, \"I have two left-feet.\" Still, he took her hand, and danced the night with her. She was most happy and in peace. Then after the last dance, he kissed her long and good. If she was still alive today, she would have been <a href=\"/cwcki/EXCLUSIVE_Manchester_High_School_2000_Reunion_Required_NOW\" title=\"EXCLUSIVE Manchester High School 2000 Reunion Required NOW\">anxiously waiting for the 2009 Reunion</a> to return the favor of Gowen offering the Strong Autistic individual the best night of their life at the Prom.\n</p><p>Now, Terrah was a Great Artist, as she was well-known and well-praised in the number of Art Classes she took at Menchi-Nasu High.\n</p><p>Following the last dance, they had the Seinor Awards Ceremony; ALL the students stayed until the FINAL END of that night. Terrah got a Star-Pin for her Good Grades; that was the ONLY AWARD she would receive that night. She anxously awaited Awards for her Inspiring, Creative Artwork she had Hand-Painted, Carved, Molded, Drawn and all Media Taught to her, yet she received NO AWARDS FOR HER CREATIVITY. She felt distraught even when called out the passing of the ART AWARDS; Her Name was NOT SAID at all.\n</p><p>Only Few Left early enough to tell the tale, but AFTER the final award was passed, and during the FINAL DANCE, she was beside herself; feeling alone. In her Furious Rage in not being appreciated Creatively EVEN ONCE, she concentrated ALL HER PSYCHIC POWERS, SHOUTED \"PRAISE MY CREATIVITY!\", then a NOVA FLASH beamed from the Prom location, seen from as far as a Hundred Miles away. All that remained was Total Silence, Terrah's gown and Star Pin, and just nearby the gown, Tippanston's Dress Jacket, with a Wedding Ring in a box, and engraved in it, \"To Terrah, My Sweetest, Most Creative Woman Ever. I Love You.\" Tippanston wanted to wait till he had brought her back home to propose, but sadly, he died with her that night.\n</p><p>Since then, Terrah haunted the halls of Menchi-Nasu High, drawing the Cheerleader Raccoon Character, <a href=\"/cwcki/Bionic_the_Hedgehog\" title=\"Bionic the Hedgehog\">Francine StripeCheer</a>, she had created from her freshman year as Varsity Cheerleader Manager. \n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Analysis\">Analysis</span></h2>\n<p>Chris, as always, fails to understand the differences in gender relations and perception in society, as while a man who hangs out with a lot of women as strictly friends will get called gay, a woman who hangs out with a lot of guys is more likely to be called a \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Gal_pal\" title=\"Gal pal\">tease</a>\" or a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tomgirl\" title=\"Tomgirl\">tomboy</a>. The only reasonable interaction in the story — a boy proposing to a girl on prom night, which is a melodramatic cliché but still happens in real life once in a while — is soured when one realizes \"Tippanston\" is meant to be a gender-flipped <a href=\"/cwcki/Tiffany_Gowen\" title=\"Tiffany Gowen\">Tiffany Gowen</a>, a girl Chris knew from high school, which means he also still wants a <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_Music_Video_Holding_Out_For_a_Hero\" title=\"CWC Music Video Holding Out For a Hero\">heroine fresh from the shop</a> to rescue him from a world that doesn't appreciate his \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_art\" title=\"Chris and art\">art</a>.\"\n</p><p>Perhaps this desire to be rescued is what prompted him to try out the gender-flip itself, as well: In heterosexual romantic relationships, it's generally the guy who is expected to initiate things by asking the girl out. Chris, however, given his <a href=\"/cwcki/Noviophobia\" title=\"Noviophobia\">noviophobia</a>, the <a href=\"/cwcki/Infinitely-High_Boyfriend-Factor\" title=\"Infinitely-High Boyfriend-Factor\">Infinitely-High Boyfriend-Factor</a>, and never having to work for anything in his life, would prefer to take the passive role. Therefore, he creates a female alter-ego, for whom this passiveness will hopefully be seen as more societally acceptable. Sadly, Terrah fares just as badly as Chris did and dies a <a href=\"/cwcki/Virgin_with_rage\" title=\"Virgin with rage\">virgin with rage</a>.\n</p><p>This story also confirms (again) that Chris is terrible at making up names, with \"Tippanston\" and \"Francine StripeCheer\" joining the ranks of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Simonla\" title=\"Simonla\">Simonla</a>.\n</p><p>Interestingly, Francine StripeCheer is an analog to <a href=\"/cwcki/Bionic_the_Hedgehog\" title=\"Bionic the Hedgehog\">Bionic</a>, rather than Sonichu. Notice how Bionic the basketball-playing hedgehog was turned into <a href=\"/cwcki/Megagi_La_Skunk\" title=\"Megagi La Skunk\">a cheerleading raccoon</a>, as Chris is <a href=\"/cwcki/Women%27s_rights\" title=\"Women's rights\">far too sexist</a> to have a girl actually playing a sport.\n</p><p>Despite the inherently small framework of a short story, Chris still manages to make many continuity errors. In addition to the above-noted incomplete complete destruction of the school, it is also said that some students survived the hell sent hissyfit by leaving the prom early, despite it also being stated that all the attendees stayed till the \"FINAL END\". Chris also proposes two alternative futures had Terrah not lost her shit at the prom, which in context seem mutually exclusive; one in which she anxiously awaits the school reunion so she can ask Tippenston to dance to \"return the favor\", and another in which Tippanston proposes to Terrah after the prom (and she presumably accepts). Thus, even when Chris is writing about things that are hypothetical <i>in-universe</i>, he still manages to screw it up. \n</p><p>The whole story is, of course, an obvious rip-off of the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/1976\" title=\"1976\">1976</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/The_Wallflower\" title=\"The Wallflower\">Stephen King</a> film <i><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_(film)\" title=\"wikipedia:Carrie (film)\">Carrie</a></i>, in which an unattractive young girl with budding telekinetic powers is bullied so severely that she ends up destroying her prom hall and killing hundreds. It has been suggested that Chris is too sheltered to have read the novel; it contains some intense and raw themes, rather, Chris has probably seen the movie. By no coincidence, the movie <i>Carrie</i> appeared in Chris's <a href=\"/cwcki/Netflix\" title=\"Netflix\">Netflix</a> queue shortly before he wrote this story. Considering how Chris can equate the death of <a href=\"/cwcki/Patti_Chandler\" title=\"Patti Chandler\">his dog</a> to the death of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ryan_Cash\" title=\"Ryan Cash\">a human being</a>, it's easy to think he would consider not getting an undeserved minor art award exactly as bad as (if not worse than) having swine's blood dumped on him and being ridiculed by his peers.\n</p><p>Oh, and also, this is one of the only stories not from the backwaters of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/4-Cent_Garbage\" title=\"4-Cent Garbage\">4-chan</a> to glorify a homophobe <a href=\"/cwcki/Kick_the_Autistic\" title=\"Kick the Autistic\">beating the</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/DIRTY,_CRAPPED_BRIEFS\" title=\"DIRTY, CRAPPED BRIEFS\">shit</a> out of people.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Fan_comic\">Fan comic</span></h2>\n<center>\n<ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\">\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\"><div style=\"width: 155px\">\n<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><div style=\"margin:15px auto;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:F1p11.jpg\"><img alt=\"F1p11.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"120\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/5/58/F1p11.jpg/77px-F1p11.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/5/58/F1p11.jpg/116px-F1p11.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/5/58/F1p11.jpg/155px-F1p11.jpg 2x\" width=\"77\"/></a></div></div>\n<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n</div>\n</div></li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\"><div style=\"width: 155px\">\n<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><div style=\"margin:15px auto;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:F1p12.jpg\"><img alt=\"F1p12.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"120\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/f/f7/F1p12.jpg/77px-F1p12.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/f/f7/F1p12.jpg/116px-F1p12.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/f/f7/F1p12.jpg/155px-F1p12.jpg 2x\" width=\"77\"/></a></div></div>\n<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n</div>\n</div></li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\"><div style=\"width: 155px\">\n<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><div style=\"margin:15px auto;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:F1p13.jpg\"><img alt=\"F1p13.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"120\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/6/61/F1p13.jpg/77px-F1p13.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/6/61/F1p13.jpg/116px-F1p13.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/6/61/F1p13.jpg/155px-F1p13.jpg 2x\" width=\"77\"/></a></div></div>\n<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n</div>\n</div></li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\"><div style=\"width: 155px\">\n<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><div style=\"margin:15px auto;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:F1p14.jpg\"><img alt=\"F1p14.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"120\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/a/a9/F1p14.jpg/77px-F1p14.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/a/a9/F1p14.jpg/116px-F1p14.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/a/a9/F1p14.jpg/155px-F1p14.jpg 2x\" width=\"77\"/></a></div></div>\n<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n</div>\n</div></li>\n</ul>\n</center>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Fan_videos\">Fan videos</span></h2>\n<table style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa;
