As he could not find anyone else to go with him, even after he called the members of his <a href=\"/cwcki/Wesley_Memorial_United_Methodist_Church\" title=\"Wesley Memorial United Methodist Church\">church</a>'s \"Young Adult Social Group\", he was forced to scalp his tickets and then sit alone in the bleachers beside a \"lovey-dovey couple\" (who probably haven't even got a <a href=\"/cwcki/I_Pimp_My_Ride.MOV\" title=\"I Pimp My Ride.MOV\">pimped out PS3 controller</a>) while handsomer, happier, less <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">autistic</a> men did flips on motorcycles for the roaring crowd.

Threatening to put me in a mental institution. That was pretty much why we had to run away... and move to Chesterfield County, and I had better life over there, I had a lo- I had so many friends over there, in high school. And I was just <i>sad</i> to leave, when I, after I graduated. 'Cause I had to leave all my friends. I had the good life. But we were forced to move back here.\n</p><p>You people of Greene County, you could not have left us, uh, left me and my family alone. You had to go and pay off the realtors, just so, this h- so that this house here could not have been sold. If it, 'cause if it had been sold, we would have been able to stay in Chesterfield County. [<i><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sigh\" title=\"Sigh\">sigh</a></i>] And I would have been ha- I would have had a lot- a happier life over there, than right now and how I'm feeling.

I wish my family and I did not have to move back here. I wish we could have stayed in Chesterfield County, 'cause I had the better life there. And we were doing we- we were doing well, but you had to drag us down! You had to make us unable to sell our house here. You had to <i>force</i> my family to move back here, where I was okay and I have a couple of friends, and I'm better off with... [<i>Voice cracks, shakes arm to gesture at room.</i>] <b>stuff.</b>\n</p><p>That stuff is no good if I don't have, if I don't have many friends to share it with.  [<i>Chokes back tears.</i>]\n</p><p>And it all just went downhill. I bet, even Greene County had something to do with influencing that goddamn <a href=\"/cwcki/Michael_Snyder\" title=\"Michael Snyder\">Michael Snyder</a> to see f- to see any... so recourse... or... anything like that to make him pretend to have a reason to kick me out, quote-unquote \"<i>scaaaaring</i> his customers away!\" [<i>Flips off the camera</i>] You goddamn, greedy... <i>Snyder</i>!\n</p><p>I was at the John Paul Jones Arena earlier tonight, at the Extreme Action Sports. I had won four tickets the previous Friday, Friday of the last week, from 95.1. The few <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">friends</a> I have here could not have come- could not come with me, and I could not even find anyone in the congregation to take- to go with me. 'Cause I misplaced directory for one reason. And even with the help of, uh, my pastoral counselor to get in contact with them, they did not call- none of them called me back!  \n</p><p>And I had to sell the... tickets I had, and I had to sit there next to a... lovey-dovey couple. [<i>His voice begins to crack.</i>] Which, that was okay, you know, I was trying to be... good- I was trying to be good friend, you know... [<i>scratches back of head</i>] Sociable. [<i>sigh</i>] But still, if that was... If I had stayed in Chesterfield County, and I would- and I had a similar situation for an event there... <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">I would definitely have had my friends I had there</a>. Moving back here, it just dragged me downhill. So I tell you what, Greene County... Because you saw fit to make- to make me and my family have to move back here, just to make me sad, and move more into my Autistic Shell: <i>you did it</i>.  \n</p><p>If I had stayed in Chesterfield County, I would have been a whole lot better off.
