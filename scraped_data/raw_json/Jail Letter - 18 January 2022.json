  "html_content": "<div class=\"mw-body-content mw-content-ltr\" dir=\"ltr\" id=\"mw-content-text\" lang=\"en\"><div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p>On 18 January 2022, Chris sent an <b>eleventh letter</b> to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Kenneth_Engelhardt\" title=\"Kenneth Engelhardt\">Kenneth Engelhardt</a>.\n</p><p>Some highlights of this letter include:\n</p>\n<ul><li>This is so far the first known instance where Chris adds a disclaimer on his letter that it can be shared online.</li>\n<li>Kengle has requested to do a crossover with Chris for his Sonichen stories and Sonichu, to which Chris answers with a rather unsubtle \"HELL NO!!!\". Along with this, Chris sets up a set of guidelines for Sonichu fanfiction for it to be considered canon.\n<ul><li>At two points Chris berates fan-fiction of Sonichu for containing profanity, gore and violence. One need only glance the pages of <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_10\" title=\"Sonichu 10\">Sonichu 10</a></i> to see the glaring hypocrisy of this condemning of violence and gore.</li>\n<li>Chris states that ‘countering’ the gore and violence-filled Sonichu fanfiction is very stressful and tiresome for him, Implying that people have been sending Chris their own versions of Sonichu, possibly in weenish attempts to recreate the events surrounding the <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Asperchu\" title=\"Asperchu\">Asperchu</a></i> saga.</li></ul></li>\n<li>At various points in this letter Chris refers to ‘we’ as ‘Christine and I’, as though ‘Jesus’ and Chris are two different people. Chris seems to have slipped further into his delusions of being Jesus and now regards Jesus and Christine as two separate entities, whist still being both of them.</li>\n<li>Chris states that he intends to return to <a href=\"/cwcki/14_Branchland_Court\" title=\"14 Branchland Court\">14 Branchland Court</a> when he is released from jail. Chris does not specify how he plans on doing this, as he is already miles away from 14BC, and will likely not be allowed to be anywhere near Barb.</li>\n<li>Chris writes another long list of the television, movie and video game characters who are present on C-197. The list includes many of Chris's favorite series as well as some media which Chris has never expressed an interest in before.</li>\n<li>Chris states that all Sonichus and all humans who are part Sonichu have the ability to ‘breathe in space like Sonic can’.</li>\n<li>Chris mentions updating his list of \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Commandments\" title=\"Commandments\">commandments</a>\" since <a href=\"/cwcki/Jail_Letter_-_22_December_2021\" title=\"Jail Letter - 22 December 2021\">writing about them to Spamton</a>. He also states that he has added about 11 new commandments and plans to share them all in due time.\n<ul><li>He shares his 15th commandment in this letter. This commandment essentially says that one should not post online unless the intent is to post constructively.</li></ul></li>\n<li>Like with <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Fiona\" title=\"Fiona\">Fiona</a>, Chris wants to re-gain contact with both <a href=\"/cwcki/The_WCT\" title=\"The WCT\">The WCT</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/The_Praetors\" title=\"The Praetors\">the Praetors</a>, requesting the both of them to send him their phone numbers.</li></ul>\n<h2><span id=\"Chris.27s_Reponse\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris's_Reponse\">Chris's Reponse</span></h2>\n<table class=\"\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px; vertical-align:top;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:top;\">Jesus Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top; text-align:right;\"><code>Richmond VA 230</code>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;\">[picture of a bird]\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top; text-align:right;\"><code>18 Jan 2022</code>\n</td>\n<td style=\"font-size:60%; text-align:right; vertical-align:top;\"><code>US POSTAGE<br/>$000.53°<br/>18 Jan 2022<br/>MAILED FROM ZIP CODE 22960</code>\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13021 James Madison Hwy<br/>Orange, VA 22960\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:JailLetter2NewCWCCross.jpeg\"><img alt=\"JailLetter2NewCWCCross.jpeg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"194\" src=\"/w/images/5/58/JailLetter2NewCWCCross.jpeg\" width=\"189\"/></a>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;\">Kenneth Engelhardt\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;\">\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:center;\">\n</td>\n<td colspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\">\n</td>\n<td>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p><br/>\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>① *THIS LETTER YOU MAY UPLOAD ONLINE*\n<p>Yo. \nKenneth Erwin Engelhardt. \n</p><p>Firstly, I just received your letter, \"A Sonichu Rebirth and makeover\"; I am only going to say this one time:\n</p><p><br clear=\"both\"/>\n</p>\n<p style=\"padding: 5px; text-align: center; font-size: 70px; line-height: 90px; font-weight: 700;\"><i><u>HELL NO!!!</u></i></p>\n<p><br clear=\"both\"/>\n</p><p>Also, your \"Sonichu and Rosechu\" are Distant Alternate Timeline and Universe; They have never exited in this timeline's set of universes, here \"Including 1218; C-197, and the whole of 1c-211987), so ditch that idea of yours to the curb at present. \n</p><p>As for the books and continuations, I , the body of your <i>Jesus Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu, the Goddess Blue Heart, Avatar &amp; Lord</i>, as well as my soul partner, Jesus Christine, herself, who is presently out and working on the Greater and ultimate duties responsibilities, and matters, already have plans to go into effect post-collective shift and after I am released and returned home to the Sonichu Temple.
