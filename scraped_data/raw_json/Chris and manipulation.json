One such example is <a href=\"/cwcki/Twin_Falling_Towers\" title=\"Twin Falling Towers\">Twin Falling Towers</a>, a 2009 video in which Chris invoked the 9/11 tragedy to diss Clyde Cash. The Man in the Pickle Suit described how the trolls talked to Chris behind the scenes to get him to make the video as:\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #CEF2CE; border:1px dotted #A3BFA3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>be sure to mention that you think he's weak! call him weak, like some sort of big disaster, like a bridge collapsing. ooh, or compare him to 9/11! that'll embarrass him!<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>For a decade or so, people assumed he came up with the 9/11 video on his own volition, painting an image of an <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/USA\" title=\"USA\">unpatriotic</a> ingrate. It didn't help that his apology video involved photoshopping the Twin Towers into candles, basically depicting the buildings on fire. Whether this apology video was staged or not is unknown.

Chris's situation reflects Truman's, as he has been manipulated by trolls for the sole purpose of making him into a spectacle for online mockery, and many of his ostensibly private interactions have been unwittingly shared with the world. The only real difference is that Chris installed the <a href=\"/cwcki/PSEye\" title=\"PSEye\">cameras</a> himself. \n</p><p>Similar to how actors populate Truman's world while posing as trusted loved ones, undercover trolls posed as Chris's friends for years. They controlled access to Chris - when one sweetheart saga ended, another potential sweetheart would contact Chris, and he would ask his \"friends\" to vet them. The undercover trolls would confirm to Chris that the sweetheart could be trusted, thus continuing the cycle of trolling.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-10\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">[10]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-11\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">[11]</a></sup>\n</p><p>One such undercover troll is <a href=\"/cwcki/LoveYouLongTime\" title=\"LoveYouLongTime\">LoveYouLongTime</a>, the woman behind <a href=\"/cwcki/Emily\" title=\"Emily\">Emily</a>,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-lylt_12-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-lylt-12\">[12]</a></sup> <a href=\"/cwcki/Kim_Wilson\" title=\"Kim Wilson\">Kim Wilson</a>,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-13\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">[13]</a></sup> and several other undisclosed personas.

In a manner similar to the boiling frog, Chris is increasingly unable to recognize when he is the target of manipulation without being told outright by others that said manipulation has taken place. In 2018, the <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys</a> manipulated Chris in ways darker than had ever been attempted before, including systematically dismantling <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/CWCVille\" title=\"CWCVille\">his imaginary world</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(species)\" title=\"Sonichu (species)\">its cast</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu_(species)\" title=\"Rosechu (species)\">of characters</a>, engaging in criminal extortion against him, and accusing Chris of <a href=\"/cwcki/Pedofork\" title=\"Pedofork\">pedophilia</a> if he didn't play along with them (see \"Overview\" section). Chris was gaslit to the point of completely believing everything the Idea Guys said to him. \n</p><p>While the efforts of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Guard_Dogs\" title=\"Guard Dogs\">Guard Dogs</a> minimally restored Chris's self-awareness to the point that he will level angry asides at the Idea Guys for their extortion in his videos, as demonstrated in those during the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Soft_Exile\" title=\"Soft Exile\">Soft Exile</a> saga, Chris still wholeheartedly believes in modifications the Idea Guys made to both the Sonichu canon and real world aspects of Chris's life.

At that point, the classic troll cabal voluntarily relinquished their control over Chris to allow him to grieve. As a direct result, Chris stopped recording wacky videos online (hence the abrupt end of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Calling_Out\" title=\"Calling Out\">Calling Out</a> saga).\n</p><p>The troll experience has left Chris with lingering suspicion and paranoia as to the motives of others, and he has occasionally posted on social media channels about how he suspects people offline of being trolls, albeit without any real evidence. Chris gradually socialized in the real world again, such as hanging out at the <a href=\"/cwcki/Impulse_Gay_Social_Club\" title=\"Impulse Gay Social Club\">Impulse Gay Social Club</a> and with his <a href=\"/cwcki/Pok%C3%A9mon_League_friends\" title=\"Pokémon League friends\">Pokémon League friends</a>, although this respite was interspersed with the beginning of modern trolls such as <a href=\"/cwcki/Catherine\" title=\"Catherine\">Catherine</a> and the <a href=\"/cwcki/Lady_Managers\" title=\"Lady Managers\">Lady Managers</a> who, again, manipulated Chris back into his Truman Show existence.\n</p><p>The <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Business\" title=\"Business\">Business</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Financhu_Crisis\" title=\"Financhu Crisis\">Financhu Crisis</a>, and <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys</a> sagas were a paradigm shift from Chris's tendency to slide offline without troll influence to a new Chris, increasingly online by his own volition.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Chris.27s_mother\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris's_mother\">Chris's mother</span></h2>\n<p><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Barb\" title=\"Barb\">Barb</a> is often blamed for being Chris’s original and most persistent <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Enabler\" title=\"Enabler\">enabler</a>, and it is likely that her coddling gave Chris his <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">puerile and egocentric attitude</a>. She is also deemed by Christorians to be the one responsible for Chris constantly taking orders from random strangers without giving it a second thought. In the past, some of Barb's attempts at controlling Chris were nothing short of outright emotional abuse. Examples include threatening to lock Chris out of the house and leave him homeless if he dared travel further than a few miles out of town after the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ohio_Trip\" title=\"Ohio Trip\">Ohio Trip</a>, as well as feigning cardiac arrest to bring Chris into line, terrifying him to the point of calling 911 on several occasions.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-17\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">[17]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Perhaps the most notable incident involving this sort of manipulation took place in 2011; Chris had planned to visit that year's <a href=\"/cwcki/MAGfest\" title=\"MAGfest\">MAGfest</a> convention, but realized that he didn't have enough of his <a href=\"/cwcki/Monthly_tugboat\" title=\"Monthly tugboat\">monthly tugboat</a> left to afford a hotel room, so he instead opted to sleep in his car. After informing his parents of his plans, Barb gaslit him into backpedalling, firstly by claiming he could be at risk from a combination of criminals and cold temperatures, then by again threatening to leave him homeless, and finally by implying that she would <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_Death\" title=\"Chris and Death\">commit suicide</a> if Chris went to the convention. A distraught Chris cancelled his plans, and received only further guilt tripping (and a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Video_games\" title=\"Video games\">video game</a>) as consolation.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-18\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">[18]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Manipulation_techniques\">Manipulation techniques</span></h2>\n<table style=\"background:#FFF; border:1px solid #DEA743; border-top:8px solid #DEA743; color:#000; width:100%; max-width:618px; margin:0 auto 16px;\">\n<tbody><tr style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<td style=\"padding:5px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Protip.jpg\"><img alt=\"Protip.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"90\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/6/6a/Protip.jpg/90px-Protip.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/6/6a/Protip.jpg/135px-Protip.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/6/6a/Protip.jpg 2x\" width=\"90\"/></a>\n</td>\n<td style=\"padding:0 5px 0 1px; width:100%;\"><div style=\"font-size:1.25em; margin:0\"><b>PROTIP:</b></div>\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:0\"><b>The methods listed here are for documenting common techniques used by trolls. Do not attempt any of these.</b></div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>As shown above, after gaining Chris's trust, it isn’t particularly difficult to get him to do many things he wouldn't normally do. There is a three step process that most trolls and enablers use:\n</p>\n<ol><li><b>Appeasement</b>: Give Chris an offer for something he’d really want or feed into Chris’s beliefs.</li>\n<li><b>Instructions</b>: Provide Chris with over-the-top steps he can take to take the offer or so that he can roleplay with you.</li>\n<li><b>Betrayal</b>: Watch him do it, and betray him. Then watch the result of said betrayal. Rinse, Dry, and Repeat.</li></ol>\n<p>As an example, Chris’s history of being manipulated began with him being tricked into crawling into a tight space by childhood friend <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sarah_Hammer\" title=\"Sarah Hammer\">Sarah Hammer</a> when she told him that she found Casper the Friendly Ghost there. Sarah simply noticed that Chris had a fascination with cartoon characters being real, and knew this was the perfect opportunity to give Chris the offer of meeting him in person (<b>Appeasement</b>). She then told him that he could see Casper if he crawled into the hole (<b>Instructions</b>). Finally, she locked him in, and began watching the events that would follow (<b>Betrayal</b>).\n</p><p>During the <a href=\"/cwcki/Saga\" title=\"Saga\">Classic Era</a>, this technique would be used by many trolls, such as <a href=\"/cwcki/Blanca_Weiss\" title=\"Blanca Weiss\">Blanca Weiss</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">Clyde Cash</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris\" title=\"Liquid Chris\">Liquid Chris</a>, and even <a href=\"/cwcki/Shigeru_Miyamoto\" title=\"Shigeru Miyamoto\">a bunch of trolls posing as Nintendo Staff</a>. In the case of Blanca, the trolls behind the pseudonym simply realized that Chris really wanted a significant other to complete his <a href=\"/cwcki/Love_Quest\" title=\"Love Quest\">Love Quest</a> and finally get some <a href=\"/cwcki/China\" title=\"China\">china</a>, so they used Chris's desperate pleas to complete this mission to obtain his medallions (<b>Appeasement</b>). Afterwards, they insisted that Chris give them the medallion if he wanted Blanca for himself (<b>Instructions</b>). Finally, they destroy the medallion in many ways, from cutting it with a knife and hitting it with a hammer, to setting it on fire and submerging the broken pieces into a jar of pickles (<b>Betrayal</b>).\n</p><p>The most illegal and life-changing use of this technique to date is from Chris's most infamous enablers, the <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys</a>. After a long string of supernatural beliefs and creepy behaviors being displayed from Chris during his comeback, a troll by the name of Joshua Wise noticed his complete lack of self-awareness, and wanted to see how deep the rabbit hole would go. Wise would then appeal to many of Chris's fantasies by roleplaying as several of his characters (<b>Appeasement</b>). Afterwards, he tasked him to do a number of nonsensical tasks such as having him lick a drawing of Magi-chain's penis on a wall, and having him destroy a Christmas tree, telling him it was Nazi merchandise (<b>Instructions</b>). The Betrayal part of this would come from the proposed humiliation that Chris would subject himself to. Even after he was doxed and shut down for a while, he (along with several others), would use this technique repeatedly until they went as far as extorting large sums of money from him and falsely reporting him to the FBI for being a pedophile, among other things (<b>Betrayal</b>).\n</p><p>A less common means that people have found to manipulate him is through this same process but in reverse. This method is a favorite among his mother.\n</p>\n<ol><li><b>Threats</b>: Tell Chris that if he does or does not do something, you will do something undesirable that will happen to him.</li>\n<li><b>Instructions</b>: Tell him that, in order to prevent the undesirable thing from happening, he has to cancel all plans and instead take part of someone else's whims.</li>\n<li><b>Betrayal/Reward</b>: Reward him for doing what he has been told to further strengthen his trust for you. Or, you can just betray him anyway. Rinse, Dry, and Repeat.</li></ol>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Validation\">Validation</span></h3>\n<p>Some manipulation involves giving Chris validation over his pre-existing feelings and beliefs, which influences him further. Examples include the unknown enabler who told him to get in touch with his feminine side and influenced him into identifying as a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tomgirl\" title=\"Tomgirl\">tomgirl</a>; the <a href=\"/cwcki/Subliminal_Frequency_Hypnosis\" title=\"Subliminal Frequency Hypnosis\">Subliminal Frequency Hypnosis</a> videos, and the people who commented in them, who influenced Chris into <a href=\"/cwcki/Self-inflicted_taint_wound\" title=\"Self-inflicted taint wound\">believing his taint was transforming into a vagina</a>; and the <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys</a>, who exploited his beliefs about alternate <a href=\"/cwcki/Dimensions\" title=\"Dimensions\">dimensions</a> in order to influence and shape those beliefs further, culminating in Chris's pseudo-religious belief over the <a href=\"/cwcki/Dimensional_Merge\" title=\"Dimensional Merge\">Dimensional Merge</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Reasons_why_Chris_is_so_gullible\">Reasons why Chris is so gullible</span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Mental_Deficiencies\">Mental Deficiencies</span></h3>\n<p>A common aspect of <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">autism</a> spectrum conditions is an increased level of gullibility; those on the spectrum are often more openly trusting of others, willing to put aside suspicion to follow what someone says, even in situations which could put them at risk. Chris also appears to have some degree of both <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosopagnosia\" title=\"wikipedia:Prosopagnosia\">face blindness</a> and <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonagnosia\" title=\"wikipedia:Phonagnosia\">difficulty recognizing voices</a>, which are also common (though not universal) autism symptoms. \n</p><p>Chris has been fooled by numerous personas operated by the same person; an example of this is Chris wholeheartedly believing the person behind <a href=\"/cwcki/Jack_Thaddeus\" title=\"Jack Thaddeus\">Jack Thaddeus</a> in the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Calling_out\" title=\"Calling out\">Calling out</a> Saga to be Ahuviya Harel (ADF), even though the two neither sounded nor looked alike, as well as Chris believing <a href=\"/cwcki/Kim_Wilson\" title=\"Kim Wilson\">Kim Wilson</a> to be a different person from <a href=\"/cwcki/Emily\" title=\"Emily\">Emily</a>, even though the latter presented herself to Chris as the former on several occasions, even in face to face meetings where Chris should have been able to tell the difference had he not been experiencing this impaired recognition. Furthermore, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Julie\" title=\"Julie\">Julie</a> was a 13-year-old boy using an obvious falsetto voice, yet Chris believed \"her\" to sound 100% female, even when <a href=\"/cwcki/BlueSpike\" title=\"BlueSpike\">the actor</a> forgot to mask his voice. \n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Enablers_.26_Lack_of_Independence\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Enablers_&amp;_Lack_of_Independence\">Enablers &amp; Lack of Independence</span></h3>\n<p>Chris isn't very independent. He relies on the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tugboat\" title=\"Tugboat\">government</a> and his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Barb\" title=\"Barb\">mother</a> to pay the bills, and still ends up in <a href=\"/cwcki/Debt\" title=\"Debt\">debt</a>. While he has made <a href=\"/cwcki/Pok%C3%A9mon_League_friends\" title=\"Pokémon League friends\">real-life friends</a> in the past, the <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys</a> saga led him to alienate them in mid-<a href=\"/cwcki/2018\" title=\"2018\">2018</a>. Nowadays, he prefers to surround himself with online <a href=\"/cwcki/Enablers\" title=\"Enablers\">enablers</a> who play into his every escapist fantasy, in turn gaining his trust. Chris's dependence on other people, especially his enablers, has actually made him more susceptible to being manipulated, as all of his trust is simply put into them without any second thoughts. He is also highly susceptible to peer pressure and fitting in with others' opinions. \n</p><p>Chris’s gullible, overly trusting nature and desire for contact means that he has often been drawn to consider others friends, even if they’re acquaintances at best or simply attempting to get close for malicious reasons at worst. Even though he would often curse and even wish death on trolls, in recorded voice chats with them he would often appear to be quite receptive and active in such conversations, as long as the others did not cross the “Hurtful Truth Level”, in which case he would become hostile in return. From an outside perspective, Chris’s isolation has also resulted in making him vulnerable to manipulation techniques as a result of his attempts at seeking out people beyond the hoard-choked halls of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/14BC\" title=\"14BC\">14BC</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Lack_of_Self-Awareness\">Lack of Self-Awareness</span></h3>\n<p>Chris lacks self-awareness and a sense of boundaries, whether for himself or for others. He has no filter, a trait which he calls <a href=\"/cwcki/Honest_Content\" title=\"Honest Content\">honesty</a>. He will tell you embarrassing, private matters when you first meet him, including his former <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Virgin\" title=\"Virgin\">virginity</a>, his story about how pinkeye gave him <a href=\"/cwcki/Heterochromia\" title=\"Heterochromia\">differently-colored eyes</a>, and even his tendency to <a href=\"/cwcki/DIRTY,_CRAPPED_BRIEFS\" title=\"DIRTY, CRAPPED BRIEFS\">soil himself</a>. Once someone gains his trust, he will reveal even more personal information, most of which an average person wouldn't even reveal to a psychologist. Trolls collate the information and leak it to the general public, where it ends up on <a href=\"/cwcki/Kiwi_Farms\" title=\"Kiwi Farms\">forums</a>, YouTube videos, and this fine Wiki.\n</p><p>This lack of self-awareness may also be another symptom of his autism. Usually, this manifests as generally innocuous things, like being unable to regulate the volume of one's voice to match the social setting, or being unable to recognize non-verbal social cues when communicating with other people. In more severe cases like Chris however, his lack of social awareness can come across as <a href=\"/cwcki/Megan_emails,_Jan-July_2007\" title=\"Megan emails, Jan-July 2007\">tone-deaf</a> at best, or <a href=\"/cwcki/Megan_emails,_2008\" title=\"Megan emails, 2008\">a threat to one's safety</a> at worst. Normally, this lack of self-awareness in a social sense can be minimized or outright \"cured\" with the proper resources (e.g. special education and the right therapist), <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_mental_healthcare\" title=\"Chris and mental healthcare\">but we all know how that turned out</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"His_Self-Entitlement\">His Self-Entitlement</span></h3>\n<p>Another massive flaw that makes Chris easy to manipulate is his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_Ego\" title=\"Chris and his Ego\">egotism</a> and resulting entitlement, so long as he takes a procedure or simply whines about it long enough. Many of the cases where he had been manipulated involved the manipulator noticing this fundamental character flaw, and therefore bribing him with gifts and promises of self-fulfillment. The bribes could be anything from promises of romance to a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Miyamoto\" title=\"Miyamoto\">video game publishing deal</a> – as long as it's something Chris wants, trolls will use it as bait. However, this also has a tendency to backfire, as Chris always believes he is entitled to more, and will take a gift and then turn around and ask for another.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"General_Short-sightedness\">General Short-sightedness</span></h3>\n<p>Chris repeatedly falls victim to the SuperStraight effect, where someone will provide a quick rebuttal to a point and lose ground to the wider argument. In SuperStraight's case they inadvertently corroborated the claims that trans women are women by creating a separate sexuality than straight for those who aren't attracted to them. Likewise, Chris will regularly talk himself into various corners by agreeing to various outlandish claims merely because he was pressured to accept certain points as fact to continue the conversation. This is how you can get him to finally admit Liquid's <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Honest_content\" title=\"Honest content\"> TRUE and honest</a> name really is \"Chris\" and not \"Jeff\", then \"<a href=\"/cwcki/CHRIS!!!_CHANDLER!!!\" title=\"CHRIS!!! CHANDLER!!!\">CHRIS!!! CHANDLER!!!</a>\", then \"Christian Weston Chandler\" (but he was given that name and not renamed by an <a href=\"/cwcki/Christopher%27s_name_change\" title=\"Christopher's name change\"> animatronic bear</a>), and so on theoretically forever.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_Also\">See Also</span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/cwcki/Enablers\"
