nutrition</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>Put simply, Chris is a fatty. Unfortunately, he continues to deny this fact, and often lies that he cooks for himself often. Chris's diet actually consists largely of fast food from <a href=\"/cwcki/McDonald%27s\" title=\"McDonald's\">McDonald's</a>, which is admittedly not unlike the diet of many Americans. He claims to usually only eat fast food salads, but the caloric content of the salads often exceeds fast food burgers after adding the sauce that comes with them. His diet contributes in large part to many of his health issues, as well as his <a href=\"/cwcki/Financhu_Crisis\" title=\"Financhu Crisis\">financial problems</a>.\n</p><p>After spending three months in <a href=\"/cwcki/Western_State_Hospital\" title=\"Western State Hospital\">Western State Hospital</a>, his mugshot upon returning to jail on 3 <a href=\"/cwcki/May_2022\" title=\"May 2022\">May 2022</a> revealed him to have lost a significant amount of weight. This is likely due to Chris being completely unable to beg for money to spend on junk food. However, since his release from jail in 2023, he has quickly ballooned back to his former obesity.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Hydration_and_water_consumption\">Hydration and water consumption</span></h2>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_nutrition#Hydration_and_water_consumption\" title=\"Chris and nutrition\">Chris and nutrition#Hydration and water consumption</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>Up until 2020, Chris's water consumption was incredibly low, and his primary fluid consumption consisted mainly of carbonated drinks, as revealed by <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris\" title=\"Chris\">Chris</a> having 8,000 <a href=\"/cwcki/My_Coke_Rewards\" title=\"My Coke Rewards\">My Coke Rewards</a> points. For reference, buying and redeeming a 36-can pack of Coke is only equivalent to 25 points. This data point gives Christorians a metric in determining the amount of soda that Chris had actually consumed. In fact, it is estimated that between the 6th of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/March_2007\" title=\"March 2007\">March 2007</a> and the 4th of <a href=\"/cwcki/September_2009\" title=\"September 2009\">September 2009</a>, Chris drank around 2,500 bottles of Coca-Cola.\n</p><p>Chris's heavy consumption of carbonated beverages is also illustrated in a video in <a href=\"/cwcki/April_16_Fetish_Vids#Fanta:_Semen_Flavor\" title=\"April 16 Fetish Vids\">2009</a>, wherein Chris creates his infamous 'Semen Flavored Fanta' at the request of <a href=\"/cwcki/Ivy\" title=\"Ivy\">Ivy</a>. Chris believed that in consuming his own reproductive fluids, he could 'recycle' his semen and protect his fertility, as he likely thought men were subject to the female factoid of being \"born with all of their eggs they'll ever have\". The belief in this concept alone gives Christorians great insight into Chris's incorrect view of not only biology, but of how consumption of food and beverage works in the human body.\n</p><p>Contrary to his previous practices, it seems that after 2020 Chris's water consumption has increased as he has often been seen with a <i>Glaceau</i> water bottle. However, as early as <a href=\"/cwcki/January_2018\" title=\"January 2018\">January 2018</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris\" title=\"Chris\">Chris</a> expressed a favoring of water<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup> Inside said bottle is an <a href=\"/cwcki/Magic_stones\" title=\"Magic stones\">amethyst crystal</a> which Chris believes heals him and 'recharges' his powers, as he believes the powers from the crystal are transferred into the water. This may be derived from the ancient Greeks who believed that amethyst could protect its owner from drunkenness and drinking vessels made from it would prevent intoxication.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Exercise\">Exercise</span></h2>\n<center><div class=\"thumb embedvideo autoResize\" style=\"width: 328px;\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo autoResize\" style=\"\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideowrap youtube\" style=\"width: 320px\"><div class=\"embedvideo-consent\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo-consent__overlay\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo-consent__message\">Click to load content</div><!--\n--></div><!--\n--></div><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" data-src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c7BcDvftwhI\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"180\" loading=\"lazy\" modestbranding=\"1\" width=\"320\"></iframe></div><!--\n--></div><!--\n--></div></center>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">[…] while my body is <a href=\"/cwcki/I_AM_STRONG\" title=\"I AM STRONG\">Strong</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Power\" title=\"Power\">Powerful</a>, I am unable to Run Fast without losing breath 10-Seconds in <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog\" title=\"Sonic the Hedgehog\">Sonic</a>-Running Speed.\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:11px; padding:0 0 0 16px; vertical-align:bottom; width:20px\">”\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\" style=\"font-size:smaller; padding:8px 36px; text-align:right;\"><cite><a href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia\" title=\"CWCipedia\">CWCipedia</a><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup></cite>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Cwcstrongman.JPG\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"452\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/a/a1/Cwcstrongman.JPG/300px-Cwcstrongman.JPG\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/a/a1/Cwcstrongman.JPG/450px-Cwcstrongman.JPG 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/a/a1/Cwcstrongman.JPG/600px-Cwcstrongman.JPG 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Cwcstrongman.JPG\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div><a href=\"/cwcki/I_AM_STRONG\" title=\"I AM STRONG\">I AM STRONG</a>!</div></div></div>\n<p>Chris has not had any regular exercise since leaving <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/High_school\" title=\"High school\">high school</a>, and the lack of physical activity has contributed to his already ballooning shape. Since he barely leaves his house and focuses his time on playing <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Vidya\" title=\"Vidya\">vidya</a>, his lack of exposure to the sunlight has left his skin a frightening pallor that starkly contrasts to the dark background of his room while making videos. Also, most fat people have strong, stocky legs, due to carrying around all that weight, but since Chris very rarely performs any task more physically demanding than <a href=\"/cwcki/Guitar_Hero\" title=\"Guitar Hero\">standing up</a>, his muscles have withered away, leaving a body made almost entirely out of fat, as evidenced by his incredibly thin and weak arms <a href=\"/cwcki/Sign_Destruction_Video\" title=\"Sign Destruction Video\">that are incapable of breaking wooden sticks</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_Loses_It\" title=\"Chris Loses It\">barely capable of tearing cardboard</a>.\n</p><p>When questioned about exercise, he regarded standing up and playing <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Guitar_Hero\" title=\"Guitar Hero\">Guitar Hero</a></i> as exercise.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]</a></sup> Needless to say, Chris is clearly delusional. Chris never seemed to show interest in actual exergaming titles, such as <i>Dance Dance Revolution</i> or <i>Wii Fit</i>. In Chris's <a href=\"/cwcki/Chop_Chop_Master_Onion%27s_Rap_Showdown\" title=\"Chop Chop Master Onion's Rap Showdown\"><i>PaRappa the Rapper</i> contest entry</a>, where he foolishly chose to dance, he seemed to get tired very easily from dancing for a mere 30 seconds and even stopped recording to take a break (evidenced by the abrupt change of position). While attending <a href=\"/cwcki/Fridays_After_Five\" title=\"Fridays After Five\">Fridays After Five</a> for a while, he danced in public like a stroke victim, then sat down to rest and play some vidya outdoors. Despite this, he is capable of dancing in place for over seven minutes in <a href=\"/cwcki/WelcometoBollywood\" title=\"WelcometoBollywood\">WelcometoBollywood</a>. Whether or not he did this with the magic of jump cuts remains to be seen.\n</p><p>During the later stages of his infatuation with <a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey\" title=\"Kacey\">Kacey</a>, many of Chris's videos showed a growing obsession with his own physical power. Chris apparently believes himself to be a nigh-unstoppable testament to human might, and has made several videos dedicated to flexing and <a href=\"/cwcki/30_Push-Ups\" title=\"30 Push-Ups\">feats</a> of <a href=\"/cwcki/11042009_51_50\" title=\"11042009 51 50\">strength</a>, performing Herculean tasks such as lifting boxes of <i>Minute Maid</i> lemonade and almost doing fake push-ups. He appears to believe that he could've defeated both his rivals <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Gregg_Mays\" title=\"Gregg Mays\">Gregg Mays</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris\" title=\"Liquid Chris\">Liquid Chris</a> should've it to came to blows, and as such had challenged them to fisticuffs multiple times.\n</p><p>Of course, Chris is once again completely delusional about his own abilities. The push-ups and curls he has struggled to do on camera only serve to demonstrate exactly how hopelessly out of shape he really is. He's so fat and his muscles are so small that it's never clear whether he's actually flexing, and the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_Fighter\" title=\"CWC Fighter\">fighting</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Challenge_for_Clyde\" title=\"Challenge for Clyde\">moves</a> he's shown are laughably incompetent. Were Chris to <a href=\"/cwcki/I_Got_A_Fish\" title=\"I Got A Fish\">get his wish</a> and physically confront Gregg or Liquid, he would definitely <a href=\"/cwcki/Kick_the_Autistic\" title=\"Kick the Autistic\">have his ass handed to him</a>.\n</p><p>In the <a href=\"/cwcki/Father_Call\" title=\"Father Call\">Father Call</a> and the subsequent <a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey_and_Liquid_Call\" title=\"Kacey and Liquid Call\">Kacey and Liquid Call</a>, Chris made various claims about having taken up jogging. At one point he claimed to jog 5 miles (8 kilometers) a day, but it didn't take long for Kacey and her father to call him out on this obvious lie. The truth is clearly shown in <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu%27s_Edge\" title=\"Sonichu's Edge\">Sonichu's Edge</a>, where Chris runs only a fraction of a mile and had to take six breaks to catch his breath, whereas a person in decent health would take a few seconds to jog the same distance without having to stop as often as Chris did.\n</p><p>Chris's downright pathetic musculature may at least partially stem from <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotonia\" title=\"wikipedia:Hypotonia\">hypotonia</a> (lack of muscle tone), which can occur in people on the <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">autism</a> spectrum,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-7\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">[7]</a></sup> although it is clear that his poor lifestyle has only exacerbated this.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Bicycling\">Bicycling</span></h3>\n<p>Chris has owned several bicycles over the course of his life, but it is unknown if he ever rode any of them regularly. The most recent one was lost in the hoard sometime before <a href=\"/cwcki/2010\" title=\"2010\">2010</a>.

However, his propensity to lie and reports from people who have interacted with him suggest otherwise. According to <a href=\"/cwcki/Emily\" title=\"Emily\">Emily</a>, he reeked of \"rotten watermelons\"; <a href=\"/cwcki/Robert_Simmons_V\" title=\"Robert Simmons V\">Robert Simmons V</a> said that he had a variant of the homeless person stank, and field agents have said \"body odor masked with gallons of Axe\". In fact, it might be that Chris regards <a href=\"/cwcki/Axe\" title=\"Axe\">Axe</a> as a substitute for a shower.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-17\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">[17]</a></sup> Rosechu seems to confirm this belief, as upon being told of Sonichu's Axe usage she makes an awful attempt at suggestive wordplay, suggesting both that using Axe makes Sonichu clean enough for sex and that cheap deodorant has an aphrodisiac effect on Rosechu.\n</p><p>It would appear that Chris compounds this hygiene problem by frequently going for days without changing his clothes; perusal of his videos has shown him wearing the same shirt for several days in a row.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-18\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">[18]</a></sup> It may be that Chris just gets into \"nice\" clothing to make his videos and as such doesn't get them dirty, allowing for him to use the same ones repeatedly, although this hygienic habit would be at odds with everything else he does.\n</p><p>The condition of his epidermal system is so poor that it's visibly noticeable, even in his <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_cameras\" title=\"Chris and cameras\">low quality videos</a>. The texture of grease that is probably permanently adhered to his skin creates a disgusting sheen that reflects a significant amount of light. The same goes for his <a href=\"/cwcki/Hair\" title=\"Hair\">hair</a>, which is in such poor condition that when he allowed it to grow for the <a href=\"/cwcki/Tomgirl_Pictures\" title=\"Tomgirl Pictures\">Tomgirl Pictures</a>, many strands were clumped together in greasy, sticky locks, looking akin to the long beard of a homeless man. And even when washed, it looks exactly as greasy and unkempt as it did before, as seen in the <a href=\"/cwcki/HairDifference\" title=\"HairDifference\">HairDifference</a> videos. This neglect will only make his hair fall out even faster than it already was.\n</p><p>This lack of cleanliness, combined with the state of his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris%27s_Room\" title=\"Chris's Room\">room</a> where he spends almost all his time, means that Chris and his surroundings must smell absolutely <i>disgusting</i>. Chris evidently simply tolerates the horrible odors, perhaps not noticing them anymore. It may be that he has an abnormally weak or insensitive sense of smell or has gone nose-blind; few other things would allow for such living conditions.\n</p><p>Despite his irregular (at best) use of the shower, Chris is reportedly an enthusiastic consumer of hand sanitizer. <a href=\"/cwcki/Daniel_Mimms\" title=\"Daniel Mimms\">Mimms</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Lucas\" title=\"Lucas\">Lucas</a> recalled that he would scrub his hands with germ-killing jellied alcohol after every post-card-game handshake at <a href=\"/cwcki/The_GAMe_PLACe\" title=\"The GAMe PLACe\">The GAMe PLACe</a> (doubtlessly offending his victorious opponents) and photographs of Chris at <a href=\"/cwcki/Fridays_After_Five\" title=\"Fridays After Five\">Fridays After Five</a> suggest that he kept a bottle on hand at all times. Additionally, Mimms and Lucas said in their <a href=\"/cwcki/Mimms_and_Lucas_Q%26A\" title=\"Mimms and Lucas Q&amp;A\">Q&amp;A session</a> that Chris didn't have any noticeable BO during his time at the GAMe PLACe, suggesting that his odor problems would only worsen from that time onward. <a href=\"/cwcki/BlueSpike\" title=\"BlueSpike\">BlueSpike</a> also mentions Chris's usage of hand sanitizer throughout <a href=\"/cwcki/Julie_Reveals_Herself\" title=\"Julie Reveals Herself\">Julie Reveals Herself</a>.\n</p><p>A 2020 tweet suggested that Chris wears the <a href=\"/cwcki/Medallions\" title=\"Medallions\">Sonichu medallion</a> in the shower.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-19\"><a href=\"#cite_note-19\">[19]</a></sup> <a href=\"/cwcki/CHRIS!!!_CHANDLER!!!\" title=\"CHRIS!!!

The medallion has also grown more and more filthy and discolored due to contact with hot water.\n</p><p>Chris stated in a <a href=\"/cwcki/November_2021\" title=\"November 2021\">November 2021</a> that he was highly encouraged to shower daily with Bob Barker or Irish Spring soap, a towel, and shampoo, while in jail, bringing hope that Chris's hygiene improved drastically at the time. Chris claimed that he was \"VERY clean\".<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-20\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">[20]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Vision\">Vision</span></h2>\n<p>As evidenced by his oversized, <a href=\"/cwcki/Pedo-Glasses\" title=\"Pedo-Glasses\">aviator-like glasses</a>, Chris has a vision problem. Judging by pictures of Chris in his youth, it appears that he began wearing glasses around the time he entered high school. The extent of his eyesight problems is anybody's guess. His glasses are often fogged and <a href=\"/cwcki/DIRTY,_CRAPPED_BRIEFS\" title=\"DIRTY, CRAPPED BRIEFS\">dirty</a>, thus simultaneously improving and worsening his sight along different feature dimensions. Chris often takes them off when things are <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress\" title=\"Stress\">\"getting serious\"</a>, but keeps them on to <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_English\" title=\"Chris and English\">read</a>. This is evident in the video in which he <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Captain%27s_Log,_Stardate_February_10th,_2009\" title=\"Captain's Log, Stardate February 10th, 2009\">reads a letter from Nintendo</a>, and in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler%27s_FUTURE_MESSAGE\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler's FUTURE MESSAGE\">\"FUTURE MESSAGE\"</a> video.\n</p><p>Chris may also suffer from <a href=\"/cwcki/Facial_blindness\" title=\"Facial blindness\">facial blindness</a>. This may exacerbate some of his current health issues, because there are indications that he legitimately cannot see the way his unhealthy lifestyle has affected his appearance, thus removing an incentive to change.\n</p><p>One of Chris's half-brothers, Dr. David Alan Chandler, happens to be an eye doctor whom Chris has seen in the past. The last time Chris was known to have seen him for an appointment was 6 January 2004. \n</p><p>Chris's driver's license has a restrictive condition checked, which commonly means that the driver must wear glasses in order to legally drive. Whether his vision contributed to the <a href=\"/cwcki/Son-Chu#Car_trouble\" title=\"Son-Chu\">numerous vehicular incidents</a> he has been involved in has yet to be seen. However, it is a good bet that Chris should be wearing glasses while driving, for the sake of those sharing the road with him.\n</p><p>In his <a href=\"/cwcki/CLog_10042017_-_Q%26A_NO_MORE\" title=\"CLog 10042017 - Q&amp;A NO MORE\">CLog 10042017 - Q&amp;A NO MORE</a> video, Chris's left eye is drooping noticeably, which may imply either an early sign of a stroke or substance abuse. Both of these are plausible due to his <a href=\"/cwcki/Obesity\" title=\"Obesity\">obesity</a> and poor nutrition for the former, and his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Oestrogel_application_and_Vibrating_Bra,_How_To.\" title=\"Oestrogel application and Vibrating Bra, How To.\">abuse of a black-market drug</a> for the latter.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Hearing_and_speech\">Hearing and speech</span></h2>\n<p><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Speech_impediment\" title=\"Speech impediment\">Speech impediment</a></i>\n</p><p>Little is known about the current state of Chris's hearing, but the <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism_papers\" title=\"Autism papers\">Autism papers</a> said he suffered from high-frequency hearing loss in early childhood. Chris has also exhibited signs of tone-deafness; his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Music\" title=\"Music\">musical</a> performances show little semblance of melody at all. \n</p><p>Chris is known for his <a href=\"/cwcki/Speech_impediment\" title=\"Speech impediment\">unusual way of talking</a>, which goes beyond just having a Southern accent. He mixes up, clutters, and substitutes sounds regularly. He also often talks quickly and slurs his words, and when he doesn't, his voice takes on a staccato rhythm. His voice itself is a very severe deformity, ranging in pitch from normal to the sound of a three-year old girl on helium all the way to <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Gottfried\" title=\"wikipedia:Gilbert Gottfried\">Gilbert Gottfried</a>. It has been medically proven that one of the effects of <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">autism</a> is a lack of variation in speech such as tone, pitch and accent. It can also work backwards, which could explain Chris's far from normal voice: autistics often have difficulty distinguishing voice tone. \n</p><p>In his <a href=\"/cwcki/Song_of_Christian\" title=\"Song of Christian\">Song of Christian</a> video, his voice sounds almost entirely normal and even deeper than later years, except for the occasional times where he recalls <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Conker_characters#Conker_the_Squirrel\" title=\"wikipedia:List of Conker characters\">Conker</a> of <i><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conker%27s_Bad_Fur_Day\" title=\"wikipedia:Conker's Bad Fur Day\">Conker's Bad Fur Day</a></i>. However, this voice deformity most likely comes from the fact he has little to no human interaction; such isolation has been proven to change a person's perception of pitch, especially if they're autistic. Chances are likely this has become permanent for Chris, given his decades of isolation.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Dental_health\">Dental health</span></h2>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Fangs\" title=\"Fangs\">Fangs</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:252px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:ChrisCavities.JPG\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"187\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/7/7f/ChrisCavities.JPG/250px-ChrisCavities.JPG\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/7/7f/ChrisCavities.JPG/375px-ChrisCavities.JPG 1.5x, /w/images/7/7f/ChrisCavities.JPG 2x\" width=\"250\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:ChrisCavities.JPG\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>He's not even afraid to show the gaping cavities at the back of his mouth.

Knowing this, Chris should have realized he was at a far higher chance of inheriting cardiac disorders and related risk factors. Thanks to his poor decisions regarding his own health, he has made an already bad situation worse.\n</p><p>In August 2013, Chris indicated that the <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_stress\" title=\"Chris and stress\">stress</a> he's endured has begun to affect his health, citing a symptom of high blood pressure. In 2016, he implied that he has hypertension;<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-25\"><a href=\"#cite_note-25\">[25]</a></sup> this was later confirmed in August 2017, when he stated that he takes prescription medicine for it.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-26\"><a href=\"#cite_note-26\">[26]</a></sup>\n</p><p>In September 2017, Chris discussed his new method for growing larger breasts, which involves flavoring his food with soy sauce. As an example, he posted a picture of <a href=\"/cwcki/McDonald%27s\" title=\"McDonald's\">McDonald's</a> fries doused in soy sauce.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-27\"><a href=\"#cite_note-27\">[27]</a></sup> It is evident that he has conflated soy-based foods with soy sauce, thinking the latter would be a good way to boost estrogen levels. In reality, the phytoestrogens found in soy products do not bind to the body's estradiol receptors, and thus will have no effect on his manboobs. Conversely, soy sauce is loaded with sodium, and said sodium is actually making him fatter due to weight gain and fluid retention, as well as inflicting further damage to his heart, which is already straining under the effects of hypertension. Although drinking water does help offset the effects of sodium-laden foods, Chris is too busy slurping on Coca-Cola to ever consider adding that to his daily food regime, although he has been drinking more water recently, due to his belief that putting a crystal in his water bottle will give him magical powers.\n</p><p>In <a href=\"/cwcki/January_2019\" title=\"January 2019\">January 2019</a>, Chris uploaded the results of a blood sugar and blood pressure screening.

Due to Chris being generally <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">incompetent</a> it is unclear whether these were heart palpitations or genuine blood pressure spikes. Either explanation is a reasonable possibility given the medical information he previously provided. Chris also revealed he was on <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_drugs\" title=\"Chris and drugs\">4 prescription medicines</a>, any of which may cause symptoms that Chris could mistake for a blood pressure spike.\n</p><p>Thirteen days after his complaints of blood pressure spikes, Chris messages The Place complaining of dimensional disturbances \"jarring heart rate to high numbers\". At the request of <a href=\"/cwcki/Kyle\" title=\"Kyle\">Kyle</a> Chris states that the heart rate spikes have caused \"brief disable and paralysis\". It's revealed by Chris' that his heart rate read higher than 93bpm at one point during this episode<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-33\"><a href=\"#cite_note-33\">[33]</a></sup>. Surprisingly Chris actually saw a doctor about this ailment 4 days after his messages to The Place, receiving an EKG scan and a standard checkup.

Because <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">autism</a> isn't nearly enough to explain the full spectrum of his abject psyche, many observers have tried to pin down Chris for a variety of mental illnesses ranging from sociopathy (minus the increase in charisma) to narcissism (ditto), to schizophrenia (signs include his disorganized speech and writing, loss of contact with <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">reality</a>, and paranoid ideas about being the victim of persecution or \"conspiracies\" – such as his delusional belief that <a href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Schroeder\" title=\"Megan Schroeder\">Megan Schroeder</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Michael_Snyder\" title=\"Michael Snyder\">Michael Snyder</a> were somehow responsible for him getting banned from <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Walmart\" title=\"Walmart\">Walmart</a>). \n</p><p>The one mental failing that debilitates Chris most is his rigid refusal to adapt to his environment. This stubbornness, more than anything else, is what makes him so frustrating to watch – he is incapable of advancing mentally beyond the mind of a ten-year-old with some <i><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy\" title=\"wikipedia:Playboy\">Playboy</a></i> magazines stuffed under his mattress. Whatever mental problems he may have are only exacerbated by this stubborn inability to mature or even alter his tactics. For well over a decade, he has been led on by various <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">trolls</a> pretending to be <a href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart\" title=\"Sweetheart\">young white women</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">who are interested in a relationship with him</a>, and yet he continually falls for it. It is Chris's refusal to listen or learn that ensures that he will continue to live in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Naive\" title=\"Naive\">ignorance</a>, isolation and misery, and until he decides to change, it always will, irrespective of whether his trolls stay interested in him.\n</p><p>It was once thought possible that Chris didn't feel like his life had truly begun, that he was still in the \"pre-adult\" years – because he remained a <a href=\"/cwcki/Virgin_with_rage\" title=\"Virgin with rage\">virgin</a> into his early 30s, and judging by his <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">oversimplified, black-and-white view of the world</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/The_Adventures_of_The_American_Rabbit\" title=\"The Adventures of The American Rabbit\">tainted</a> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Video_games\" title=\"Video games\">by</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">fiction</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_television\" title=\"Chris and television\">and</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_brand_loyalty\" title=\"Chris and brand loyalty\">media messages</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Women%27s_rights\" title=\"Women's rights\">treatment of women</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_sex\" title=\"Chris and sex\">stunted understanding of sexual relationships</a>, because he saw sex not as a biological or recreational function, or an expression of love, but rather as a rite of passage, of sorts, and he therefore believed that he wasn't able to truly be an adult until he had sex. Chris later would <a href=\"/cwcki/Mia_Hamm\" title=\"Mia Hamm\">lose his virginity for real</a>, albeit to a hooker; as of yet, he has made few to no changes that will tangibly improve his life. In fact, he has been plunging himself and his mother even further into <a href=\"/cwcki/Debt\" title=\"Debt\">debt</a> to buy toys, of all things, as well as a new car. Needless to say, no one expects Chris and Barb to be able to afford to keep the car for long.\n</p><p>Since Chris has been pampered and sheltered from basically all forms of outside influence, he lacks experience with the real world. His reaction to the real world can best be seen in his reactions to trolls; instead of dealing with them in a constructive way (taking their advice) or even a neutral way (either ignoring them or getting off the internet), he will freak out, yell at things, blame his autism or the trolls themselves for his shortcomings, and maybe crush a <a href=\"/cwcki/Sex_toys\" title=\"Sex toys\">dildo</a> or his <a href=\"/cwcki/PSEye\" title=\"PSEye\">camera</a>.\n</p><p>He also has a peculiar notion that he is slim, broad-shouldered and tan, and that he has a full head of <a href=\"/cwcki/Hair\" title=\"Hair\">hair</a> and is generally not creepy. This image comes from two things:\n</p>\n<ul><li>His mother would always <a href=\"/cwcki/Barbara_Chandler#Pampering_of_Chris\" title=\"Barbara Chandler\">tell him how \"handsome\" he was</a>. This might simply be <a href=\"/cwcki/Barbara_Chandler\" title=\"Barbara Chandler\">Barbara</a> telling her son what all mothers tell their kids.</li>\n<li>He has an inability to recognize people's faces, a medical condition formally known as <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosopagnosia\" title=\"wikipedia:Prosopagnosia\">Wikipedia:Prosopagnosia</a> and informally known as <a href=\"/cwcki/Facial_blindness\" title=\"Facial blindness\">facial blindness</a>. For example, during the <a href=\"/cwcki/Blanca_Weiss\" title=\"Blanca Weiss\">Blanca</a> incidents, trolls used pictures of two different girls to represent Blanca and he never suspected a thing; he thinks that he and <a href=\"/cwcki/BILLY_MAYS\" title=\"BILLY MAYS\">BILLY MAYS</a> would have looked the same if BILLY shaved off his beard. In <a href=\"/cwcki/Manchester_High_School\" title=\"Manchester High School\">high school</a>, he had to remember his own appearance by staring in the mirror, leaving his more youthful image of himself branded in his mind.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-34\"><a href=\"#cite_note-34\">[34]</a></sup> The fact that the only distinguishing features of his cartoon characters are hair and eye color also point to this, although this may just be Chris being a <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_art\" title=\"Chris and art\">shitty artist</a>.</li></ul>\n<p>Some people think that, far from being mentally ill, Chris is just misguided and simply needs to be steered in the right direction. <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/White_knight\" title=\"White knight\">However...</a>\n</p><p>In the July 2012 <a href=\"/cwcki/This_is_how_the_Trial_went\" title=\"This is how the Trial went\">arraignment</a> for his and Barbara's actions at the GAMe PLACe <a href=\"/cwcki/28_October_2011\" title=\"28 October 2011\">the previous fall</a>, Chris agreed to a plea bargain, avoiding felony charges and jail time in exchange for, among other things, \"mandatory psychological treatment and evaluation,\" which meant that Chris was forced to undergo legitimate psychiatric treatment (as opposed to simply seeing <a href=\"/cwcki/Rocky_Shoemaker\" title=\"Rocky Shoemaker\">an un-certified pastoral \"counselor\"</a>), or risk being imprisoned. Given that most, if not all of the problems described above persist in some form or another to this day, it seems that Chris reacted to psychiatric treatment in much the same way he reacted to the education system, as it seems that, whatever his psychiatrist said, he took none of it in, probably taking out his <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">anger at being forced to obey the law</a> on the psychiatrist by simply refusing to co-operate.\n</p><p>Chris began listening to <a href=\"/cwcki/Subliminal_Frequency_Hypnosis\" title=\"Subliminal Frequency Hypnosis\">Subliminal Frequency Hypnosis</a> videos on YouTube in 2016.

Piercings require constant disinfection while they heal, anywhere on the body, even for very clean people, and so many trolls were concerned that considering Chris's general filthiness and the fact that the location of the piercing would receive very little air, there was a serious risk of infection. In December, he shared another picture of this piercing which showed that, while it wasn't infected, the piercing had begun to reject (<i>tearing the skin</i> in the process). Making lemonade out of lemons, Chris (now in the throes of his transwoman fantasy) noted with pride the tear's semblance to a <a href=\"/cwcki/China\" title=\"China\">vagina</a> and actually got it re-pierced, without giving the original wound any longer than about a week to heal. Fortunately, Chris gave up on it after it became clear that the piercing was going to be more hassle than it was worth, and removed it for good before any serious harm was done.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Self-inflicted_taint_wound\">Self-inflicted taint wound</span></h3>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Self-inflicted_taint_wound\" title=\"Self-inflicted taint wound\">Self-inflicted taint wound</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>In <a href=\"/cwcki/July_2016\" title=\"July 2016\">July 2016</a>, Chris posted about a wound on his taint, announcing that he had gotten it as a result of <a href=\"/cwcki/Subliminal_Frequency_Hypnosis\" title=\"Subliminal Frequency Hypnosis\">Subliminal Frequency Hypnosis</a> and would be growing new labia as a result.

Then I awoke at 3AM, and after one set of short excretions (#1) sitting on the john, I found a bit of blood in the water.\n<p>I called for the doctor appointment at about 9:00AM.
