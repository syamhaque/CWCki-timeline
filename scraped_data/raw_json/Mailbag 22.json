I call him Swastichu. I'm currently in the process of making a comic book starring him and I've already had negotiations with Marvel Comics about publication.

If <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Megan\" title=\"Megan\">Megan</a> has constantly spoken to you in the past that she does not need a boyfriend due to some factors involved, then why do insist that she still wants you? If she wanted you, she would've rabbled the masses to make you win some insignificant contest, went with you to that video game con, and had sex with you so she could birth your <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Daughter\" title=\"Daughter\">daughter</a>. How else do you explain why she and <a href=\"/cwcki/John%27s_Custom_Gundam:_Sisterly_Rescue\" title=\"John's Custom Gundam: Sisterly Rescue\">John</a> moved out of state? Could it be that she was playing a joke with you all along; that John was indeed her boyfriend?\n</p><p>2. How could you think that anybody could be fooled into thinking that a more dapper teenager with a brown polo is you?\n</p><p>3. Do you really think <a href=\"/cwcki/Tiffany_Gowen\" title=\"Tiffany Gowen\">Tiffany</a>, with this influx of information coming in, would really dance with you at the high school reunion? I think otherwise; she has seen what you have become since you left <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Manchester\" title=\"Manchester\">Manchester</a> to be taken care of by two uncaring parents who live off of pension. She will see you as the <a href=\"/cwcki/Semen\" title=\"Semen\">semen</a>-drinking future rapist. There's no point in dancing with you; it's dancing with death.\n</p><p>4. Why do you assume that your voice is better than Frank Sinatra's? I have heard your albums and Frank's Wee Small Hours LP on different occasions - your voice is tone-deaf and it grates the ears while Frank's is smooth, dapper, and quite exquisite for a man in his mid-40s. And why do you rate your art higher than that of established artists? I can really see you boasting that \"<a href=\"/cwcki/A_Sonichu_and_Rosechu_Christmas_Story\" title=\"A Sonichu and Rosechu Christmas Story\">A Sonichu Christmas</a>\" is loads more better than Brave New World or anything by James Joyce; it's inevitable. You can't understand anything as complex as alienation or societal outcasting; you feed yourself on simple allegories and Goosebumps. If you wanted to really read, go on and read goddamn Ulysses or Slaughterhouse-Five. Maybe it'll get to you somehow that you're destined for bigger failure and you can't stop now.\n</p><p>5. Do you think Woody Allen teachers great \"dating advice?\" I mean; look at it! The guy appears to be a genius trapped in a pervert's body: he married his own \"daughter.\" He supposedly touched one of Mia Farrow's naked children. He makes the same film over and over: a neurotic man goes to analysis, dates a girl, and fucks her while making sardonic comments about society. I like some of his films; he's different compared to that of watching Gone with the Wind ad nauseum. However, that does not help the fact that he's not a good moral teacher; if anything, that makes him less of the influential comedian he was and more of the unfunny Jew he's becoming.\n</p><p>6. Will you ever listen to Slint's Spiderland and appreciate something other than 1970s pop or boy bands? Even the most \"indiefuck\" of indie rock is better than boy bands or mediocre pop from struggling alt-rock artists! Well, I don't think you'd get it; even its normal time signatures are a foreign language to your common time brain. You wouldn't get the literary references or the messages behind the whining; you're too dosed on outright love songs that you'd have a hard time trying to get the story behind a man riding a roller coaster with a fortune teller. You're too childish to be a true furry or an indiefuck.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Autism_Mailbag\">Autism Mailbag</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Chris.27s_mental_block_in_full_effect\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris's_mental_block_in_full_effect\">Chris's mental block in full effect</span></h3>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #B48246; padding:5px; background-color:#FCC\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>From: Gary Finch &lt;garyfinch@live.com&gt;\n<p>Hey-o, Gary Finch again.
