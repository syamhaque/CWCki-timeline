I didn't know how bad until the second outing, and now months later I'm angry that I didn't do anything about it. There's just so much insanity in dealing with Chris that you sort of lose the ability to react any further.\n<p>The second outing nearly didn't happen because of a bunch of personal, car, and logistics issues on everyone's part. Barb had to go deal with the insurance/rental people because the insurance wasn't going to pay anymore rent for them because, I guess, they expected the Chandler house to have been rebuilt by then. It was almost eleven months by that point, after all. So Barb was away from home and Chris called me saying he couldn't leave the house without his mom there. He suggested I come 'hang out' at the rental, but no way was that happening.\n</p><p>When I asked why he couldn't leave, he explained the dogs couldn't be left alone. Why? Well, Barb and Chris have never, ever, EVER left then home alone. Ever. If errands need to be run, then someone has to stay home with the dogs or the dogs have to come with them and wait in the car. Chris claimed they would \"destroy the house\", tearing up furniture and chewing everything and peeing and crapping and basically all the bad things dogs are capable of doing. He said it like this was totally normal, that all dogs must do this since his dogs do it. I told him that that's what bored/frustrated/understimulated animals do, but he brushed it off. I was stunned, but also trying to salvage the meetup.\n</p><p>Chris said he'd wait til Barb was home, but after he found out it could be a few hours until she got back, he came up with this stellar plan: he was going to load those dogs into his car and leave them there while we bowled and had dinner! Dey like da cawr, mmm! I desperately tried to dissuade him from this, and when Al and I stopped for gas, I got the Virginia SPCA phone number and resolved to call them and anonymously report if Chris had those poor animals in his car. (I'd slip away to the ladies', but for all I know Chris would have followed me since girls always go in pairs, teeheehee!) Barb turned up last minute and so we never got to see the SPCA Saga.\n</p><p>Now I'm wishing it had happened. But when you deal with Chris, there's so much crazy going on that you basically run out of reactions. I wish I had done something.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Gal_Pals\">Gal Pals</span></h2>\n<p>18 March 2015<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup>\n</p><p>In response to a user's comment, \"...... - and if it's true about him 'paying' for Chris' gal-pals...\":\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #edf2ce; border:1px dotted #4b5320; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>According to Catie, Barb confirmed that Bob paid the gal pals.

I used Mimms, because I thought Chris would consider him a sort of spokesperson for the trolls (and therefore credible). Once again, I had \"Mimms\" say the things that Rebeckah couldn't.

There have been entire personals created for sweethearts and friends that interact with Chris, and outside of two or three people, his \"friends\" have all been trolls.\n</p><p>There was, after all, fake correspondence from \"the gal pals\" that makes me skeptical of their emails, without screenshots.\n</p><p>So were you friends with high school members on Facebook (or whatever site, I'm just assuming Facebook) to see this and email them?

I essentially paraphrased what the real Tiffany said, but I used much more frank, sometimes harsh, language to get the message across. (The gal pals are genuinely nice people which is another reason why I didn't want to get them involved in any of this.)\n<p>The whole point of this, as I've said before, was to convince Chris to stop obsessing over his high school glory days, make a clean break with his past, and get on with his life (which, ironically he seems to have done now as he's more interested in going out to Impulse, etc.) I don't remember the last time he mentioned high school, the reunion, or the gal pals. Of course, it's too early to tell just yet if Chris has actually moved on.\n</p><p>Rebeckah was simply the \"voice of reason\" who served as a kind of \"buffer\" between Chris and the [fake] gal pals. While Chris was more inclined to be on the defensive around the gal pals, he was more reasonable with Rebeckah (which was the intent).\n</p><p>There was also one other factor that motivated me to try and get Chris to give up his obsession with the gal pals. Someone had given Chris Tiffany Gowen's work address and he was actually planning on showing up to \"surprise her\". Tiffany was aware of this and, as you can imagine, she wasn't too happy about it. (I don't know if she every spoke to her employer to tell them to be on the lookout for Chris or otherwise warn her if he showed up because we never finished that conversation.)\n</p>\n<center><ul
