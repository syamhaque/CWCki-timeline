Chris describes her as having a \"<a href=\"/cwcki/China\" title=\"China\">fun</a>\", \"<a href=\"/cwcki/China\" title=\"China\">caring</a>\", \"<a href=\"/cwcki/China\" title=\"China\">kind</a>\" personality, since Chris believes all women consist of nothing but these attributes (<a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">bar one</a>). Chris never referred to her as intelligent or smart, despite her being a student of both biological and medical sciences.\n</p><p>Chris tried to lure Kacey to <a href=\"/cwcki/14_Branchland_Court\" title=\"14 Branchland Court\">his house</a> under the false pretense that he was actually Liquid Chris, which consisted of numerous extremely poor impersonations of Liquid which Kacey had to pretend to be fooled by. They had a long series of <a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey_calls\" title=\"Kacey calls\">phone conversations</a> before she cut ties with him due to <a href=\"/cwcki/Father_Call\" title=\"Father Call\">her father</a>'s disapproval.\n</p><p>Kacey has a rather polarizing reception among Christorians. On one hand, many found her high-maintenance and needy attitude quite annoying, and her tactics and phrasing bordering on gaslighting. On the other hand, she seemed to genuinely care about Chris and wanted him to improve his lifestyle and be a healthier person, and frequently told Chris advice that he <i>needed</i> to hear (which nevertheless ended up falling on deaf ears). Regardless of the tactics she used, most of the events that caused her to eventually drop Chris are entirely blamable on his own actions.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Background\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Background</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Contact_with_Chris\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Contact with Chris</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Kacey_Date_Log\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Kacey Date Log</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#The_Love_Quest\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The Love Quest</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#The_End_of_Kacey\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The End of Kacey</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Kacey_Q&amp;A\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Kacey Q&amp;A</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Background\">Background</span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Kacey.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"225\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/2/2e/Kacey.jpg/300px-Kacey.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/2/2e/Kacey.jpg 1.5x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Kacey.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>What Chris probably thought Kacey looked like.</div></div></div>\n<p>While the Liquid Chris scenario played out, Chris became resentful that Liquid could not only steal his identity, but that he have a girlfriend while he couldn't, so he conspired to steal her away in a series of devious phone calls in which he pretended to be Liquid, memorably trying to seduce her by telling her he would put his <a href=\"/cwcki/Duck\" title=\"Duck\">penis</a> in between her breasts and cum all over her. He also planned to follow this act by licking his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Comeuppance\" title=\"Comeuppance\">comeuppance</a> off of her and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Recycling\" title=\"Recycling\">recycling</a> it with her. Uncomfortable and vaguely homoerotic fantasies aside, Kacey pretended to be fooled by his impersonation for a time until she \"realized\" it was really CWC for the sake of playing along with her boyfriend's trolling games.\n</p><p>The impersonation episode was a revealing insight into Chris's mind. Having accused Liquid of being an impostor, he then becomes an impostor himself in a desperate attempt to seduce Liquid's girlfriend. As one would expect, Chris did an absolutely terrible impersonation of Liquid (even though he was impersonating someone impersonating himself) and indeed was such a dunce that not only did Kacey frequently have to correct his impersonation (while pretending to be fooled by it) but Chris <i>continued to believe she was fooled by him while she was correcting him</i>. As if Chris couldn't get any stupider, Kacey herself often understandably forgot to pretend to be fooled by his piss-poor impersonation, and Chris still didn't suspect a <i>thing</i>. His by-proxy narcissism also reared its head numerous times, and he ended up defending \"Solid\" Chris's <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_fashion\" title=\"Chris and fashion\">clothing</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Obesity\" title=\"Obesity\">weight</a>, and even his <a href=\"/cwcki/Hair\" title=\"Hair\">haircut</a>. \n</p><p>As revealed by Chris in the video <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Greetings_to_Kaceys_folks\" title=\"Greetings to Kaceys folks\">Greetings to Kaceys folks</a>, Kacey's parents are Mr. and Mrs. D (Devoria). Kacey was the middle child of her parents, a military couple. Her father is retired military, her mother works in government affairs. She has an older brother, Kale, also military, and a younger sister, Kara, who was a freshman in college. Kacey was rumored to be attending university in Washington D.C., living nearby in an apartment with male roommates. Her family lived in the suburbs of <a href=\"/cwcki/Virginia\" title=\"Virginia\">Virginia</a>. She majored in nursing and biology.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Contact_with_Chris\">Contact with Chris</span></h2>\n<p>On 3 <a href=\"/cwcki/August_2009\" title=\"August 2009\">August 2009</a>, Chris sent Kacey <a href=\"/cwcki/For_Kacey_from_CWC\" title=\"For Kacey from CWC\">For Kacey from CWC</a> to prove that he is the real Chris.\n</p><p>On 4 August 2009, Chris created <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_-_Hand_Drawn_Original\" title=\"CWC - Hand Drawn Original\">CWC - Hand Drawn Original</a> to reveal his true, fat self.\n</p><p>Kacey claimed to have been very hurt by the fact that Chris tried to trick her into going to his house. What he was planning to do if she did show up on his door is anyone's guess. In all likelihood, he expected her to actually dump her longtime boyfriend for him once he proved he's the One, True and Honest creator of <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(character)\" title=\"Sonichu (character)\">Sonichu</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu\" title=\"Rosechu\">Rosechu</a>. That, or he'd put on a brown shirt and paper medallion and hope she never noticed the difference while he <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Recycling\" title=\"Recycling\">ate</a> his own <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Navy\" title=\"Navy\">navy</a> off of her.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Kacey_Date_Log\">Kacey Date Log</span></h3>\n<p>On a few occasions, both Kacey and Chris have mentioned a meeting which took place between them. Kacey seems to maintain that Chris was disrespectful and perverted during this meeting.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup>\n</p><p>An account of the meetings Kacey had with Chris was later posted.\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>As someone put two and two together, Kacey has met Chris Chan. On two occasions, and one near miss.\n<p>Also, just to answer any questions from the gitar thread, I am the one who developed an allergy rash to Chris. I'm not kidding. It kept getting worse each time and I actually went to get shots and have to use a creme now for erasing the \"scarring.\" It was on one side of my face (where I keep my phone) and along my left shoulder and both arms. It's not axe. It might be his laundry soap or something on his skin. I'm thinking it's his skin because it's where his bare hands touched me.\n</p><p>and now onto our show This is rushed short versions. Kim can help fill in details.\n</p><p>First day:\n</p><p>went to mall with <a href=\"/cwcki/Kim_Wilson\" title=\"Kim Wilson\">Kim</a>. We met, talked, and called Liquid. We planned to have Liquid not know that Kacey was there to try to be peacemaker, and he would call, find out and be angry.\n</p><p>Chris had given us the slip, so we called him and finally got him to go back to the mall. It was scary seeing him for the first time. He sweats a god awful lot and gets tired just walking. You notice the medallion right away. He comes speeding towards us. He looks me over, rape eyes my breasts, and tells me \"I thought you'd be a little more ::makes a hand motions showing a skinnier girl:: but you're gorgeous!\" and I'm like \"WTF? You think I look more what?\" And he says he thought I'd be skinnier, but I'm hot. etc we go outside to take pictures. he puts his arm around me. I sob on the inside. He shows me his eyes up close. They both look hazel. they are not different colored. so we walk to starbucks. he draws me a picture of sonichu. He shows me the medallion. He constantly brushes his knee against mine and tries to rub my side, back and shoulder. Rape eyes are constant. I send liquid a text message to call.\n</p><p>Liquid calls, I confess where I am, and Liquid starts screaming and demanding to talk to Chris. Chris grabs the phone and starts screaming in a crowded mall. People are uncomfortable, staring, and walk away. I'll let Liquid detail the call.\n</p><p>Liquid talks to me again and is a jerk. I cry and ask Kim to go to the bathroom so I can sob. Inside we call Liquid and ask him what he told Chris. I smudge my makeup and go back out. Chris is coming towards us. I act like I'm upset and crying. Chris mentions how Liquid sucks, etc. He says he has to go. He grabs me and pulls my face into his chest and he smells like horror. He repeats that now we are friends and he will help me out. HE THEN SMELLS MY HAIR AND BRUSHES HIS LIPS AGAINST MY EAR. I look onto Kim with horror. She looks at me in horror. Chris bounds away without so much as a goodbye.\n</p><p>overview: + Chris touches me. a lot. + Chris is boring and goes on and on about Sonichu and how now I'm meeting the TRUE CREATOR. + Chris repeats about his stupid eyes. Thinks he's better than Liquid because both of Liquid's eyes are green. + Chris does not approve of Liquid + CHRIS FUCKING TRIED TO KISS ME + Chris scares everyone\n</p><p>I'll let you digest this and Liquid can chime in and I'll write up the near miss meeting and part two.\n</p><p>Near miss:\n</p><p>My cousin and I went to Charlottesville to see Kim. We almost ran into Chris Chan. I saw him near the city hall with his stupid park poster. We ran away. He went in the building and we waited, but we did not see him come out. The end.\n</p><p>Second time: (note Liquid is now gone)\n</p><p>We met Chris at the mall again. There was horrible traffic so I was late and Chris left for his British Comedy. I called him and begged him back. He would FOR KACEY. He showed up. Rape eyes, told me I was pretty like a teacher he once had, rape eyes, etc. We walked around the mall. All of a sudden Chris calls out \"OOPS MY KNUCKLE TOUCHED YOUR ASS.\" there are kids around. we hush chris to shut up.\n</p><p>more rape eyes, he talks about how liquid trolled us both but now i have THE REAL DEAL TO HELP ME GET THROUGH THIS. more attempted touching and stroking of my bare arm. More boring. More Chris asking for my number, and I say I have overprotective parents who pay for it so i have to keep my restricted number and no. He keeps hinting to dating me and how pretty I am.\n</p><p>Kim gets distracted by a friend. Chris and I walk along without realizing. He asks me if I want to see his car. I of course say yes but then realize Kim isn't there. I text her. Chris calls his father and lies and says he's in traffic and will be late going home. Chris takes me to his car. It's awful. Stickers of pokemon and sonichu everywhere (there is a homemade one of his tripod site address). The bumper sticker is held up by duct tape. He tries to hold my hand while we cross the street. I glare at him and break away. He asks if I want to sit in his car, I text Kim. I say no. He insists. I sit with the door open and my legs out, ready to run. He tells me the last girl in his car besides his mom was megan. I cry. I ask to take his picture. I do. He asks to take a picture together, so I do. he tries to grope my chest and misses horribly, only grazing it. I glare and him and tell him not to do that. He insists he slipped. I say let's go find kim. He tries to grab my hand again and I shake it away.\n</p><p>He needs to rest so he sits down on a wall outside the mall. He notices my bag from Bath and Body works and asks what I bought. He smells them and one of them is called \"P.S. I love you\" and he jokes \"P.S. IM LOVING YOU!\" I laugh nervously and we find Kim. By this time Liquid asks for me to put on the phone so he can hear everything, so I do and hide the phone. I mention Chris liked the perfume I'm wearing, so he leans in and AUDIBLY MAKES A SNIFFING SOUND. I scream \"OH LOOK MAKEUP\" and run off. He asks me my fav color. I say \"teal.\" he says \"how atealing.\" I die on the inside.\n</p><p>Chris keeps trying to get close and get my number. He messes with my hair and Kim yells at him for touching me. he touches me 5 seconds later. Then he leaves eventually after more boring and rape eyes.\n</p><p>In a later call he invites me to stay the night. I say no. He says I can come over any weekend and go to his church. He doesn't know his own religion. He sucks.\n</p><p>The end.\n</p><p>Overview: + Chris touches me too much and tries to smell me + Chris is rape eyes always + Chris is a moron + Chris wants to be a sub for Liquid + Chris sweats sooooo much and wipes it off on his vest. He's gross.\n</p><p>Any questions? I may remember more later.\n</p><p>And after the first time, I couldn't stop shaking. It was weird.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Love_Quest\">The Love Quest</span></h2>\n<p>Once <a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris#The_Return_of_the_King\" title=\"Liquid Chris\">Liquid Chris returned</a>, details of the contact between Chris and Kacey began to emerge. In Chris' <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Adressing_Liquid\" title=\"Adressing Liquid\">Adressing Liquid</a> video, he suggested that Kacey had become a close \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Gal-pal\" title=\"Gal-pal\">gal-pal</a>\", and implies that he still pines for her. Chris would later officially proclaim his love for her in the creatively titled video \"<a href=\"/cwcki/I_Love_You_Kacey\" title=\"I Love You Kacey\">I Love You Kacey</a>\", where he states that Kacey and himself had been in frequent contact with each other during the period in which Liquid disappeared... which they had, except that Chris was pretending to be Liquid. And Kacey was pretending to be fooled by it.\n</p><p>In <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/10252009_For_Kacey\" title=\"10252009 For Kacey\">10252009 For Kacey</a>, Chris graduated to an official <a href=\"/cwcki/Love_Quest\" title=\"Love Quest\">Love Quest</a> in his desperate attempt to steal Kacey from her future husband. The delusion would grow further in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/For_Chris_No_2\" title=\"For Chris No 2\">For Chris No 2</a>, where Chris implies that he genuinely thinks that Kacey is leaving Liquid for him. Kacey would later state outright that she only ever considered herself and Chris as friends.\n</p><p>However, Chris being himself, he began to think that she really was in love with him (despite literally no evidence), and went so far as to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Re_to_Chris_No_2_-_SHE_IS_MINE_NOW\" title=\"Re to Chris No 2 - SHE IS MINE NOW\">make a video of him gloating to Liquid that he had won her heart.</a> Having decided to enter a \"relationship\" with Chris, Kacey uploaded audio of herself singing the female part to <i>A Whole New World</i>, a romantic duet from the popular Disney movie <i>Aladdin</i> to Youtube. The description section ambiguously sought for \"Chris\" to sing the male part in a duet with the audio; naturally, this <a href=\"/cwcki/My_Half_of_A_Whole_New_World_for_Kacey\" title=\"My Half of A Whole New World for Kacey\">culminated in a video showing the true range of Chris' Sinatra-esque tones</a>. This cemented their status as \"boyfriend\" and \"girl feigning romantic interest for the amusement of thousands of people online\".\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_End_of_Kacey\">The End of Kacey</span></h2>\n<p>Chris and Kacey's harlequin romance continued for a while afterward, until Chris got into an <a href=\"/cwcki/Father_Call\" title=\"Father Call\">argument with Kacey's father</a> after attempting to prove his worthiness as a man. In the process, Kacey saw how utterly messed up he was, mentally and physically, and returned to Liquid's waiting arms. Chris' chances were utterly dashed after she got a hold of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_Special_4\" title=\"Sonichu Special 4\">his comic to her</a> and learned that he was willing to go and <i>shoot</i> Liquid Chris. Horrified, Kacey scorned Chris for his actions in <a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey_and_Liquid_Call\" title=\"Kacey and Liquid Call\">a final phone call to him</a>, never to speak to him again. Chris would later upload <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/CWC_is_sad\" title=\"CWC is sad\">a video where his solemnity was clear</a>. This abyssal depression lasted for about a day.\n</p><p>With the release of <a href=\"/cwcki/The_End_For_Real_(Kacey_call)\" title=\"The End For Real (Kacey call)\">the <i>actual</i> final phone call between Kacey and Chris,</a> Kacey reveals just how well she knows Chris, predicting that he'll have forgotten about her before long. While Chris did release the melodramatic monologue <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/CWC_is_sad\" title=\"CWC is sad\">CWC is sad</a>, in a video he made the next day <a href=\"/cwcki/Red_Letter_CWC_Certified_Day\" title=\"Red Letter CWC Certified Day\">Chris is smiling from ear to ear.</a> The very next day.
