It is fairly obvious that either the HTML classes didn't teach good web design principles, or Chris <a href=\"/cwcki/A_Week_With_Christian_Chandler\" title=\"A Week With Christian Chandler\">slept through those sections</a>.\n</p><p>The main hub of the Sonichu site was the front page. Chris dumped everything on the front page, all of the content centered. Chris also added things to the page in random places with little thought as to where they would go, and didn't really have the time and energy to update the page. In its later incarnations, the page had mentions of <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Animal_Crossing\" title=\"Animal Crossing\">Animal Crossing</a></i> material, Chris's changes to the comic, and had \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_copyright\" title=\"Chris and copyright\">Copyright</a> CWC and <a href=\"/cwcki/Nintendo\" title=\"Nintendo\">Nintendo</a>\", long after the end of the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Miyamoto_Saga\" title=\"Miyamoto Saga\">Miyamoto Saga</a>.\n</p><p>Chris's site also boasted that it was a member of the \"Super <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonic\" title=\"Sonic\">Sonic</a> Webring\"; closer inspection reveals that Chris's site is not listed as a member of the webring, and Chris failed to insert the correct codes (i.e., he failed to put in his member ID, leaving \"_SITE_ID_HERE_\" in the links) – this simple failure to follow very simple setup instructions may have been why he was not approved as a member, as Webring owners usually checked this. His Fastcounter link is also broken. In its earliest incarnations Chris had a MIDI playing in the background, just to get that old Web 1.0 feel.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Sonichu-Fans_.282008.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sonichu-Fans_(2008)\">Sonichu-Fans (2008)</span></h3>\n<p><b>Sonichu-Fans</b> was a small sub-site of Sonichu.net, created by <a href=\"/cwcki/PandaHalo\" title=\"PandaHalo\">PandaHalo</a>, and meant for use by Chris's <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Fans\" title=\"Fans\">fans</a>.

And upon the unity in business between <b>Nintendo</b>, the company who provided me with my second gaming system, the Game Boy, after my very first <b>Commodore 64</b> computer, <b>SEGA</b>, the company who introduced <b>Sonic the Hedgehog</b> as not only my Life-Long Hero, after the American Rabbit, but as the True Role Model Icon I am proud to have learned some of my attitudes and beliefs from since 1991, and myself, <b>Christian Weston Chandler</b>, we will make Sonichu and Rosechu and their world being more Real than I was able to make them by myself with pen and markers in hand, and a vasly-knowledgeable imagination.\n</p><p>You won't be able to truly say you've \"Caught Them All\", until you've caught the Original Sonichu and Rosechu in a CWC Approved Nintendo/Sega Pok'emon Lightning Version on GBA and DS to catch a great share of the other currently avilable <b>Four Hundred and Ninty-Three</b> Pok'emon.\n</p><p>Think you know the ins and outs of Sonichu and Rosechu, wait until Season Two of the Comic Book Series, likely to start within the year 2009. I will withdraw myself from being as intrusive in the series as I have been so far; I've been selfish, and I'm tired of drawing myself so much. See how I take my leave of Cwcville in the Season Finale, to hopefully be uploaded and on the Sonichu Site 4th Quarter, 2008 or 1st Quarter, 2009.\n</p><p>And because I've been hogging the spotlight, you don't know Sonichu and Rosechu as you properly should. In the first CWC Approved Release of the \"Sonichu's Adventure\" video game, with Nintendo and SEGA's help, on Nintendo Wii (although it was intended originally for Gamecube), with compatibility with the Wii Classic Controler as well as Gamecube Contoller, with rumble functionality hopefully. Sonichu is more than Lightning and Lightning-Speed, and Rosechu is more than delightful Bolts and Heart-Felt for Sonichu. Play on, as they rescue each other from the darkest evil that has manifested itself within some recycled nuts and bolts on the moon. And what a storyline it will have, based mostly from the comics with the duo and the Chaotic Combo as well.\n</p><p>And I HAVE the idea for the Video Game for myself, if I can swing that with SEGA as well, an epic tale of my tragic Adult Life straight from my tortured heart and soul. I will bring the pain to the Jerkops, I will kick Mary Lee Walsh into her cauldron to burn, as well as the other villians. And I will have support from my Electric-Hedgehogs, my mother and father, my Closest Gal-Pals who I've grown to love; <b>Megan Schroeder</b> and <b>Anna McLerran</b> to name a couple, sparingly in the game. And I will square-off in the TRULY SELF-EPIC Battle between me, and my Dark Half. I plan to have THIS GAME ALONE go Multi-Console between Nintendo Wii, Playstation 2 and Playstation 3 (with downloadable content).\n</p><p><b>And All This CAN come to Fruition... with YOUR HELP!</b>\n</p><p>The populace of Sonichu, Rosechu and Christian Chandler fans. All I ask for in minimum, is to contact Nintendo of America AND SEGA of America by way of POSTING in their respective FORUMS, sending them E-Mails, and, HIGHLY Recommended, Hand-Written Letters to BOTH Companies, that You Want Sonichu, and that they should get in touch with me, Christian Weston Chandler, via Telephone or Snail-Mail, or In Person.

As the site was launched back when it was not yet a crime to violate aesthetics and common sense in web design, Chris's page blended right in.

He then says, \"Tripod was weak, in security, and it lacked the support for Flash media, anyway.\" In truth, Chris's site was hacked entirely due to his weak passwords and sloppy security practices. For example, in security questions, he has put in answers that could be looked up from the web; everyone knows his <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Poppins\" title=\"Mary Poppins\">favorite film</a>.

Just hit me with your best shot. I'm pretty much perfect. I was captain of the football team, and starter on my basketball team.

I also get <a href=\"/cwcki/Honor_roll\" title=\"Honor roll\">straight A's</a>,] and have a banging hot girlfriend (She just blew me; Shit was SO cash). You are a faggot who should just kill himself.

Since the end of 2010, the domain has been owned by another parked domain business. It has seen a brief resurgence in 2012 as a redirect to a <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler\">christian</a> book shop's website.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"http:.2F.2Fwww.spergweb.com.2FSonichuOnline_.28November_2014.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"http://www.spergweb.com/SonichuOnline_(November_2014)\">http://www.spergweb.com/SonichuOnline (November 2014)</span></h3>\n<p>On 20 <a href=\"/cwcki/November_2014\" title=\"November 2014\">November 2014</a>, Chris's Facebook <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/White_knight\" title=\"White knight\">white knight</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Kenneth_Erwin_Engelhardt\" title=\"Kenneth Erwin Engelhardt\">Kenneth Engelhart</a> created the first Sonichu website in five years, so that Chris would have a place where he could dump his <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_Boom_Protests\" title=\"Sonic Boom Protests\">blue arm ramblings</a>. While this motive may at first seem in line with those of Chris's trolls – encouraging Chris to produce new content is a unanimous goal – Kengle's reasoning was more unusual. A man in his 50s who still lived with his parents, Kengle's primary goal in life was to befriend Chris by giving him a safe space to vent his tard-rage. From the start, the site was barely functional and drenched in the amateurish 90s HTML stylings that only two unemployed adult autists could achieve. At least one page was made, Chris's partial biography, directly copied from his <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris%27s_Wikipedia_profile\" title=\"Chris's Wikipedia profile\">Wikipedia profile</a>. Links suggested that the site would eventually contain Sonichu character profiles, the comics themselves, and other classic Chris content. Note that although the site was officially meant to be about Sonichu, Ken's priority was the vanity page about Chris himself.\n</p><p>The site also contained a forum with very strict moderation. Some users from <a href=\"/cwcki/Kiwi_Farms\" title=\"Kiwi Farms\">Kiwi Farms</a> made accounts so they could dick around, but the site collapsed before they could have their accounts verified. Presumably, Ken intended to coerce Chris into posting, but of course this never happened.\n</p><p>The page received DDoS attacks from <a href=\"/cwcki/Weens\" title=\"Weens\">weens</a> almost immediately after its creation, and only displayed 404 errors for a while. Ken had inexplicably hosted the site on the domain \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Asperger_syndrome\" title=\"Asperger syndrome\">spergweb</a>.com.\" It is not clear why Ken chose this domain to host a site for Chris, a guy known for being a notorious Asperger hater, but this stupid decision resulted in Chris expressing a general distrust of the site. One of Chris's white knights at the ass-patting <a href=\"/cwcki/Keep_Sonic_Original\" title=\"Keep Sonic Original\">Keep Sonic Original</a> festival assured him that the site was being \"redesigned\".\n</p><p>The website is now shut down permanently. Kengle confirmed this on his Facebook, claiming that he has \"other things going on in life\", what with his stamp collecting and all. It's more likely that Kengle saw Chris's complaint about the site as some kind of threat to their potential friendship and immediately nuked the site, so as not to offend Great Director Chandler. This makes Spergweb the shortest-lived website Chris has ever technically owned, lasting a mere ten days.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Gallery\">Gallery</span></h2>\n<center><ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\">\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\"><div style=\"width: 155px\">\n<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><div style=\"margin:40.5px auto;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:163-cwcsonstecrdver2.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"69\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/2/28/163-cwcsonstecrdver2.jpg/120px-163-cwcsonstecrdver2.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/2/28/163-cwcsonstecrdver2.jpg/180px-163-cwcsonstecrdver2.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/2/28/163-cwcsonstecrdver2.jpg/240px-163-cwcsonstecrdver2.jpg 2x\" width=\"120\"/></a></div></div>\n<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n<p>Banner\n</p>\n</div>\n</div></li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\"><div style=\"width: 155px\">\n<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><div style=\"margin:19.5px auto;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:193-soniclgo.jpg\"><img alt=\"193-soniclgo.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"111\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/1/13/193-soniclgo.jpg/120px-193-soniclgo.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/1/13/193-soniclgo.jpg/180px-193-soniclgo.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/1/13/193-soniclgo.jpg/240px-193-soniclgo.jpg 2x\" width=\"120\"/></a></div></div>\n<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n</div>\n</div></li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\"><div style=\"width: 155px\">\n<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><div style=\"margin:19.5px auto;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:194-SchuSteLgoIdea2.jpg\"><img alt=\"194-SchuSteLgoIdea2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"111\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/d/d1/194-SchuSteLgoIdea2.jpg/120px-194-SchuSteLgoIdea2.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/d/d1/194-SchuSteLgoIdea2.jpg/180px-194-SchuSteLgoIdea2.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/d/d1/194-SchuSteLgoIdea2.jpg/240px-194-SchuSteLgoIdea2.jpg 2x\" width=\"120\"/></a></div></div>\n<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n</div>\n</div></li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\"><div style=\"width: 155px\">\n<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><div style=\"margin:15px auto;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:195-SchuSteLgoIdea3.jpg\"><img alt=\"195-SchuSteLgoIdea3.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"120\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/8/8c/195-SchuSteLgoIdea3.jpg/95px-195-SchuSteLgoIdea3.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/8/8c/195-SchuSteLgoIdea3.jpg/143px-195-SchuSteLgoIdea3.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/8/8c/195-SchuSteLgoIdea3.jpg/191px-195-SchuSteLgoIdea3.jpg 2x\" width=\"95\"/></a></div></div>\n<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n</div>\n</div></li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\"><div style=\"width: 155px\">\n<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><div style=\"margin:25px auto;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:196-Schulgo.jpg\"><img alt=\"196-Schulgo.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"100\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/c/c1/196-Schulgo.jpg/120px-196-Schulgo.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/c/c1/196-Schulgo.jpg/180px-196-Schulgo.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/c/c1/196-Schulgo.jpg/240px-196-Schulgo.jpg 2x\" width=\"120\"/></a></div></div>\n<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n</div>\n</div></li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\"><div style=\"width: 155px\">\n<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><div style=\"margin:40.5px auto;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:197-cwcsonstecrd.jpg\"><img alt=\"197-cwcsonstecrd.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"69\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/e/e9/197-cwcsonstecrd.jpg/120px-197-cwcsonstecrd.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/e/e9/197-cwcsonstecrd.jpg/180px-197-cwcsonstecrd.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/e/e9/197-cwcsonstecrd.jpg/240px-197-cwcsonstecrd.jpg 2x\" width=\"120\"/></a></div></div>\n<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n</div>\n</div></li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\"><div style=\"width: 155px\">\n<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><div style=\"margin:49.5px auto;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:198-cwctop50.jpg\"><img alt=\"198-cwctop50.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"51\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/2/27/198-cwctop50.jpg/120px-198-cwctop50.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/2/27/198-cwctop50.jpg/180px-198-cwctop50.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/2/27/198-cwctop50.jpg/240px-198-cwctop50.jpg 2x\" width=\"120\"/></a></div></div>\n<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n</div>\n</div></li>\n</ul></center>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_the_Internet\" title=\"Chris and the Internet\">Chris and the Internet</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia\" title=\"CWCipedia\">CWCipedia</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/The_OFFICIAL_Sonichu_%26_Rosechu_Blog\" title=\"The OFFICIAL Sonichu &amp;
