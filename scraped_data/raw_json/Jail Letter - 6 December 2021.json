  "html_content": "<div class=\"mw-body-content mw-content-ltr\" dir=\"ltr\" id=\"mw-content-text\" lang=\"en\"><div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p>On 6 December 2021, Chris had sent a <b>sixth letter</b> to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Kenneth_Engelhardt\" title=\"Kenneth Engelhardt\">Kenneth Engelhardt</a> of the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Onion_Farms\" title=\"Onion Farms\">Onion Farms</a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup> Like with the previous letter directed to him, the exact contents of the letter were previously not disclosed. However, unlike with the previous letter, Kenneth eventually did share all of the contents of the letter two days later. Kenneth Englehart published this confidential part of a letter written to him by Chris on the 7th of August 2022. Kenneth published this letter in response to Chris’s attitude towards Barbara expressed in jail letter received by him in the summer of 2022. From the way the letter is written Chris appears to be roleplaying as one of his characters.\n</p><p>Chris starts the letter off with a series of \"prophecies\", each more peculiar than the last. One of these prophecies makes mention of the \"Toxic Minority\". Unlike previous letters that bring this up, Chris elaborates what this entails in a little more detail. He believes that a chosen set of people will be physically disappearing off of Earth after the Collective Shift, and reappearing on the resulting Earth that is created in the dimension 1C-211987, to which the rest, the minority, would burn on the C-197 Earth during its destruction. Chris also makes mention of the date 12/02/2021 being a very \"cosmical\" event, as the date can be written as \"1202201\", a palindrome. Chris then follows this with a brief set of answers to questions that Kenneth had asked him, ranging from things like how he meditates to the quality of the food served at the jail.\n</p><p>The latter half of the letter then has Chris giving his current opinions on <a href=\"/cwcki/Null\" title=\"Null\">Null</a>, along with how he saw his $150 extortion from Barb, both of which Kenneth had decided to share online, despite Chris insisting not to. Chris, claiming that he had 'foreknown and sensed everything about him' when they first met, states again that Null is in fact Judas, even questioning if Null is a better kisser than Judas. By leaking the bank transfer from Barb's account before his arrest, Chris claims that Null had failed his divine test. Likewise, Chris states that Null had sensed his aura and of being Jesus Christ reincarnated. As a result of this supposed betrayal, Chris decides to \"leak\" information about Null (such as his secret identity and his moving to Serbia) in the letter, despite the information Chris tried to leak about Null being information that most have already known about him.\n</p><p>Chris also states that he had paid back $150 to Barb's account on August 1st after extorting her money, along with the remaining $600 last month, presumably with the money sent to him by weens. Chris also proceeds to go off on Null for refunding the money from his GoFundMe, claiming that he had recorded personalized video messages and had drawn 60-plus drawings, therefore earning the money. Chris also failed to put into account that the money wasn't for him to waste, but for his trip to <a href=\"/cwcki/Everfree_Northwest\" title=\"Everfree Northwest\">Everfree Northwest</a>.\n</p><p>Chris concludes the letter by then asking for Kengle's phone number so that they can stay in touch, and recounting what their prior interactions were like since Chris being sent to jail, revealing that many of the letters that Kenneth had sent to Chris made mentions of Islam and Muhammed. \n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Description_of_Letter\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Description of Letter</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Chris's_Response\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris's Response</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Original_scans\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Original scans</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Notes\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Notes</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Description_of_Letter\">Description of Letter</span></h2>\n<p>Kenneth had described the contents of the letter in an Onion Farms thread titled \"Preview of 12/11/21 Letter: CWC Opens Up About Joshua Moon\":\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #d0b6c8; border:1px dotted #BFB1A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Buckle up Onions.\n<p>Claims Joshua regrets his fucked up life.

When we first started talking with Moon, even before the first text communication from him, we had foreknown and sensed Everything about him. We had sensed insecure and unconfident vibrations, as well as some Demon liniages, from him. That last part was confirmed by looking him in the eyes in his photograph. We did not see him as any father figure, but more as an ally we've goetically called and summoned to aid us during those events. We have given him respect in the similar way we did with Judas back in Jerusalem, and with caution, as well as very good guidance from our Love, Magi-Chan. On that, with How Moon FAILED his Test by leaking the bank transfer of that money from Barbara's account (PAID Back $150 on August 1, and Finally the remaining $600 over a Month ago) in an Ultimate act of Betrayl that begs the question: Who was the better Kisser: Judas or Moon? AND the confirmed Fact that Moon took back that $1,000 out of the $5,000 from the Go-Fund ME he had sent that weekend late July, and <u>Refunded</u> the lot of the Money, despite the FACT I have Recorded those personalized Videos and drew those 60-Plus Drawings and Pieces, Having <u>Earned</u> Well Over 3/4 of that Money that could have been sent to Barbara in confirming Light of these Foreknown-to-Me-Events.\n<dl><dd><dl><dd>Dratsab Gniyarteb,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[note 1]</a></sup>        →</dd></dl></dd></dl>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>But, yeah, also, Moon Is Paranoid; He is truly scared of the Demons and Devils from Hell Realm that he works with and holds a massive amount of regrets and sins within him. Moreover, rather he verbally, or in writing, admits it or not, but he has Known and Sensed my Aura and being Jesus Christ reincarnated. The reason he plays Athiest, is because he has sensed and known this sub and unconsciously, and he does not understand and Fears addressing us, or telling Anyone Else, about it and his Knowledge and experiences, past, in Universe 1C-211987.\n<p>And to answer your question from what is recorded in the Akashic Records: Moon had moved from Pensacola, Florida to Serbia, because of better business opportunites, to get away from those that remind him of his greater Regrets in Florida and the States, and other Legal charges against him as well. His former life in Pensacola was not among the better lifestyles. He’s essentially Hiding and not really wishing to return to the states, even though he feigns intentions to in his statements, Moon has not directly mention or tell us of his personal and daily life. But it is revealed that he is playing “Secret Identity” there, he is presently trying to, and is, maintaining a relationship with someone in Serbia, and essentially living life like he goes daily to a Starbucks at least once or twice a day.\n</p><p>What we have spoken of Joshua C. “NULL” Moon in this letter on the front and back of this sheet of paper does not go online or public, stays only between you, us, Christine, Magi-Chan, the Psychics, and the Akashic Records. And should you say anything online, you may state honestly your information source was the Akashic Records.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>④ To end this letter for now, I request your phone number, please, so we may call and talk with you that way as well.\n<p>Go forth with further Peace, Clarity, Blessings, and Enlightenment.\n</p>\n<dl><dd>Be Safe and Well.\n<dl><dd>Mrs. Jesus Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu,</dd>\n<dd>The Goddess Blue Heart, Avatar, and Lord,</dd>\n<dd>Messiah, Savior, and God of all.</dd></dl></dd></dl>\n<p>PostScript:\n</p><p>We have read and appreciated the information on Muhammad, But please, let’s tone it down on that being huge chunks of the letters.
