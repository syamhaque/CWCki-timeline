Jackie continues to carp at Chris about not getting a job and relying on <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Rocky\" title=\"Rocky\">Rocky</a> to do everything for him. Chris feels insecure about his failure to land a job and doesn't want to talk about it. He claims that Rocky is trying to help him find public assistance housing, but the details are beyond his understanding. What Chris has no trouble understanding is a <a href=\"/cwcki/Tomboys_And_Tomgirls_of_Virginia\" title=\"Tomboys And Tomgirls of Virginia\">forum</a> he's just discovered that pertains to his new <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tomgirl\" title=\"Tomgirl\">tomgirl</a> identity.

That's odd, you lie to your parents and take advantage of them a hell of a lot, but whatevs.\n</p><p>What about <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Rocky\" title=\"Rocky\">Rocky</a>'s words was confusing to you? Since you have that photographic memory, you should just repeat what she told you to me, and I can help you sort through it and understand it better. Just write it out in your next email.\n</p><p>Anyway, since you don't really feel like talking about real issues like your job search, I'm kind of at a loss for what to talk about. I find my mind drawing a blank right now about movies like <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannibal_Holocaust\" title=\"wikipedia:Cannibal Holocaust\">Cannibal Holocaust</a> for reasons I don't really know.

Especially after I've suggested you tell me more about yourself AND your family. Plus we can discuss other current events. Job hunting IS an important topic; I have failed time and again at getting one; I feel uncomfortable talking about things I obviously suck bad at.\n</p><p>Photographic Memory goes with VISUAL Memory; details discussed in conversation, UNWRITTEN, is AUDIO Memory, which is soo different. But I did shorthand some of those details of the thing Rocky informed me about. It has to do with the Intellectual &amp; Developmental Combination Plan to be put into Legal Action in July, 2012. We'll be working with someone who works for the State who has authority to paper development. \n</p><p>Department of Mental Disabilitiyes &amp; Region can only get Waiver for assistance for stay @ home &amp; no institute and get $ for job hunt and \nsuch.

It's impossible to say that you suck at it because you don't even bother trying. You applied at two whole places nearly a year ago and haven't gotten up off your ass once to try again since. You sit on your hands and try to explain away your lack of trying to others with lies about how \"employers will google me and find the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Cwcki\" title=\"Cwcki\">cwcki</a>\", even though you know perfectly well that's not how background checks work.\n</p><p>I'm starting to get a picture of what Rocky's help is going to do for you, with a government-assisted job search program, but I don't really understand why it matters to you looking for a job now. I mean, <a href=\"/cwcki/July_2012\" title=\"July 2012\">July 2012</a> is over a year away, and if you actually put time into looking now you could get a job long before then. You're surviving comfortably on your <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tugboat\" title=\"Tugboat\">tugboat</a> right now, why do you need even MORE free money to do something you should be doing in the first place? How will getting more welfare help you get a job any easier? Just go get a job now. Go look. Go apply. Go DO something.\n</p><p>Answer me one question honestly Chris: Do you, in all seriousness, actually WANT to get a job and move out on your own? If so, what are you doing to achieve it? Waiting for Rocky to do it all isn't doing anything. Are you sure you wouldn't just rather let other people take care of you while you use their money to buy video games and cosmetics for the rest of your life? Because that's not what I'm interested in. I'm not interested in being your caretaker.\n</p><p>Jackie\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #B48246; padding:5px; background-color:#FCC\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>May 24, 2011 2:46pm\n<p>Chris, where have you been?\n</p><p>I'm so exhausted right now.

No biggie.\n</p><p>Well since you aren't going to be pursuing a job or moving out, I'm glad at least you have started a hobby in taking pictures for your church. I bet it feels really good to just get out and get some variety like that! I know you've been having trouble getting along with your parents lately, so I think just spending some time out of the house and throwing yourself into some activity will be good for all of you. And you made some new friends? That's awesome!! I know how shy you can be so I'm glad you're meeting new people to hang out with. Tell me about them! What are their names? What are they like, what kind of things do they do?\n</p><p>As for my parents, well, I can give you the rundown. <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fresh_Prince_of_Bel-Air\" title=\"wikipedia:The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\">My father's from Philadelphia, born and raised</a>, on the playground is where he spent most of his days. Then one day he decided he wanted to be an engineer, so he found some good schools and started applying around here. He got accepted to Virginia Tech and his mom got stoked, she said \"you're packing your bags and moving to Roanoke\". And that's how he came to be in Virginia.\n</p><p><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Connor_(Terminator)\" title=\"wikipedia:Sarah Connor (Terminator)\">My mother</a>'s story is a bit different from my father's, and a bit more interesting. She comes from Los Angeles originally, way out in California. She never went to college after high school initially, she spent her early 20's as a waitress in a little diner. Actually, a really freaky thing happened to her when she was young: There was this crazy guy who came along and tried to murder her after she got off work one night. The guy almost succeeded too, except that a good samaritan saved her life and got her away from the attacker. The guy pursued both of them for days, I think he actually shot up a bunch of cops while doing so, killing a few of them. Eventually the murderer killed my mother's protector, but she managed to kill him in self-defense by trapping him in some big crushing press (they were in a factory at the time, I think the murderer worked there or something, I don't know how they all wound up there). But before her protector died, the two of them shared a night of intimacy, during which my half-brother was conceived.\n</p><p>A few years after that, my father and some of his college friends went to L.A. on spring break, and they were doing body shots in the club where my mother happened to have taken a job. My father slipped that lime into my mother's mouth and their eyes met, and both knew it was meant to be. Soon after my father graduated and my mother moved out to Virginia to be with him, and they got married. I was born a few years later. I'm still to this day not allowed to ask my mother directly about what happened with the murderer all those years ago (It's a very traumatic subject for her), but my father has told me some things that she told him: Apparently, the guy was absolutely crazy, when he came at her he was ranting about her needing to die or else his race was going to die in the apocalypse in the future, I guess he thought she was like the anti-christ or something. I don't know what race he was talking about, my dad said he looked like some eastern european.\n</p><p>Anyway, as for my half-brother: He was like 8 years older than me and we never had a very strong relationship. He was kind of a bad seed, always getting into trouble when he was a teenager, he smoked all the time, stole money, did vandalism, other petty crimes. He actually caused a lot of fights for our family. A little before he turned 18, he ran away and said he didn't want to come back, and he refuses to talk to any of us now. Last I heard he moved back to Los Angeles, but I think he's just kind of living off the grid, semi-homeless. I don't know if he has a job or not. It's really sad because I think he had some mental illness or instability, he always got so angry and impulsive and was really paranoid about stuff. Sometimes I think about him and hope he's doing okay but he's really not a part of any of our lives anymore.\n</p><p>Well anyway, tell me about this Tomgirl forum you found! Have you gotten involved there? Are your new friends tomgirls/tomboys from there too? I bet you can make more new friends on there. I'll take a look at the forum a little later but let me know how it goes for you! Get really involved! I'm so glad that you're getting out there and being active like that. It's going to be really good for you in the long run.\n</p><p>Oh, and I'm not exactly sure when I'll be free to hang out, I'm sorry, my schedule is just slammed at the moment. It seems like I don't get a free moment to just step back and rest even these days. I've got to rearrange some things so I have more energy and time to do stuff.

My mother has had her share of pursuing attackers as well; thank God and Jesus for her safety as well. She remembers her episodes better than I; among which I can \nrecall, she did have trouble with someone who came in and robbed her family's house during her childhood. Also, she got something broken \nafter being tackled by a football player while she was a cheerleader in High School. And she twisted her ankle doing <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twist_(dance)\" title=\"wikipedia:Twist (dance)\">the Twist</a> at a dance.\n</p><p>Your half-brother and mine, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Cole\" title=\"Cole\">Cole</a>, share very similar stories. Cole was born with hip problems, and later one school day some other kid shoved \nhim into the side of a bus, hurting his head badly. He was not raised by his birth father, but by our mother and a step father who is one of \nmy mom's exes. Cole (to him, regretfullest), gave our mom away at her wedding to my father. After then, he's left her to seek his carrer and \nfortune and whatnot. I met him during our one trip to California where he was attending college. The last time I saw him was over half a \ndecade ago at a Weston Family Christmas Party. Now he, like yours, keeps farthest distance from me and mom in New York, living with his \ngirlfriend and Her family (possibly married by now) and working as a Movie Reviewer. Mental Illnesses And Family Cutoff; quite a common sad \nstory among a portion of the world population. I sometimes think of him and how he's doing. All I have to do is look up his most recent \n\"Cole Smithey\" video on his website.\n</p><p>For your information, I played that H.M. game for a spot of feminine influance. I have not played it since after earning one of the easiest \nPlatinum Trophies. And I am trying my hardest to refrain from having to ONLY talk about gaming. Which is why I have been encouraging talking about other things.\n</p><p>Among the new friends I've met are a few gals who work at T.G.I.Fridays; few of which also hang out at Applebees Monday nights for Kareokee. There's Jessica, Tamika and Cassie, plus I know another Jessie at the R-Ville <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Wal-Mart\" title=\"Wal-Mart\">Wal-Mart</a>, and Emily at <a href=\"/cwcki/Kaka_Makeup_Basics\" title=\"Kaka Makeup Basics\">Sephora</a> of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Fashion_Square_Mall\" title=\"Fashion Square Mall\">F.Square</a>. I've only known them a few weeks, and I know little about them. All I can say about them is that they're all good, friendly women with their own satisfied romance histories. Nothing has happened with me involved there.\n</p><p>You may check out <a href=\"/cwcki/Tomboys_And_Tomgirls_of_Virginia\" title=\"Tomboys And Tomgirls of Virginia\">the Tomboy/Tomgirl forum</a> for yourself at \nhttp://tomboytomgirls.44.forumer.com/; I've posted a few things so far on there with intention to post some more.
