Before, the artwork looked so babyish, like something you'd see on the fridge that a three year old did. I mean, seriously, Crayola markers? What were you thinking? It looked so hideous! To be honest, I didn't really like the comic at all before because I thought it looked like shit.\n</p><p>But now, the comic is really sleek and stylish. It looks so professionally done. The attention to little details is especially great. For example, I like how you drew yourself on the first page of Sonichu Revolution. With your stomach sticking out of your shirt, your receding, your mantits, and those dorky grandma glasses, you drew more realistically than you ever did before. Looks almost like you traced a photo of yourself! Good job.\n</p><p>All in all, I'm really happy for the changes you've made in Sonichu Revolution.
