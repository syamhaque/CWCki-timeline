  "html_content": "<div class=\"mw-body-content mw-content-ltr\" dir=\"ltr\" id=\"mw-content-text\" lang=\"en\"><div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p>On 30 November 2021, Chris sent <b>another letter from jail</b>, his <b>second letter</b> to Twitter fan, \"<b><a href=\"/cwcki/Eels_and_the_Egg-man\" title=\"Eels and the Egg-man\">Eels and the Egg-man</a></b>\", where he answers 12 questions received from him. The letter was posted on their Twitter on 7 December 2021.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup>\n</p><p>The letter shows that Chris has grown bitter towards <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bella\" title=\"Bella\">Bella</a>, who, to Chris, was previously a trusted companion and <a href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart\" title=\"Sweetheart\">sweetheart</a>. One of the more notable questions in this list asks about Chris's current feelings on <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Fiona\" title=\"Fiona\">Fiona</a>, a young woman who once had a genuine self-admitted crush on him, and that Chris had become infatuated in himself. In his answer to this question, he claims that Bella shall be punished on Judgement Day, and that <a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_Chris%27s_lies\" title=\"List of Chris's lies\">he foresaw her \"Nasty Plot\" against him</a>.\n</p><p>Chris also answers that he still has feelings for Fiona, claims to have attempted to contact her while \"healing\" her through astral projection, and wishes for others to contact her, regretting not having her and an unknown person’s number. Chris had also claimed in the letter that he \"foresaw\" Bella's plot, and that he had told Fiona about their relationship not lasting long, and the \"risks\" that'd come with it as a result.\n</p><p>Chris explains the Heaven Realms, where he attempts to do <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_science#Mathematics\" title=\"Chris and science\">a bunch of calculations</a>, and lists several of the resulting worls created by the <a href=\"/cwcki/Dimensional_Merge\" title=\"Dimensional Merge\">Dimensional Merge</a>. Chris also claims that these Heaven realms are roughly the same size as the city of CWCville, having visited almost every other dimension. Chris also acknowledges the existence of Hell Realms, saying they are comparatively worse than Post-Apocalyptic alternate timelines.\n</p><p>At the end of the letter, Chris explains how he is the Real Player One in detail. Chris claims that while the term was in part based on the movie of the same name, he also cites the Akashic Guardian, who is supposedly the chronicler of the <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akashic_records\" rel=\"nofollow\">Akashic Records</a>, as being the original being in the universe, preceding all other \"players\". \n</p><p>He also makes the claim that as the Messiah, he can reincarnate infinitely many times and retain memories of previous lives. Extending on this idea, he then talks about his lifE incarnated as Jesus of Nazareth, then talks about a various number of other lifetimes he had prior to his current incarnation.\n</p><p>Along with these, Eels asks Chris about various other topics, ranging from donations to his opinions on various Christubers. Particularly of note is how Chris is asked if people can donate him money or game consoles in jail, to which he confirms that monetary donations are approved. Though he also states that other kinds of donations, including the donation of video games and consoles, are prohibited. Chris also claims in the letter that the Christuber Dillin Thomas is a \"minor traitor\", likely due to him sharing info about his incestuous relationship with Barb.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Original_Letter\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Original Letter</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Chris's_Response\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris's Response</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Original_scans\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Original scans</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Original_Letter_2\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Original Letter</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Chris's_Response_2\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris's Response</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Notes\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Notes</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Original_Letter\">Original Letter</span></h2>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#F2CECE; border:1px dotted #BFA3A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Dear Chris Chan,\n<p>Thank you for your response and for answering my questions. I hope all is well with you and you\nare doing ok in spite of the circumstances. I'm to hear your case received a second\ncontinuance.  I'm glad you say Bella for what she really is, hopefully karma bites her in the ass.\nBut we had some more questions:\n</p><p>1.) Have you playing <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Basketball\" title=\"Basketball\">basketball</a> and has it been fun? We know you used to a basketball team manager in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/High_school\" title=\"High school\">high school</a>. Is it nostalgic? Is <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bionic\" title=\"Bionic\">bionic</a> the givinging [sic] you any good pointers?\n</p><p>2.) Have you considered using the library to run dungeons and dragons, vampire the masquerade or shadowrun? These are fun pen and paper rpgs. A buddy of mine was in prison for a few years and he discovered the hobby of rpgs behind bars. I know you are a creative type and good at witing stories and think you'd make a good DM (dungeonmaster) or GM (Gamemaster) there is not much to do so I figured. It's good entertainment as I imagine prison/jail is boring. I imagine it's lonely there and this could be a good way to make some friends and meet people. Not to mention there are books you could read that are likely entertainment, not as good as video games but you gotta play the hand you're dealt sometimes.\n</p><p>3.) I asked about approved items in regards to approved items to see what sorta things you can get. It sounded like (and correct me if fm wrong) the jail only takes donations. I was curious to know if you knew that there was a handheld console that can be purchased by inmates in all states, the games aren't great on it but it's something, if that was on your list of approved items and you could get us a price someone out there might have cash and able to send you a monetary sum that would allow you to buy it. I did some research and apparently it's possible to get an Xbox in certain states. Sadly not in virginia :( but I believe that handheld consoles are still available in all states.\n</p><p>4.) What's going on with Fionna are you guys done? Some recent updates still sound like she's in love with you. Have you been in contact with her? Do you plan to meet with her when you get out? Or have you severed ties with her like Bella. Her actions, although extreme, seemed to be taken to get you out of Bella's clutches. She apparently still wants to bear you a child. Maybe a conjugal visit could be arranged?\n</p><p>5.) What are you looking forward to doing the most when you get out? Any big celebratory plans when you are free? Any video games you wanna play, Transformers toys or legos you wanna play with or movies/tv shows you wanna watch?\n</p><p>6.) You mentioned you have been to other dimensions? What is heaven like? Have you been there? How does it compare to CWCville? Are there other heaven dimensions you've been too? Any hell dimensions?\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#F2CECE; border:1px dotted #BFA3A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>\n<p>7.) I wrote a letter to you many years ago about changing the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Amy_Rose\" title=\"Amy Rose\">Amy Rose</a> part of the sonichu girls into Sally Acorn. Most hardcore sonic the hedgehog fans hate and despise amy rose as they find her obnocious unlike sally acorn 17 shes bad ass and intelligent. Your roseachus are way better than Amy Rose ever was, to the point where they are too much better, they more closely resemble Salty. Is there any chance with the dimensional merge going on that that could happen and the roseachus could become acomchus or sallychu's? Maybe there is a Sallyacorchu ornewhere in cwcville or in an adjoining dimension?\n</p><p>8.) Have you been to the boondocks universe and met tom dubois? He is a lawyer and knows much about people in your situation. He might be helpful and sympathetic to your cause. Going to the Transformers afterlife, the well of all sparks and recruiting some dead wamor transformers like Ironhide or Dinobot might also be helpful so some tough guys have your back.\n</p><p>9.) Any thoughts on youtubers Dillon Thomas, Gibi and SmokeyMcCrack? They make a lot of videos on you rmre so since your arrest?\n</p><p>10.) You've mentioned your-the real player one\" what is that? Can you explain a bit more? Just curious? Does it have anything to do with hyper dimension neptunia or ready player one? Or does this have to do with the super nintendo game athe lawnmower man\"\n</p><p>11.) It seemed like there were items you wanted to go home and get before you went to jail? If you don't mind my asking what were those items?Maybe we could try and buy you some replacement items and have them ready for you when you get out\n</p><p>12.) When you are out do you plan on doing the killstream with Ethan Ralph like you had agreed to at your arrest? He seemed to realty wanna have you on his show.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span id=\"Chris.27s_Response\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris's_Response\">Chris's Response</span></h2>\n<table class=\"\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px; vertical-align:top;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:top;\">Christine Weston Chandler\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top; text-align:right;\"><code>Richmond VA 230</code>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;\">\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top; text-align:right;\"><code>2 Dec 2021</code>\n</td>\n<td style=\"font-size:60%; text-align:right; vertical-align:top;\"><code>US POSTAGE<br/>$000.53°<br/>2 Dec 2021<br/>MAILED FROM ZIP CODE 22960</code>\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14 Branchland Court<br/>Ruckersville, VA 22960-2807\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;\">\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;\">\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center;\">\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:center;\">\n</td>\n<td colspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\">\n</td>\n<td>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>①\n<p>Hey, &lt;CENSORED&gt;<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[note 1]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Rest assured, a LOT more than Karma shall bite <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bella\" title=\"Bella\">Bella</a>’s ass around Judgement Day.

I had played a bit of Basketball in the Rec Room, but the Rec Room had been restricted from me for a while now, so “I Wish” is also a response. Nostalgic, yes. <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bionic\" title=\"Bionic\">Bionic</a> has given me some tips, and playing a game with him (without flying) is fun.\n</p><p>2. The library is not large enough for D&amp;D. Yes, I like to read, and I have considered eventually becoming a DM for a group.\n</p><p>3. Money, pretty much, yeah. No video game handhelds or consoles on offer.\n</p><p>4. Okay, THIS Part you may share online in efforts to reach her on my behalf: I still care about Fiona and her future. I had foreknown of my arrest, and the circumstances that would pin her emotions, especially in regard to the “Nasty Plot” Bella would have instigated, as a major casulty has been a great concern of mine. I’ve even warned her verbally, spoiler-free, of the ship between her and I likely not lasting long and there being a risk.
