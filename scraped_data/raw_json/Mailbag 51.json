However, it is also poor in a technical sense. Characters seldom remain a consistent size, your sense of perspective is skewed, and the panels are sometimes so crowded as well as badly laid out, that it becomes hard to follow what is happening.\n</p><p>While this can be excused in the case of a young child's artwork, you are a man twenty seven years of age with aspirations of doing this professionally. Am I right in saying that you wish to be a professional comic book writer/artist? There is a difference between child-like and childish.\n</p><p>Now, with all that being said, here's my advice. Why don't you go back to college and enroll in an art course or two? You would have to cut down on buying videogames and sex related paraphernalia, but if drawing is what you plan to do with your life, why not take it seriously and try to improve? If you're truly passionate about your art, a few hundred dollars every month should not be a big sacrifice for you.\n</p><p>I am fully aware there are professional artists out there that have never taken an art course, but if you are honest with yourself, Christian, you'll notice their art is on a different level from yours.\n</p><p>I truly believe that if you learn the basics, your art would improve a hundred-fold and silence all those critics who say you cannot draw better than a third-grader. Yes, you would have to swallow your pride and admit to yourself that your art is not as good as you thought, but Christian, no one gets better without first realizing they need to get better.\n</p><p>And think of the benefits. You would actually have something to wake up for everyday. You could start showering regularly. You could start socializing again. You would even know the correct date instead of being five days off like in your <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_Update_30_January_2009\" title=\"CWC Update 30 January 2009\">last video</a> (It's January 30th, Chris, not 25th). Just don't do silly things like spreading around a newsletter or wearing a sign, and try not to make the female students uncomfortable. Get out there into the world and make something of yourself, Christian Weston Chandler, before life passes you by completely.\n</p><p>Good Luck,\nDerek\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_art\" title=\"Chris and art\">I have taken over 15 art classes</a> in my lifetime, learned perspectives and all that.
