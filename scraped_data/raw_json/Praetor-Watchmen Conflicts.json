Several members of the Watchmen, out of a combination of their own misunderstandings and paranoia, targeted and instigated conflict with the <a href=\"/cwcki/Praetor\" title=\"Praetor\">Praetor</a> group.

When Naught asks about the \"figurine people\", Chris affirms them as \"good and genuine\", and tells them that they've been helping him create a batch of medallions. He also reveals the name of the group behind the medallions as Praetor LLC.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup>\n</p><p>On 3 October, Chris mentioned to them that Praetor was helping him create a \"lore bible.\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup> There, he mentioned three parties, the Watchmen, Praetor, and <a href=\"/cwcki/Bible_Enabler_DMs\" title=\"Bible Enabler DMs\">another enabler</a>, suggested the idea to him. He started the discussion off by calling Praetor \"our new business group\", implying that Chris believed that the Watchmen were completely on board with them working with Praetor. Kyle, however, was suspicious that only Praetor was ordering him to do this, and instead suggested Chris to make a Twitter poll to gauge support for this idea, which Chris agreed to.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup> The poll received overwhelming support for the Bible's creation, with 82.1% of 6,257 voters saying yes. \n</p><p>The Lore Bible wound up to be one of the primary factors that led up to the feud between the Watchmen and Praetor, especially when Chris began to discuss more about what he intended to put in it, and connected it to Praetor.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Watchmen.27s_Paranoia\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Watchmen's_Paranoia\">Watchmen's Paranoia</span></h2>\n<p>A core clique of Watchmen members, paranoid over the prospect of others interacting with Chris, gossiped over the newly-appeared Praetor.

He interpreted the dream as a solution to breaking the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Iron_curtain\" title=\"Iron curtain\">iron curtain</a> that separated <a href=\"/cwcki/Dimensions\" title=\"Dimensions\">dimensions</a>.\n</p><p>Chris discussed this further with the Watchmen, but mostly Kyle. From this, while bringing up lore from various media and even those introduced to him by the <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys</a>, he also determines 22 or 23 October 2020 being the date to which this happens.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-disc_7-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-disc-7\">[6]</a></sup> At some point before, Chris had told Naught about two of the Praetors (Annie and Owen) connecting the dreams to the end of the world, predicted by the Mayan Calendars.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-q&amp;a_8-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-q&amp;a-8\">[7]</a></sup> When Chris talked to Kyle about this connection, he also states how it sounds \"vaguely similar\" to Mesoamerican Revivalist art, showing he somewhat doubted this connection, but played along with Chris's and the Praetor's interpretation anyway.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-disc_7-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-disc-7\">[6]</a></sup> At the end of the conversation, Chris mentions the Chaos Control date and time already being figured out, which he'd later tell Naught was figured out by the members of Praetor.\n</p><p>Chris talked about the golden disc again on 14 October 2020 with Naught.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-9\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">[8]</a></sup> There, he talks about four members from Praetor; Annie, Owen, Cabell, and Caden; and tells Naught what Caden and Owen thought that the dream meant, and also discusses his plans to go to the Goochland Library. They had also theorized a link between Chris's dream and the Mayan calendars, theorizing that the end of the Mayan Calendar had to do with \"boosted Spiritual Powers\", or the aforementioned \"Chaos Control date and time, the date being December 21, 2020. In the same post, Chris mentions the Lore Bible he was working on, likely intending to put the discussion of the dream in it, and the planned trip, which Praetor suggested could also be a part of said Bible. This made Naught suspicious about the trip, asking Chris if he was comfortable with doing the video and if it was Caden's idea, to which Chris said he was comfortable. Chris also told the Watchmen that the Praetors would come into the server to answer any of their questions about the Lore Bible, the upcoming speech, and their interpretation of the dream.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Goochland_Library_Sermon\">Goochland Library Sermon</span></h3>\n<p>The next day, the Praetor <a href=\"/cwcki/Discord\" title=\"Discord\">Discord</a> account, ran by Caden Peck, finally joined the <a href=\"/cwcki/The_Place\" title=\"The Place\">The Place</a> Discord server, and answered the Watchmen's questions, and also gave additional information about their role with Chris.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-q&amp;a_8-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-q&amp;a-8\">[7]</a></sup> Right before that, Chris mentions a hand-written script that he was working on for the trip, which would involve him making a speech with regards to the Dimensional Merge being broken as a result of the golden disc he dreamed about. \n</p><p>Naught then invites the Praetor account onto the Discord server. Naught and Kyle then immediately ask the Praetor account questions while Chris stepped away, encouraging those present to talk amongst themselves about theories surrounding the Dimensional Merge and the golden discs. They mostly asked questions about the production of the medallions, the Lore Bible, as well as Chris's relations with the group. During the conversation, Anaxis asked the group if they have a website, though they claimed not to have a website anymore, but told the group about their Twitter and Instagram and gave them their business email, which ironically made it easy for the Watchmen to dox the Praetors later on. Throughout much of the conversation, Chris occasionally gave his progress on the hand-written script.\n</p><p>Chris had finished the script on 16 October 2020, and posted the photos of it in the Place, tagging all of the members to read it.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-10\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">[9]</a></sup> Chris was recorded making a sermon at the Goochland Library the next day, and the video was then uploaded onto YouTube on 8 November 2020. Combined with Chris's discussion with Naught about the golden disc, the video caused concern amongst the Watchmen. The video also served as the first public introduction to Praetor, which left many observers and Christorians confused on who they were and what their intentions were. The Christuber <a href=\"/cwcki/GiBi\" title=\"GiBi\">GiBi</a> reached out to Naught on 12 November 2020 in an attempt to get answers, and Naught gave their accounts of their interactions. Naught posted about it in the second layer of The Place, to which MKR expressed hope that it could attract weens onto the scene.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-11\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">[10]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Etsy_Store\">Etsy Store</span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:252px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Praetor_cart.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"250\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/a/aa/Praetor_cart.jpg/250px-Praetor_cart.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/a/aa/Praetor_cart.jpg/375px-Praetor_cart.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/a/aa/Praetor_cart.jpg/500px-Praetor_cart.jpg 2x\" width=\"250\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Praetor_cart.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>The image featured in the instagram post</div></div></div>\n<p>On 15 <a href=\"/cwcki/November_2020\" title=\"November 2020\">November 2020</a>, Praetor, seemingly aware of all of the attention they're receiving from the video, posted a screenshot of an online shopping service's shopping cart to provoke a reaction from observers - in the cart was a Pikachu mask and a VIPERTEK VTS-989 560 BV stun gun.

Regardless, Chris mistakenly referred to her as such, calling her \"one of our Praetor friends\", and showed them the animation she made. This led to more suspicion about Praetor's intentions. \n</p><p>The Watchmen MKRNightVee and Kyle expressed concerns that Praetor could be tampering with the Lore Bible, and making Chris say the things he said at Goochland.

At the end of the conversation, they also joke about MKR's statements, calling them \"baseless accusations\".\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #ffe8fc; border:1px dotted #BFB1A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">MKR</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>No I was just stating a fact?\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #F2E6CE; border:1px dotted #BFB6A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">Praetor (Caden)</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Do you feel we're extorting Chris?\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #ffe8fc; border:1px dotted #BFB1A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">MKR</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Are you?\n<p>I'm the official artist\nI do a lot of work for cwc.\nAs a professional artist I know a lot on the subject.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #F2E6CE; border:1px dotted #BFB6A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">Praetor (Caden)</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>And we're pleased for it!

Naught had even given up his role as the owner of The Place, lending it over to Kyle instead and temporarily leaving the server.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-25\"><a href=\"#cite_note-25\">[note 2]</a></sup> Others, however viewed this as a sign that Chris was influenced far more by Praetor than the Watchmen, especially when Chris began to get less involved in The Place server. This only gave them more incentive to believe that Praetor had to be defeated, and that Chris had to be pulled away from their grasp. Though this imaginary battle petered out for the following months, the same can't be said about the sentiments that the Watchmen had for Praetor. It is here in these following months where the Watchmen's possessiveness towards Chris, but especially that from the \"toxic trio\", became much more apparent. The Watchmen had made several attempts to win Chris back.\n</p><p>Right after the confrontation, the Watchman KND had tried to come up with elaborate plans to dismantle the entire group to get them away from Chris.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-26\"><a href=\"#cite_note-26\">[24]</a></sup> Some of the things that he suggested included sending Chris a gal-pal to lure him away from the group with and making him afraid of <a href=\"/cwcki/COVID-19\" title=\"COVID-19\">COVID</a>. After KND, The WCT, and Kyle discuss whether or not they thought that Annie was attractive, KND came up with the idea to try and use the female Praetor members for \"info\", and Kyle suggests to the WCT to try and create fake Instagram accounts to DM them about Chris. KND had also speculated that Chris could have been invited by the Praetors into a Discord server. After Peachy tries telling the other Watchmen that she didn't have much luck reaching out to the Praetors besides Owen, she suggests DMing him instead. KND also suggests that if Caden doesn't have a separate Discord server, they could ban him from the Place, forcing him to create a new one to get a hold of all of his associates. None of these overly elaborate plans, if the Watchmen had attempted them at all, seemed to have pulled through, however.\n</p><p>Even after the fiasco that went down between the Praetors and the Watchmen, Chris had still expressed seeing <a href=\"/cwcki/MKRNightVee\" title=\"MKRNightVee\">MKRNightVee</a> of the Watchmen, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Annie_Ikenberry\" title=\"Annie Ikenberry\">Annie Ikenberry</a> of Praetor, and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bella\" title=\"Bella\">Bella</a>, who he still perceived as a Praetor, as potential sweethearts. He talked about it in a <a href=\"/cwcki/The_Place_chats_-_Lonely_Feelings\" title=\"The Place chats - Lonely Feelings\">Discord chat</a> with the Watchmen, where he tagged both MKRNightVee and the Praetor account. In that Discord chat, Chris also mentions not wishing to \"offend anyone\", or do anything they don't want to for \"sympathy\", indicating that he was worried that expressing his attraction to these people might cause more tension between the Praetors and Watchmen. He wasn't entirely wrong to think this however, as Chris had later created a <a href=\"/cwcki/Lovers_Attributes_List\" title=\"Lovers Attributes List\">list</a>, which the Watchmen misattributed to Anaxis. Chris asked MKR to review the list to see if she matches any of the list's attributes. Chris expressing his love towards MKR was one of the factors that led to them believing that Anaxis, who at the time was still believed to be a Praetor, was manipulating him.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Mkrragequit.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"197\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/d/d8/Mkrragequit.png/300px-Mkrragequit.png\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/d/d8/Mkrragequit.png/450px-Mkrragequit.png 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/d/d8/Mkrragequit.png/600px-Mkrragequit.png 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Mkrragequit.png\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>MKR ragequits.</div></div></div>\n<p>MKR further expressed contempt at the Praetor's \"winning over\" Chris in a 5 March 2021 Twitter post in a fit of jealousy.\n</p>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">You know what, I'm done.
