So, I am extending an offer: The FIRST Person who purchases and sends me one, and I receive it Before or On February 24, 2016, I Will make and issue to the person a Big Voucher for $500 off on Cwcville Shopping. Which is equal to Ten Sonichu/Rosechu family Figures (more or less, depending on which ones), so all the person needs to pay on that order is the Shipping, and that order will definitely take up to Eight weeks for material figure acquiring, creations and certification. The Console AND Camera MUST be purchased from a Store Website, such as Amazon, Best Buy or GameStop. And I will be able to tell from the printed receipt and papers enclosed with the goods there. So, definitely NO funny business.\nAs the Amazon Wish List is a definite fickle, because the list disappears as quick as I make it, I am posting recommended Links onto this post. As well as a few additional pieces for the PS4 I would like (Should they be included as well, I will add their value, as depicted on their receipt, onto the Voucher).\nPrivate Message me if you need my address, but it's pretty well-known by now.\nThank You. :)\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>Chris included a bunch of links for websites selling PS4s, including <a href=\"/cwcki/GameStop\" title=\"GameStop\">GameStop</a>, which he ended his \"embargo\" the day before. <a href=\"/cwcki/The_Eye_of_Judgment\" title=\"The Eye of Judgment\">It is not the first time that Chris stopped doing something against a company just so that he could buy new vidya game related stuff</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Arthur_Spatchcock\">Arthur Spatchcock</span></h3>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>3 February 2016\n<p><a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"https://soundcloud.com/cat-knight-430471584/part-1-christine/s-iCiQa\" rel=\"nofollow\">[1]</a>\n<a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"https://soundcloud.com/cat-knight-430471584/part-2/s-o9B33\" rel=\"nofollow\">[2]</a>\n<a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"https://soundcloud.com/cat-knight-430471584/chrisinterview2/s-avffG\" rel=\"nofollow\">[3]</a>\n<a class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"https://soundcloud.com/cat-knight-430471584/interview3/s-U64WP\" rel=\"nofollow\">[4]</a>\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Emotions\">Emotions</span></h3>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>9 February 2016\n<p>I'm feeling off and mildly dizzy.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3><span id=\"Not_Dizzy_Enough_To_Beg_For_PS4.21\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Not_Dizzy_Enough_To_Beg_For_PS4!\">Not Dizzy Enough To Beg For PS4!</span></h3>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>11 February 2016\n<p>I feel better today, and I will be making medallions today as well.

I have made a simple offer of My Time and Work to make some figures, or a combination of that and commission(s), medallion(s), book(s) and such, as offered on my shop; for a (white Destiny Bundle) PS4 Console with its camera. And Not only that, but Higher in value and retail of the console and camera combined. PLUS, to add more time and work for anything in addition to that in the same delivery. Alright? I Felt it was a fair cop, plus the person would get the better half of the deal.\nI never said \"EVERYONE, send me a console\"; ONE Person to send the One console and camera is ALL. I am NOT the U.S. Air Force that needed over a Hundred Thousand PlayStations for their Super Computer. And I never requested for More than ONE. ONE PlayStation 4, with PS4 Camera, is all I requested, and is all I need. I do not like being left behind in tech, like the rest of you all.\nAlso, WHO in this world, WITH a Modern Touch Screen Phone, at least, Never felt even tempted to spend on APPS in their respective mobile stores?\nAND, PC &amp; Console Gamers, WHO, amongst you lot have NOT spent less than a hundred dollars on your NEW computer upgrades, software and apps, EVEN into the Thousands?\nI should Not be Judged by Theoretical and Presumptuous prices of various game discs and downloads, when we ALL Know damn well they can be purchased Secondhand, and EVEN amongst them are Free to Play as a PSPlus or XBox Live Member, as well as Streamed through services like PSNow. And you all who have spent at least One Dollar on your App and Game Stores; you all are no more guilty than I am. I do not judge any of you all for spending on what you want; we each have our own wants and needs respectively.\nSo, when you look at my generous offer, Empathize and Put Yourself into My Situation: NOT Rich, Want to get back into the game, Require the New Hardware when support for the old is fading over time; what can you do? You look to trade for, Or up to, the new tech; reaching out towards other people for the help. And That is what I am doing and offering. Alright?\nThank you.

Among which, while I DID have a plan for the routine of drawing pages nearly every other week initially in between weeks of working on medallions and all that, I have been unable to get that routine successfully habitual and set. The reasons are between my Emotions and Mood; I have to be in the right mind set in order to draw and create. Between my ADD, from the bleeding autism, and the stresses of life, including finances and keeping the household above water with the sales and keeping up with the orders, plus the <a href=\"/cwcki/Lulu\" title=\"Lulu\">publisher problem last December</a> having weighed me down not helping either, not to mention my Fickle Internal Clock changing my sleep schedule from being a Day Person into a Night Person, and back and forth over and again... It gets frustrating to me. And that is why I needed the time to recover.\n<p>I am most able to create and issue the voucher most quickly, and hardly the creativity is required for that as well. AND, I Promise I Will be most able to Hold my end of the deal of what the sender of the console and camera redeems the voucher for from my shop. So, I can most definitely Promise that I Will hold my half of the deal after receiving the console and camera, and anything else added in that deal; No Problem.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Socializing\">Socializing</span></h3>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>20 February 2016\n<p>I am watching ‪#‎PawnStars‬ and ‪#‎RickHarrison‬ in the beginning of Season 9, Episode 16, state how I Really Fell about Online Social Media, that I could not have said better, and I quote,\n</p><p>\"Technology is great and everything, but I think everyone has lost all of their social skills; it Is More Socialable (and Better) talking to them Face to Face or on the phone.\"\n</p><p>And I do see that happen all around me when I am out and about; nearly Everyone is glued their bleeding faces onto their phones, tablets, and whatever; NOT really looking at other people or talking much.
