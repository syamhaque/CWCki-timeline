In the process, \"Perron\" managed to get a variety of details about the Chandlers' living conditions from her. The troll's use of that name is a reference to Chris Perron, better known as \"Chris the Hacker\", who was a then-popular target of soundboard prank calls.\n</p><p>It is revealed that there is a severe bug infestation at <a href=\"/cwcki/14_Branchland_Court\" title=\"14 Branchland Court\">Chris's home</a>, which might explain why he was \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Voicemail_greeting#6_December_2011\" title=\"Voicemail greeting\">sick</a>\". The call also reveals that when <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler\" title=\"Bob Chandler\">Bob</a> was originally hospitalized he was also placed under quarantine for \"bug bites\". Doctor Perron advises Ms. Shoemaker to convince Barb and Chris to move out of the property while the court proceedings go on and that perhaps Ms. Shoemaker could find them a temporary home within the church outreach program whilst Doctor Perron arranges a fumigation of the property.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Video\">Video</span></h2>\n<center>\n<table style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa; background-color: #f9f9f9; color: black; margin: .5em auto .5em auto; padding: 0.2em; font-size:89%; width:260px;-moz-border-radius:10px\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFFF00\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size:110%; color:#008080;-moz-border-radius:10px\"><b>Rocky Shoemaker Call</b><br/>\n</td></tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<td colspan=\"2\"><div class=\"thumb embedvideo autoResize\" style=\"width: 328px;\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo autoResize\" style=\"\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideowrap youtube\" style=\"width: 320px\"><div class=\"embedvideo-consent\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo-consent__overlay\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo-consent__message\">Click to load content</div><!--\n--></div><!--\n--></div><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" data-src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1AmJB7LDek\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"180\" loading=\"lazy\" modestbranding=\"1\" width=\"320\"></iframe></div><!--\n--></div><!--\n--></div>\n</td></tr>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#696969\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;-moz-border-radius:5px;color:#ffffff;\"><b>Stardate</b>\n</td>\n<td>8 December 2011\n</td></tr>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#696969\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;-moz-border-radius:5px;color:#ffffff;\"><b>Featuring</b>\n</td>\n<td><a href=\"/cwcki/Rocky_Shoemaker\" title=\"Rocky Shoemaker\">Rocky Shoemaker</a>\n</td></tr>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#696969\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;-moz-border-radius:5px;color:#ffffff;\"><b>Saga</b>\n</td>\n<td><span style=\"display:none\">Game_Place_saga</span><a href=\"/cwcki/The_GAMe_PLACe\" title=\"Game_Place_saga\"><img alt=\"Game_Place_saga\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"32\" src=\"/w/images/e/e3/Game_place_saga.png\" width=\"32\"/></a> <a href=\"/cwcki/The_GAMe_PLACe\" title=\"The GAMe PLACe\">The GAMe PLACe</a>\n</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n</center>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Transcript\">Transcript</span></h2>\n<p><i>(phone ringing) </i><br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Hello?<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Good afternoon, uh, is this, uh, Ms. Shoemaker?<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: I...

You've been his pastoral counselor for some time.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Yeah, but I would have to see something in writing, uh, simply because I have been getting a lot of <a href=\"/cwcki/Prank_calls\" title=\"Prank calls\">unauthorized phone calls</a>.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: From the court, or from this office?<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: From, from, from...people claiming to be part of all this.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Well, um... sorry... did you say, did you say that...<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: So...<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: ...did you say that you have received a call from this number before?

And that's just to protect Christian, um, because I've had police reports filed over the past two years around all of this, because of misuse of my phone.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Well, uh, yes, I was...I was made aware of everything that had been happening. Uh...<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Yeah.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: What if this was previous to the, uh, to <a href=\"/cwcki/28_October_2011\" title=\"28 October 2011\">the current case</a>?<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Yeah, yeah.

We were attempting to get a kind of, uh, historical perspective on everything that had been going on. But, um, It's been very difficult, uh...<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Right. That makes perfect sense and I would be very happy to help with it. But, I, I do need to have some authorization.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Well, uh, I shall be meeting with Christian in uh, in, uh, Branchland Court uh, on the...hold on a second...either the tenth or the eleventh...hold on...<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Mm-hmm.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Oh, yes, it would be the tenth. Uh, yeah, so we should be up there on the tenth. Uh, eleven o'clock in the morning? Uh, we just wanted to meet with Christian...<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Uh-huh.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: ...um, I suppose, if you wanted to, uh, to have some kind of introduction, face to face, I assume Mr. Bell will be there as well, I suppose if you want to come along to that.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: That, that, that would be fine. This is on the tenth, that is...<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: On Saturday.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: What day of the week is...pardon?<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: That would be on Saturday.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Uh, day after tomorrow.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Yes.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: At what time?<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Uh, is it, uh, ten or...hold on a second...yes, it was eleven o'clock.

I...<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: I assume...<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: I...I could do that at eleven.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: All right, I assume you know the way down there. [<i>chuckles</i>]<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Uh, this is...would be in Mr. Bell's office?<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: No, this would be in, uh... Christian's home, uh...<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Where?<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: ...Christian's home, on uh, <a href=\"/cwcki/14_Branchland_Court\" title=\"14 Branchland Court\">14 Branchland Court</a>. He, uh, well I don't know, he, uh, requested that we, uh, liaise there and, uh, Mr. Bell seems to have gone along with it. It's, uh, a little unorthodox, but uh, we wouldn't mind seeing him inside his, uh...inside his home. To get a kind of sense of everything that had been going on...from him and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Barb\" title=\"Barb\">his mother</a> as well.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Where...okay, uh...let me write down the, the address again.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: It's, uh, 14 Branchland Court. It's, uh, Christian's home address.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Oh! He is meeting you at his home?<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Yes.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Um...hm! <br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Like I said, it was a little unorthodox...<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: That, that...it, it...it not only would be unorthodox but I think you'll have a very difficult time work...getting anything done in that home...<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Well, how...<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: ...simply because...um...w-uh, because, I, of things I know about the conditions of the home. Uh...<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Well, this is...<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: That is, is not... (<i>man in background mumbling \"not okay\"</i>) it's not going to be a good place to meet.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Well, they...this is again, why...<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Um...<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Personally, I wouldn't have a problem with even, uh, seeing the address itself, to get another kind of understanding of the perspective from, uh, Christian's angle. Um...<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Mm-hmm.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: At least, at least that was, the uh, the silver cloud of the lining that I was taking away from it. Um, like I said, it is rather unorthodox, but Christian requested it. And, uh, it may be, uh...prudent, I think...<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: They...they, um, are having an infestation problem in that home.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Oh, really?<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: And, yeah. And, and, <a href=\"/cwcki/THAT_IS_MY_HOUSE\" title=\"THAT IS MY HOUSE\">the health department</a> has already visited there, and...<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Oh, my goodness.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: It...would probably not be a real wise place for you to go.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Are they still, are they still living there, or have they taken up alternate accommodation? Because, according to, uh, Mr. Bell and Christian, they were still living there...<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: No. Yeah, they are still living there.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: With an infestation, in Christian's condition?<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Mm-hmm!<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Well, that shouldn't...that shouldn't be at all.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Uh, no. No it shouldn't, and, uh, the social services and the health department have, have been a part of that.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Have you, have you spoken with social services yourself? Because we uh, we've yet to speak with them.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: I, I have not...uh, I have spoken with health department people.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Yes. I, I understood that you were sort of, um, uh, a personal assistant almost, and uh, as well as a counselor to Christian, you've accompanied him to several things before, so...<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Yes. Yes. Yes I have.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Mm.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Absolutely, and I will be very happy to, to assist in, in whatever way I can.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: I'm, I... I'm not happy to hear about this infestation problem, uh, especially with Christian the way he is. Is there, is there any chance you could, uh, sort out some kind of alternate accommodation? Do you, have that kind of services at your disposal?<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Um... certainly you could meet at the church.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: No, I meant... for actual accommodation for Christian.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Oh, uh... that... that, that has to be, has to be handled through...uh...he's, he's not requesting anything alter-alternate. And any decisions like that have to come through social services, and that has been a long history as well.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: That's-that's...that's why I was recommending...perhaps, if you had a sort of, um, a sort of church outreach program where you could offer temporary accommodation just until the trial's finished with, maybe Christian would be willing to go along with that. 'Cause, I, um... I understand that he doesn't want to move from his residence, but I also understand the infestation's a very bad thing at the moment. Especially with everything that's going on, so... we might want to recommend something that...<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Uh, well, this has been, has been, has been a situation ongoing over... many months. And, um, uh, Christian, Christian seems to feel that he has stayed away from it. Uh, but that requires him to stay just in one room...<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: The infestation.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Um... and, uh, heal-health services have, have talked with the family. Uh, so, it-it simply, uh, we have, we have always met with the family at the church or at the lawyer's, or with Christian somewhere wi-...in town. They have never wanted us to come to the house...<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: No, I can't understand...<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: And... and, uh, I-I don't think Christian would be comfortable with me coming there.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Well, he-he did request, well I, I assume he requested that you would be there as well, but he did ask me to come down there to the residence. I don't really know what that's about now, or if Mr. Bell's going to be there or not.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Yeah... uh, I, I would...<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Personally, personally...<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: I would be happy to talk with him...<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Personally, I have no problem going down there myself...<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: ... and, and see if I can... pardon?<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: I said, personally I have no problem going down there myself, I'm sure, I've seen far worse places... whatever kind of, infestations are going on. Um, but I was kind of hoping that we could have counted on your support to come along. If only, to sort of...<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Um...<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: ...to sort of handle the introductions in a personal way, with someone that Christian already knows.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Mm...yeah. Uh...let me, let me talk with Christian and see if the same thing could be done at the church.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: All right. I'll tell you what, I'll uh... I'll ask <a href=\"/cwcki/Allison_Amber\" title=\"Allison Amber\">my secretary</a> to give you a call back, and we'll try and go from there.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Okay.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: All right, should be about... in an hour or two.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Okay...<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: I've got to, uh...<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Can I have your name again, please?<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Uh, this is Dr. Perron. P-E-double R-O-N.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: ....Doctor...Perron?<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: P-Perron. P-E-double R-O-N.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Uh-huh.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Yes.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Okay, and...<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: I'm all set to give you a call back, and hopefully we can figure out what's going on before, uh, before Saturday.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Yeah, yeah, uh....let me, let me call Christian and, and see...I-I just...I would have, working on a...on a family systems and on a pastoral counseling psychological basis...<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Right.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: I-I would not think that that would be a good place to do the interview. Uh, they're going to be defensive. They're going to be trying to...<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Christian...<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: ...protect you from...<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Yes...<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: ...uh, the nurses that went out there found that a very difficult place to try to work with them.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Well, even so...<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Um...<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: It...it would make sense though, in order to just, to gain that kind of persepective and see things from Christian's angle a little more. I-I-I do understand what you're saying about trying to put it in a, uh, a neutral environment, but, uh...I'm not too sure now. I wasn't aware that it's as bad as you say it was.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: I have not been there, and I do not know...<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Oh.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: But... um, except from what the nurses have said.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Uh, which nurses were these?<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Public health... nurses.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: And how long ago was that? Was that... was that fairly recent?<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: That, that was, uh... around the time of his father's death, his father's death. They were out there because of...<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: I have no idea...<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: ...patient discharge procedures and such...<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: All that would have been about, um two or three months ago, I think. So yes, that is recent.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: And, and, he was... he was, while he was in the hospital, under <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine\" title=\"wikipedia:Quarantine\">quarantine</a> because of it.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Christian was?<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: No, Christian's father.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Oh, oh. So he, he's, he contracted something from the... from the infestation?<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: He, he had...had, bug bites all over him.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Oh, gee. Good God. Well that's...all right, uh, Miss, uh Mis-is it Miss or Mrs. Shoemaker?<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: M-M-Miss Shoemaker.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Miss Shoemaker.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Miss Shoemaker.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Um, I, I...<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: It's Reverend Shoemaker, actually.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: I'm sorry?<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: I-I said actually, I-I... officially, it's Reverend Shoemaker.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Oh, Reverend-I didn't realize. Okay, um...all right, I think the best way to proceed, if you could, um, if you could speak with your church outreach group, if you could find some kind of temporary accommodation for Christian and his mother... uh, just until the, uh, the court case is over...we can, perhaps, see if we can get the state to fund a cleanup or something in the property. Because that's quite horrendous. And I think we can do something about it. We should... so, if you could find some kind of temporary accommodation for them, uh...<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Um...<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: ...preferably within the church, because I can understand they wouldn't want to go with, uh, outside strangers... uh, I quite understand.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: I... really doubt that they would receive that offer at all. They have not, they have not received help from social services.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Well, you could understand why it would be in Christian's best interest if you could do that, because if he was to go to the court and if they were to present an assessment with, that he was living in such conditions along with his mother... then it would not fare well at all...<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Mm-hmm.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: ...and they would perhaps be completely evicted from the property. And that wouldn't be in their interests even in the least.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Yeah. Um...<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: I'm not, I'm not asking you to do this, but I-I think it would be a, uh, wise thing to do.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: I-I-I can see, I can see your point and I'll certainly talk with Mr. Bell, about...<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Yes.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: ...about whether he would rather see Christian in such a situation. Um...<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: It, it, i-i-it wouldn't be permanent, it would only have to be temporary, just until the trial is, uh, done with and we could perhaps fund a, cleanup, while they were in there, they wouldn't have to end up back for that...<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Mm-hmm.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: So, perhaps we could do that.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Mm-hmm.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Anyway, I do have to be going off, but if you could call this week with Christian, and I'll try to have somebody, uh, or possibly myself calling back in about, uh...two hours. Okay?<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: About...how many hours?<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: About, uh, two hours.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: About two hours... from now?<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Yes, uh, are you going to be there? [<i>laughs</i>] -to be up?<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Uh, yeah, yeah. I'll be up until eleven, so yes.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Okay. Yeah, I'm sorry 'bout that. Um... all right, I've got to be getting off, but thank you very much for speaking.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Shoemaker</b></font>: Okay.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: Okay, thank you. Goodbye.<br/>\n<i>(Skype hangup sound)</i><br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Doctor Perron</b></font>: [<i>drops his British accent</i>] Goddamn. [<i>sighs</i>] I was not expecting ANY of that.
