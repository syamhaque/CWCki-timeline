Either that, or it was because Chris was growing even more creepy towards her. Nonetheless, despite Chris's repeated e-mailing and touchiness, she would continue to remain nice towards him for the most part. This period ended with Chris telling Megan about his plans if he won the <a href=\"/cwcki/Chop_Chop_Master_Onion%27s_Rap_Showdown\" title=\"Chop Chop Master Onion's Rap Showdown\"><i>PaRappa the Rapper</i> contest</a> - an event that would, ultimately, end in tragedy for the both of them.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#E-mails\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">E-mails</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Chris_apologizes_for_being_a_douche\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris apologizes for being a douche</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Megan_gives_Chris_a_lesson_in_canine_anatomy\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Megan gives Chris a lesson in canine anatomy</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href='#Another_email_from_the_\"Seriously_Stop_Fucking_Touching_Me\"_collection'><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Another email from the \"Seriously Stop Fucking Touching Me\" collection</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Chris_on_Soul_Calibur,_and_a_shitty_poem\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris on <i>Soul Calibur</i>, and a shitty poem</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Megan_talks_about_her_infatuation_with_a_game_character\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Megan talks about her infatuation with a game character</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Chris_talks_about_Megan_while_she's_away\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris talks about Megan while she's away</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Chris_is_sad_about_Patti\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris is sad about Patti</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#Chris_talks_about_the_Pokemon_League_and_Megan_memories\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris talks about the Pokemon League and Megan memories</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Chris_lists_Soul_Calibur_cards_and_talks_about_the_Transformers_movie\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.9</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris lists <i>Soul Calibur</i> cards and talks about the <i>Transformers</i> movie</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#Megan_still_away,_Chris_continues_talking_about_video_games\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.10</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Megan still away, Chris continues talking about video games</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#Chris_continues_to_be_boring,_Megan_continues_to_be_away\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.11</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris continues to be boring, Megan continues to be away</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-13\"><a href='#Chris_talks_about_a_soap_opera,_has_\"gunky_ear\",_and_is_still_thinking_of_Megan'><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.12</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris talks about a soap opera, has \"gunky ear\", and is still thinking of Megan</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-14\"><a href=\"#Chris_enters_PaRappa_the_Rapper_contest\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.13</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris enters PaRappa the Rapper contest</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-15\"><a href=\"#Chris_wishes_her_a_happy_birthday,_Megan_still_in_Kentucky,_Chris_whores_himself_for_votes\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.14</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris wishes her a happy birthday, Megan still in Kentucky, Chris whores himself for votes</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-16\"><a href=\"#Chris_talks_about_trading_cards,_tells_Megan_he_wants_to_go_to_Seattle_with_her\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.15</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris talks about trading cards, tells Megan he wants to go to Seattle with her</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-17\"><a href=\"#Gallery\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Gallery</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"E-mails\">E-mails</span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris_apologizes_for_being_a_douche\">Chris apologizes for being a douche</span></h3>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF;

Cool; <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Panther\" title=\"wikipedia:Pink Panther\">Pink Panther</a> it is then.

I am sorry that I hurt your feelings; I didn't mean to, and I was not being contradicting. Also, I did not \"dismiss\" the story, I just gave it consideration, and I offered my honest and open opinion about it. I did picture your Skitty in your Metune outfit, and I can honestly say that it is a cute idea. :) I just feel that the permament (or the world-switch) transformation rubs me the wrong way... How about this, let's say your future daughter is transformed into the skitty of Team Courage, and she and her team time-travel back to aide you and me in our battles and steps towards the future (kind of a <a href=\"/cwcki/Sailor_Moon_Poster_of_Fail\" title=\"Sailor Moon Poster of Fail\">Chibi-Usa</a> situation). And this would happen after we get the seven <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_Balls\" title=\"Sonichu Balls\">Crystal Sonichu Balls</a> together, get <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sister\" title=\"Sister\">my imiginary sister</a> out of the mirror, awaken <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Darkbind\" title=\"Darkbind\">Darkbind's</a> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Princess_Zelina\" title=\"Princess Zelina\">Princess Zelina</a> and put an end to <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Mary Lee Walsh's</a> terror.

Also, Houndour and Absol... let's put Hound-Howl and Apocolypse in those shoes (with the random evolution to Pending Doom and Devolution Spray that Skitty will have). And I'm not so sure about <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charmander\" title=\"wikipedia:Charmander\">Charmander</a> on the team... could you go with a <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporeon\" title=\"wikipedia:Vaporeon\">Vaporeon</a>, and draw him/her like Hound-Howl or Apocolypse (making a better balanced type-match for the team... Normal, Water, Fire and Dark vs. Normal, Fire X2 and Dark (they would be more weak against ground or water attacks). Does that work better for you? I support your cute and fun ideas as much as possible, and I feel a little sad from having hurt your feelings...

I have one request about making a femine Houndour design. Whether or not you've noticed NONE of my original female characters have....breasts. And the reason is because they are more animalish, they have what <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Pattie\" title=\"Pattie\">Pattie</a> had, six nursing tools. I just don't believe in <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_and_Rosechu%27s_Luv_Shack\" title=\"Sonichu and Rosechu's Luv Shack\">giving animals that kind of human quality</a>. Although my girls and boys wear clothes, I give them no undergarments. When you think about it- when pets get dressed up, they don't have <a href=\"/cwcki/DIRTY,_CRAPPED_BRIEFS\" title=\"DIRTY, CRAPPED BRIEFS\">underwear</a> either.<br/>\nWith that said, to me it gives my animal characters a more purist appeal.<br/>\nAnd despite walking upright, talking, and wearing clothes, they still have animal instincts--<a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_Sex_Videos\" title=\"Chris Sex Videos\">hissing and growling</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/For_J-R%27s_Eyes_Only.MOV\" title=\"For J-R's Eyes Only.MOV\">grooming with their tongues</a>, you get the idea.\n</p><p>SO, I will give the hound version of myself eyelashes, maybe jewelry and a ribbon.

I've unlocked all the Custom Character Jobs, so everyone is at the highest role. I started your character as a Ninja, which later unlocked Assassan, which later unlocked Samurai; you are now Samurai Class. I started as a Saint (<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_ego\" title=\"Chris and ego\">because that sounded like basically who I am</a>), then I've got upgraded to Sage (no more beyond that). Also available were Thief &gt;&gt;&gt; Pirate, Barbarian &gt;&gt;&gt; Gladiator &gt;&gt;&gt; Knight, Dancer, Monk, and the topper, Swordsmaster.\n</p><p>Each Job has a specific number of compatable weapons. Like for you, as Ninja: Kunai, Katana &amp; Shuriken, Sickle (flexible), and weapons of Taki &amp; Setsuka. Then as Assassin: Wave Sword, Iron Sword, Chinese Sword, and weapons of Lizardman and Tira. And NOW as Samurai: Katana (only), Katana &amp; Shuriken, Sickle (flexible), and Weapons of Mitsurugi and Yoshimitsu. :D\n</p><p>I, as Saint, welded: Staff (Personal Weapon of Choice), Dagger, Steel Fan, and Weapons of Zasalamel and Talim. Now as Sage I get: Chinese Blade, Sword &amp; Shield, Staff, and Weapons of Sophita and Casandra.\n</p><p>The list of weapons for each job were listed from lowest level earned to highest (Lv1, Lv10, Lv20 and Lv30). And my source of information: GameInformer.com.\n</p><p>BTW, <a href=\"/cwcki/John%27s_Custom_Gundam:_Sisterly_Rescue\" title=\"John's Custom Gundam: Sisterly Rescue\">John</a> was started as Barbarian, and now is Knight. Also, there was not enough room for \"Schroder\" in the name spaces, so for both of you, it was shortened to \"Schroe\"; nothing personal.\n</p><p>Well, enough Soul 3 talk. Let me ask you something, and John may input his opinion for this question as well, Have either of you played <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauntlet_II\" title=\"wikipedia:Gauntlet II\">Gauntlet 2</a> or <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rampart_(arcade_game)\" title=\"wikipedia:Rampart (arcade game)\">Rampart</a>?

With the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixaxis\" title=\"wikipedia:Sixaxis\">Sixaxis</a>, I rotate and shake a tub with the hero Rubber Duckie, and guide it to collect the trapped smaller ducks and lead them to the Drain Exit.

In Tekken 3, one of the battlegrounds is a backstreet type place with graffiti. And an Especially large spraypainted logo \"SoulEdge\" adorns the fence behind you.\n</p><p>I'm sure you wonder....and even I wonder...why is this weirdly dressed alien such my most favorite fighter?\n</p><p>It probably started back when I had Tekken2, I was 10 or 11. Back then you had more tolerance for all the characters and I played as anybody and everybody. But there was something about <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshimitsu_(Namco)\" title=\"wikipedia:Yoshimitsu (Namco)\">Yoshimitsu</a>'s costume that \"spoke\" to me. I liked his threatning [sic] expressed mask, and his Japanese hat. I just liked the way he looked all-around. And he has a good personality. He's like a Robin Hood. He helps the poor and travels a path of righteousness. But at the same time he is obsessed with <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Video_games\" title=\"Video games\">arcades</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Internet\" title=\"Internet\">internet</a>! Moving back to helping the poor. He will lend a hand to anyone in need. But I like how he's not liberal. If he helps someone and they turn on him....he will come after them and kill them if needed.\n</p><p>So anyway, eventually as I grew older and developed more tastes I narrowed down my choice of fighters to Yoshimitsu. I feel like I have this \"bond\" when I choose him. Like Yugi and his Dark Magician. I hope this doesn't sound silly but I feel \"close\" to Yoshimitsu and he is very dear and special to me.<br/>\nI believe Tekken6 comes out this Nov. on <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PS3\" title=\"PS3\">PS3</a>. If you consider getting it for yourself, I only ask for you not to play Yoshimitsu, ONLY to unlock his movie. I feel like I can't share him with anyone else. Do I sound crazy?\n</p><p><br/>\nWell so that's it I guess.

I cried for a while, with <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Barb\" title=\"Barb\">my mom</a>, being reminded of the Burdens hardest to bear; I'm fine now. Funny side-stories, I didn't remember till just after I hit the sack, but earlier I was playing <a href=\"/cwcki/Guitar_Hero\" title=\"Guitar Hero\">Guitar Hero</a> to complete the Hard Mode. One song to go, \"<a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bark_at_the_Moon\" title=\"wikipedia:Bark at the Moon\">Bark At The Moon</a>\"; I said to myself that this one was for Patti.

Subconsiously, we were, without realizing it, being reminded of this one-year anniversary. At least now, Patti's resting in peace, and she's looking down and protecting us and our cats. Did I tell you that Patti and our elder <a href=\"/cwcki/Chandler_Cats\" title=\"Chandler Cats\">kitty</a> were really close; they would chat on and on, share food and sleep together.\n</p><p>On the bright side, I took up Gamestop's current offer of trading in 2 PS3 games to get one FREE; I got the new <a href=\"/cwcki/Transformers\" title=\"Transformers\">Transformers</a> Game after trading in <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untold_Legends:_Dark_Kingdom\" title=\"wikipedia:Untold Legends: Dark Kingdom\">Untold Legends Dark Kingdom</a> and <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armored_Core_4\" title=\"wikipedia:Armored Core 4\">Armored Core 4</a>.

I didn't get a Soul Calibur Pack this week, but I noticed that they have in stock a two-deck pack for <a href=\"/cwcki/Card_games#UFS_.28Ultimate_Fighting_System\" title=\"Card games\">Street Figher UFS</a>; <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryu_(Street_Fighter)\" title=\"wikipedia:Ryu (Street Fighter)\">Ryu</a> Vs. \"Ayku\" (wasn't sure of that name) and new <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Yu-Gi-Oh\" title=\"Yu-Gi-Oh\">Yu-Gi-Oh</a> (GX) Starter Decks featuring <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaden_Yuki\" title=\"wikipedia:Jaden Yuki\">Jaden</a> (the Holo card is Elemental Hero Necroshade) and... the boy who plays with the machanic toon vehicles (I forgot his name). Tony warned me last week that he wouldn't make it today, so I worked pretty hard.\n</p><p>I had to sign up two new members; Bridget and Perry. Bridget's deck was perfectly Psychic, so I didn't have to work on hers, but Perry's was a bit of chaos; one <a href=\"/cwcki/Yawning_Squirtle\" title=\"Yawning Squirtle\">Squirtle</a>, one <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wartortle\" title=\"wikipedia:Wartortle\">Wartortle</a>, one <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blastoise\" title=\"wikipedia:Blastoise\">Blastoise</a> EX, one <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtwig\" title=\"wikipedia:Turtwig\">Turtwig</a>, one (stage 1 for turtwig), one matching stage 2, and the same column scheme applied to <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piplup\" title=\"wikipedia:Piplup\">Plipup</a> to <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empoleon\" title=\"wikipedia:Empoleon\">Empoleon</a>, <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimchar\" title=\"wikipedia:Chimchar\">Chimchar</a> to <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infernape\" title=\"wikipedia:Infernape\">Infernape</a> and <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charmander\" title=\"wikipedia:Charmander\">Charmander</a> to <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charizard\" title=\"wikipedia:Charizard\">Charizard</a>. And he had a bunch of non-evoling basics that made it a real messed-up haymaker, and the rest was about 2 Boost Energies, one Cyclone Energy, one Multi Energy, one Rainbow Energy, one Psychic, some of the other basics (excluding Metal and Dark) totaling to 28 Energy Cards. And he had no Trainer cards. And what he had in his book was somewhat out of order. But I perservered with a mostly colorless deck for him. :) I got a few small headaches and head-quits (that's where my brain would just zone out for about a few seconds).\n</p><p>Aside from today, last week at the Playstation Store, after like a couple of months, they finally added a NEW PS1 title for download and play on <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PS3\" title=\"PS3\">PS3</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PSP_of_Fail\" title=\"PSP of Fail\">PSP</a>: <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castlevania:_Symphony_of_the_Night\" title=\"wikipedia:Castlevania: Symphony of the Night\">Castlevania - Symphony of the Night</a>. It set me back about 9.99, but I downloaded it. I have made it about half-way to fully through; I'm now playing in the inverted castle (it's upside-down...freaky).\n</p><p>Also, I have been working hard on spreading the word around locally, on <a href=\"/cwcki/MySpace\" title=\"MySpace\">MySpace</a> and on the <a href=\"/cwcki/PlayStation_Network\" title=\"PlayStation Network\">PSNetwork</a> about voting for my video on the Playstation website. I've played Motorstorm online to get a bunch of names for new acquaintances; I've rarely been able to make it at First place. But one time I did manage to make 3rd. Quite the stress-work, but it will be worth it if I win the trip to Seattle. I fantasy you and me taking the trip, having fun at the Penny Arcade Expo, maybe take a tour of the Nintendo of America company, playing <a href=\"/cwcki/Guitar_Hero\" title=\"Guitar Hero\">Guitar Hero</a> with you on my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PS3\" title=\"PS3\">PS3</a> in our hotel room, and basically just being with you, period. :) And I would give you and John the two <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PSP\" title=\"PSP\">PSPs</a> (but I would keep one of the two <a href=\"/cwcki/PaRappa_the_Rapper\" title=\"PaRappa the Rapper\">PaRappa the Rapper</a> games). But I digress...\n</p><p>I hope you and your family are doing well and good in Kentucky. I'd wish for you to come back sooner, but I can't control how soon John will be able to finish his mechanic course. I'll be happier when you are standing in front of me again, safe and sound. :)\n</p><p>That's enough from my <a href=\"/cwcki/Heart_level\" title=\"Heart level\">heart</a> (blush) for a while, my sweet friend. I'll e-mail you again soon.\n</p><p>Faithfully yours;\n</p><p>Chris Chan. &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Gallery\">Gallery</span></h2>\n<center><ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\">\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\"><div style=\"width: 155px\">\n<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><div style=\"margin:44px auto;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Megan_07-03-06.PNG\"><img alt=\"Megan 07-03-06.PNG\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"62\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/b/b3/Megan_07-03-06.PNG/120px-Megan_07-03-06.PNG\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/b/b3/Megan_07-03-06.PNG/180px-Megan_07-03-06.PNG 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/b/b3/Megan_07-03-06.PNG/240px-Megan_07-03-06.PNG 2x\" width=\"120\"/></a></div></div>\n<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n</div>\n</div></li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\"><div style=\"width: 155px\">\n<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><div style=\"margin:38px auto;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Megan_07-04-30.PNG\"><img alt=\"Megan 07-04-30.PNG\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"74\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/d/d8/Megan_07-04-30.PNG/120px-Megan_07-04-30.PNG\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/d/d8/Megan_07-04-30.PNG/180px-Megan_07-04-30.PNG 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/d/d8/Megan_07-04-30.PNG/240px-Megan_07-04-30.PNG 2x\" width=\"120\"/></a></div></div>\n<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n</div>\n</div></li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\"><div style=\"width: 155px\">\n<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><div style=\"margin:30.5px auto;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Megan_07-06-04.PNG\"><img alt=\"Megan 07-06-04.PNG\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"89\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/8/83/Megan_07-06-04.PNG/120px-Megan_07-06-04.PNG\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/8/83/Megan_07-06-04.PNG/180px-Megan_07-06-04.PNG 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/8/83/Megan_07-06-04.PNG/240px-Megan_07-06-04.PNG 2x\" width=\"120\"/></a></div></div>\n<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n</div>\n</div></li>\n</ul></center>\n<table align=\"center\" id=\"toc\" style=\"text-align:left;
