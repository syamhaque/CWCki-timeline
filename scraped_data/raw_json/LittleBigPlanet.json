Get it now.</div></div></div>\n<p>Chris is a huge fan of <i>LittleBigPlanet</i>. He participated in the beta test in the fall of <a href=\"/cwcki/2008\" title=\"2008\">2008</a> and was very annoyed that he had to take a <i>whole week-long break</i> between the beta's expiration and the official release of the retail version.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup> He was also terribly concerned about whether or not his creations from the beta would still work in the real game. When <i>LBP</i> was released, Chris disappeared from the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Internet\" title=\"Internet\">Internet</a> for the better part of two months in <a href=\"/cwcki/November_2008\" title=\"November 2008\">November</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/December_2008\" title=\"December 2008\">December 2008</a>. The game's main character, \"Sackboy\", has appeared in several ill-placed adverts throughout his comics (most prominently in the preview for <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_10\" title=\"Sonichu 10\"><i>Sonichu</i> #10</a>, which was released before the blackout). Chris has every available trophy for the game in his <a href=\"/cwcki/PlayStation_Network\" title=\"PlayStation Network\">PlayStation Network</a> trophy case, as well as every single game add-on available in the <a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_Chris%27s_PSN_game_downloads#LittleBigPlanet\" title=\"List of Chris's PSN game downloads\">PSN Store</a>.\n</p><p>The biggest reason Chris latched onto <i>LittleBigPlanet</i> was that it let him make <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(game)\" title=\"Sonichu (game)\"><i>Sonichu: The Game</i></a>; no other game in existence was sufficiently idiot-proof for the purpose. Of course, Chris still managed to make somewhat horrific levels and it took until <i>LBP 2</i> until Chris's output started to look at least somewhat plausible.\n</p><p>The title is also a widely-touted PlayStation exclusive, often cited by console-warring fanboys in their attacks on the <a href=\"/cwcki/HEXBox\" title=\"HEXBox\">HEXBox</a>, which is possibly another reason Chris likes it so much. Since Chris has no idea what porting a game to different platform usually entails, however, he thinks that pirates made versions of <i>LittleBigPlanet</i> for the <a href=\"/cwcki/Nintendo\" title=\"Nintendo\">Wii</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/HEXBox\" title=\"HEXBox\">Xbox 360</a> before the game was even out, and condemned these vile bastardizations before even finding out if they <i>actually exist</i>.\n</p><p>Not everything is rosy in Chris's <i>LittleBigPlanet</i> world, though. He has had problems saving his profile because he has collected so much stuff - and there is a certain limit on how many level-creation widgets the player character can carry or stuff into a level at any given time. In response, he created \"collector's cases\" to help him store all his crap. In <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris-chan_Discusses...\" title=\"Chris-chan Discusses...\">the ScrewAttackEurope interview</a>, he hoped that there would be \"expandable memory usage\" to allow him to save more junk. (All this is not entirely surprising, considering how much junk he and his family keeps around in real life, too.) In the same interview, he also expresses the hope that he could transfer some of the collected stuff to the PSP version of <i>LittleBigPlanet</i> as well. (We all know his opinion on giving away his material possessions, don't we?) He was also <a href=\"/cwcki/F_Abstinance#Description\" title=\"F Abstinance\">unhappy with the <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i> DLC</a> (likely because it made it marginally difficult for him to create his <a href=\"/cwcki/Electric_Hedgehog_Pok%C3%A9mon\" title=\"Electric Hedgehog Pokémon\">horrid abominations</a> in-game). As he knows absolutely nothing about how video games work, he demands that the parts be completely redone to match his own moronic concepts. \n</p><p>In yet another example of irony flying right over Chris's <a href=\"/cwcki/Hair\" title=\"Hair\">balding</a> head, his favorite video game is narrated by Stephen Fry, a well-known <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">homosexual</a> and enthusiastic gay rights advocate. (He's also a successful author, actor, comedian, narrator for classic literature and film, and proponent of the supremacy of science, as opposed to <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_religion\" title=\"Chris and religion\">theism</a>, making him something close to the platonic anti-Chris.)\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris_vs._Sony_vs._the_LBP_Community\">Chris vs. Sony vs. the <i>LBP</i> Community</span></h2>\n<p>Sony and Chris have become best friends and worst enemies over <i>LittleBigPlanet</i>. It's not surprising that the <i>LBP</i> community is one of the few online communities Chris has gotten into voluntarily. However, just like in the case of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Chop_Chop_Master_Onion%27s_Rap_Showdown\" title=\"Chop Chop Master Onion's Rap Showdown\"><i>PaRappa</i> contest</a> and PS3 boards in general, his personality and antics have not helped him to earn friends there.\n</p><p>Late in 2008, Chris's \"<a href=\"/cwcki/PS3_History_Level\" title=\"PS3 History Level\">PS3 History</a>\" videos were featured on the game's main page. Plenty of lulz were to be had on the site's forums, when <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Troll\" title=\"Troll\">trolls</a> began to link and post the many <a href=\"/cwcki/Nudes\" title=\"Nudes\">NOODZ</a> of the level's creator.\n</p><p>Sony Europe pulled his <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a></i> levels several weeks later under grounds of \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Copyright\" title=\"Copyright\">Copyright</a> Infringement\". This was not enough to get him banned, however, and the levels are back in the servers.\n</p><p>Several videos that Chris posted were addressed to the <i>LBP</i> community at large. See most of his <i>LBP</i> videos, the \"Collector's Case\" videos in particular, for several good examples. In <a href=\"/cwcki/Download_For_Play_Only\" title=\"Download For Play Only\">Download For Play Only</a>, Chris also begged the <i>LBP</i> community to not modify copies of his level, even though the game allows it.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"On_costumes\">On costumes</span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:SonicLBPCostumes.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"127\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/2/23/SonicLBPCostumes.jpg/300px-SonicLBPCostumes.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/2/23/SonicLBPCostumes.jpg/450px-SonicLBPCostumes.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/2/23/SonicLBPCostumes.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:SonicLBPCostumes.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>The costumes that failed to meet Chris's specifications...</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:SonicCostumeWhining.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"134\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/c/c9/SonicCostumeWhining.jpg/300px-SonicCostumeWhining.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/c/c9/SonicCostumeWhining.jpg/450px-SonicCostumeWhining.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/c/c9/SonicCostumeWhining.jpg/600px-SonicCostumeWhining.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:SonicCostumeWhining.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>...and Chris's subsequent bitching</div></div></div>\n<p>Much later, in <a href=\"/cwcki/March_2010\" title=\"March 2010\">March 2010</a>, Sony released a DLC pack of <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog\" title=\"Sonic the Hedgehog\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></i> costumes for <i>LBP</i>. While one would think that something like this would fill the <i>Sonic</i>-obsessed Chris with joy, Chris was deeply disappointed with the release, because it didn't help him make <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a></i>. Not content to wallow in misery alone, Chris let Sony know how he felt by posting the following rant to LittleBigWorkshop. In classic Chris style, his only contribution to the community is to bitterly whine about something that nobody else cares about, and his only demand to game developers is to ask for something that would benefit him alone.\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>I waited long for something like this sweet Sonic Costume Set to BEST put together my Sonichu Costume for my Sackperson. But I am disappointed on a few things about the Sonic and Werehog costumes that CAN BE FIXED IN AN UPDATE.\n<p>Firstly, the respective Headdresses; I was expecting the Spikes and the Ears to be TWO SEPERATE <i>[sic]</i> PIECES: Spikes for Hair and Ears for Head. With the two merged together into a HEAD Piece, I can not have the Bunny Ears Required to make the Ears REQUIRED for my Sonichu Costume.\n</p><p>Second, the Spines and Tails for the two costume pieces should be separate <i>[sic]</i> Also; The Spines for NECK and Tails for Waist. Firstly, with THAT TAIL, it makes an Unacceptable Odd appearance of TWO TAILS on the Sonichu Costume. Plus, for my <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu\" title=\"Rosechu\">Rosechu</a> Costume, I would require the Spines to be a Neck Piece, because with the Spines/Tails being a Single TORSO Piece, <a href=\"/cwcki/Women%27s_rights\" title=\"Women's rights\">SHE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO WEAR HER DRESS</a>.\n</p><p>I am deeply not satisfied with these portions of the Sonic the Hedgehog and Werehog Costumes.\n</p><p>Christian Weston Chandler.

These videos are truly breathtaking; you rarely see an allegedly enthusiastic video game fan play so clumsily on such awfully designed levels, especially considering they're made by him. With all the trophies in the game already bagged, years of playing, and thousands spent on video games, one would think Chris would be able to both play the game at some tolerable skill level and also have some gut feeling about what goes into the design of an enjoyable game level. But no - his level shows that the entirety of his video game achievements was obtained by merciless, uninterrupted grinding.\n</p><p>Interestingly, Chris's levels show the same problems as his <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\">comic</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_camerawork\" title=\"Chris and camerawork\">the videos</a>. They're poorly thought out, not playtested before publishing, show laziness, and technical incompetence all around, and have an irritating overall look. Chris obviously applies the same minimal effort to <i>LBP</i> as he does to everything else. Do note that nearly all of Chris's levels follow the tried-and-true \"combine two franchises\" technique and that all of them have been tagged by <i>LittleBigPlanet</i> players as being \"creepy,\" \"weird,\" \"rubbish,\" and \"frustrating.\" All of Chris' levels use the in-game music track \"Gardens IntMusic\" as the background music, suggesting it is his favorite OST from the game.\n</p><p>The introductory quotations by Chris are as they appeared in the LBP2 incarnations of the levels. \n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sonichu_Episode_1\">Sonichu Episode 1</span></h3>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>This is the very first epsode of my Sonichu Comic Series.

Unfortunately, it also appears to be the first <i>LBP</i> level he made, and the well-kept adage in the game modding world is that only fools release their first crappy attempts at making levels. This is especially true if one's idea of a masterpiece is a level full of random inaccessible areas, ugly design, and frustratingly hard platforming.\n</p><p>The level is loosely based on <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_0\" title=\"Sonichu 0\">Episode #1</a> of the comic. \"Loosely,\" because Chris's idea of a level based on the comic is a bunch of images copied on level elements, combined with speech bubbles in roughly the same order as they appear in the comic. The rest of the level is just expanses of empty areas, poorly-made blocks of material, small jumping puzzles, and something that may resemble a platformer level if you are <a href=\"/cwcki/Yawning_Squirtle\" title=\"Yawning Squirtle\">stoned</a> enough.

Chris concludes this level with one of the most epic straight-faced fanboy rants in recent history — the speech bubbles tell us that Chris considers the PS3 to be the best \"life upgrade\" ever. Clearly, fanboy-ism is more important than quality.\n</p><p>This level also includes a detailed PS3 recreation which, unsurprisingly, Chris admits to copying from another level. He also claims it is \"worse,\" perhaps referring to the barely identifiable PS3 made with falling Tetris blocks that he himself cobbled together earlier in the level.\n</p><p>Chris won the <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Metal_Gear\" title=\"Metal Gear\">Metal Gear Solid</a></i> level pack after this demonstration of the power of the weapon that will lead us through the 21st century.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"LBP_Collector.27s_Case\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"LBP_Collector's_Case\">LBP Collector's Case</span></h3>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>This is a Useful Accessory.

Being an incurable packrat, Chris ran into problems when he was unable to save his accumulated garbage into his <i>LBP</i> profile. He figured out that since items you've collected can be placed into levels, he should create a \"collector's case\": a few boxes stacked atop each other, and elevators to make climbing easier. You can stick items in bubbles, and place photos to the background to remind you what's in it. Chris, of course, believed this was one of the most remarkable ideas ever, and asked everyone to thank him for this amazing original idea. Never mind that there had been many similar \"collector's cases\" available in the servers already. Never mind that the idea of persistent storage in game levels had been around for decades.\n</p><p>Chris created two videos in which he demoed the levels, one with the level empty and ready for abuse, one with the cases jam-fucking-packed with Chris's stored items. In the second video, Chris figured out how to hook up the microphone, so Sonichu's mouth now opened and closed in sync with Chris's words (to chilling effect).\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"A_Fun_First_Date\">A Fun First Date</span></h3>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>This is a fun level, most suitable for (Straight) Couples.

Meant for <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Julie\" title=\"Julie\">Julie</a>, this level reaches towards good taste and rapes it brutally. It features some rather difficult-to-navigate buildings. A plagiarized \"rollercoaster\" is the highlight of the level, with <b>two</b> extreme loops, passing by some of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">gaudiest pink trees</a> in existence. Once these ten seconds of mild amusement are over, failure appears. You're led into a pink room full of hearts, where you're supposed to take <a href=\"/cwcki/Nudes\" title=\"Nudes\">pictures</a> of you and your <a href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart\" title=\"Sweetheart\">sweetheart</a>. Chris is completely unaware of how damn creepy this is.\n</p><p>He also condemns those who dare to play the level in one-player mode by making them take a path out of the level and into a depressing black-and-white void away from all the action, where the player is mocked for being single. \"No Date?

Chris corrupts everything, with no exceptions. In this abortion of a level, Chris distills the essence of <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Metal_Gear\" title=\"Metal Gear\">MGS</a></i>: <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonic\" title=\"Sonic\">linear, boring speed sections</a> and impossibly difficult turret sections that instantly kill you. The level features rave lights and lots of seizure-inducing material. There's also an almost impossible jetpack race through a maze of electrified walls, with glitchy sections where you must travel at \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonic\" title=\"Sonic\">Sonic</a> speed\".

The plot of this video roughly follows the infamous <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_Special_4\" title=\"Sonichu Special 4\">Gun Comic</a>, which was leaked later. Chris rides some buses, mercilessly guns down <a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris\" title=\"Liquid Chris\">Liquid Chris</a>, who is allegedly holding Kacey hostage and receives massive ego-stroking from extremely crude cutout characters who represent Kacey's family.
