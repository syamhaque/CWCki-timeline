Chris feels unappreciated by Jackie for the enormous effort he put into trying to meet her for the Fourth of July, and temporarily breaks off communication. This makes Jackie cry into her pillow for several days. Chris apologizes, and they talk on the phone. Whatever is said, it patches up the relationship to such an extent that Chris is persuaded to make several bizarre and disgusting <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Videos\" title=\"Videos\">videos</a> for his sweetheart. Chris also gets a chance to speak with Jackie's drunk step-father, who reminds him of <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_the_Hill\" title=\"wikipedia:King of the Hill\">Hank Hill</a>. Chris refers to himself as a \"Small-Breasted <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tomgirl_Saga\" title=\"Tomgirl Saga\">TomGirl</a>,\" indicating that he's already proud of his female sex characteristics, three years before declaring himself to be <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos#Chris_and_transgender_topics\" title=\"Homos\">transgender</a>.\n</p><p><br/>\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #B48246; padding:5px; background-color:#FCC\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>July 4, 2011 4:24pm\n<p>One more thing: You say I \"have a place a place for myself here available to return to\" in <a href=\"/cwcki/14_Branchland_Court\" title=\"14 Branchland Court\">your house</a>.

I am sorry for making you cry with my absence. And I am sorry for not answering your calls. I have been falling asleep earlier and getting up early lately. I have been fatigued from the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress\" title=\"Stress\">stress</a> of failing you, taking the aggression and all.

Acquaintance, *Friendship, Relationship, Love, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sex\" title=\"Sex\">Sex</a>. Perhaps your input into the quandry may help.\n</p><p><a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">Friendship (2) leads to Relationship (3); 3 leads to Love (4), and 4 leads to Sex (5). Yet I have before heard of 5 destroying 2; Acquaintance (1) skipping 2 towards any of 3 to 5; 5 without 4; 4 without the foundation of either 3 or 2. Also, I feel 5 breaking 2 is rediculous, because 2 is the stronger foundation towards 5, with 3 and 4 in between. Most adults currently have 3 and up in mind without the sweet foundation of 2, which leaves them too cautious, scared, paranoid and so on in Social Situations.</a>\n</p><p>I grew up watching, enjoying and learning from Friendship, Caring and Sharing-encouraging programs, including \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Care_Bears\" title=\"Care Bears\">Care Bears</a>\", \"<a href=\"/cwcki/My_Little_Pony\" title=\"My Little Pony\">My Little Pony</a>\", etc. Plus, I was educated with a great number of Coping Skills classes, yet after leaving Midlothian, I have lost a chunk, of that friendship-filled confidence, from leaving my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Gal-pals\" title=\"Gal-pals\">good friends</a> behind.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\">Sonichu series</a> was originally going to be a Friendship and Social-encouraging series with the dashes of action from defending the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">city</a> and the adventures.

I talked with my pastoral counselor, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Rocky\" title=\"Rocky\">Rocky</a>, about it later that day; she took my word-for-word thoughts down and drew up the Acquaintance-to-Sex ladder for me, which I had not thought of beforehand; good idea.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #B48246; padding:5px; background-color:#FCC\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>July 9, 2011 9:22pm\n<p>Hello Chris,\n</p><p>I feel as if I can finally breathe again.

(:0 *sigh* And I apologize for <a href=\"/cwcki/Forgot_the_Glitter\" title=\"Forgot the Glitter\">forgetting the glitter</a>.\n</p><p>Second, I would appreciate it if from here on out, we have no more on-location (especially in a store or restaurant of any sort) videos.  \nOn one hand, I'd have to record with my digital camera, which saves the video files in a format unreadable by any of my consoles, and would require a PC to either reformat it or directly upload it onto YouTube, which I have been using a computer at my nearest library to upload with. On the other hand, keeping the videos at home, and in my room, I can record videos with my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PlayStation_Eye\" title=\"PlayStation Eye\">PlayStation Eye</a> Camera through the EyeCreate program, export the video onto the XMB in the readable format, and directly upload onto YouTube from there, saving me gas in driving to the library.\n</p><p>Third, I appreciate your ideas for videos, but allow me to surprise you with my own ideas for satisfying or serenading you in the future recordings. I promise to surprise you in the near future with a live from my room recording of a few <a href=\"/cwcki/Cakefarts\" title=\"Cakefarts\">cake farts</a> (in one video).

You, Your Presence and Your Love Are most certainly worth all of the efforts from me. Another thing, actually, the practice sex in My room did turn you on; I feel it partially hard to grasp as to why we'd Have To spend our night(s) together in a hotel room, when I have demonstrated well that there is plenty of room in mine to get it on in and be comfortable. I'm just thinking of that for your benefit of saving money.

Actually, it's something else. Straight-up: my family and I, we have received a number of abusive calls from someone or more who made bad impersonations of <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Hill\" title=\"wikipedia:Hank Hill\">the character</a>, \"sellin' propane and propane accessories; boy, I tell you what\" and such shit. To us, it was perceived as a bunch of Troll calls. And after hearing that talk from him that night, I felt suspicion, because he sounded Very close to what I have heard before. I am not accusing anyone, and I do not mean any offense; I just felt paranoid. Is it possible that your step-dad got my numbers from you and during past drunk episodes rang me and my family to give us abuse and hate? I mean, his voice was just Soo close to what I have heard before. I apologize if I've made you feel discomfort.\n</p><p>Topic change, the cake farts won't happen that soon, and I have told you before that I will surprise you with it soon. With that, I appreciate your enthusiasm with the sex-talk and all, but there is a limit to how much I can take for a time before it becomes monotonous and bothers me wrong. I feel it better if the really dirty talk is decreased; use it sparingly. And there are still a Lot of other things we can talk about; sex isn't everything, you know.\n</p><p>You are a truly delightful and radiant woman; don't \"shoot yourself in the foot\" with too much bad ammo (symbolically and metaphorically). Do you understand, Sweetheart? There is a time and place for everything.  \nI Like You; I Care about You; I Love You, Jacklyn. &lt;3\n</p><p>I have another good surprise for you; I got an idea for a set of lyrics I'm going to write 'bout me being a \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Manboobs\" title=\"Manboobs\">Small-Breasted</a> TomGirl.\" You'll see in due time. :)\n</p><p>I have my own good ideas too.\n</p><p>B.T.W., if you have <a href=\"/cwcki/Netflix\" title=\"Netflix\">Netflix</a>, check out the <a href=\"/cwcki/Anime\" title=\"Anime\">anime</a> \"<a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nana_(manga)#Anime\" title=\"wikipedia:Nana (manga)\">Nana</a>\" through the Instant Streaming; it's one about two women both named Nana.

I don't know... You told me you had something going on in your pocket for me and that you were horny, and now you are not? I am saving myself for you so I am perpetually horny. Have you been relieving yourself? I have not been. I have been keeping myself pure and a new-<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Virgin\" title=\"Virgin\">virgin</a> just for you, my one and only. So please don't act like I am a machine. I am crying again now and I seriously cannot stop. I didn't mean this but I can't help it! I feel so let down and depressed. I really wanted to see cakefarts on Tuesday and now I will not. You told me about the surprise angle but you also told me on the call you were flexible with things since I was out making money for both of us and our future. \n</p><p>You wanted to see me for a week instead of a weekend and I said okay provided you really, really honored me with what I requested of you in return. I guess you're not going to now... I guess you don't want to see me for a week, either... I don't feel very loved now. I fell for your beautiful tomgirl ways and those eyes, those gorgeous eyes!!... I feel horrible and ugly and alone...That super cute and handsome voice of your's haunts my dreams and now... I feel kinda sick now, too. I got in major trouble that night for telling Daddy off because I hated to see him hurt you. He knows I'm dating a man now. As does Mommy... I came out to them and risked my neck because I thought you were worth that risk and effort... I got my chopsticks and perfume set taken away because of it... because all I wanted was you in my life... \n</p><p>Jackie\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>July 17, 2011 9:48pm\n<p>That's Not what I meant at all.

    "Friendship (2) leads to Relationship (3); 3 leads to Love (4), and 4 leads to Sex (5). Yet I have before heard of 5 destroying 2; Acquaintance (1) skipping 2 towards any of 3 to 5; 5 without 4; 4 without the foundation of either 3 or 2. Also, I feel 5 breaking 2 is rediculous, because 2 is the stronger foundation towards 5, with 3 and 4 in between. Most adults currently have 3 and up in mind without the sweet foundation of 2, which leaves them too cautious, scared, paranoid and so on in Social Situations.",
