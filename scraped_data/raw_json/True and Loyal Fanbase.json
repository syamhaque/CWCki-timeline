In <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_48\" title=\"Mailbag 48\">Mailbag #48</a>, Chris stated that he believes he has over one billion fans, meaning that roughly one-eighth of the world's population (or one third of <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_the_Internet\" title=\"Chris and the Internet\">Internet</a> users) has supposedly discovered and grown to love <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\">Sonichu</a></i> since the comic began back in <a href=\"/cwcki/2000\" title=\"2000\">2000</a>. Even in <a href=\"/cwcki/2021\" title=\"2021\">2021</a>, he thinks that <i>Sonichu</i> is more popular than mega-franchises like <i><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings\" title=\"wikipedia:The Lord of the Rings\">The Lord of the Rings</a></i> and <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Harry_Potter\" title=\"Harry Potter\">Harry Potter</a></i>,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup> despite the fact that he wouldn't be living in borderline poverty if that were the case.\n</p><p>While his fans used to be comprised entirely of trolls feigning support for him, Chris eventually garnered a more \"legitimate\" fanbase, albeit one with a sizeable amount of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/White_knight\" title=\"White knight\">white knights</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Enablers\" title=\"Enablers\">enablers</a> mixed in with fans of <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog\" title=\"Sonic the Hedgehog\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></i> and <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Pok%C3%A9mon\" title=\"Pokémon\">Pokémon</a></i> and furries in general.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Personal_army\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Personal army</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Chris's_contempt_for_his_fans\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris's contempt for his fans</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Chris_turns_on_his_fans\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris turns on his fans</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Legitimate_fanbase\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Legitimate fanbase</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Source_of_income\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Source of income</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Gallery\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Gallery</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Fan_videos\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Fan videos</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Personal_army\">Personal army</span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:ChrisPersonalArmy.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"169\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/e/ef/ChrisPersonalArmy.jpg/300px-ChrisPersonalArmy.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/e/ef/ChrisPersonalArmy.jpg/450px-ChrisPersonalArmy.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/e/ef/ChrisPersonalArmy.jpg/600px-ChrisPersonalArmy.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:ChrisPersonalArmy.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>This is what Chris actually believes.</div></div></div>\n<p>Like many individuals who have become notorious on the Internet, Chris believes that he has a sizable fanbase that adores him.

This belief was likely reinforced by the backfired trolling attempt during the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/GameStop_Be_A_Star_Sweepstakes\" title=\"GameStop Be A Star Sweepstakes\">GameStop Be A Star Sweepstakes</a>, and it's possible that's what drives him to continue acting this way.\n</p><p>Chris tried to play the personal army game in the aftermath of his <a href=\"/cwcki/Michael_Snyder_is_ColdHearted_and_Mean\" title=\"Michael Snyder is ColdHearted and Mean\">12 April 2010 confrontation</a> with <a href=\"/cwcki/Michael_Snyder\" title=\"Michael Snyder\">Michael Snyder</a>. The related <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jackie_e-mails\" title=\"Jackie e-mails\">Jackie e-mails</a> gave us an interesting glance at Chris's perspective on his ability to command his fans, as well as this interesting tidbit:\n</p>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">Considering after what had transpired, I decided to upload the audio-only video onto my <a href=\"/cwcki/YouTube\" title=\"YouTube\">YouTube</a>.

It's possible he thinks that his trolls are indiscriminately cruel to everyone, and that, if given a target, they would lash out against it without a second thought. Then again, given his sizable <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_Ego\" title=\"Chris and his Ego\">ego</a> and shaky grasp on <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">reality</a>, it's also possible he thinks that trolls will do what he says just because he said it.\n</p><p>On 17 <a href=\"/cwcki/July_2010\" title=\"July 2010\">July 2010</a> Chris posted a series of <a href=\"/cwcki/Twitter\" title=\"Twitter\">tweets</a> (if they can be called that given that Chris boldly defies the definition of microblogging) on his <a href=\"/cwcki/Twitter\" title=\"Twitter\">Twitter</a> account after roughly three months of silence. In typical Chris fashion, he was only doing so not out of care for his fans but to ask for people to give him DLC codes for <i><a href=\"/cwcki/ModNation_Racers\" title=\"ModNation Racers\">ModNation Racers</a></i>, helping to push his agenda along by claiming that he was still working on the <i>Sonichu</i> comics. This is despite the fact that much of Chris's <i>Sonichu</i> fanbase had long ago given up hopes for any new pages. Along with e-begging, Chris proceeded to plug his <i>ModNation Racers</i> creations.\n</p><p>Chris's understanding of his personal army has become more apparent with the <a href=\"/cwcki/Calling_Out\" title=\"Calling Out\">Calling Out</a> videos. Somehow, Chris thinks that revealing the contact information of his trolls guarantees that they will be trolled. It is not difficult to see Chris's pattern of thought here, considering the fact that ever since his own address was released on the internet it made his house a hot spot for phone calls from trolls, letters from trolls, and hookers from trolls.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Chris.27s_contempt_for_his_fans\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris's_contempt_for_his_fans\">Chris's contempt for his fans</span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Sonichufans.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"262\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/1/1d/Sonichufans.png/300px-Sonichufans.png\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/1/1d/Sonichufans.png/450px-Sonichufans.png 1.5x, /w/images/1/1d/Sonichufans.png 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Sonichufans.png\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Fans of <i>Sonichu</i> lining up to get an autograph from Chris.</div></div></div>\n<p>Chris takes his alleged fanbase entirely for granted. When he doesn't want something from them, he ignores them. He is happy to try and extort them, in fact, as when he threatened <a href=\"/cwcki/Take_that_Page_DOWN_NOW!\" title=\"Take that Page DOWN NOW!\">to withhold his comics unless the ED page was taken down</a>. Despite his contemptuous attitude towards them, he assumes that his TRUE and LOYAL fans will keep the <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">trolls</a> in check. Another example came on <a href=\"/cwcki/THAT_IS_MY_HOUSE\" title=\"THAT IS MY HOUSE\">27 August 2009</a>, when Chris implored his fanbase to remove every last video that showed the <a href=\"/cwcki/Tour_of_Chris%27s_House\" title=\"Tour of Chris's House\">tour of his house</a> after his father found out about it. To this day, mirrors of the two-part video still pop up to mock Chris. \n</p><p>Despite his belief that his fans adore him, Chris is notoriously inattentive to the sort of things that allow a person to continue having fans. He believes that people love him for his <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\">comic</a>, and yet his updates are often months apart. His attitude is neatly summed up at the end of <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_10\" title=\"Sonichu 10\"><i>Sonichu</i> #10</a>, in the message from <a href=\"/cwcki/Things_Chris_has_ripped_off\" title=\"Things Chris has ripped off\">Marvey Blaziken</a>. Chris wants the adulation that goes along with being a popular artist, but he thinks that he ought to receive it in exchange for whatever amount of effort he feels like putting forth. Which, Chris being Chris, isn't very much at all.\n</p><p>Chris refuses to take responsibility for his output or lack thereof, blaming any troubles on <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress\" title=\"Stress\">stress</a> caused by trolls. In a sense, because he expects his fans to take care of the trolls for him, he's blaming them for the fact that he can't keep updates regular. He also shows his fans contempt by having the radio on in the background during fan chats over <a href=\"/cwcki/Mumble\" title=\"Mumble\">Mumble</a><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup> and giving extremely short, often rude, responses to lengthy, innocent questions in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag\" title=\"Mailbag\">Mailbag</a>.\n</p><p>As his ego has swollen over the years, Chris seems to have come to believe he can control what his fans do with their lives. In <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Down_with_asperchu\" title=\"Down with asperchu\">a video from January 2010</a>, Chris told his fans to never read an issue of <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Asperchu\" title=\"Asperchu\">Asperchu</a></i> because \"there are no LINKS\" to Chris's works. He later went so far as to try and <a href=\"/cwcki/U8C43P2A37A8_y_U8C1N023V0L\" title=\"U8C43P2A37A8 y U8C1N023V0L\">brainwash</a> his followers into hating what he viewed as a rival comic.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris_turns_on_his_fans\">Chris turns on his fans</span></h2>\n<p>In <a href=\"/cwcki/March_2010\" title=\"March 2010\">March 2010</a>, after a troll interfered in Chris's pursuit of <a href=\"/cwcki/The_Wallflower\" title=\"The Wallflower\">The Wallflower</a>, Chris took to his <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_Blog\" title=\"CWC Blog\">blog</a> and attacked his fans along with the trolls, accusing them of breaking up his quest for true love out of a selfish desire to consume more of his comics. \"You all are just as Terrible as I portrayed <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Mary Lee Walsh</a> to be,\" he declared, \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_hypocrisy\" title=\"Chris and hypocrisy\">so self-absorbed in yourselves</a>, spoiled, and such, YOU ONLY want more story arcs and <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_art\" title=\"Chris and art\">art</a> MORE QUICKLY than my own Inspiration can come up with. You all are nothing bug <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_money\" title=\"Chris and money\">greedy</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_anger\" title=\"Chris and anger\">impatient</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sarah_Hammer\" title=\"Sarah Hammer\">un</a><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Megan\" title=\"Megan\">lov</a><a href=\"/cwcki/The_Wallflower\" title=\"The Wallflower\">ed</a> and corrupted people.\"\n</p><p>He also claimed to tire of trying to please the \"millions\" of fans he has. Instead, he explained that he only wants to please \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ruckersville\" title=\"Ruckersville\">the local few around me</a> who I truly and deeply care about.\" What this could mean is a number of things. The biggest thing he feels they have done is trolled him just as badly as the trolls themselves just to get his comics. Thus, he feels that they share equal blame with the trolls just because he doesn't want to spend time working on his comic.\n</p><p>This might have represented a valuable moment of clarity on Chris's part. He may have managed to discover, however inadvertently, that all his comic really accomplishes is to draw unwelcome attention to him.\n</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Chris soon forgot all about this and went back to assuming command over his personal army, directing them to <a href=\"/cwcki/Michael_Snyder_is_ColdHearted_and_Mean\" title=\"Michael Snyder is ColdHearted and Mean\">harass a manager</a> for not letting him back into a store.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Legitimate_fanbase\">Legitimate fanbase</span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:FanbaseTrends.gif\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"77\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/1/10/FanbaseTrends.gif/300px-FanbaseTrends.gif\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/1/10/FanbaseTrends.gif/450px-FanbaseTrends.gif 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/1/10/FanbaseTrends.gif/600px-FanbaseTrends.gif 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:FanbaseTrends.gif\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Worldwide interest in Chris has remained about steady since <a href=\"/cwcki/2008\" title=\"2008\">2008</a>.</div></div></div>\n<p>Chris's fanbase evolved into legitimate supporters during the middle of the 2010s.
