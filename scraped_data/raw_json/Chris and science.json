Science can be divided into pure science, which studies natural phenomena, and applied science, which finds practical uses for said phenomena. \n</p><p>Chris has an on/off history with science – though it is <a href=\"/cwcki/Honor_roll\" title=\"Honor roll\">mostly off</a>. His view on science, nature, and technology is utterly warped. He has <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">lost touch with the times</a> and thinks science is much more ahead in certain fields than it actually is, probably due to him getting all his information through fictional media. He has also mixed up real science, pop science, pseudoscience, and other things he has learned from media and enablers to create a very distorted view of nature. Furthermore, Chris struggles with mathematics and numerical reasoning despite boasting otherwise. \n</p><p>His <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">ego</a> also causes him to reject scientific findings, such as when he rejected the fact that <a href=\"/cwcki/Asperger_syndrome\" title=\"Asperger syndrome\">Asperger syndrome</a> and high-functioning <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">autism</a> are one and the same.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Chris_on_science\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris on science</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Pure_science\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Pure science</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Physics\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Physics</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Chemistry\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chemistry</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Biology\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Biology</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Astronomy\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Astronomy</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Applied_science\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Applied science</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Computer_science\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Computer science</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#Engineering\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Engineering</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Medicine\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Medicine</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#Psychology\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Psychology</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#Pseudoscience\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Pseudoscience</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-13\"><a href=\"#Astrology\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Astrology</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-14\"><a href=\"#Magic\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Magic</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-15\"><a href=\"#Magic_stones\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Magic stones</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-16\"><a href=\"#Precognition\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.2.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Precognition</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-17\"><a href=\"#Subliminal_Frequency_self-help_audio\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Subliminal Frequency self-help audio</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-18\"><a href=\"#Numerology\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Numerology</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-19\"><a href=\"#Mathematics\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Mathematics</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-20\"><a href=\"#Arithmetic\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Arithmetic</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-21\"><a href=\"#Estimation/Measurement\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Estimation/Measurement</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-22\"><a href=\"#Algebra\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Algebra</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-23\"><a href=\"#Geometry\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Geometry</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-24\"><a href=\"#Number_Systems\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5.5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Number Systems</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-25\"><a href=\"#Statistics_&amp;_Probability\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5.6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Statistics &amp;

he worked as a GE engineer for a large part of his life. He wanted Chris to be into science too, so he had set up a small workshop where he and young Chris would tinker around. Chris's <a href=\"/cwcki/Minor_Family_Members\" title=\"Minor Family Members\">paternal half-siblings</a> both held STEM doctorates - with <a href=\"/cwcki/Minor_Family_Members#Alan_Chandler\" title=\"Minor Family Members\">one in particular having made a career as an ophthalmologist</a> - and Chris himself has an Applied Science associate's degree in <a href=\"/cwcki/CADD\" title=\"CADD\">CADD</a>. Alas, none of this got Chris deeply interested in science.\n</p><p>Chris has stated his opinions on science in his <a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_OkCupid_Answers\" title=\"List of OkCupid Answers\">OkCupid questionnaire</a>. He said all types of science are interesting to him, though he finds conversations about science to be boring and annoying. He claims to put equal weight in science and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Religion\" title=\"Religion\">faith</a> and enjoys finding out how things work.\n</p><p>All these however should be taken with a grain of salt since he was ready to do anything <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Lies\" title=\"Lies\">(including lying)</a> to obtain <a href=\"/cwcki/China\" title=\"China\">china</a>. His actual views on pure science are probably low or non existant since he slept through <a href=\"/cwcki/Manchester_High_School\" title=\"Manchester High School\">high school</a>. He may have a positive opinion on computer science due to him being hooked on computers since a very young age. Unsurprisingly, Chris is not interested in engineering; all his engineering marvels are shitty duct tape and Lego creations that a child could also make.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Pure_science\">Pure science</span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Physics\">Physics</span></h3>\n<p>There are multiple things that are horribly wrong in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\"><i>Sonichu</i> comics</a>, including a lack of regard for the laws of physics.

But Chris thinks all of this really happened in some other dimension, and it can be considered as a critique of his scientific knowledge.\n</p><p>In real life, since <a href=\"/cwcki/Messiah_complex\" title=\"Messiah complex\">Chris has no real powers</a>, he has to play by the rules of physics, but he maintains an unbending belief in unproven concepts. Most of these beliefs can be traced back to fictional media he likes, such as <i>Who Framed Roger Rabbit</i> and <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Futurama\" title=\"Futurama\">Futurama</a></i> for the <a href=\"/cwcki/Dimensional_Merge\" title=\"Dimensional Merge\">multiple dimensions</a>,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup> and <i>Rick and Morty</i> to prove that there are other people who can traverse dimensions.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Chris again attempted to bend the laws of physics in February 2021, having plans to use piezoelectricity on his quartz crystals in order to open up a portal to complete the Dimensional Merge. Chris has discussed this with <a href=\"/cwcki/Kyle\" title=\"Kyle\">Kyle</a>, to which he explains to Chris why this wouldn't work, and how the article that he is citing does not provide evidence of his claims.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chemistry\">Chemistry</span></h3>\n<p>Chris had two <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Gal-pals\" title=\"Gal-pals\">gal-pals</a> as partners in his Chemistry lab.

According to the <i>Sonichu</i> canon, 10 C-quarters make up a single W-quarter, which makes no sense; a quarter is one-fourth of its respective unit.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>When a clerk told Chris he was $2 short of affording his <a href=\"/cwcki/Obesity\" title=\"Obesity\">junk food</a>, he was left dumbfounded as to what he should do. Another customer in line gave Chris $2 to make up the deficit, and instead of handing it to the clerk to pay off his <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_money\" title=\"Chris and money\">debt</a>, Chris simply <i>took that money, the food, and left the store over everyone's protests</i>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-9\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">[9]</a></sup></li></ul>\n<ul><li>According to Chris, if he lived in Equestria, he'd be 1,050 years old, because one year on Equestria is equal to 30 Earth Years, while <a href=\"/cwcki/Night_Star\" title=\"Night Star\">Night Star</a> is 19 years old in human years, but 570 in pony years. <sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-10\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">[10]</a></sup> Because Chris has this <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">fixation for his birthdate</a>, he decided to give her the birth date, 24 February, 1982, which is apparently Pony Year 967. Only checking after he's made his statement, Chris did the math to confirm this. In a later Facebook post, Chris stated that 30 out of 365.25 Earth Days is equal to 11 Earth Days for each birthday, in reality, 30 ÷ 365.25 is approximately eight-hundredths. Even more pathetic is how he wrote the quotient as divided 30 by 365 instead of the other way around, and still got it wrong, as 365.25 ÷ 30 is equal to 12.175, which cannot be rounded down to 11. In his flawed math though, he had found that her actual birth date in Pony years should be 19 February, 939.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>In <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_10\" title=\"Sonichu 10\">Sonichu 10</a>, the <a href=\"/cwcki/4-cent_garbage.com\" title=\"4-cent garbage.com\">4-cent_garbage.com</a> tower collapses, with 1,500 people in it. According to Chris, 500 were \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_English#Written_language\" title=\"Chris and English\">prefectly</a> [sic] unharmed\"; 250 were too drunk to escape on their own (125 of these drunk trolls managed to get out alive with help from sober trolls, while 125 of the drunk trolls were hurt, injured or killed); 125 sober trolls were hurt, injured or killed; 250 others were injured; 150 others were \"safe but hurt\"; and 100 were killed. Not only are we left in the dark about what happened to the 125 drunk troll casualties, but this total also only accounts for 1,375 people.</li></ul>\n<h3><span id=\"Estimation.2FMeasurement\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Estimation/Measurement\">Estimation/Measurement</span></h3>\n<ul><li>When exercising by lifting two boxes of 12-pack lemonade, he estimated that the 4.26 liters of lemonade he was lifting weighed about 50 pounds, when in fact it weighed less than ten.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>In the chair lifting video, Chris claimed the chair he was lifting weighed \"a grand number of pounds.\"</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Chris repeatedly claims to have D-cup breasts. In his <a href=\"/cwcki/My_Breast_Massage_Routine_18%2B\" title=\"My Breast Massage Routine 18+\">breast massage video</a>, Chris measures his chest and underbust as 44 and 40 inches respectively, and says they make him a D cup.  In reality, he is a B cup.  Also, the conventional method for breast measurement does not work for <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tomgirl\" title=\"Tomgirl\">trans women</a>, mainly because of chest girth, so Chris is actually closer to an A cup.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>In the infamous <a href=\"/cwcki/Father_Call\" title=\"Father Call\">Father Call</a>, Chris seemed to believe a <a href=\"/cwcki/Patti_Chandler\" title=\"Patti Chandler\">dog house</a> made of plastic and wood weighed 5 to 10 tons (10,000-20,000 pounds), and was heavier than any tombstone (which tend to weigh an average of about 80 pounds). Essentially, Chris believes that plastic and wood would weigh more than solid stone.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>After <a href=\"/cwcki/Walking_to_the_post_office#Chris_is_back_home\" title=\"Walking to the post office\">walking</a> 8 miles to and from the post office, Chris vastly underestimated the entire journey to have only been 2 miles.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Chris has tried to describe a number of everyday things like love and respect using all kinds of scales and numbers. His most famous example, the <a href=\"/cwcki/Heart_level\" title=\"Heart level\">heart level</a>, measures his emotional state. Another example, the <a href=\"/cwcki/Scale_of_Respect\" title=\"Scale of Respect\">Scale of Respect</a> is meant to be used to measure Chris' respect for certain individuals.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>In one of Chris's early maps of CWCVille, the dimensions of its sectors/divisions are clearly out of scale.

Two days after that post was made, Chris made another response to 2D animator Spinalpalm, in which he says that salted butter is better than unsalted butter (written as \"Salted butter &gt; Unsalted butter\"). This time around, Chris actually understood the underlying message, and agreed with Spinalpalm about the topic,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-12\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">[12]</a></sup> meaning that he must have figured out the meaning of the greater than symbol after several other users corrected him.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Geometry\">Geometry</span></h3>\n<ul><li>In one of his tirades towards the <a href=\"/cwcki/HEXBox\" title=\"HEXBox\">Xbox</a>, Chris said that the angle of half a circle is 120º, then revised his claim to 130º.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-13\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">[13]</a></sup></li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Number_Systems\">Number Systems</span></h3>\n<ul><li>Chris's reports of how much <a href=\"/cwcki/Cherokian_Clan\" title=\"Cherokian Clan\">Cherokee</a> blood he has have been inconsistent.  When he <a href=\"/cwcki/Jackie_E-mails_16\" title=\"Jackie E-mails 16\">emailed Jackie</a>, he stated he was 1/16 Cherokee, but he later <a href=\"/cwcki/Regina_e-mails\" title=\"Regina e-mails\">told Regina</a> that he was 1/32 Cherokee. Finally, when talking to <a href=\"/cwcki/Emily\" title=\"Emily\">Emily</a>, he claimed <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler\" title=\"Bob Chandler\">Bob</a> was at least one-fourth Cherokee, which would make Chris at least one-eighth Cherokee, not 1/16 or 1/32.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>To avoid assigning an \"unlucky number\" to his Night Star comic, Chris decided to number the comic as Sonichu #12-9, using an em-dash in place a decimal point.
