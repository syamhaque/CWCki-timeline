Defying this, Chris has stated that one goes to Heaven or Hell based completely on personal actions. He thinks that he will go to heaven because he's done \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Common_Questions#1_January_2010\" title=\"Common Questions\">a lot of</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/28_October_2011\" title=\"28 October 2011\">good deeds</a>\".

He teaches that, upon death, one may merge with one's <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(species)\" title=\"Sonichu (species)\">Sonichu</a> counterpart there. Among those who have been depicted in their Sonichu form on the other side include disastrous German chancellor <a href=\"/cwcki/Nombie-zazis\" title=\"Nombie-zazis\">Adolf Hitler</a>, serial killer and rapist <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ted_Bundy\" title=\"Ted Bundy\">Ted Bundy</a> and Chris's late father, <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler\" title=\"Bob Chandler\">Bob Chandler</a>. Only the truly wicked, such as <a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris\" title=\"Liquid Chris\">Liquid Chris</a>, are denied this in the hereafter: Satan instead burns their bodies in 'hell's lava pool', purges them of their memories and sends their oblivious souls to be reincarnated.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-7\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">[7]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Since the autumn of <a href=\"/cwcki/2018\" title=\"2018\">2018</a>, Chris has taught that we are living in the latter days. From a mixture of off-hand comments by comic artists and several <a href=\"/cwcki/Weens\" title=\"Weens\">weens</a> foddering him with misinformation and dumb inside jokes, Chris thinks that beginning in <a href=\"/cwcki/November_2018\" title=\"November 2018\">November 2018</a>, the real world (or 'Dimension 1218', as he calls it) is in the process of combining with C-197, in what he calls the <a href=\"/cwcki/Dimensional_Merge\" title=\"Dimensional Merge\">Dimensional Merge</a>. Chris has attributed miscellaneous events past and present, real and fictional, ranging from tragedies like the <a href=\"/cwcki/Twin_Falling_Towers\" title=\"Twin Falling Towers\">World Trade Centre's destruction</a> to salad recalls,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-8\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">[8]</a></sup> to the impending Merge. Originally projected to be complete before <a href=\"/cwcki/January_2019\" title=\"January 2019\">New Year's 2019</a>, Chris maintains still that the Merge is just about the corner. Chris foretells massive destruction heralding the Merge that will result in the deaths of about half the world's population, as well as half of the fictional characters from C-197. <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">Naturally</a>, Chris, being the goddess in charge of managing this brouhaha, will be spared: everyone else must take their chances. Survivors will be able to enjoy the company of their favorite cartoon characters in the flesh, as well as their deceased relatives transformed into Electric Hedgehog Pokémon.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Dimension_C-197_as_Chris.27s_version_of_Heaven\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Dimension_C-197_as_Chris's_version_of_Heaven\">Dimension C-197 as Chris's version of Heaven</span></h2>\n<p>Following the <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys</a> saga, which affirmed to Chris his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Dimension\" title=\"Dimension\">dimension</a> beliefs, Chris began to think of alternate dimension <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/C-197\" title=\"C-197\">C-197</a> as Heaven.

In 2009 he stated flatly that he believed in the concept,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-13\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">[13]</a></sup> but in 2014 he seemed more uncertain, writing “It is possible, but I'm not sure.”<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-lvlup_4-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-lvlup-4\">[4]</a></sup>. He has yet to offer any criteria for what might cause someone to be reincarnated. While reincarnation was and to some extent is still embraced by a few Christian sects, Chris has nothing to do with them and seems to have lifted the notion from <a href=\"/cwcki/Anime\" title=\"Anime\">somewhere else</a>.\n</p><p>Chris has suggested that he is himself a reincarnation of various people. In <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\"><i>Sonichu</i></a>, Chris's <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Comic_Chris\" title=\"Comic Chris\">fictional counterpart</a> is the reincarnation of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Ancient_leader_of_the_Cherokee_Clan\" title=\"Ancient leader of the Cherokee Clan\">ancient leader of the Cherokee Clan</a>, though he does not appear to believe this about himself in real life. However, during the epilogue of <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_12#Episode_26:_Prideful\" title=\"Sonichu 12\"><i>Sonichu</i> Episode 26</a>, Chris mentions a real-world dream in which he discovered he had been a (true and honest) <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">lesbian</a> hippie who attended <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock\" title=\"wikipedia:Woodstock\">Woodstock</a> in a recent past life. He credits this dream with his realization that he is a \"female soul\" and decision to identify as a transsexual as opposed to a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tomgirl\" title=\"Tomgirl\">cross-dresser</a>, further calling the psychological validity of his gender identity into question. Besides his own reincarnation, Chris's explanation of <a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris#In_the_comic\" title=\"Liquid Chris\">what happened to Liquid Chris</a> in the <i>Sonichu</i> canon mentions Liquid's soul being cleared of all memory of previous incarnations before being reincarnated, as what Chris considers an ironic punishment for someone who dared impersonate him.\n</p><p>Chris believes that in other <a href=\"/cwcki/Dimensions\" title=\"Dimensions\">dimensions</a>, people have the innate ability to swap bodies with others, even inanimate robots.\n</p><p>In a <a href=\"/cwcki/Jail_Letter_-_30_November_2021_(Eels_and_the_Egg-man)\" title=\"Jail Letter - 30 November 2021 (Eels and the Egg-man)\">jail letter direct to Eels and the Eggman</a>, Chris claims that as the Messiah, he can reincarnate or \"Respawn\" infinitely many times, and retain memory of all prior lives.
