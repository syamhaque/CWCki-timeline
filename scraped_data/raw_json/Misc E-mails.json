I have fully accepted Jesus as my savior.  And my mother, father, and what I've hear on television, all have informed me about heaven, hell, that the best way to live is as one does without much regret or with moderate acceptance and happiness.  And that \"God\" is within all of us, as energy and direction.   And in the end, we all believe in the same God(ess).  Yet also, if God is supposed to love us all, why does he let me continue to have a Lot of downs in my life?

I would not let my sister date him, so I ain't gunna hook anyone up with or for him. His behavior is his own, Jesus he's lucky he didn't get hauled off to jail for Wal-Mart innocent.
