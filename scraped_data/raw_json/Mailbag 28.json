I am disfortuned that you think my Aspergers is not True and Honest, which is what you suggest by suggesting that I know nothing about the <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">Autism</a>. I do have the Aspergers Papers; from work with my licensed psychotherapist who has years of working with children with developmental disorders (she is no pastoral councilor it is true, but she does the best she can) I have learned much about the Autism Spectrum.\n</p><p>Secondly, you remarked that ASPERCHU is a parody of your Sonichu, and of poor quality at that. Ignoring for the moment the rather rudeness of your statement that it is poor in quality (Some of us cannot afford Crayola Markers and many <a href=\"/cwcki/LittleBigPlanet\" title=\"LittleBigPlanet\">LittleBigPlanet</a> downloads to use as tools for our creations Christian, some of us only have received enough christmas tugboat to buy Adobe CS4 and a Wacom Tablet to work with), I must let you know ONCE AGAIN that ASPERCHU is most certainly NOT a <a href=\"/cwcki/Parody\" title=\"Parody\">parodic</a> work. In fact, ASPERCHU is a True and Honest creation from my Sound Mind and Heart with strengths given from my many joy-boys, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Gal-pal\" title=\"Gal-pal\">gal-pals</a> and my dearest sweetheart who all support me. However, I will extend the branch of olive and presume that it is possible you have simply confused it because you are not sure what a True Parody is (unlikely, but possible nonetheless). For the purpose of Extending your knowledge, I have included a new drawing which is a DELIBERATE and INTENTUAL parody, so as to set it apart from my ASPERCHU comics, which are Not parodies.\n</p><p>Please retract your statement, as it was very hurtful and rather petty of you. A great artist such as yourself has so many Fans that you surely must not feel threatened by the creations of an Up and Coming Aspiring artist such as me, who is also amassing a large following. There is room for more than One of us, Christian.
