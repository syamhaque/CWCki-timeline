These select people are what we call <b>passive observers</b>. They <s>enjoy</s> observe Chris's antics from the delightful view of the moral high-ground while not directly interfering with his life, and recognise that Chris really needs help from the people around him and trained professionals, not random people on the internet. \n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#The_CWCki_as_passive_observers\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The CWCki as passive observers</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Criteria\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Criteria</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Why_passive_observation_works\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Why passive observation works</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#You_don't_have_to_risk_becoming_an_easy_target\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">You don't have to risk becoming an easy target</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Concerns_with_privacy\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Concerns with privacy</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Prevention_of_further_degrading_a_mentally_ill_man's_sense_of_reality\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Prevention of further degrading a mentally ill man's sense of reality</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_CWCki_as_passive_observers\">The CWCki as passive observers</span></h2>\n<p>Some passive observers decide to record the more interesting and comedic events of Chris's life. On the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCki\" title=\"CWCki\">CWCki</a>, avoiding direct contact with Chris is essential — along with trying to remain as neutral and unbiased as possible — but a little ribbing is okay, so long as it doesn't <a href=\"/cwcki/Unholy_Quintet\" title=\"Unholy Quintet\">go too far</a>. The CWCki's wealth of information over the years has been gained from Chris's inability to keep information to himself - his incredible <a href=\"/cwcki/Honest_Content\" title=\"Honest Content\">honesty</a> has made sure we know everything we <a href=\"/cwcki/DIRTY,_CRAPPED_BRIEFS\" title=\"DIRTY, CRAPPED BRIEFS\">need to know</a> without having to befriend him. \n</p><p>Open-ended questions have also been a good way to get information in the past, as we've discovered from the <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag\" title=\"Mailbag\">Mailbags</a>, and details of how to ask Chris a good question are provided <a href=\"/cwcki/Passive_observers#Q&amp;A_Advisory_Guidelines\" title=\"Passive observers\">below</a>. Chris tends to interpret yes-or-no questions without subtext; for example, one person asked him if he listens to music while working on the comic, and he simply replied \"yes\". He missed that there may have been subtext (what kind of music, does it help/distract you, has it ever provided inspiration, etc.), and didn't provide much information. However, he has a tendency to be incredibly <a href=\"/cwcki/Honest_Content\" title=\"Honest Content\">candid</a> when asked an open-ended question.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Criteria\">Criteria</span></h2>\n<p>Passive observers are very strongly discouraged from doing the following:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Attempting to contact Chris — Do not directly message Chris on any of the social platforms he is on. If Chris tries to contact you or mentions you in a comment, just ignore him.</li>\n<li><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/White-Knighting\" title=\"White-Knighting\">Defending</a> Chris — Chris is by no means innocent, and he is beyond help from people who aren't professionals, which you most likely aren't.</li>\n<li>Expressing <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/A-Logging\" title=\"A-Logging\">hatred</a> for Chris and over-exaggerating his flaws — For the simple reason that <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Weening#If_you_fail_hard_enough,_you_will_become_a_target_for_trolls_yourself\" title=\"Weening\">this makes you no better than Chris</a>. If you really hate whatever Chris is doing, you don’t need to threaten or otherwise get actively involved with him over it.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Enablers\" title=\"Enablers\">Encouraging Chris’ bad habits</a> — Playing along with his lifestyle is a very bad idea, as it only gives him more of a reason to remain as childish as ever.</li>\n<li><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Weening\" title=\"Weening\">Attempting to troll or annoy Chris</a> — This is not only is most likely to fail, it's also fruitless and often comes back to bite you in the ass.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Carpetbaggers\" title=\"Carpetbaggers\">Attempting to profit off of Chris's fame</a> - Often times, those that do this, usually big names, get in a heap of trouble for exploiting Chris's infamy.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Why_passive_observation_works\">Why passive observation works</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"You_don.27t_have_to_risk_becoming_an_easy_target\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"You_don't_have_to_risk_becoming_an_easy_target\">You don't have to risk becoming an easy target</span></h3>\n<p>Kiwi Farms is the internet equivalent of Roanapur from <i><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lagoon\" title=\"wikipedia:Black Lagoon\">Black Lagoon</a></i>: a seedy, shady underworld that's dominated by thugs, gangsters and mafiosi and \"governed\" by leaders of various major organized crime groups, and any outsiders that try to meddle in their affairs are met with vicious retaliation by the inhabitants. Much like Roanapur, Kiwi Farms is a seedy, shady website that's dominated and ruled by the <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">trolls</a>, and any outsiders that try to meddle in their affairs are met with vicious retaliation by the inhabitants. This includes getting involved with lolcows that they're documenting, such as Chris. Trying to get into contact with Chris for one's own ends is the equivalent of an outsider stepping into Roanapur unprepared: you're going to get viciously targeted. As such it is best to not try to interact with Chris in any way shape or form unless you wanna risk being a possible target for the trolls themselves.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Concerns_with_privacy\">Concerns with privacy</span></h3>\n<p>In the post-<a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys</a> era, users of <a href=\"/cwcki/Kiwi_Farms\" title=\"Kiwi Farms\">Kiwi Farms</a> have made it a habit to dox people who tried to contact Chris with the express purpose of getting directly involved in his life for their own ends as a deterrent.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Prevention_of_further_degrading_a_mentally_ill_man.27s_sense_of_reality\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Prevention_of_further_degrading_a_mentally_ill_man's_sense_of_reality\">Prevention of further degrading a mentally ill man's sense of reality</span></h3>\n<p>Even by the time he was discovered by SomethingAwful and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/4chan\" title=\"4chan\">4chan</a> in October 2007, his grip on reality was already weak, such as his belief he can <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Curse-Ye-Ha-Me-Ha\" title=\"Curse-Ye-Ha-Me-Ha\">curse</a> people who have inconvenienced him. <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Marvin\" title=\"Marvin\">Marvin</a> (a former <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Miscreant\" title=\"Miscreant\">Miscreant</a>) later <a href=\"/cwcki/Kiwi_Farms_posts_(Marvin)#Subverted_White_Knights\" title=\"Kiwi Farms posts (Marvin)\">confided</a> that his group regularly interfered with any attempts to help Chris by deleting emails before Chris could read them or by <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Manipulation\" title=\"Manipulation\">manipulating</a> Chris to believing the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/White_knights\" title=\"White knights\">white knights</a> were leaking information. This did no favors to a man with an already weak grip on reality and virtually nonexistent social skills, and the Miscreants only ended their Truman Show engineering over him once his dad died. By that point, the damage had been done as what they have done left Chris with lingering suspicion and paranoia as to the motives of others, and he has occasionally posted on social media channels about how he suspects people offline of being trolls, albeit without any real evidence. Following the death of <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler\" title=\"Bob Chandler\">his father</a> in September 2011, Chris's mental state has taken a freefall, as he was immediately thrust into the world of adult responsibilities that he was mentally and emotionally ill-equipped to deal with due to a lifetime of being coddled by <a href=\"/cwcki/Borb\" title=\"Borb\">his parents</a> and thus increasingly invested into magical beliefs as solutions to the problems presented by <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Reality\" title=\"Reality\">reality</a>. His increasingly deteriorating mental state has resulted in numerous <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_coping\" title=\"Chris and coping\">maladaptive coping mechanisms</a> such as <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/escapism\" title=\"wikipedia:escapism\">escapism</a> (<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Astral_projection\" title=\"Astral projection\">Astral projection</a>, the <a href=\"/cwcki/Dimensional_Merge\" title=\"Dimensional Merge\">Dimensional Merge</a>), <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalization_(psychology)\" title=\"wikipedia:Rationalization (psychology)\">rationalization</a> (\"I can't go to BABScon because of <a href=\"/cwcki/COVID-19\" title=\"COVID-19\">COVID-19</a>, so it must be a part of the merge!\"), <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Nostalgia\" title=\"Nostalgia\">Nostalgia</a> (trying to relive his <a href=\"/cwcki/Manchester_High_School\" title=\"Manchester High School\">high school days</a>), <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dissociation\" title=\"wikipedia:dissociation\">dissociation</a> and <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_behaviors_(anxiety)\" title=\"wikipedia:Safety behaviors (anxiety)\">safety behaviors</a> (<a href=\"/cwcki/Spirit_possession\" title=\"Spirit possession\">Spirit possession</a>), and <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sensitization\" title=\"wikipedia:sensitization\">sensitization</a> (i.e. flipping out over blocks on <a href=\"/cwcki/Twitter\" title=\"Twitter\">Twitter</a>, resulting in the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Soft_Exile\" title=\"Soft Exile\">Soft Exile</a>). By the time of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys</a> in 2017, Chris's mental state has deteriorated so badly that he was <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Dancing_with_Magi-Chan\" title=\"Dancing with Magi-Chan\">dancing with Magi-Chan</a> at <a href=\"/cwcki/BronyCon\" title=\"BronyCon\">BronyCon</a> 2017, just a month prior to his interaction with them. After the Idea Guys were ousted by the <a href=\"/cwcki/Guard_Dogs\" title=\"Guard Dogs\">Guard Dogs</a>, the damage had been done, as they have devolved Chris's mental state into a too far gone state that he has chose to completely alienate himself from his <a href=\"/cwcki/Pok%C3%A9mon_League_friends\" title=\"Pokémon League friends\">remaining real-life friends</a> in in favor of his <a href=\"/cwcki/Imaginary_friends\" title=\"Imaginary friends\">imaginary friends</a> and internet <a href=\"/cwcki/Enablers\" title=\"Enablers\">enablers</a>. With Chris being blacklisted by virtually every convention (one of the last vestiges of real-life socialization for him) due to his <a href=\"/cwcki/Affair_with_Mother\" title=\"Affair with Mother\">incest</a> in July-August 2021, Chris has made himself into a pariah. Trying to further degrade his already horrid mental state is the equivalent of kicking down a weak guy who cannot defend himself at all.
