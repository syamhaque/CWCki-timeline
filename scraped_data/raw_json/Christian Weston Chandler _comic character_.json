2017, when the <a href=\"/cwcki/Allison_Amber\" title=\"Allison Amber\">new mayor</a> was mentioned) of his fictional town, <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a>. Unlike real life, comic-Chris is popular, good-looking (<a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_art\" title=\"Chris and art\">notionally speaking</a>), and surrounded by adoring women (whose real-life counterparts are generally <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">trolls</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Gal_pal\" title=\"Gal pal\">gal-pals</a> who <a href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Schroeder\" title=\"Megan Schroeder\">hate him</a>, or fictional creations like <a href=\"/cwcki/Allison_Amber\" title=\"Allison Amber\">Allison Amber</a>). He also has the ability to change himself into <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris-chan_Sonichu\" title=\"Chris-chan Sonichu\">Chris-chan Sonichu</a> and use any and all of the powers of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Electric_Hedgehog_Pok%C3%A9mon\" title=\"Electric Hedgehog Pokémon\">Electric Hedgehog Pokémon</a> at will, thus rendering Sonichu and company completely superfluous. \n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:FattyLOL.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"302\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/b/b0/FattyLOL.jpg/300px-FattyLOL.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/b/b0/FattyLOL.jpg 1.5x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:FattyLOL.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>A typical comic depiction of Chris – a tall, broad shouldered, handsome young man. Compare to the real hunched, fatty, double-chinned Chris.</div></div></div>\n<p>Any characteristics comic Chris possess stem from Chris's attempt to portray himself as the lovable loser type of character, known from any generic romantic comedy. He is portrayed as noble, brave, intelligent, and surrounded by cartoon characters who fawn over him. However, so as not to appear to be a COMPLETE Mary Sue, comic-Chris also has trouble with <a href=\"/cwcki/Love_Quest\" title=\"Love Quest\">finding a girlfriend</a>, is shown to have a limited ability to fight off his <a href=\"/cwcki/Manajerks\" title=\"Manajerks\">enemies</a>, and is regularly in need of help from his supportive friends in order to overcome his problems. In the comic, real-life relics like his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Medallions_of_Fail\" title=\"Medallions of Fail\">medallion</a> are not mere paraphernalia – they're magical objects which can make his <a href=\"/cwcki/China\" title=\"China\">dreams come true</a>. \n</p><p>He is of course the creator of CWCville, complete with a doting <a href=\"/cwcki/Allison_Amber\" title=\"Allison Amber\">secretary</a>, now <a href=\"/cwcki/February_2017_Facebook_Posts#CWCville_is_a_sanctuary_city\" title=\"February 2017 Facebook Posts\">heiress to the CWCville legacy</a>, on whom he dumps all his <a href=\"/cwcki/Semen\" title=\"Semen\">dirty work</a>, which she takes with a smile. However, his actual role relative to the citizens of his city is closer to god-king than mere creator; his office was permanent and indisputable during his time in it, and every character reveres him as their creator and supreme being, and is unswervingly loyal to him for no reason. If it weren't totally obvious, Chris's comic persona is a pure wish-fulfilment Mary Sue. Because Chris has trouble <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">defining the line between reality and fiction</a>, added with his compulsive knack to cling onto <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Honor_Roll\" title=\"Honor Roll\">anything</a> that would justify him as a person, Chris tends to view his achievements in the comic as genuine achievements, and held the title of Mayor of CWCville when addressing himself.\n</p><p>Sonichu is the main character of his self-titled comic in name only. While all the <a href=\"/cwcki/Electric_Hedgehog_Pok%C3%A9mon\" title=\"Electric Hedgehog Pokémon\">Electric Hedgehog Pokémon</a> tend to make up an ensemble cast with equal weight on the story, if there is any true lead protagonist to the series, then it is Chris. The comic's narrative focuses on him and the problems he has to deal with, and virtually everything in the world of CWCville only seems to matter in relation to Chris (much like the real world). Towards the end of the initial run of Sonichu, Chris began to feel that the focus on his trolls and personal problems were distracting the series from its original purpose, and created <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_10\" title=\"Sonichu 10\">Sonichu 10</a> to wrap up his storylines in the most gruesome, violent but satisfying way possible, supposedly to let his character retire in a blaze of glory.\n</p><p>Prior to appearing in <i>Sonichu</i> #11, Chris updated his in-comic incarnation to reflect his transgenderism in 2014, with the resulting design looking even less like his real self than he did before transitioning. He draws himself as a complete female, with a feminine shape (relative to the featureless rectangles he generally uses for bodies, that is) and breasts. His <a href=\"/cwcki/Hair\" title=\"Hair\">hair</a>, greasy, thin and receding in real life, is full and feminine. As is customary, his <a href=\"/cwcki/Heterochromia\" title=\"Heterochromia\">heterochromia</a> is hugely exaggerated and he is intended to look attractive. That being said, he still drew himself fucking Sonichu in the ass with his <a href=\"/cwcki/Duck\" title=\"Duck\">Duck</a> at the request of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys</a>, ostensibly to ensure that <a href=\"/cwcki/Crystal_Weston_Chandler_(daughter)\" title=\"Crystal Weston Chandler (daughter)\">GodBear-given daughter</a> comes into this world, so at best, this iteration of the character is intersex.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Atrocities\">Atrocities</span></h3>\n<p><i>See also: <a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_unheroic_protagonist_actions\" title=\"List of unheroic protagonist actions\">List of unheroic protagonist actions</a></i>\n</p><p>Predictably, Chris's creation of a world in which he is god results in even more insane behavior than is exhibited his real-life counterpart, primarily due to him (and his <a href=\"/cwcki/Electric_Hedgehog_Pok%C3%A9mon\" title=\"Electric Hedgehog Pokémon\">superpowered goons</a>) possessing the power to actually carry out his <a href=\"/cwcki/Death_threats\" title=\"Death threats\">threats</a> in a controlled environment where he can (attempt to) portray himself as morally superior.\n</p><p>In only 11 issues (including 4 specials), he permanently crippled <a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris\" title=\"Liquid Chris\">someone</a> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Megatron_Pistol\" title=\"Megatron Pistol\">by</a> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_Special_4\" title=\"Sonichu Special 4\">shooting</a> him in the legs after he'd surrendered, <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu#0\" title=\"Sonichu\">completely destroyed the life</a> of a <a href=\"/cwcki/Jerkhief\" title=\"Jerkhief\">man</a> who was simply doing his job and then callously mocking him by saying that <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\"><i>he'd</i></a> suffered worse, destroyed a populated building which he had sealed up beforehand to ensure no living thing escaped and later tried to blame it on the building's lackluster security, broke into <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">an old woman</a>'s home and brutally attacked her to the extent of causing permanent paralysis, directly ordered the murder of over 1500 people in the self-perpetrated destruction of the <a href=\"/cwcki/4-cent_garbage.com\" title=\"4-cent garbage.com\">4-cent_garbage.com</a> building, orchestrated a purging of <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">homosexuals</a> and asexuals, and arranged a <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu#10\" title=\"Sonichu\">show trial</a> for <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Asperpedia_Four\" title=\"Asperpedia Four\">four men</a> in an openly biased court, before personally executing them in brutal and inhumane ways – forcing <a href=\"/cwcki/Kel\" title=\"Kel\">chil</a><a href=\"/cwcki/Sandy_Rosechu\" title=\"Sandy Rosechu\">dren</a> to commit first-degree murder in the process – for the crime of making a <a href=\"/cwcki/Asperchu\" title=\"Asperchu\">parody webcomic</a>. \n</p><p>It should be noted that Chris's avatar undertakes all of these activities with self-righteous euphoria, and offers no justification, nor does he display any remorse.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Sonichu_.230\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sonichu_#0\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_0\" title=\"Sonichu 0\"><i>Sonichu</i> #0</a></span></h3>\n<p>Right from <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_0\" title=\"Sonichu 0\"><i>Sonichu</i> #0</a> Chris is depicted on the front cover commanding Sonichu to \"Zap to the extreme!\", and within the comic itself, congratulating Sonichu for his victory. At this point, Chris is drawing himself only semi-realistically, but he is still a minor character. <i>Sonichu</i> #0 is one of the rare issues that is actually based primarily around the idea of Sonichu as the protagonist.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Sonichu_.231\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sonichu_#1\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_1\" title=\"Sonichu 1\"><i>Sonichu</i> #1</a></span></h3>\n<p><i>Sonichu</i> #1 is perhaps Chris's lowest-key outing in the entire comic, merely depicting himself commenting on the actions of the characters, and, bizarrely, his own <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_art\" title=\"Chris and art\">drawing ability</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Sonichu_.232\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sonichu_#2\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_2\" title=\"Sonichu 2\"><i>Sonichu</i> #2</a></span></h3>\n<p>Having again drawn himself on the cover, by <i>Sonichu</i> #2 Chris has turned himself into a fully-fledged main character. Chris depicts himself as the messiah of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Anchuent_Prophecy\" title=\"Anchuent Prophecy\">Anchuent Prophecy</a> foretold by his <a href=\"/cwcki/Ancient_leader_of_the_Cherokee_Clan\" title=\"Ancient leader of the Cherokee Clan\">ancestors</a>. It is in this issue that he first gains his ability to turn into <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris-chan_Sonichu\" title=\"Chris-chan Sonichu\">Chris-chan Sonichu</a>, an event which will dominate the rest of the series to the point of <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a>'s redundancy.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Sonichu_.233\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sonichu_#3\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_3\" title=\"Sonichu 3\"><i>Sonichu</i> #3</a></span></h3>\n<p>After being heavily featured in the previous comic, Chris takes a back seat in order to put a spotlight on the <a href=\"/cwcki/Chaotic_Combo\" title=\"Chaotic Combo\">Chaotic Combo</a>. Sadly, he still can't resist adding his head onto the first page.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Sonichu_.234\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sonichu_#4\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_4\" title=\"Sonichu 4\"><i>Sonichu</i> #4</a></span></h3>\n<p>The legendary comic made entirely up of sub-episodes about Chris's life. Things get a little confusing because not only are the <a href=\"/cwcki/Electric_Hedgehog_Pok%C3%A9mon\" title=\"Electric Hedgehog Pokémon\">Electric Hedgehog Pokémon</a> depicted as existing in Real Chris's universe, but he also has super-powers with which to battle the <a href=\"/cwcki/Jerkop\" title=\"Jerkop\">Jerkops</a>. Again, Chris is depicting himself with selfless friends and powers he wished he actually had, but doesn't. And all the powers and Pokémon in the world still don't stop him getting beaten by the Jerkops or being trolled by <a href=\"/cwcki/Hanna\" title=\"Hanna\">Hanna</a>. This comic also marks the introduction of <a href=\"/cwcki/Crystal_Weston_Chandler_(sister)\" title=\"Crystal Weston Chandler (sister)\">Crystal</a>, his imagined sister, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_sex#Incest\" title=\"Chris and sex\">on whose beauty he remarks numerous times</a>.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:202px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Chris5.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"160\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/1/1e/Chris5.jpg/200px-Chris5.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/1/1e/Chris5.jpg 1.5x\" width=\"200\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Chris5.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Manga Chris is so kawaii!

Of course, in reality, Sarah couldn't have cared less what Chris thought of the wedding, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">but Chris felt that showing his acceptance was vitally important</a>. An interpretation could be made that Chris is battling the two versions of himself – the side who wants Sarah all to himself (Real Chris, played by <a href=\"/cwcki/Wes_Iseli\" title=\"Wes Iseli\">Wes Iseli</a>) and the side who wants Sarah to be happy (Comic Chris). It probably helped that by this point Chris had transferred his feelings for Sarah over to <a href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Schroeder\" title=\"Megan Schroeder\">Megan</a>, who makes her début appearance as <a href=\"/cwcki/Sailor_Megtune\" title=\"Sailor Megtune\">Sailor Megtune</a>, allowing him to make the noble choice a lot easier than it would have otherwise been.\n</p><p>This comic also introduces the pseudo-manga art style (thanks a lot, Megan) that would come to characterize later comics. While the art doesn't get <i>better</i>, it at least becomes comparatively more consistent than it did previously.\n</p><p>By the next episode, things start to get confusing. Yes, Chris is Mayor of <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a> and can order around public servants, but he still can't find a <a href=\"/cwcki/Boyfriend-free_girl\" title=\"Boyfriend-free girl\">girlfriend</a>. Despite this, he continues to depict himself as a noble warrior of <a href=\"/cwcki/China\" title=\"China\">love</a>, protecting all of <a href=\"/cwcki/Virginia\" title=\"Virginia\">Virginia</a> from <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">those who would attempt to take it away</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Sonichu_.236\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sonichu_#6\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_6\" title=\"Sonichu 6\"><i>Sonichu</i> #6</a></span></h3>\n<p><i>Sonichu</i> #6 is the first issue to go into detail about how Comic Chris manages to run a city while sitting around getting <a href=\"/cwcki/Hanna\" title=\"Hanna\">trolled</a>. Opening with Real Chris discovering that his beloved dog <a href=\"/cwcki/Patti_Chandler\" title=\"Patti Chandler\">Patti Chandler</a> can talk, the action soon switches to Comic Chris as they enter CWCville. Chris introduces <a href=\"/cwcki/Patti-Chan\" title=\"Patti-Chan\">Patti-Chan</a> to Allison Amber, a Hollywood starlet who inexplicably gave up her promising career to run CWCville while Chris was sitting in his <a href=\"/cwcki/Attraction_Location\" title=\"Attraction Location\">attraction locations</a>. This character is indicative of how Chris portrays himself as so charismatic that young women drop everything to do his bidding. He is the \"Big Cheese\". Either way, fictional Allison Amber has a boyfriend, so Chris loses out in his own comic yet again.\n</p><p>Comic Chris spends the rest of the comic bemoaning his loneliness, and making bizarre and scarcely-comprehensible \"hints\" that <a href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Schroeder\" title=\"Megan Schroeder\">Megan</a> is his true <a href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart\" title=\"Sweetheart\">sweetheart</a>. Even in comic form, Megan wants none of this.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Sonichu_.237\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sonichu_#7\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_7\" title=\"Sonichu 7\"><i>Sonichu</i> #7</a></span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:119px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Chris7.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"205\" src=\"/w/images/3/37/Chris7.jpg\" width=\"117\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Chris7.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Chris as depicted in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Issue_7\" title=\"Issue 7\"><i>Sonichu</i> #7</a>.</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Chrisandsammy.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"175\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/8/8b/Chrisandsammy.jpg/300px-Chrisandsammy.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/8/8b/Chrisandsammy.jpg 1.5x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Chrisandsammy.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Chris and <a href=\"/cwcki/Sammy\" title=\"Sammy\">Sammy</a> together.</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Set1pic2.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"412\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/7/7b/Set1pic2.jpg/300px-Set1pic2.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/7/7b/Set1pic2.jpg/450px-Set1pic2.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/7/7b/Set1pic2.jpg/600px-Set1pic2.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Set1pic2.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Comic Chris in 2014, showing off a \"Tomgirl\" look.</div></div></div>\n<p>The megalomania begins on the cover, which is decorated with tiny pictures of the important moments of Chris's life, such as the time he held a basketball or tricked Megan into being photographed with him. \n</p><p>The comic itself revolves around Comic Chris and Megan, who is depicted as struggling with her feelings for Chris (in reality, at this point, she hated him). The comic at this point was being used as a tool to attract Megan, so much of the extraneous action is centered on the dating life of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(species)\" title=\"Sonichu (species)\">Sonichus</a> as a (barely) veiled hint as to what direction their friendship should take. The courting of Megan is also why it's the most manga-esque issue to date, which in turn results in Chris's self-depictions being hugely inconsistent in style.\n</p><p>This issue is also notorious for its introduction of <a href=\"/cwcki/Sammy\" title=\"Sammy\">Sammy</a>. Intended to be a bumbling, <a href=\"/cwcki/Family_Guy\" title=\"Family Guy\">Peter Griffin</a>-type counterpart to Comic Chris, Sammy is extremely <a href=\"/cwcki/Slow-in-the-minds\" title=\"Slow-in-the-minds\">stupid</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Obesity\" title=\"Obesity\">massively overweight</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/DIRTY,_CRAPPED_BRIEFS\" title=\"DIRTY, CRAPPED BRIEFS\">shits his pants</a>, which results in a far greater resemblance to the real Chris than Comic Chris has ever had.\n</p><p>Halfway through making this comic Chris was being trolled relentlessly, so he responded by trapping himself in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Time_Void\" title=\"Time Void\">Time Void</a>, and thus removing himself from the direct action in the comic... A measure that would not last very long.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Sonichu_.238\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sonichu_#8\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_8\" title=\"Sonichu 8\"><i>Sonichu</i> #8</a></span></h3>\n<p>Unable to keep himself completely out of the action, Chris somehow emerges temporarily from the Time Void on the 10th floor in the <a href=\"/cwcki/4-cent_garbage.com\" title=\"4-cent garbage.com\">4-cent_garbage.com</a> building in order to physically assault an employee who is working on a caricature of the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/The_Oversized_Drinking_Straw\" title=\"The Oversized Drinking Straw\">over-sized drinking straw</a> picture, while <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu\" title=\"Rosechu\">Rosechu</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a> cheer him on in unison.

The first time he shows up is during <a href=\"/cwcki/Ivy\" title=\"Ivy\">Ivy</a>'s \"vision\" portraying her being with Chris as told by <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/GodJesus\" title=\"GodJesus\">God and Jesus</a>. The second time is at the end of the comic. In the scene, <a href=\"/cwcki/Magi-Chan\" title=\"Magi-Chan\">Magi-Chan</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Wild_Sonichu\" title=\"Wild Sonichu\">Wild Sonichu</a> discover the <a href=\"/cwcki/Time_Void\" title=\"Time Void\">Time Void</a> and end up pulling Chris out of it. Fifteen minutes later, Chris, as <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris-Chan_Sonichu\" title=\"Chris-Chan Sonichu\">Chris-Chan Sonichu</a>, unveils some sort of plan (which isn't elaborated) and he races off. On the final page, Chris declares that he, and anyone he created out of his sweetheart search misadventures, will never show up in the pages of his comic again... though the last page presumes that it'll continue in <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler%27s_Adult_Chronicles\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler's Adult Chronicles\">Christian Weston Chandler's Adult Chronicles</a></i>.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Sonichu_.2310\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sonichu_#10\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_10\" title=\"Sonichu 10\"><i>Sonichu</i> #10</a></span></h3>\n<p>Despite the announcement at the end of the previous issue, Chris's character returns and immediately places himself in the middle of the spotlight. During the time this issue was being drawn, Chris was boiling with <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_anger\" title=\"Chris and anger\">rage</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Death_threats\" title=\"Death threats\">crying for the blood</a> of <a href=\"/cwcki/Jack_Thaddeus\" title=\"Jack Thaddeus\">Jack Thaddeus</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">Clyde Cash</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Evan\" title=\"Evan\">and</a> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Asperpedia\" title=\"Asperpedia\">every</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Alec_Benson_Leary\" title=\"Alec Benson Leary\">other</a> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Troll\" title=\"Troll\">troll</a> and for the  <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Love_Day\" title=\"Christian Love Day\">\"straightening out\"</a> of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Homosexual\" title=\"Homosexual\">homosexual</a> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/JERK\" title=\"JERK\">males</a> due to all the gay ads in his <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia\" title=\"CWCipedia\">CWCipedia</a>. As such, whatever small narrative restraints Comic Chris had possessed have been extinguished, and the character acts purely as a mouthpiece (and avenging fist) for his creator.\n</p><p>At the beginning of the comic Chris discusses the future, wherein he is to be married to a woman named <a href=\"/cwcki/Lovely_Weather\" title=\"Lovely Weather\">Lovely Weather</a> and, since he slept with her, he is no longer a virgin. Apparently, homosexuality is such a big problem in the future that Chris was also asked by future scientists to donate some of his \"straight\" blood so they could use it for a vaccine. Chris, however, hoping to employ it on the homos in the present, sends Magi-Chan back to the future to steal a crate of the vaccine. This is contrary to the time-travel logic he established in \"Time Hogs\", wherein it is assumed that time is in flux and cannot be altered.\n</p><p>Chris moves on to fight some devil trolls who had infested his <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC%27s_Sonichu_Site!\" title=\"CWC's Sonichu Site!\">old website</a>, and then he attacks and destroys 4-cent_garbage.com leaving a hundred people dead in the process, including Jack Thaddeus and Clyde Cash, who are forced to commit suicide. \n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:202px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Christinecomicdrawing.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"220\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/a/a0/Christinecomicdrawing.jpg/200px-Christinecomicdrawing.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/a/a0/Christinecomicdrawing.jpg/300px-Christinecomicdrawing.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/a/a0/Christinecomicdrawing.jpg/400px-Christinecomicdrawing.jpg 2x\" width=\"200\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Christinecomicdrawing.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Chris during his <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_11\" title=\"Sonichu 11\">\"physical transformation\"</a></i>.

After Naitsirhc turns back into his old incarnation, Chris declares the vaccine a success, and gives the order to pollute all the drinking water in the world with it, effectually eradicating homosexuality, along with asexuality.\n</p><p><a href=\"/cwcki/Meg_Griffin\" title=\"Meg Griffin\">Meg Griffin</a> of all people suddenly turns up and claims to be a fan of <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\"><i>Sonichu</i></a>, much to Chris's pleasure. After beating up some random guy who called Meg \"sir\" and Chris \"madam\", he cheats on Lovely Weather by making out with her, after her confirming that she is consensual. Unbeknownst to Chris, Meg is really <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Silvana_Rosechu\" title=\"Silvana Rosechu\">Silvana Rosechu</a> in disguise, and Chris has therefore been trolled.\n</p><p>Once again Chris takes the time to apologize without really apologizing, this time with a babbling insincere speech to the homosexuals who might have been offended by the fact that he just committed something comparative to genocide against them. With that out of the way, Chris takes out the <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_Balls\" title=\"Sonichu Balls\">Sonichu Balls</a> and transforms into <a href=\"/cwcki/Collosal_Chan\" title=\"Collosal Chan\">Collosal Chan</a>, and together with Sonichu, now transformed into <a href=\"/cwcki/Ultra_Sonichu\" title=\"Ultra Sonichu\">Ultra Sonichu</a>, sets out to \"right some wrongs\". Aside from the minor detail of getting <a href=\"/cwcki/Crystal_Weston_Chandler_(sister)\" title=\"Crystal Weston Chandler (sister)\">Crystal</a> out of the mirror, <a href=\"/cwcki/Collosal_Chan\" title=\"Collosal Chan\">Hobo Chan's</a> main priority is getting rid of <a href=\"/cwcki/Asperchu\" title=\"Asperchu\">Asperchu</a>, which he does by breaking into Asperchu/Alec Benson Leary's house, fingerbanging his \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Xbox\" title=\"Xbox\">HEXBox Pavilion</a>\" to the breaking point and turning Asperchu and the rest of the comic cast into \"improved\" versions of themselves.\n</p><p>After this, Hobo-Chan fights <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Mary Lee Walsh</a>, leaving her completely paralyzed and sentenced to a lifetime in CWCville's maximum-security prison (killing her is out of the question after the <a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris\" title=\"Liquid Chris\">Liquid Chris</a> furore). After that, Chris reverts to his human form and gives a speech. Meanwhile, Simonla Rosechu is murdered, and the Asperpedia Four are arrested for the crime. And at the same times as Chris starts giving out blessings and apologies to the Asperpedia Four, they are subjected to a show trial for their crime against him and CWCville, and are then brutally executed by the Sonichus, with Chris partaking in Alec's execution by electrocution, and personally carrying out Mao's execution by <i>tearing him apart</i> with his psychic powers.\n</p><p>The huge issue finally concludes with Chris urging everyone to celebrate his masturbatory holiday, <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Love_Day\" title=\"Christian Love Day\">Christian Love Day</a>, and leap and dance and sing praise in His name, for great is His wisdom and His benevolence. It truly is <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_writing\" title=\"Chris and writing\">his story</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_art\" title=\"Chris and art\">nothing less</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Sonichu_.2311\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sonichu_#11\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_11\" title=\"Sonichu 11\"><i>Sonichu</i> #11</a></span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:CWC_gets_kicked.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"225\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/8/8b/CWC_gets_kicked.jpg/300px-CWC_gets_kicked.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/8/8b/CWC_gets_kicked.jpg/450px-CWC_gets_kicked.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/8/8b/CWC_gets_kicked.jpg/600px-CWC_gets_kicked.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:CWC_gets_kicked.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div><a href=\"/cwcki/CHRIS!!!_CHANDLER!!!\" title=\"CHRIS!!!

As the episode takes place in <a href=\"/cwcki/2008\" title=\"2008\">2008</a>, Chris is depicted as becoming \"Christine\" much sooner than in real life; this is confusingly explained by retconning the time travel plot so that Magi-Chan helped 2007-Chris to transition into a tomgirl in 2014 and then sent her back to 2007/08.
