[<i>Laughs</i>] You know, work just keeps trying to make me stay late so, um- \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> What’s up?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Oh, you know, this and that. I went to my first yoga class today that was good. I feel like-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oh, that’s exciting!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uh, I’m sorry what?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I said that’s exciting.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Oh, OK, yeah it was, and it was very good. It was also, you know, classes uh, weekly apparently, so I’ll definitely be going to future ones including the one next week.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> That’s cool, well I mean, you know you must be happy because of all the endorphins that are running through your body because that happens after exercise. I mean, do you feel more relaxed, because you sound kind of stressed right now. \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Aw yeah well, little bit, um [sigh]. I was expecting, I was expecting you to call and then like, you know, you know, you come in as unavailable or restricted you know. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Uh-huh.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> There’s been this, this <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Troll\" title=\"Troll\">troll</a>, I think this troll is just trying to call me back, you know I’m hearing the beeping like and go figure the damn troll turned out to have been a female troll.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oh.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I was like I told her, “Quit calling me here, I’m expecting a call from my girlfriend!” \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> WHAT?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I’m sorry, I mean- I mean, it was just a troll. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oh, you said it as an excuse. Right, right.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, but anyway-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Because I know you don’t think that of me right now because we’re friends. But-\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I mean you are a girl and you are my friend.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Right, right.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> So you are my girl friend.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>Laughs</i>]\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I understand that. Yeah, okay, so anyway then the girl had the nerve to call me back and she said, “Your girlfriend's a <a href=\"/cwcki/Kimmi\" title=\"Kimmi\">blow-up doll</a>.” That’s how then I learned that it was a woman--female troll. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oh gosh, did her number come through?  \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> No, she was a restricted number.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Ugh… Well maybe you should get a new phone number, you know, and not give it out to the trolls.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, but unfortunately I got this phone number linked up on my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Resume\" title=\"Resume\">resume</a>, and it’s in my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Playstation_Network\" title=\"Playstation Network\">Playstation Network</a> account, and a whole lot-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well you know you can change all those things, but I understand, I mean yeah, that is difficult. \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bob\" title=\"Bob\">my father</a> would tell you the same thing as well, you know. He would change the home phone number, but so many things that’s linked to. A lot more than mine, I tell you what. [Sound of door opening] Anyway, aside from that. I here and my father went out within the <a href=\"/cwcki/Burger_King\" title=\"Burger King\">Burger King</a> at lunch and I didn’t get my walk in at the, around the neighborhood like I would have wanted to beforehand because of that. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Uh-huh.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I had a side salad, you know usually I go there cause this Burger King gives two Whoppers for three dollars, um I- \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, when did you wake up?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Probably I got up around 11:30 this morning.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Yeah I guess that’s a little early for you, because normally you wake up around noon. [<i>laughs</i>]\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, [inaudible] but I expected my father to, like you know, he would want to go out to Burger so I had a bowl of oatmeal...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Uh-huh.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> ...and then, you know, that got me filled so all I really needed was the side salad, so I spent a dollar on that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well oatmeal is supposed to be very filling so I’m surprised you needed a salad after that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah maybe, this was like an hour or two after I had the oatmeal.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Wow, I don’t get hungry til, like, much later but- [<i>laughs</i>] \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> It was just something to munch on anyway. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Uh huh.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> You know vegetables are always good for you anyway. Anyway, aside from that I, after we got back home I had to leave right away because, you know…[stuttering] yesterday I went up to Harris Teeter because my mom needed some more water that was on, you know bottles of waters on sale for a dollar or two less than the Food Lion.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Uh huh.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Actually while I was there I looked up your Febreze, because you know, when we were talking I wasn’t sure if you were talking about air freshener or fabric softener. I realized that Febreze does make fabric refresher and I realized that’s what you were talking about. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Right.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> So I went over to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Target\" title=\"Target\">Target</a> and found that it was on a temporary fifty-cent price cut there. So I bought me a bottle of the lavender scented. But then <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Barb\" title=\"Barb\">my mom</a> was telling me, “Oh yeah there’s like a bottle of Febreze, there’s like a thing of Febreze in the car.” I wasn’t sure what she was talking about, it thought she was talking about the air freshener. I mean I thought she was talking about the air freshener. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Uh-huh.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> But then I come home with the lavender-scented Febreze fabric refresher but it turns out that was a bottle of fabric refresher too, except it was the allergen reducer. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oh OK. \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I don’t really like the way that one smells, so-  \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> The allergen reducer.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Yeah, It just doesn’t have- It smells clean but I don’t like it.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hmm. OK, I sampled, smelled the two anyway and uh, I kinda liked the allergen reducer a little better, so I’ll finish that up and I’ll get the lavender-scented one, but I needed a few more dollars in my wallet anyway so I ended up returning the lavender-scented one. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Wait, you returned something you already used?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> No I didn’t use it, all I had to do was just unscrew the top and smell it. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Hmm… still you opened it and that makes it, that’s just not safe. Either way.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Anyway they still took it back and I got my four-something back.  \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK.  \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> So I’ll finish up the allergen reducer and then like, you know, I’ll spend the five bucks and get the lavender again.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Which reminds me, yeah, I need to let you know about my current finances, I just haven’t been able to lately because I was busy. Anyway, yeah, went to Target, returned the Febreze, and then also I ordered something from Goodwill that came with a free gift which is like a three set, set of three kitchen tongs. Couldn’t reuse [inaudible] at the time so I donated them to Goodwill and then I went to Greenbrier Drive from <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Kim\" title=\"Kim\">Kim</a> to find the dance studio where the pole dancing class was. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Uh huh. \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> But I was being held up, and I couldn’t find it. Then you know, I just talked to Kim she told me it’s around Greenbrier Drive. I was like, oh well, I’ll Google it later anyway. I’ll find out for sure where it is. What street address at-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> So why did you buy kitchen tong? Are you going to start cooking? \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> No, I did not buy these. These were a free gift.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oh.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> It was like a free supplies.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> So I didn’t expect- \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Maybe you should start cooking. \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hmm, yeah. I can and I will, you know, start cooking for myself more often. But you know, one day at a time. I’d like to feel more independent, you know. Get myself a job and maybe move out of the house or whatever, mmm, moving on to what happened today. After I went searching for the dance studio on Greenbrier Drive, then I just moved ahead to the Western [inaudible] building and attended the yoga class.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK. \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I met a new girl, I met a new <a href=\"/cwcki/Gal_pal\" title=\"Gal pal\">female friend</a>.  \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oh cool! \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> We talked a little bit but it’s not like we exchanged phone numbers or email addresses. Her name is Lauren, she’s a <a href=\"/cwcki/University_of_Virginia\" title=\"University of Virginia\">UVA</a> student. She’s majoring in, well she’s not sure yet, but she’s taking politics. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Politics?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I guess she’s going to be a political science major. \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah probably, yeah, I think she said so, yeah she said political science. Yeah there you go you, just took the words out of her mouth. [<i>laughs</i>]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Yeah, [<i>laughs</i>] political science majors! \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah but anyway, apparently she attended <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Church\" title=\"Church\">church</a> the past couple of Sundays as well. So it was like, you know, first time we met so I said, you know, I’ll see you next Sunday in church- there we are. And then, you know, maybe I can get, maybe we’ll share email addresses then. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You should, I’m surprised you didn’t already. Especially if you think she’s a friend. \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah I mean, like, you know, we just met. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Still I’ve exchanged email addresses right away.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah well, OK, yeah I’ll see about that next time I see her. Either on Sunday or next Wednesday. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK, well hopefully you do see her.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, but anyway, I learned a lot about the yoga poses. Actually I heard a new meaning, I mean, I’ve heard the expression “open your heart” before, like from the Sonic Adventure.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Uh huh.  \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> But the way the yoga teacher it was like lift up your chest. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Uh huh.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> So you know, I have a better understanding of what they mean by open your heart, it’s like keep your chest held high.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Um, It’s actually supposed to be a metaphor and it’s got a lot of interpretations. Like opening your heart means opening up to someone or being respectful. It can be interpreted dozens of ways.  \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, but in terms of the yoga, opening up the heart means lifting your chest and opening it up for the air you’re breathing in.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, that doesn’t make sense because your heart doesn’t do your air.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Let me put it another way. You’re slouched over and you’re breathing, it’s more difficult for the air to get to your lungs and your heart when you’re slouched over. But when you’re straight up in posture then it’s easier for the air to get to your lungs and your heart.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Um no… What?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Come on, you’re the nurse major you should know that! \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Chris that’s not even remotely true! Just because you’re slouched over doesn’t mean that you can’t get air.  \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I did not say CAN’T get air, I just said that- \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> It doesn’t make it difficult either, because your body’s circulatory system takes care of that whether you’re slouched over or not. \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hmm, OK while I didn’t- surely you’ve personally, you’re slouched over and your breath but you found that you had to breathe in more because it was like, a longer trip for the air. I’ve felt that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Chris, it’s the same distance no matter what position you’re in, your body doesn’t... [<i>exasperated sigh</i>]\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hmm, OK well, I don’t know, I just learned a little bit more about the expression open your heart. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Uh huh.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, So let’s just leave it at that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Right.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> OK. So anyway, I really enjoyed the yoga, but since I’ve been not doing my walking and running like I wanted to I did an hour around the <a href=\"/cwcki/Charlottesville_Fashion_Square\" title=\"Charlottesville Fashion Square\">Fashion Square Mall</a> before I went home. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> That’s good, just remember you’ve got to get your heart rate up, walking doesn’t help all that much.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I think I did a little power walking in there, so yeah. I’ll get there. I mean, I’ll jog more around the neighborhood at my own pace, you know?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\">'<b>Kacey:</b></font> But if you don’t get your heart rate up to a certain level, you’re not going to lose anything. You really should Google this. You have to push yourself.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah… I… yeah. Details I have yet to comprehend about that. Anyway also while I was over at the mall I stopped over at the <a href=\"/cwcki/GameStop\" title=\"GameStop\">GameStop</a> to browse around a little bit, and the black cash-, the <a href=\"/cwcki/Niggos\" title=\"Niggos\">black guy</a> who was working as a cashier there, you know, working at the GameStop [sound break] square. Yeah, he recognized me. And he’s also friends with a fellow employee, with the guy who works there named Angel. I met him, and he recognized me that Sunday when I gave blood and participated in that <a href=\"/cwcki/Guitar_Hero\" title=\"Guitar Hero\">Guitar Hero</a> con- Guitar Hero Tournament. He wanted a picture of me and him together, you know, his fellow employee at the time took the picture. It’s a souvenir for him to gloat about. I made his day. The black guy was talking me, yeah, he and Angel were like, “We’re waiting for you to come out with the official Sonichu merchandise, like especially the official Sonichu doll. We’ve seen all this stuff on the internet but we know it’s not official because you say so, and you didn’t official sign off on it or all that.” So you know-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, did you actually give blood?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, that Saturday, yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> So somebody is going to have- your blood is going to save somebody’s life.  \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah but also I double redded. Do you know about that double redding in donating blood?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You double what?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Double red…Red R-E-D.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> OK well I’ll explain it to you, you can probably Google it and find out more. In addition to them taking a pint, taking some of your blood whole, they take a chunk of your blood to. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oh, you mean giving plasma. \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, they took a whole thing of plasma but after that, they have this little machine where they separate the red cells from the plasma and then they give you [sound break] -plasma. Like I said you could Google, and learn more to better understand. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oh no, I just know it as giving plasma, that’s fine.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> You know, mm’kay. Anyway that’s double red. Two words, you can Google it. It’s a thing that I started probably before that weekend. It’s like, new.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, I’m proud of you for giving blood. That’s very noble and stuff, you know?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I’ve donated blood before and that’s how I learned I’m an A negative blood type. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Yes, A negative. \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah anyway, getting back on today, after talking to that guy, you know, I came home. And after I came home I finally printed out the three copies of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_0\" title=\"Sonichu 0\">Number Zero book</a> and three copies of my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Resume\" title=\"Resume\">resume</a>. I’m gonna send them out to Marvel, Archie and Dark Horse Comics. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b> </font>And also I’m going to [inaudible] creating all the <a href=\"/cwcki/Official_Videobooks\" title=\"Official Videobooks\">audiobook videos</a> for <a href=\"/cwcki/YouTube\" title=\"YouTube\">YouTube</a>.  \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK, just remember get those done soon and the pictures.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I’ll [inaudible] more on the sexy drawings, I’ve already got the <a href=\"/cwcki/File:CWCRockin4Way.jpg\" title=\"File:CWCRockin4Way.jpg\">three girls</a> on drawing reference, so from that point all I have to do, on I can do, yeah, sex drawings. Yeah, and then before I upload those drawings I have to make one or two YouTube videos of me playing, of me playing <a href=\"/cwcki/Guitar_Hero\" title=\"Guitar Hero\">Guitar Hero</a> 5 with my female band.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oh, are you going to upload those to the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia\" title=\"CWCipedia\">CWCipedia</a>? Because you should. \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Mmm yeah, Kim encouraged me to do that in a private area, you know. And the sex drawings I’m probably going to put those like in the- You know I have a section of the Fan Art that guidelines what not to submit for consideration in the Fan Art section?  \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Uh huh. \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I could put the sex drawings there. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Cool.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I put a warning on there, where it’s like you have to be 18 or older to view these. And plus, they’re like drawings, like art pieces I got from the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/ED\" title=\"ED\">ED</a> page. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\">'<b>Kacey:</b></font> OK.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hmm, where was I… Yeah I’ll work more on the drawings tonight, and I’ll get all the audiobooks done tomorrow. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Okay, well I have a question that’s just going through my mind. Because you told me how much you think I weighed. How much do you think Kim weighs? I just want to see what you think.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> How much Kim weighs? I’m not sure, I’d say 175, 150, somewhere between there?  \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> What did you say again, I’m sorry?  \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I’d say about 150 to 175 is my guess.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oh, OK. So I can’t remember how much you say you weigh. Did you weigh yourself recently?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, last time I checked, when I was going in for my quad-check up with my doctor, they had to put me on a scale, just to see how much I weighed and do my blood pressure. But yeah- I’m about, <a href=\"/cwcki/Obesity\" title=\"Obesity\">somewhere between 215 and 220</a>.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, have you done it recently within the past couple of weeks? \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, we don’t have a scale here at home so it’s kind of hard for me to do that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Maybe you should go get one, who knows?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> They probably have one at yoga class.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Funny, I did not really see a scale at yoga class or one in the closet where the [inaudible] were, so I don’t know. Mmm. So I just told you my blood type, do you know what your blood type is?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Yeah, it’s A positive.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Wow, we’re so close, we’re both A’s.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Yeah, A is a pretty popular blood type.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, it’s not, I mean it’s not- wait a minute. Are the A’s common or uncommon?  \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> A is pretty common. AB and O are fairly uncommon. It’s A, then B, then O and then AB.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> So it’s A, then B, then O, then AB.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> So between A positive and A negative is there just an A? \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> No it’s A negative and A positive. It has to do with the antigens. \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> The antigens?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Yes. \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> OK, that’s a new word to me. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well you should probably look it up, it’s all in blood type.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah OK. Antigens. Is that like, I’m gonna spell it how it sounds, is that spelled A-N-T-O-G-E-N?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> What? It’s A-N-T-I-G-E-N.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Oh, A-N, oh Antigen, antigen, OK. So A is for Antigen, what’s B and O?  \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> What? No everything has antigens except for type O.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Okay so type B has antigen in it as well?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Yeah they have the B an-, you just have to look it up.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah OK, it’s very interesting.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Yeah, blood is very interesting.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Let me ask you, why is it a bad idea to mix blood types, like if you put B or O in an A positive or A negative person?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK, O is the universal donor, so they can give to anyone because they don’t have antigens. AB can receive anyone because they have both A and B antigens. If you take the wrong antigen and put it in someone’s bloodstream, they will die because their body will attack itself. So if you put A antigens in a B blood type, they’re going to kill each other and then you die. \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Oh, OK, so AB and O are neutral.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> No, O is neutral it has no antigens, it is the universal donor so anyone can take O blood. AB is the universal receiver so they can take anyone’s blood because they have all the antigens.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> OK so AB is the universal receiver, OK.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Yes.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Wow, A and B, it’s like those are opposite types, huh.  \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Yeah, people with O, even though they can give to anyone, they can only have O blood, but AB can take anyone’s blood.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Which is more rare, AB or O?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> AB usually, because it’s got both the of them, but it’s by a small margin.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Huh, I see. Is blood type- I’m sure blood types are genetic, aren’t they? \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Of course, almost everything is genetic. Actually blood type is very important in cultures, not so much of ours, but in other cultures they use blood type to determine personalities and for match-making. It’s kind of outdated but they still do that. \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\">Chris: </font>Yeah I think we talked about that in a previous conversation about personality traits in comparison to blood types, and then, yeah, I can Google that as well.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Right.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah we talked about that before.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b> </font>Yeah. [<i>laughs</i>]\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hmmm, well OK, let me ask you though, A positive and A negative, would you say those are opposing, opposite of each other? If you put A negative in the A plus, A positive and they die?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> What?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> If you put A negative blood in an A positive person will the A positive person-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Yeah you can’t mix that, you don’t want to.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Oh, OK. I get it, cool.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, anything else on your mind?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Let me think. Oh yeah, I asked <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Barb\" title=\"Barb\">my mom</a> earlier today why she thinks that I often blank out or I’m often confused.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Uh huh.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> She theorizes it’s because I’m a creative genius. You know, I’m a very creative guy, and I have so many creative thoughts coming in and out and they differ from what’s currently in my mind and-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well I’m really creative and I don’t blank out. I’m serious when I say there’s a serious, serious thing that could be wrong with you. You blanking out like that, It could be you’re not getting adequate nutrition, it could mean you’re dehydrated. It could mean you could have something wrong seriously like a tumor or something.  \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Mmm, I don’t know it’s a theory my mom had, but anyway point was, so many creative thoughts pretty much derails my train of thought and puts me in a blank state or confusion. That’s just from my mom’s point of view and how she understands it, something like that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I don’t know. That just doesn’t make sense to me.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> OK, say you want to remember something from like, yeah from like ten conversations ago, but then you try to remember, but it’s like it’s hard for you to remember because of all your incoming creative ideas at the time, or- \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> The brain doesn’t work that way.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Come on, memory in the brain is like <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Random_access_humor\" title=\"Random access humor\">random access memory</a> just like in any computer, it’s random.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> No it’s not. No, no, no, no.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Did you voice just get deep there?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Sorry, I covered my mouth with my hands.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Well it could be just-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> It was just my voice echoing through my hands, that’s all it was.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> OK.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I mean yes, there have been comparisons to the brain being like a computer, but it’s not like that. It’s not like a switchboard where things can get plugged up or anything. There are so many places in your brain that have to do with memory, I just don’t even know how to explain this.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> OK, well you’re probably right, it could be the nutrition thing, but I’m drinking water more, nowadays and I’m getting on track [inaudible] vegetation and having a more healthy lifestyle and my daily exercise regimen so I’ll probably get better on that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You should actually talk to your doctor about it, because if you are suffering from poor nutrition they can give you tests. You really should look into that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\">Chris: </font>OK, well I’ll be sure to- \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b> </font>Maybe you have an iron deficiency, you should totally ask. \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b> </font>Yeah well before my check-up I usually go in a little earlier and give a little blood for blood work so they would know at that point. So they would know at that point. So I’ll be sure to talk to my doctor about that.  \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Okay that’s good.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Alright.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Okay, well anything else?  \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, the current <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_money\" title=\"Chris and money\">money</a> I spent on so far this month I will definitely know about that, I promise, I’ll send you a message.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK cool, thanks.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I do want to tell you that, but I’m not [inaudible] bank account number or anything like that. [<i>laughs</i>]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK. [<i>laughs</i>]\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah but anyway, oh shoot I had another thought in my head… [mumbles] What I spent on so far this month, shoot I lost the other thought… hmmm, oh well. Hmm, what else is on your mind?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Just, you know, all my tests and all my projects and stuff. I really don’t have anything else. \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Learn anything new today? \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> We just went over some of the projects, we didn’t go over anything I didn’t already know, so I’m good. We’re still in review.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Your project’s like, essays. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> No I have a five page paper that’s for Anthropology, and I have to get people to take these surveys and then I have to cross reference everything by state, region, nationwide and worldwide. So it’s going to be a really easy paper, it’s just the research that’s going to get me. \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hmmm, survey huh? You know, I can probably take that if you email me the questions on your survey.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK, I totally can.  \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I’d be happy to help you with that. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK, I will totally do that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Just type in the email or type it in a Microsoft Word file and I will download it and open it up on my Microsoft Word.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK. \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> And then I’ll put the answers on the Word file and add my name to it, or I can put it in an email reply, the answers.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK, that’d be cool.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Oh, I just remembered the other thought. I thought about more, about the 500-word minimum essay I was gonna do for you about <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">autism</a>, I thought about what I could do for that. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Mmhmm. \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I thought about just refreshing myself on the characteristics of a person with autism, you know like on Autism.org, that’s a good place to go, or look it up on Wikipedia. And comparing it to my actual, real life experiences, you know, how I have exhibited some of those characteristics, and also, you know how I got better from that later on in life. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I’m just thinking, like you know, I’m thinking good for you there.
