The only thing that has been removed are the email ads at the bottom of each page.\n</p><p>Megan's e-mails are in pink, Chris's in light blue.\n</p><p>Throughout this time period, Megan is generally friendly to Chris (even if a majority of their conversations are her requesting him to buy stuff for her on <a href=\"/cwcki/EBay\" title=\"EBay\">eBay</a>). However, if her e-mails are anything to go by, Chris is already acting creepy towards her, with Megan repeatedly telling him off for touching her, telling her he wants to be her boyfriend, and acting rude towards other men who already have girlfriends. She'd be civil towards him in this period, but this wouldn't last forever.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#E-mails\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">E-mails</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Megan_wants_a_Tintin_tape\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Megan wants a <i>Tintin</i> tape</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Megan_talks_about_meeting_Chris_on_the_park\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Megan talks about meeting Chris on the park</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Chris_wants_to_date_Megan_at_McDonald's\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris wants to date Megan at McDonald's</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Don't_kiss_me,_bro\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Don't kiss me, bro</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Megan_puts_Chris_in_the_friend_zone\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Megan puts Chris in the friend zone</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Megan_writes_the_longest_Urgent_Message_in_history\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Megan writes the longest Urgent Message in history</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Megan_has_a_thing_for_German_soldiers\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Megan has a thing for German soldiers</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#Megan_likes_friendship_but_dislikes_touchy/feely_situations\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Megan likes friendship but dislikes touchy/feely situations</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Chris_wants_her_number\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.9</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris wants her number</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#Megan_tells_Chris_to_think_of_her_as_Knuckles\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.10</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Megan tells Chris to think of her as Knuckles</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#Megan_comments_on_Chris's_photos\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.11</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Megan comments on Chris's photos</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-13\"><a href=\"#Megan_tells_Chris_to_stop_acting_like_a_molester\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.12</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Megan tells Chris to stop acting like a molester</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-14\"><a href=\"#Pinned_against_the_wall\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.13</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Pinned against the wall</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-15\"><a href=\"#Megan_sends_Chris_some_more_mixed_signals\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.14</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Megan sends Chris some more mixed signals</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-16\"><a href=\"#Megan_calls_Chris_out\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.15</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Megan calls Chris out</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-17\"><a href=\"#Gallery\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Gallery</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"E-mails\">E-mails</span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Megan_wants_a_Tintin_tape\">Megan wants a <i>Tintin</i> tape</span></h3>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#F2CECE; border:1px dotted #BFA3A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>−−−−−Original Message−−−−−<br/>\n<p>From: pearl3 &lt;pearl3@velocitus.net&gt;<br/>\nTo: CWCSonichu@aol.com Cc: pearl3@velocitus.net<br/>\nSent: Tue, 1 Nov 2005 3:14 am<br/>\nSubject: quick!\n</p><p>Hey quick!

But PLEASE DON\"T BE MAD...especially since I was fooling around with John's gamecube and saw some of the note...I didn't read all of it. Something like make sure I don't get a DS with Nintendogs?

Please show that loser what your <i>[sic]</i> made of on the other 3!! Thank you! I hope steady payments will be ok? Did you inform the dealer that you may win others? So he can combine shipping?\n</p><p>Second of all the term I used \"I'm not the one for you\" Has absolutely NOTHING to do with YOU. That term refers to ME. And the reason for being is because I have no desire nor do I care to have a boyfriend, period. Even if he were the most gorgeous soldier on the planet. I just don't care. And perhaps I was meant to not like \"love\". Actually I have more enjoyment when I'm by myself. I don't ever feel lonely. So the term means, I wouldn't be good in a relationship because I'm not one to frantically dial the phone hoping for date. I'm a loner kind of person and that's the way I was born. I'm sorry again you feel that way. But you know me, I gotta be 100% <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Honest\" title=\"Honest\">honest</a>.\n</p><p>So in other words: you're NOT a loser, I'm not saying I don't like you. I just don't care for guys in that kind of relationship matter. But that doesn't mean I don't care period. I care because we are friends. And I prefer to have guys only as friends because they are good companions and comrades. I never cared about having a boyfriend, I doubt I will.\n</p><p>I like being the way I am, and I don't want to be like the others. Yeah that's a good way to say it. I want to be as different from people as I can. I hear girls saying how they wanna get married/have kids and stuff like that, but not me! I wanna be free from marriage and have my own life with myself. I absolutely LOVE being by myself for some reason, but again that doesn't mean I hate being around you or other friends, ok?\n</p><p>So I hope you understand that now. And maybe you know now why I don't like touchy/feely situations. BUT I ENJOY BEING FRIENDS!!\n</p><p>In conclusion, having a any kind of boyfriend is just not in my system. My goofy cousins just don't understand why I'm not married or dating. They're both married but I think deep down they admire me for being that adament <i>[sic]</i> about it. Somehow I get the same feeling from you? You admire my rougeness and toughness?\n</p><p>Well I hope you feel better after you read this.

Ok, maybe I should get this off my chest first-\n</p><p>Well I like us being <a href=\"/cwcki/Gal_pal\" title=\"Gal pal\">friends</a> but please understand that I wish for no <a href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart\" title=\"Sweetheart\">deeper relationship</a>. I just don't care or have that desire for a boyfriend no matter who he is ok?<br/>\nAnd to be honest I felt awkward on how you all of sudden said you wanted to come to my house. Lemme just say this- You should think of me as <a href=\"/cwcki/Knuckles\" title=\"Knuckles\">Knuckles</a>! I'm the kind of person who although is a loyal friend- I can only take so much friendly meetings. You know how Knuckles will hang around a bit but then take off once again. I'm like that. Hanging out on fridays is really the most I can do. I know that probably doesn't seem fair to you but you are a different person with your own <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">different needs</a>. I'm my own person with my own different needs- or should I say unwanted needs! ;) So please could we put off park meetings for a while? Pretty please with a Yoshi Berry on top! :D And also please give me a little more space at the <a href=\"/cwcki/The_GAMe_PLACe\" title=\"The GAMe PLACe\">store</a>. I don't always like having a second shadow while looking at stuff. DO NOT take this as an insult- you have no idea how many times I have to bark at John sometimes!!<br/>\nSo from now on I'd like a little time alone looking at models that will never come in and then I'll come to the middle and <a href=\"/cwcki/Card_games\" title=\"Card games\">play</a>! I love playing now since I made a new refreshing deck! Speaking of decks, Print out that email you sent me about your <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Yugioh\" title=\"Yugioh\">Yugioh</a> deck cause John has more knowledge about it then <i>[sic]</i> me. John helped me with all my yugioh stuff!\n</p><p>Ok, moving from that \"depressing\" subject! I think I see the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Music\" title=\"Music\">music</a> problem! When you download, are all the bands separated by genre? If so then Stryper and Holy Soldier are more then <i>[sic]</i> likely located in the Christian section. (no pun intended-as I rudely burst out laughing! forgive me!)<br/>\nYes Stryper is a \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_religion\" title=\"Chris and religion\">religious</a>\" band but I don't think they are extreme. You know how they say people change depending on the music they hear. Sure that's probably true for all the hoods that listen to that <a href=\"/cwcki/Chop_Chop_Master_Onion%27s_Rap_Showdown\" title=\"Chop Chop Master Onion's Rap Showdown\">stupid loud violent rap</a>. But I've had Stryper for several years and it hadn't turned me into a nun!<br/>\nAs for Holy Soldier, they were probably put there just because of their name. I don't think their music is as Christ-ly as Stryper. Holy Soldier is however positive  and anti-negative. For example one song explains \"<a href=\"/cwcki/6_June_2010\" title=\"6 June 2010\">drink and drive is suicide</a>.\"<br/>\nEither way I think you'll like them. Which of the songs I reccomended <i>[sic]</i> did you like the most or least?\n</p><p>I love your mario <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Video_games\" title=\"Video games\">game</a>- so does John! But I love playing the mini games better then <i>[sic]</i> the real game! Not to brag but I've beaten some of your high scores!! My favorite games are:<br/>\nThe game where you find either Mario, Luigi, Wario, and Yoshi's face.<br/>\nMatching the Wiggler pattern! I love Wigglers!!! They are soooo oogy-woogy! Plus that baby music they play emphasizes that!\n</p><p><i>[Part of the mail is missing]</i>\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3><span id=\"Megan_comments_on_Chris.27s_photos\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Megan_comments_on_Chris's_photos\">Megan comments on Chris's photos</span></h3>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#F2CECE; border:1px dotted #BFA3A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>−−−−−Original Message−−−−−<br/>\n<p>From: pearl3 &lt;pearl3@velocitus.net&gt;<br/>\nTo: cwcsonichu@aol.com Cc: pearl3 &lt;pearl3@velocitus.net&gt;<br/>\nSent: Mon, 5 Jun 2006 12:18 am<br/>\nSubject: My tour through CWCville\n</p><p>Hi!

So we may go back later in the summer. Oh and to start off I did NOT go to any <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Navy\" title=\"Navy\">Navy</a> base. I was only being sarcastic towards Fredric-- (don't know how to spell that)\n</p><p>Thanks for all your <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Emails\" title=\"Emails\">emails</a> though! Oh I came home yesterday afternoon. There wasn't much to say about it since it rained.\n</p><p>Anyway well! I'm glad there is a new possible <a href=\"/cwcki/Gal_pal\" title=\"Gal pal\">friend</a> for you!! So let me begin by saying this however I mean no harm towards your feelings. It's flattering how said your heart would remain strong to me but I really wish it didn't. And here is why: I've told you many times I don't want a serious relationship with you or any other guy for that matter. And so you really need to \"give up\" on me cause it'll only make you miserable. The fact that a fan has showed up may be a sign. Y'see instead of spending all your energy looking for a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Girlfriend\" title=\"Girlfriend\">girlfriend</a>, you should lay back, take it easy and open up. Then I think someone will show. You should try not to act so desperate. The way to \"spell it out\" and advertise yourself- passing girls may think it's strange behavior. Of course I understand your situation, but other people don't and they may think- please don't get upset- that you are some kind of lech or molester. I know your <i>[sic]</i> not, but you see where I'm coming from?<br/>\nSo, please do not waste more thoughts on me, of course we are friends but <a href=\"/cwcki/Friend_zone\" title=\"Friend zone\">friends only</a>. Please \"detatch\" <i>[sic]</i> yourself from me and see if anything happens between you and this girl and maybe her friends ok? My wish for you is to find your own someone for yourself. Me? I'm just a \"heartbreaker\"!<br/>\nBut just to answer your weird question, I would prefer clean shaven men but don't get any ideas that, THAT would win me! ;)<br/>\nI don't mean to sound harsh but I am grateful that we are friends. If it wasn't for you, I may have never seen StarS and my collection would be the same dolls and few figurines. I must say I am entirely grateful that you have trusted me finacially <i>[sic]</i> on <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ebay\" title=\"Ebay\">ebay</a>! I'll try my best to pay the remaining payments as quickly as possible. Thanks for your trust and patience.\n</p><p>I was wondering, I stay off <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ebay\" title=\"Ebay\">ebay</a> for a while but if there is a little plush I want from Pokemoncenter can we order it? I'll look later to see if there is anything.\n</p><p>Well John wants me for something so I'll get back to you later!\n</p><p>See ya!<br/>\n~Megan\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Pinned_against_the_wall\">Pinned against the wall</span></h3>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#F2CECE; border:1px dotted #BFA3A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>From: pearl3<br/>\n<p>Sent: 25 June 2006\nSubject: an \"angry\" Megan?\n</p><p>Yeah, although I'm not angry at you, I'm a little dissapointed at your behavior. I'm really sorry this may sound harsh but it's the 100% truth about how I feel ok?\n</p><p>I know you know I \"hate\" guys and I hate love, cause I told you a million times ^^;!!\n</p><p>So why do you keep getting too close and touching me? I REALLY don't like it at all. I know you said cause you have feelings for me and it's hard for you. But (I'm sorry, this sounds mean) you really need to try and get over it. If you keep hanging on like that to someone who doesn't love you back.......well it'll only make you more miserable. You need to just accept the fact that I don't and will probably never love you so you should just take <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress_sigh\" title=\"Stress sigh\">a rejuvenating breath</a> and move on.\n</p><p>Here's a secret, ONCE I actually \"liked\" someone and I spent <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress\" title=\"Stress\">a lot of unnesessary energy and time</a> thinking about this person and <a href=\"/cwcki/Love_Quest\" title=\"Love Quest\">trying to spend time with this person</a>. But when I finally admitted to liking this guy, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Heart_Level\" title=\"Heart Level\">I was bluntly refused</a>. I wasn't his \"type\". And he didn't even tell me that, I had to ask his friend! So when a guy doesn't like me, THAT'S IT!! I don't \"like\" them anymore! If I'm not his type to be close to, then I'm not his type to be friends with, an what do you know! The same person things I'm a freaky nazi thing! But don't EVER EVER EVVVVVVVER repeat that to me or anyone else ok? Although I was somewhat hurt I've soon gotten over it, you know I don't even think I really liked this guy in the first place! It's like....I was experimenting? Oh well he's not worth my time. &gt;-&lt;\n</p><p>So it was a fake love? Sometimes I don't understand myself. My mind and heart say two different things. But throughout my life I've trained myself to ignore feelings for a guy. I don't WANT a boyfriend and I won't give in! I won't allow it!! Of all the hair bands I love anti-love songs. Example: did you download Queensryche's I Don't Believe In Love?<br/>\nI don't. To be honest, I don't care for love. period.\n</p><p>Now I sound like <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">that lady villian you have</a>, but oh well, that's the real me. Also this is a secret I've hidden away for a long time cause everyone would think I really was a freak.\n</p><p>I only love animals. I love recieving affections from them and I love being with them. In other words, I love <a href=\"/cwcki/My_Little_Pony\" title=\"My Little Pony\">animals</a> more than <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris\" title=\"Chris\">humans</a>. <a href=\"/cwcki/20_December_2009\" title=\"20 December 2009\">I absolutely HATE how people treat them</a> and are cruel to them. Afterall animals were here on this planet first. And now look what we've done. We destroy their homes and destroy them. Animals that are endangered are all because of stupid humans. Their disgusting greed of taking their own fur!! It makes me SICK!!\n</p><p>Now you know the real me, but how do you like me now? When it comes to relationships, I'm a \"dangerous\" person. It seems I only <a href=\"/cwcki/Heart_level\" title=\"Heart level\">break hearts</a>. So for your own sake, please try to get rid of the lovey feelings for me and we can <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Just_Friends\" title=\"Just Friends\">just be friends</a>. So PLEASE don't touch me anymore ok? I don't like it! And last wed you really had me pinned against the wall. Please give me more space.\n</p><p>Now that I've finally gotten THAT off my chest let's move on to more <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Fuzzy-wuzzies\" title=\"Fuzzy-wuzzies\">happier thoughts</a>.\n600??!! No way! I only have around 80! Even though they started in the 80's I don't think 600 were ever made! But I could be wrong. I only collect the newer ones that came out in the <a href=\"/cwcki/2000\" title=\"2000\">2000</a>'s.\n</p><p>Sheesh, where do you keep your <a href=\"/cwcki/Transformers\" title=\"Transformers\">transformers</a>? Maybe you should hang some in the ceiling like there battling! Yeah I seem more like a Gemini. I have <a href=\"/cwcki/30_August_2009\" title=\"30 August 2009\">split personalities</a>, there's the girly-my-little-pony-shoujo-anime-lover-plushie side of me then there's the cold-war-monger-gi joe-german soldier-militaria side of me.\n</p><p>Yes I've heard that opposites attract, but also....doesn't a negative and a positive make a negative?\n</p><p>Oh yeah, before I decide to write a letter, why does <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bob\" title=\"Bob\">your father</a> doubt my residing in Staunton in the first place and why would he care anyway? I feel wierd about the whole thing in any case. Cause I mean, when you look at it, where I live has nothing to do with him and OH YEAH I JUST REMEMBERED!!!! We no longer get mail at our house due to past events I wish not to explain. Our P.O Box is in Fishersville. So whether or not I write a letter, it wouldn't satisfy him! jeeeeez....\n</p><p>Well I'm hungry now so I'll leave it at that\nIf your feelings are hurt, I'm really sorry, but perhaps you take that opportunity to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Masturbate\" title=\"Masturbate\">release your feelings for me</a> and start a-new.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Megan_sends_Chris_some_more_mixed_signals\">Megan sends Chris some more mixed signals</span></h3>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#F2CECE; border:1px dotted #BFA3A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>From: pearl3<br/>\n<p>Sent: 15 July 2006\nSubject: yeah\n</p><p>Jeez....what kinda question is that? I honestly have NO idea!! You can't change your looks unless it's plastic surgery or something. I'm not the one you need to ask. I really don't know what you should do, you should sit down and try to think it out for yourself.\n</p><p>Also I'm just a little mad that I have to keep telling you to PLEASE stop touching me! It's like you're not wanting to listen to me! I tell you, then you say ok, but eventually you're back to the same tricks, and this time I really MEAN IT!! Even my other friends don't like it and think it's weird. So once and for all could you PLEASE STOP? You KNOW I don't like it so why do you keep doing it? It's not like you're gonna try and soften me or something.\n</p><p>So, I don't wanna have to tell you again or I might get really angry. Cause you know unwanted remarks, or advances to a girl is Sexual Harassment and I don't take that lightly. Ok? So can you understand now?\n</p><p>Anyway sometimes I get the feeling that you copy me to get me to like you. Like Sailormoon for example. The only Sailormoon thing you had was that adult video and since I told you how much I love it then you start getting into it. Kinda like My Little Pony. That kind of thing really annoys me. If you ever see any Sailormoon game for DS, please let me buy that first. Remember the first ebay purchase was that Sailormoon Super Best CD? It really hurt me when I found out you went ahead and listened to it!! If I ever purchase a game or cd from ebay in the future....please....let me listen or play it first. It hurts my feelings when I'm buying something and you go ahead and beat it first or something. Even though you are buying it....still I'm paying you back for it when you jump right in on it, it hurts me and ruins the whole fun for me. It's like, \"what's the point since you already beaten it?\"\n</p><p>Going back to \"are you copying me\" I don't like it much when people get into something RIGHT AFTER they find out I liked it first. When you said we had a lot in common like Sailormoon and My Little Pony, well who Loved Sailormoon first? Who collected My Little Pony first? Ok, I know I sound like a spoiled brat but can you see what I'm trying to say?<br/>\nI don't like being too in common with others, I try to be different from others as possible. I personally don't like Pretty Cure that much. Mostly the reason is cause YOU liked it first. And out of respect I decide not to get into it cause to me, Pretty Cure is YOUR thing like Sailormoon and My Little Pony should be MY thing, you know?<br/>\nI even remind myself to not tell of my other series I love cause I'm afraid the next day, you'll have everything there is to get from that. So if I ever order something that's something you don't really know about, then just \"hand it over casually\" like you didn't even see it.\n</p><p>So I just wanted to make these points clear and usually sounding mean like that is the only way for me to get them across. <i>[Some of the email is missing here]</i>\n</p><p>Ok, first of all, I don't remember saying I DID choose him over you, if you have the email saying I did, send it please......I can't ever remember a conversation. &gt;-&lt;;\n</p><p>Second of all.....brace yourself, this may sound blunt and harsh. But shouldn't it be MY decision? When you sent the email saying you were gonna send a freak-out message saying \"just how friendly were you\" You make it sound like I have to get your approval to be that kind of \"friendly\" to someone. And I felt rather disappointed about those remarks. Besides he was really the FIRST guy to ever pay any notice to me. Not that I was trying to find attention, he just came up to me.\n</p><p>Also I secretly DID give you a chance, I always secretly \"test\" someone I'm making friends with. Just making someone happy isn't the ONLY thing I test, but my vibes and body chemicals whatever-you-call-em just don't feel anything around you. You know? It's also about the vibes and chemistry. Even though someone can just be a bestest nicest always do things for you kind of person, you don't always actually love them, and that's how I feel about you or rather don't feel about you.<br/>\nAnd you already KNOW I don't love you so why make yourself unhappy by holding grudges and trying so hard to win me over? So please if you really want to make me happy....please....let me make my own decisions and figure out my own life ok?<br/>\nBesides even IF I had a boyfriend, what makes you think I'll stop being friends with you? I'm not that kind of person who'd say... \"well, I have a boyfriend now so see ya!\" No, I'm not that kind of bitchy girl.\n</p><p>Also you don't even KNOW this guy so why do you say he can take care of himself? Afterall YOU'RE not the one who may have to answer the call of duty and head off to war. And I think he would need MORE emotional support. You're just losing love......he could lose his life.

I'm not really wanting to get together with him either. Boyfriends aren't for me. Don't want em, don't need em.  \nHowever I can't say I like how you call him a lucky \"jerk\"\nWhy is he a jerk? Why do you call ALL guys that?\nBecause they \"Take all the pretty girls leaving you none to choose from?\"\nHate to be blunt but that's a pathetic way to think!\nYou don't go to a mall and buy a girlfriend! The thing is, the guys didn't take all the girls.....the girls just didn't choose you. Quit blaming other men! Girls chose who their boyfriend was too!\nYou should know, that girl Soshii loves has a boyfriend. But does he hate Night or other guys?\n</p><p>Just because YOU don't have a girlfriend doesn't give you the right to HATE ALL MEN!! It's not THEIR fault! The world doesn't revolve around you. And keeping this grudge will really get you nowhere.  \n</p><p>Personally I think you shouldn't be so picky about what they look like. All you say is you want a \"pretty girl\". Well it's the INSIDE that counts! Afterall, a pretty girl can have the personality of Satan, meanwhile an \"ugly\" girl may have a heart of gold but you wouldn't even give a second look would you?\n</p><p>I often wonder:\nIf I was an ugly girl, you wouldn't even come near me would you?\n</p><p>Which also makes me bring up something else. During the tag team, you yelled how you didn't want to pair up with a beginner! Did it even occur to you how many little kids' feelings you just shattered?\nAnd so if I was a beginner, would you say that to me as well? Or would you just pair up anyway cause I happen to be a GIRL?\nYour insults and hatred towards other guys can offend me cause it offends my brother!  \n</p><p>Well sorry all that sounds mean, but I hope it gave you something to think about.\nI remember seeing a letter posted by you in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Shoujo_Beat\" title=\"Shoujo Beat\">Shoujo Beat</a>. Then a couple issues later there was a reply to that. Did you see that? Well that girl is absolutely right!!\n</p><p>Ugh...hungry\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Gallery\">Gallery</span></h2>\n<center><ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\">\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\"><div style=\"width: 155px\">\n<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><div style=\"margin:40px auto;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:20051220-Meg-Hglght.png\"><img alt=\"20051220-Meg-Hglght.png\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"70\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/a/a5/20051220-Meg-Hglght.png/120px-20051220-Meg-Hglght.png\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/a/a5/20051220-Meg-Hglght.png/180px-20051220-Meg-Hglght.png 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/a/a5/20051220-Meg-Hglght.png/240px-20051220-Meg-Hglght.png 2x\" width=\"120\"/></a></div></div>\n<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n</div>\n</div></li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\"><div style=\"width: 155px\">\n<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><div style=\"margin:26px auto;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Megan_06-04-22.PNG\"><img alt=\"Megan 06-04-22.PNG\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"98\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/f/f8/Megan_06-04-22.PNG/120px-Megan_06-04-22.PNG\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/f/f8/Megan_06-04-22.PNG/180px-Megan_06-04-22.PNG 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/f/f8/Megan_06-04-22.PNG/240px-Megan_06-04-22.PNG 2x\" width=\"120\"/></a></div></div>\n<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n</div>\n</div></li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\"><div style=\"width: 155px\">\n<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><div style=\"margin:27px auto;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Megan_06-06-25-2.PNG\"><img alt=\"Megan 06-06-25-2.PNG\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"96\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/9/94/Megan_06-06-25-2.PNG/120px-Megan_06-06-25-2.PNG\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/9/94/Megan_06-06-25-2.PNG/180px-Megan_06-06-25-2.PNG 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/9/94/Megan_06-06-25-2.PNG/240px-Megan_06-06-25-2.PNG 2x\" width=\"120\"/></a></div></div>\n<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n</div>\n</div></li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\"><div style=\"width: 155px\">\n<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><div style=\"margin:46.5px auto;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Megan_06-05-01.PNG\"><img alt=\"Megan 06-05-01.PNG\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"57\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/e/e9/Megan_06-05-01.PNG/120px-Megan_06-05-01.PNG\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/e/e9/Megan_06-05-01.PNG/180px-Megan_06-05-01.PNG 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/e/e9/Megan_06-05-01.PNG/240px-Megan_06-05-01.PNG 2x\" width=\"120\"/></a></div></div>\n<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n</div>\n</div></li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\"><div style=\"width: 155px\">\n<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><div style=\"margin:25px auto;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Megan_06-08-07.PNG\"><img alt=\"Megan 06-08-07.PNG\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"100\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/5/53/Megan_06-08-07.PNG/120px-Megan_06-08-07.PNG\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/5/53/Megan_06-08-07.PNG/180px-Megan_06-08-07.PNG 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/5/53/Megan_06-08-07.PNG/240px-Megan_06-08-07.PNG 2x\" width=\"120\"/></a></div></div>\n<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n</div>\n</div></li>\n</ul></center>\n<table align=\"center\" id=\"toc\" style=\"text-align:left;
