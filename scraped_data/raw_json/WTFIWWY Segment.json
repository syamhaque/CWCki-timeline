  "html_content": "<div class=\"mw-body-content mw-content-ltr\" dir=\"ltr\" id=\"mw-content-text\" lang=\"en\"><div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p>On 29 December 2014, Nash, the star of podcast channel Radio Dead Air and a member of the Channel Awesome (formerly known as That Guy With the Glasses) team, covered the <a href=\"/cwcki/26_December_2014\" title=\"26 December 2014\">26 December 2014</a> incident along with his co-star Tara, as part of his weekly <i><b>What the Fuck is Wrong With You?</b></i> (WTFIWWY for short) segment, where the duo talk about instances of bizarre behavior that have been documented by major news sources and/or people on the Internet. Until this point Nash had shied away from the subject of Chris for much the same reason as fellow Channel Awesome producer Linkara, namely a desire to avoid bringing Chris any unnecessary attention, but decided that he had to cover this incident due to the large number of e-mails he received on the subject (at least 87 as of the podcast), and the incident being unusually insane even by Chris's standards.\n</p><p>During this segment, the two react to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris\" title=\"Chris\">Chris</a>'s actions with the expected level of shock (especially Tara, who had never heard of Chris before that day), along with watching the video taken by monozettai. Tara also compares the situation around Sonic's blue arms (and <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_Boom_Protests\" title=\"Sonic Boom Protests\">Chris's subsequent reaction</a>) to people flaming over the racial changes and Auto-Tuned musical numbers in the 2014 version of <i><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_(2014_film)\" title=\"wikipedia:Annie (2014 film)\">Annie</a></i>.\n</p><p>The video was later posted to the Channel Awesome website under the title \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_Religion\" title=\"Chris and Religion\">The Passion of the Chris-Chan</a>\", and Nash's high-ranking status among the site's producers meant that for part of 3 January 2015 until the following afternoon, the site's top video was related to Chris.\n</p><p>Chris hasn't given his reaction to this video, which is rather surprising given his knee-jerk reaction to almost any <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Media\" title=\"Media\">media</a> publishing, mocking, or trying to knock sense into him. It's likely the burnout from the GameStop incident, along with Chris and Barb being in the middle of moving out of their <a href=\"/cwcki/Rental_House\" title=\"Rental House\">Rental House</a> and back into the rebuilt <a href=\"/cwcki/14_Branchland_Court\" title=\"14 Branchland Court\">14 Branchland Court</a>, simply made him overwhelmed and unable to respond. This was also the first time that <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCki\" title=\"CWCki\">this very wiki</a> was mentioned in the media.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Video\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Video</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Transcript\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Transcript</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#External_links\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">External links</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Video\">Video</span></h2>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><div class=\"thumb embedvideo autoResize\" style=\"width: 328px;\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo autoResize\" style=\"\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideowrap youtube\" style=\"width: 320px\"><div class=\"embedvideo-consent\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo-consent__overlay\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo-consent__message\">Click to load content</div><!--\n--></div><!--\n--></div><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" data-src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/74RhbvS4N0Y\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"180\" loading=\"lazy\" modestbranding=\"1\" width=\"320\"></iframe></div><!--\n--></div><!--\n--></div>\n</div>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Transcript\">Transcript</span></h3>\n<p><i>[This transcript begins 1:43 into the podcast; prior to this Chris is mentioned, but not by name, and with no specifics of the 26 December incident. Nash also notes that prior to this he never wanted to cover Chris]</i>\n</p><p><font color=\"Blue\"><b>Nash:</b></font> Tara...are you familiar...with Chris-Chan?\n</p><p><font color=\"Pink\"><b>Tara:</b></font> [<i>hesitantly</i>] ...no.\n</p><p><font color=\"Blue\"><b>Nash:</b></font> Okay. This is a <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Saga\" title=\"Saga\">saga</a></i>. This is not just an--an Internet story, this is a fucking...saga. Chris-Chan is an individual who...loves <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog\" title=\"Sonic the Hedgehog\">Sonic</a>! <i>Loves it</i>.\n</p><p><font color=\"Pink\"><b>Tara:</b></font> The Hedgehog?\n</p><p><font color=\"Blue\"><b>Nash:</b></font> Yes.\n</p><p><font color=\"Pink\"><b>Tara:</b></font> Not, like, <a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_restaurants#Sonic\" title=\"List of restaurants\">the...fast food chain</a>?\n</p><p><font color=\"Blue\"><b>Nash:</b></font> No.\n</p><p><font color=\"Pink\"><b>Tara:</b></font> Okay.\n</p><p><font color=\"Blue\"><b>Nash:</b></font> The hedgehog. Loves fucking Sonic to an <i>insane</i> degree. And, uh, he--e also does a webcomic...I loosely use that word, about a <a href=\"/cwcki/Things_Chris_has_ripped_off\" title=\"Things Chris has ripped off\">totally original</a> character that he created, called <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(character)\" title=\"Sonichu (character)\">Sonichu</a>, which is a combination of Sonic and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Pikachu\" title=\"Pikachu\">Pikachu</a>. <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_copyright\" title=\"Chris and copyright\">That is all his</a>.\n</p><p><font color=\"Pink\"><b>Tara:</b></font> Oh...!\n</p><p><font color=\"Blue\"><b>Nash:</b></font> Totally original. And if it were just this...it would be one thing. But over the course of the last few years, fuelled by <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/4chan\" title=\"4chan\">4chan</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">trolls</a> of various assortments, he has gone on a strange, bizarre, si-sliding rollercoaster of utter...madness. There is a wiki devoted to this person. He does not author said wiki, it's done by other people, chronicling the madness. Now, the incident we're talking about today, the reason we're getting to it today, is that...he was arrested. I'd like to say \"at long last,\" but apparently <a href=\"/cwcki/28_October_2011\" title=\"28 October 2011\">this is the second time</a>, but no, today, he was arrested...well, not today, it was on the 26th. He was arrested, and the incident was caught on video. [<i>pause</i>] Now, the reason this happened, apparently, is there is a new <i>Sonic</i> game called <i>Sonic Boom</i>. Most of us who played--\n</p><p><font color=\"Pink\"><b>Tara:</b></font> They just got to that now?\n</p><p><font color=\"Blue\"><b>Nash:</b></font> Yeah. Most of us--\n</p><p><font color=\"Pink\"><b>Tara:</b></font> How long's this been a character, and they just got to that pun now?\n</p><p><font color=\"Blue\"><b>Nash:</b></font> They'd--I...well, yeah. [<i>shrugs</i>] I guess. The game is called <i>Sonic Boom</i>. Now, most of us, we recognize this is a bad game for many reasons. The camera's awful, the characters never shut up, the gameplay is horrific, it's just a bad game. But no, this is not Chris-Chan's problem with <i>Sonic Boom</i>. Chris-Chan's problem with <i>Sonic Boom</i>...is that they changed Sonic's <b>arm color</b> from white...to blue. This has caused...a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Rage\" title=\"Rage\">rage</a> among--in his mind. Flames, flames, ons--that kind of...yeah. To the point where he went to his local <a href=\"/cwcki/GameStop\" title=\"GameStop\">GameStop</a>--according to reports--attempted to deface the <i>Sonic Boom</i> display. Now, he's <i>already</i> <a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_places_that_have_banned_Chris\" title=\"List of places that have banned Chris\">been banned</a>...from this GameStop...\n</p><p><font color=\"Pink\"><b>Tara:</b></font> Tell 'em, Steve-Dave!\n</p><p><font color=\"Blue\"><b>Nash:</b></font> Yes, exactly! He had been banned from the GameStop before, but then...[<i>to his computer</i>] come on, I mean--I have to show them the video. Then, ladies and gentlemen, we got video! This happened. And...a--a--a...let me see if I can give you the actual video link, Tara...or just quickly type in... go to Google, and google \"Chris-Chan GameStop.\" It's slow as dogshit, I'm sorry, I--I put the link on there, but...here we go!\n</p><p><i>[The now-infamous video appears in a box next to the video streams of Nash and Tara]</i>\n</p><p><font color=\"Pink\"><b>Tara:</b></font> \"Chris Chan Maces a GameStop Employee?\"\n</p><p><font color=\"Blue\"><b>Nash:</b></font> Yup.\n</p><p><font color=\"Pink\"><b>Tara:</b></font> Because they changed the color of...? \n</p><p>[<i>In the video, Chris blows a raspberry, yells \"Don't call anybody!\" and sprays pepper spray at a GameStop employee</i>]\n</p><p><font color=\"Blue\"><b>Nash:</b></font> And there he goes! Hits the guy in the yellow shirt with pepper spray. [<i>Tara is staring at her own computer screen in visible shock</i>] I'll play that one again for you, as it's brief, but it happens. What you hear him say is \"Don't call anybody!\" is what he tells... that's his instructions. Anyway, here we go.\n</p><p>[<i>The video is shown again</i>]\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Ezimba14644786010700.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"169\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/1/14/Ezimba14644786010700.jpg/300px-Ezimba14644786010700.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/1/14/Ezimba14644786010700.jpg/450px-Ezimba14644786010700.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/1/14/Ezimba14644786010700.jpg/600px-Ezimba14644786010700.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Ezimba14644786010700.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Nash and Tara view the infamous bystander video.</div></div></div>\n<p><font color=\"Blue\"><b>Nash:</b></font> There we go, and...sprays the guy with pepper spray. [<i>Tara silently gasps</i>] And, that--that--that's what happened. And shortly after this, the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jerkops\" title=\"Jerkops\">police</a>, who were, um, none too pleased about this... you see, while it may not--I don't understand, and, uh, other people ask me about this, it's not a big deal anymore because \"Well, uh the cops'll hit you with the pepper spray and th--and the taser, so what's the big deal?\" Well, even if you don't hurt somebody--and the guy at the GameStop was not really hurt--the act of spraying someone with pepper spray, is an--that's considered an assault.\n</p><p><font color=\"Pink\"><b>Tara:</b></font> Yeah, you can't just do that to people. Um, like...if you have, like, a really good reason then yeah, they'll let it slide. But yeah, you can't just do that. And, wha--I--I don't understand why... your version of events here. Like, he went in...to protest Sonic's arms being blue--\n</p><p><font color=\"Blue\"><b>Nash:</b></font> Yes.\n</p><p><font color=\"Pink\"><b>Tara:</b></font> You know, fight the power, young man. \n</p><p><font color=\"Blue\"><b>Nash:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"Pink\"><b>Tara:</b></font> How did that progress to macing an employee in the face? Clearly, like, that employee probably didn't have anything to do with the changing of Sonic's arms.\n</p><p><font color=\"Blue\"><b>Nash:</b></font> No. But he has been banned from this GameStop before this. For this kind of shit. They progressively told him, \"Stop coming here. Don't do this kind of thing.\" And, he...now, he's out on bail right now. God knows how much that's costing. He was arrested, he was held until today, from, uh, over the weekend, he's out on bail, and his version of accounts...he likens that GameStop employee you just saw, the one who was pretty much just standing there...\n</p><p><font color=\"Pink\"><b>Tara:</b></font> Yeah?\n</p><p><font color=\"Blue\"><b>Nash:</b></font> To leaping out at him in a darkened alley, like a rapist.\n</p><p>[<i>Tara looks from side to side, clearly not sure how to react. There is a long pause.</i>]\n</p><p><font color=\"Pink\"><b>Tara:</b></font> Does he know that he's not a police officer? [<i>Nash shrugs; Tara laughs nervously</i>] You can't just...you don't get to say, \"I feared for my life.\"\n</p><p><font color=\"Blue\"><b>Nash:</b></font> No! You do-ho-hon't!\n</p><p><font color=\"Pink\"><b>Tara:</b></font> Unless you're a cop who kills somebody.\n</p><p><font color=\"Blue\"><b>Nash:</b></font> It...it's just THIS...really, this is the hill you wanna die on?\n</p><p><font color=\"Pink\"><b>Tara:</b></font> I...I honestly don't, like...I'm not a video game person, my nephew got a bunch of new video games for Christmas that he keeps trying to talk me into playing. He got me to play <i>Minecraft</i>, for...I think for, like, ten minutes before I drowned in lava?\n</p><p><font color=\"Blue\"><b>Nash:</b></font> Sounds about right, yes.\n</p><p><font color=\"Pink\"><b>Tara:</b></font> Today we played some fishing game, I didn't catch any fish. He keeps trying to get me to play <i>Disney Infinity</i>, and I'm like, I can't dishonor Captain America that way, because he has the full Avengers set. Um, so, um, I'm not a video game person. I played <i>Rock Band</i> sometimes--\n</p><p><font color=\"Blue\"><b>Nash:</b></font> Alright, alright. What if Captain America, in the video game, was red? What would your reaction be?\n</p><p><font color=\"Pink\"><b>Tara:</b></font> Uh, well, that'd be...weirdly...Communist, for Captain 'Murica to be wearing.\n</p><p><font color=\"Blue\"><b>Nash:</b></font> Okay. \n</p><p><font color=\"Pink\"><b>Tara:</b></font> And kinda strange. I might, like, tweet about it a couple of times.\n</p><p><font color=\"Blue\"><b>Nash:</b></font> There you go. Yeah, yeah. Would you, in fact, pick up a chemical weapon and go to your nearest game store?\n</p><p><font color=\"Pink\"><b>Tara:</b></font> Probably not.\n</p><p><font color=\"Blue\"><b>Nash:</b></font> Probably not. No. That's not what you do in this situation.\n</p><p><font color=\"Pink\"><b>Tara:</b></font> That's not what we call a proportionate response. Nor is it an effective one. Like, I've worked retail for a long time, and I'm here to tell you, the people working in the store? Fuck all to do with the decisions that are pissing you off. We're not the people who decide on the price of the item, when the store closes, how many we get in stock, what color Sonic the Hedgehog's arms are...\n</p><p><font color=\"Blue\"><b>Nash:</b></font> Uh-uh. Nope.\n</p><p><font color=\"Pink\"><b>Tara:</b></font> And if we were the people making those decisions, we wouldn't be working on Christmas Eve, in a store. So, coming after the retail people? Getting you <i>nowhere</i>.\n</p><p><font color=\"Blue\"><b>Nash:</b></font> Nnnno, 'cuz they really...[<i>stutters</i>]\n</p><p><font color=\"Pink\"><b>Tara:</b></font> We are the Morlocks, living underground on-- <i>[Audio briefly cuts out]</i>\n</p><p><font color=\"Blue\"><b>Nash:</b></font> When I was younger, I would get so much into a fucking tizzy about shit. Inconsequential bullshit, pop culture, it would just piss me off to great lengths about, \"That shouldn't be like that, that's stupid--\"\n</p><p><font color=\"Pink\"><b>Tara:</b></font> Well, when you think that people are pissed off that Annie's black...\n</p><p><font color=\"Blue\"><b>Nash:</b></font> Well, that--\n</p><p><font color=\"Pink\"><b>Tara:</b></font> She's supposed to be a redhead, and I'm like, okay, I'm about the biggest redhead elitist you're likely to meet. And they were like \"Annie's going to be black,\" and I was like, \"Oh. Alright.\"\n</p><p><font color=\"Blue\"><b>Nash:</b></font> I was, apparently, as far as Annie goes, I was told that the worst offense was that Cameron Diaz should apologize to Carol Burnett.\n</p><p><font color=\"Pink\"><b>Tara:</b></font> I've heard she's the weakest link, yeah. I've heard--I heard they added a couple of songs that don't really fit with the whole thing. Those are the two biggest actual problems that I heard. But people are really pissed off that Annie's black, and I'm like.....\"Why?\"\n</p><p><font color=\"Blue\"><b>Nash:</b></font> Yeah. And, you know...\n</p><p><font color=\"Pink\"><b>Tara:</b></font> Like, it's not actually a plot point in the movie that she's a redhead. It's not. Like, she happens to be, but it doesn't affect anything. Like, there's no reason why Annie can't be black. Or why Daddy Warbucks--or, I think his name is Will Stacks now--can't be black. There's no reason why Annie can't be white and Will Stacks... <i>it doesn't matter</i>!\n</p><p><font color=\"Blue\"><b>Nash:</b></font> And I don't recall anyone going down to their local Carmike Cinema and macing the fucking guy with the popcorn.\n</p><p><font color=\"Pink\"><b>Tara:</b></font> Well...\n</p><p><font color=\"Blue\"><b>Nash:</b></font> They're not paid enough to deal with this shit!\n</p><p><font color=\"Pink\"><b>Tara:</b></font> Give it a week or two, the movie just opened.\n</p><p><font color=\"Blue\"><b>Nash:</b></font> It's, well, i's been out on the Internet for a while. Thank you, Sony hackers. We've got more tonight, and oh, god...and--you know what, here's the thing. While Chris-Chan is such a popular Internet topic--\n</p><p><font color=\"Pink\"><b>Tara:</b></font> Is that his real name, like, <a href=\"/cwcki/Christopher%27s_name_change\" title=\"Christopher's name change\">he changed it</a> because of 4chan or something?\n</p><p><font color=\"Blue\"><b>Nash:</b></font> Christian...Christian Weston Chandler.\n</p><p><font color=\"Pink\"><b>Tara:</b></font> Okay. 'Cuz, you said \"Chris-Chan,\" and I was like, is that the new 4chan, 8chan? Are they just naming them now? They ran out of numbers?\n</p><p><font color=\"Blue\"><b>Nash:</b></font> <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler\" title=\"Bob Chandler\">BobChan</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Minor_Family_Members#Carol_Chandler\" title=\"Minor Family Members\">CarlChan</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Minor_Family_Members#David_Chandler\" title=\"Minor Family Members\">DaveChan</a>...\n</p><p><font color=\"Pink\"><b>Tara:</b></font> Yeah...Jackie Chan?\n</p><p><font color=\"Blue\"><b>Nash:</b></font> I'm gonna tell you, our last story tonight, when we get to it, will kind of make this one seem inconsequential. But you wanted me to report on it, Internet, and I did! So...there, you go.\n</p><p>[<i>This transcript ends at 12:46 in.</i>]\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/cwcki/The_Kevin_and_Bean_Show_Segment\" title=\"The Kevin and Bean Show Segment\">The Kevin and Bean Show Segment</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Toucher_and_Rich_Segment\" title=\"Toucher and Rich Segment\">Toucher and Rich Segment</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://channelawesome.com/wtfiwwy-live-the-passion-of-the-chris-chan/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The full podcast on Channel Awesome</a></li></ul>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCached time: 20230122220936\nCache expiry: 86400\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: []\nCPU time usage: 0.063 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.065 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 115/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 26/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/100\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 648/5000000 bytes\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key cwcki-1_:pcache:idhash:20604-0!canonical and timestamp 20230122220936 and revision id 258288.
