As a result of this and the following <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_in_the_media\" title=\"Chris in the media\">mainstream media coverage</a>, thousands of people were exposed to Chris for the first time. Out of this new infamy an orbiter wave arose. It is dubbed as such due to the sheer volume of new people following Chris's life story. These people can be roughly broken down into three groups:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Those who were curious to see what went wrong in his life leading up to the alleged fucking of his own mother.</li>\n<li>Those who saw him as nothing more than another deranged sex pest, blissfully unaware of Christory.</li></ul>\n<p>This page will primarily focus on the more notable examples of these people, most of whom either wanted to take full advantage of the growing awareness of Chris and his life story and used their platform to attempt to profit off of it, or indirectly found themselves involved in Christory through their actions, all of whom do not have enough material for their own article otherwise.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Examples\">Examples</span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Incest_Saga\">Incest Saga</span></h3>\n<p>After it was revealed that Chris was having sex with his mother, this led to a whole new wave of followers.\n</p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCached time: 20250426005441\nCache expiry: 86400\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: []\nCPU time usage: 0.028 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.031 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 50/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 710/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 18/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 10/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/100\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    8.353      1 -total\n 74.87%    6.254      1 Template:Stub\n 36.13%    3.018      1 Template:Namespace_detect\n 23.74%    1.983      1 Template:Articleofthenow\n-->\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key cwcki-1_:pcache:idhash:33117-0!canonical and timestamp 20250426005441 and revision id 331689.
