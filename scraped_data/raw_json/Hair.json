For most of his adult life, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Barb\" title=\"Barb\">Barb</a> served as his barber. The result was a predictably amateurish, uneven cut which served as the perfect accompaniment to his <a href=\"/cwcki/The_Classic\" title=\"The Classic\">clown shirt</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_socializing\" title=\"Chris and socializing\">social awkwardness</a>. His refusal to regularly bathe, which leaves his hair greasy and unmanageable, hasn't helped. His hair entered something of a plateau for many years, as even when he does take a shower, his hair's appearance virtually remains the same, as evidenced by his <a href=\"/cwcki/HairDifference\" title=\"HairDifference\">2010 video demonstration</a>.\n</p><p>Switching shampoos hasn't helped, either.

He has also used Aussie Sprunch hairspray because \"it keeps my hair poofy, and smells of candy.\" If his photographic record is anything to go by, nothing seems to have worked; firsthand observer <a href=\"/cwcki/Catherine\" title=\"Catherine\">Catherine</a> thought it \"looked like straw.\" \n</p><p>Chris, however, believes that his hair looks just fine, and has always been defensive about his hygienic habits.

Chris's natural hair color is a chestnut brown, although <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler#Early_life\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler\">early photos</a> from his childhood show that it was paler at one point. He seems to be dyeing his hair himself, based on the unprofessional results. The highly visible brown roots seen in pictures suggest that he did not enlist the aid of a professional stylist. Chris's hair is also evidently curly when it's long; he may have done it himself with a curling iron, but Chris is far too lax in his personal grooming for that type of styling regimen. An <a href=\"/cwcki/October_2012\" title=\"October 2012\">October 2012</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Facebook\" title=\"Facebook\">Facebook</a> profile picture revealed that Chris had grown his hair to his shoulders, and for the next couple of years it remained at approximately this length.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:202px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Chris_Long_Hair.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"263\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/3/3a/Chris_Long_Hair.jpg/200px-Chris_Long_Hair.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/3/3a/Chris_Long_Hair.jpg/300px-Chris_Long_Hair.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/3/3a/Chris_Long_Hair.jpg/400px-Chris_Long_Hair.jpg 2x\" width=\"200\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Chris_Long_Hair.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Chris with shoulder length hair.</div></div></div>\n<p>Chris has become resolutely opposed to cutting his hair, seeing it as essential to his transgender identity. In <a href=\"/cwcki/May_2011\" title=\"May 2011\">May 2011</a>, Barb forced Chris to let her cut his hair. This resulted in Chris calling Barb a \"bitch\". He wore a wig for a while after this incident.

Since hitting his late 20s, his hairline has been receding very quickly. When confronted in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag\" title=\"Mailbag\">Mailbag</a> (<a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_17#Chris's_receding_hairline_disagrees\" title=\"Mailbag 17\">17</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_25#Balding_issues\" title=\"Mailbag 25\">25</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_28#He's_also_going_bald\" title=\"Mailbag 28\">28</a>) about his obviously thinning hair, Chris asserted that he was not going bald, and he was untroubled. \"When it goes, and if I do go bald, I will deal with that when I cross that bridge\", he declared.\n</p><p>In videos taken of Chris at a <a href=\"/cwcki/Fridays_After_Five\" title=\"Fridays After Five\">Fridays After Five</a> event in 2010, a bald spot was seen starting to appear on the back of his head. By 2014, at 32, pictures showed that his hairline had receded dramatically in just a couple of years, and his hair was more poorly managed, looking even more thin, wispy and unkempt, if that's possible. While his hair is long, it has simply stopped growing on the front half of his scalp, creating an extremely bizarre effect. His attempts to brush a few locks forward do little to hide his constantly growing forehead. Catherine claimed in 2014 that it was \"halfway\" back on his scalp. The bald spot can be clearly seen in a photo of Chris with the <a href=\"/cwcki/Praetor\" title=\"Praetor\">Praetor</a> team in October 2020.\n</p><p>It should be noted that if one alters a photograph of Chris to remove his bastardized bangs, his hair looks almost exactly the same as it did before 2013 – slowly thinning and as greasy as ever.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:202px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:CWC0916.PNG\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"337\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/2/28/CWC0916.PNG/200px-CWC0916.PNG\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/2/28/CWC0916.PNG/300px-CWC0916.PNG 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/2/28/CWC0916.PNG/400px-CWC0916.PNG 2x\" width=\"200\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:CWC0916.PNG\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Chris, in 2016, continuing to bald.</div></div></div>\n<p>2016 saw the rapid acceleration of Chris's receding hairline. Cole Smithey seemed to begin shaving his head regularly around his early to mid-thirties so the timing seems about right for Chris's male pattern baldness to follow suit. Chris's ever poor hygiene and increasingly gross neglect of his remaining and now green mop-like locks certainly did not help. Chris's current hair is less that of a transitioning female, and more of a Doc Brown mixed with seaweed.\n</p><p>A popular theory among <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">trolls</a> proposes that the baldness is a physical indicator of the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress\" title=\"Stress\">stress</a> Chris claims they put him through. Realistically, however, Chris just drew an unlucky ticket in the genetic lottery. Photos of his half-brother <a href=\"/cwcki/Cole_Smithey\" title=\"Cole Smithey\">Cole Smithey</a> show that Cole lost his hair up front relatively early in life as well, and <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler\" title=\"Bob Chandler\">Bob</a> also showed signs of hair loss too. Ominously, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_health\" title=\"Chris and health\">inactivity</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_nutrition\" title=\"Chris and nutrition\">poor diet</a>, illness and stress are well-known to accelerate the balding process. In addition, there is a strong correlation between the man's age with the eventual extent of the baldness – the earlier it begins in life, the less hair will eventually remain, which does not bode well for Chris's tomgirl dreams.\n</p><p>In recent times, Chris has taken to wearing a cap or pulling his hair forward to cover his receding hairline, and possibly to mimic various anime characters and drawings he's seen of attractive women doing the same thing. It really doesn't do his appearance much good.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Body_and_facial_hair\">Body and facial hair</span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:115-CWCEmbarassed.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"394\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/a/a1/115-CWCEmbarassed.jpg/300px-115-CWCEmbarassed.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/a/a1/115-CWCEmbarassed.jpg/450px-115-CWCEmbarassed.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/a/a1/115-CWCEmbarassed.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:115-CWCEmbarassed.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Embarrassed Chris with hairy naked legs.</div></div></div>\n<p>Chris has never found body hair attractive, on himself or anyone else.

Evidently, Chris's hair is so filthy, the Mexican postal service, which regularly \"unknowingly\" ships countless pounds of cocaine, marijuana, and other illegal narcotics per year, had trouble dealing with this biohazard.
