basically it for the\n</p><p>vehicle bow so let's get down the\n</p><p>transformation shall we yes get a really\n</p><p>good spin on am spin it spin it to\n</p><p>win delightful delightful all right so\n</p><p>let me just uh rotate the camera up\n</p><p>little\n</p><p>bit right down to it course move the\n</p><p>m and what I like doing on this uh I\n</p><p>thought I say we start from the we start\n</p><p>by folding up what's in the trunk so we\n</p><p>just split shoulders up just pop that up\n</p><p>there and then we pull these\n</p><p>out SP down like\n</p><p>that this probably just go ahead don't\n</p><p>take the hands out close that up see the\n</p><p>little flip arms they close up like that\n</p><p>and we just want to wiggle these out\n</p><p>they're on a double\n</p><p>hinge and then we definitely want to get\n</p><p>down to business so we're going to bring\n</p><p>down the\n</p><p>legs work with it as you do as you\n</p><p>anyway that down you want to rotate that\n</p><p>180 and then let that click let that\n</p><p>click into place I'll just go ahead put\n</p><p>these elbows in the right\n</p><p>orientation and then let's see oh right\n</p><p>got split the legs and then we flip the\n</p><p>hoods up pull these black sections down\n</p><p>those three his KN caps sometimes could\n</p><p>be a little tricky might you make shift\n</p><p>spuder for that there we\n</p><p>go and give that 180\n</p><p>rotation put the heel spurs out on kn\n</p><p>and then rotate you flip the feet down\n</p><p>you close up the gaps\n</p><p>here and of course you just rotate\n</p><p>this and then you reveals the lovely\n</p><p>Bumble lumba Meister mug and shift the\n</p><p>shoulders\n</p><p>up\n</p><p>and that is pretty much basically it oh\n</p><p>we done just we're done woo we're done\n</p><p>and that is that is there you go there\n</p><p>you have bum B lumba in his robot mode\n</p><p>ni say in Simplicity and size is small\n</p><p>and stature this actually works even for\n</p><p>update of an M feature so let's get in\n</p><p>let's look in on those DET let's get\n</p><p>close up soon not on those check not on\n</p><p>that chest but where's the autofocus on\n</p><p>this\n</p><p>camera oh well we'll just make do what\n</p><p>we have but you got some lovely detail\n</p><p>on his face cute little smirk his eyes\n</p><p>this not little pant like cring the

little heels you got a little\n</p><p>backpack going on there but that's cool\n</p><p>now articulation wise the head is on a\n</p><p>ball joint you got a lot of Wiggly\n</p><p>waggly going on you can look you can\n</p><p>look down a little bit you can look up a\n</p><p>lot do a total squirrel or you can use\n</p><p>that transformation joint and do a total\n</p><p>squirrel and then some s squ bend it\n</p><p>flying\n</p><p>forward that's fun and of course uh head\n</p><p>can rotate do a full 360 with getting\n</p><p>the chin out from lifting above those\n</p><p>sharp pieces arms can only go up that\n</p><p>far and back that far you got a joint at\n</p><p>the shoulder here you got a joint at\n</p><p>just above the uh bicep here so you got\n</p><p>some range of movement you have this\n</p><p>joint if you want dislocate anyway but\n</p><p>still you can give you good poses this\n</p><p>way and of course uh\n</p><p>arms can do like rotate at\n</p><p>the you get 90° of Bend there at that\n</p><p>you got hand rotation there you got a\n</p><p>little inward outward rotation if you\n</p><p>open this up that's main you do for\n</p><p>transformation you have waist rotation\n</p><p>legs\n</p><p>before that far back then go that far\n</p><p>outward you can pretty much do a full\n</p><p>split yeah thigh\n</p><p>rotation you get a really good range of\n</p><p>knee Bend there it's like over 90\n</p><p>degrees of bend the knee feet can go up\n</p><p>a little bit can go down and can can't\n</p><p>go down you got a little bit of ankle\n</p><p>tilted\n</p><p>there now as far far as this weapons go\n</p><p>of course uh you can do them multiple\n</p><p>ways so of course you can hold them in\n</p><p>his\n</p><p>hands come on work here there we go can\n</p><p>hold him in his hands he can zap zap zap\n</p><p>zap like without the\n</p><p>rock BL BL I don't think you get any BL\n</p><p>is within that tiny hole I'm wondering\n</p><p>though let's see this small Bush I mean\n</p><p>was like nope but can that work can that\n</p><p>work not really okay what we tried it's\n</p><p>like we did something that he didn't but\n</p><p>aside from that of course\n</p><p>uh we can put these on this back and I\n</p><p>could store on there like that be like\n</p><p>nobody in the comment SE be like hey\n</p><p>that one ConEd would when she put them\n</p><p>on the back\n</p><p>anyway but there you go and of course\n</p><p>with a full upright hit and that there\n</p><p>you go like Ro\n</p><p>SP\n</p><p>delightful and then that course the fun\n</p><p>detail those on this just because can\n</p><p>open these up put the hands\n</p><p>in I want just mention this since he\n</p><p>didn't mention so of course uh with the\n</p><p>little Stinger on there it's like that\n</p><p>it's kind of awkward when you think\n</p><p>about the position of that Stinger it's\n</p><p>like um okay how am I supposed to sting\n</p><p>something like this I mean even just\n</p><p>like it looks like he wants a hand out\n</p><p>hey give me give me some change give me\n</p><p>some change we're not happy nope I think\n</p><p>obviously could do a little work around\n</p><p>with that just turn one be like that's a\n</p><p>little better that's a little better\n</p><p>there all right so we just get that\n</p><p>[Music]\n</p><p>there just go ahead put that there and\n</p><p>now put the two\n</p><p>together and you got that good that\n</p><p>lovely little bit of two-headed Stinger\n</p><p>action going\n</p><p>up to the\n</p><p>stream let's see here let's see if we\n</p><p>can do this let's do this live on\n</p><p>camera uh kind of sort of you know what\n</p><p>that works I'll take it so yeah now we\n</p><p>can do a lovely zapping bumba Lumber I\n</p><p>don't have a Graphic blue so I apologize\n</p><p>for do\n</p><p>noise and then they'll feely F fall\n</p><p>off and for\n</p><p>comparon here is Bumble lumba with neitz\n</p><p>bum\n</p><p>be\n</p><p>with pun\n</p><p>slav\n</p><p>with\n</p><p>Wy\n</p><p>with a t be updated\n</p><p>cracker\n</p><p>with\n</p><p>a to be\n</p><p>updated scel\n</p><p>vessel\n</p><p>with\n</p><p>Frank and here's how Bumble lumba\n</p><p>Compares and scale with the other with\n</p><p>the combiners of Quick Fill including\n</p><p>combiner form at\n</p><p>Selena here is how Bumble LBA scales\n</p><p>with the Trio OFA Chris CH between the\n</p><p>origin form on the right the\n</p><p>main CH Chris Chan Prime albot in the\n</p><p>center and of course uh the combiner\n</p><p>form Chris Chand in the the left along\n</p><p>with rung in both\n</p><p>ways he hears how Bumble lumba scales\n</p><p>with Sonu at Selena silver armor Prowler\n</p><p>and jet and an awesome Dynamic battle\n</p><p>scene where they're defending the city a\n</p><p>quick\n</p><p>bille and of course last but not least\n</p><p>here he is with the original animated\n</p><p>bumble baby because he's so precious oh\n</p><p>so\n</p><p>precious so there you go and yeah as I\n</p><p>do really love I really like this figure\n</p><p>I mean just size quality and up dead to\n</p><p>uh I just you know moment mates update\n</p><p>to the precious figure mentioned earlier\n</p><p>it actually is quite good I like the uh\n</p><p>how it can stand good on his feet makes\n</p><p>good good shorts just obviously if I was\n</p><p>to give it like a little comparative mod\n</p><p>maybe it just like you know the ends of\n</p><p>the arms where the bo where the little\n</p><p>Stingers could connected could be more\n</p><p>flat that's my more grievance with it\n</p><p>but have to give it like do a something\n</p><p>to make it like\n</p><p>connect you know give it something go\n</p><p>back and forth there that would more\n</p><p>easier and hey who hasn't thought about\n</p><p>us actually using the rocket boosters to\n</p><p>give him fight because that's one thing\n</p><p>they can do I mean I think that was also\n</p><p>portrayed that was also portrayed\n</p><p>sometime anyway yeah there you go Bumble\n</p><p>Lumber can fly but he's not a bumblebee\n</p><p>but anyway from that if you want to hear\n</p><p>the back story for Bumble LBA and all\n</p><p>the other individuals of the alots of\n</p><p>quickfi you can look at that previous\n</p><p>live stream I did so there you\n</p><p>go now I fit this up in a Lov little\n</p><p>collab personally with\n</p><p>Hasbro and you might be able find this\n</p><p>some Hasbro PE sooner and later but if\n</p><p>you would like the similar figure you\n</p><p>can always get the Transformers Animated\n</p><p>B big figure from Hasbro Pro or even\n</p><p>like big btoy store.com or your local\n</p><p>Target your local Walmart whichever\n</p><p>comes up at that time but anyway I think\n</p><p>that's about it so there you go you\n</p><p>don't not saying you don't stop

three forms\n</p><p>between origin Main and combiner limb\n</p><p>form with Legacy animated\n</p><p>Bumblebee and of course\n</p><p>with the original animated bub because\n</p><p>it's\n</p><p>prees also sticky animated\n</p><p>[Music]\n</p><p>prees and of course bumba lumba does\n</p><p>come with come with some\n</p><p>accessories you get a pair of lovely\n</p><p>Stingers Za it up to the\n</p><p>Treet but you got all the lovely silver\n</p><p>paint on the transparent blue plastic\n</p><p>which I feel like def really works and\n</p><p>you got these lovely little turbo\n</p><p>rockets that out silver paint and just\n</p><p>all looking good and all that and of\n</p><p>course to store these a vehicle mod cuz\n</p><p>you don't have a p for those Stingers\n</p><p>here and put them onto\n</p><p>these pockets and put them right here on\n</p><p>the door like\n</p><p>thisy\n</p><p>for\n</p><p>and of course\n</p><p>uh know it's blasting forward whichever\n</p><p>way you want or course you can store\n</p><p>back here as was the case with the\n</p><p>original\n</p><p>vehicle\n</p><p>precious also\n</p><p>precious so that is basically it for the\n</p><p>vehicle B so let's get down the\n</p><p>transformation shall we you get a really\n</p><p>good spin on am spin it spin it to win\n</p><p>woo\n</p><p>W delightful delightful all right so let\n</p><p>me just uh rotate the camera up little\n</p><p>bit right down to it of course move the\n</p><p>m and what I like doing on this uh I\n</p><p>thought I say we start from the we start\n</p><p>by folding up what's in the trunck so we\n</p><p>just split shoulders up just pop up\n</p><p>there and then we pull these out\n</p><p>down like\n</p><p>that at this point we can just go ahead\n</p><p>don't take the hands out go set up see\n</p><p>the little flip arms they close up like\n</p><p>that and we just want to wiggle these\n</p><p>out they're on a double\n</p><p>hinge and then we definitely want to get\n</p><p>down to business so we're going to bring\n</p><p>down the\n</p><p>legs work with it as you got do as you\n</p><p>anyway that down you want to rotate that\n</p><p>one 80 and then let that click let that\n</p><p>click into place I'll just go ahead put\n</p><p>these elbows in the right\n</p><p>orientation and then let's see all right\n</p><p>got split the legs and then we flip the\n</p><p>hoods up pull these black sections down\n</p><p>those'll be his KN caps sometimes could\n</p><p>be a little tricky might need make shift\n</p><p>spuder for that there you\n</p><p>go and give that 18\n</p><p>rotation put the heel spurs out on\n</p><p>these and then rotate you putp the feet\n</p><p>down you close up the gaps\n</p><p>here and of course you just rotate\n</p><p>this and then you reveal the lovely\n</p><p>bumba lumba M mug and shift the\n</p><p>shoulders\n</p><p>up\n</p><p>and that is pretty much basically oh we\n</p><p>done yes we're done woo we're done and\n</p><p>that is that is there you go there you\n</p><p>have bumba lumba in his robot mode I say\n</p><p>in Simplicity and size is small and\n</p><p>stature this actually works even for\n</p><p>update of an anime feature so let's get\n</p><p>in let's look in on those DET let's get\n</p><p>close up soon not on those chest not on\n</p><p>that chest but where's the autofocus on\n</p><p>this\n</p><p>camera oh well we'll just make do what\n</p><p>we haveen\n</p><p>you got some lovely detail on his face\n</p><p>cute little smirk his eyes this Lely\n</p><p>little pant like CR in the head just\n</p><p>like you see on the secret ship F folder\n</p><p>card those are going to be available in\n</p><p>the Etsy store soon plug for the Etsy\n</p><p>store the money does go the money does\n</p><p>go to CHR Jam Prime she gets that money\n</p><p>so you go on the store you buy and\n</p><p>purchase from there she gets a big chunk\n</p><p>of that money so you're doing a good\n</p><p>service for her like that okay there's a\n</p><p>Shameless plug they going Time the show\n</p><p>anyway so we didn't look down got a\n</p><p>lovely look at those flames and then\n</p><p>just love you got like those flames it's\n</p><p>like a nice update when you look at that\n</p><p>picture from that particular card that\n</p><p>was just\n</p><p>mentioned and then we go up the\n</p><p>back feel little heels you got a little\n</p><p>backpack going on there but that's cool\n</p><p>now articulation wise the head is on a\n</p><p>ball joint you got a lot of Wiggly\n</p><p>waggly going on you can look you can\n</p><p>look down and\n</p><p>you can look up a lot do a total\n</p><p>squirrel or you can use that\n</p><p>transformation joint and do a total\n</p><p>squirrel and then some Square sare bend\n</p><p>it flying\n</p><p>forward that's fun and of course uh it\n</p><p>can rotate do a full 360 with getting it\n</p><p>chin out from up those sharp pieces arms\n</p><p>can only go up that far and back that\n</p><p>far you got a joint at the shoulder here\n</p><p>you got a joint at just above the uh\n</p><p>bicep here so you got some range of\n</p><p>movement you have this joint if you want\n</p><p>to dislocate anyway but still you can\n</p><p>give you good poses this way and of\n</p><p>course uh\n</p><p>arms can do like rotate at the\n</p><p>I get 90° of Bend there that you got\n</p><p>hand rotation there you got a little\n</p><p>inward outward rotation if you open this\n</p><p>up that's maybe do for\n</p><p>transformation you have waist rotation\n</p><p>legs before that far back then go that\n</p><p>far outward you can pretty much full\n</p><p>spit yeah thigh\n</p><p>rotation you get a really good range of\n</p><p>knee Bend there it's like over 90\n</p><p>degrees of band the knee feet can go up\n</p><p>a little bit can go down and can can't\n</p><p>go go down\n</p><p>you got a little bit of ankle tilted\n</p><p>there now as far as this weapons go of\n</p><p>course uh you can do them multiple ways\n</p><p>so of course you can hold them in this\n</p><p>hands come on work me here there we go\n</p><p>can hold him in his hands he can zap zap\n</p><p>zap zap\n</p><p>like without the rock\n</p><p>like BL BL I don't think you get any\n</p><p>bles within that tiny hole I'm wondering\n</p><p>though let's see this small I mean M was\n</p><p>like nope but can that work can it\n</p><p>work not really okay what we tried it's\n</p><p>like we did something that he didn't but\n</p><p>aside from that of course\n</p><p>uh we can put these on this back and I\n</p><p>can store on there like that be like\n</p><p>nobody in the comment be like hey that\n</p><p>one ConEd would when she put them on the\n</p><p>back anyway but there you go and of\n</p><p>course with a full upright hit and that\n</p><p>there you go like RAR\n</p><p>SP\n</p><p>delightful and then of course the fun\n</p><p>detail those on this back just because\n</p><p>going open these up\n</p><p>foot the hands\n</p><p>in I just mention this since he didn't\n</p><p>mention so of course uh with the little\n</p><p>Stinger on there just like that it's\n</p><p>kind of awkward you think about the\n</p><p>position of that Stinger it's like um\n</p><p>okay how am I supposed to sting\n</p><p>something like this I mean even just\n</p><p>like it looks like he wants a hand out\n</p><p>hey give me give me some change give me\n</p><p>some change we're not thaty\n</p><p>nope I think obviously you could do a\n</p><p>little work around with that just turn\n</p><p>one be like that's a little better\n</p><p>that's a little\n</p><p>better all right so we just get that\n</p><p>there just go ahead put that there and I\n</p><p>put the two\n</p><p>together and you got that good that\n</p><p>lovely little bit of two headed Stinger\n</p><p>action going\n</p><p>up up this\n</p><p>let's see here let's see if we can do\n</p><p>this let's do this live on\n</p><p>camera kind of sort of you know what\n</p><p>that works I'll take it so yeah now we\n</p><p>can do a lovely zapping bumba Lumber I\n</p><p>don't have a Graphic blue so I apologize\n</p><p>for do\n</p><p>noise and then Fe F fall\n</p><p>off\n</p><p>and for\n</p><p>comparon here is Bumble lumba with nfz\n</p><p>Bumblebee\n</p><p>with pun\n</p><p>slav\n</p><p>with\n</p><p>Wy\n</p><p>with\n</p><p>a t be updated\n</p><p>cracker\n</p><p>with a to be\n</p><p>updated scel ass\n</p><p>vessel\n</p><p>with\n</p><p>FR and here's how Bumble lumba Compares\n</p><p>and scale with the other the combiners a\n</p><p>quick fill including combiner form and\n</p><p>Selena here is how Bumble MBA scales\n</p><p>with the trio of about Chris Chan\n</p><p>between the origin form on the right the\n</p><p>main CH Chris Chan Prime iot in the\n</p><p>center and of course uh the combiner\n</p><p>form Chris Chand in the the left along\n</p><p>with rung in both\n</p><p>ways he hears how bumble scales with San\n</p><p>at Selena silver armor Prowler and Jet\n</p><p>an awesome Dynamic battle scene we\n</p><p>they're defending the city a quick\n</p><p>bill with Legacy animated\n</p><p>Bumblebee and of course last but not\n</p><p>least here he is with the original\n</p><p>animated bumble B because he's so\n</p><p>precious oh so precious\n</p><p>so there you go and yeah as I do really\n</p><p>love I really like this figure I mean\n</p><p>just size quality and update to uh just\n</p><p>you know M mates update to the precious\n</p><p>figure mentioned earlier it's actually\n</p><p>is quite good I like the uh how it can\n</p><p>stand good on his feet makes good good\n</p><p>shorts just obviously if I was to give\n</p><p>it like a little comparative mod maybe\n</p><p>just like you know the ends of the arms\n</p><p>where the bo where the little Stingers\n</p><p>could connect to could be more flat\n</p><p>that's more grievance with it but they\n</p><p>have to give it like do something to\n</p><p>make it like\n</p><p>connect you know give something go back\n</p><p>and forth there that would more easier\n</p><p>and hey who hasn't thought about us\n</p><p>actually using the rocket boosters to\n</p><p>give him fight because that's one thing\n</p><p>they can do I mean I think that was also\n</p><p>portrayed that was also portrayed some\n</p><p>sometimes anyway yeah there you go\n</p><p>Bumble Lumber can fly but he's not a\n</p><p>bumblebee but anyway aside from that if\n</p><p>you want to hear the back story for\n</p><p>Bumble laba and all the other\n</p><p>individuals of the alots of quickfi you\n</p><p>can look at that previous live stream I\n</p><p>did so there you go now I pick this up\n</p><p>in a l collab personally with\n</p><p>Hasbro and you might be able find this\n</p><p>on Hasbro Pearl sooner and later but if\n</p><p>you would like the similar figure you\n</p><p>can always get the Transformers anime B\n</p><p>big figure from Hasbro Pro even like big\n</p><p>btoy store.com or your local Target your\n</p><p>local Walmart whichever comes up at that\n</p><p>time but anyway I think that's about it\n</p><p>so there you go you don't stop saying\n</p><p>you don't stop playing because you're\n</p><p>grow old gr because you stop playing big\n</p><p>gek be\n</p><p>proud\n</p><p>[Applause]\n</p><p>F okay so everybody knows this\n</p><p>particular outtake that we are doing\n</p><p>right now is not canon with the present\n</p><p>animated project in progress thank you\n</p><p>all very much for your continued support\n</p><p>and have a lovely blessed safe day\n</p><p>yay I love a good pizza bagel from this\n</p><p>CIA quick\n</p><p>F

Bay la da dumba jumba Bumblebee. Buzzing around...</a> Yeah no, that's not Bumblebee. That's Bumba Lumba. This video has been a long time coming. In the set of the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a> Autobots!\n</p><p>[<i>Chris makes noise with his mouth as text appears on screen</i>]\n</p><p>Light Powered Cwclight Reviews\n</p><p><b>Chris:</b> Heyyy what's up YouTubers! Christ Chan here and tod- and another freaky <a href=\"/cwcki/OC\" title=\"OC\">OC</a> review and today we will be reviewing of the CWCville Autobot team Transformers Legacy CWCville edition <b>BUMBA LUMBA</b> and so here we are and there he is. And first and foremost there's a [<i>picks up the box and brings it closer to the camera</i>] let's go take a quick look at the packaging so we have from- we got here this lovely little box of this [<i>unintelligible</i>] Legacy United Animated Universe Bumblebee. So we got the front [<i>stammers</i>] it's a- it's a deluxe class • classe deluxe, deluxe-klasse • <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_Spanish\" title=\"Chris and Spanish\">clase de lujo</a> Transformers! On the side of the box you got half a lovely piece of artwork, and I say half because look like it's like it's another half of a picture there. Other side of the box you got lovely part lovely mold of pictures of the of the old Bumble Meister. And then top of the box this lovely little flap. And bottom [<i>unintelligible</i>] barcodes. And on the back of the box you have your obligatory [<i>mimics Transformers transformation sound?</i>] that's basically for... [<i>throws the box off camera</i>] the packaging. [<i>video cuts</i>] And moving right along here is our lovely little Bumba Lumba, two words Bumba Lumba. [<i>autistic singing</i>] It's a lovely little souped up sports car with a lovely flea mar- on look at it, rise of the phoenix, can you rise? <b>RISE OF THE PHOENIX!</b> [<i>makes a noise</i>] Huhh anyway, let's take a look around all this lovely vehicle. So in front here we got the grille and headlights looking all nice and good looking and all that, got the fire bird there. All nice and green. You got the side of the vehicle. Its got like a hole here and a hole there which is- like at least that's a good looking painted window. There's the back of the vehicle complete with <b>TAIL LIGHTS</b> HEY you better break when the lights flash red vvv vvv vvv vvv. There's the other side, so- there's the top, there's the bottom. It does roll [<i>slides the toy car back and forth on the table</i>] as well as [<i>unintelligible</i>] slide [<i>unintelligible</i>] [<i>stops sliding the toy car back and forth</i>] sliding light things... And for comparison [<i>Netflix Bumblebee toy is placed on the table</i>] here he is with Netflix Bumblebee. [<i>grabs Netflix Bumblebee toy and moves it off camera and the video cuts</i>] [<i>Earthrise Optimus Prime toy is placed on the table</i>] And of course here's Bumba with the good old standard comparison with Earthrise Optimus Prime. \n</p><p><b>Earthrise Optimus Prime:</b> Can you rise?\n</p><p><b>Bumba Lumba:</b> I think I can Optimus. But I know, I know <a href=\"/cwcki/Son-Chu\" title=\"Son-Chu\">Son-Chu</a> can, he's done it more times than I have. Yeah [<i>unintelligible</i>] from the other dimension heh.\n</p><p><b>Chris:</b> [<i>rolls Earthrise Optimus Prime toy offscreen and video cuts again</i>] [<i>Punislav is placed on the table</i>] Punislav of the dece- of the PVC Citizen <a href=\"/cwcki/Decepti-Clones\" title=\"Decepti-Clones\">Decepti-Clones</a>. [<i>takes Punislav offscreen and grabs Gwenmi Mikoto and places it on the table</i>] With Gwenmi Mikoto in a lovely old cybertronic pickup truck. [<i>grabs Gwenmi Mikoto and moves it off camera and the video cuts</i>] Here is Bumba Lumba [<i>places Cybertron Deluxe Skywarp on the table</i>] with Cybertronian Thundercracker needs to desperately to be like Crackder [<i>grabs Cybertron Deluxe Skywarp and moves it off camera and the video cuts</i>] And here's Bumba Lumba with [<i>places Swindle (Animated) toy on the table</i>] Animated Swindle that is also going to be repainted to be more like an S.A.V. (Scoundrel as Vessel). [<i>grabs the Swindle (Animated) toy and moves it off camera and the video cuts to an assortment of Transformers toys on the table</i>] And here he is with all the other autobots of CWCville the top five or so hehh... which they will each get their respective review videos not too long from now until I can redo <a href=\"/cwcki/Son-Chu_Review\" title=\"Son-Chu Review\">Son-Chu's video</a> because I had so much noise in the original video I had the PlayStation. So yeah, of course there's Jet goes with Armoraxe over there, but hey options they're good, they're good. [<i>video cuts to a different assortment of Transformers toys on the table</i>] And here is Bumba Lumba with our CWCville combiner team including combiner mode Excelina far in the back there. [<i>video cuts again to a different assortment of Transformers toys on the table</i>] Here he is with autobot Chris Chan Prime and all her three forms between origin, main, and combiner limb form. [<i>video cuts to just Bumba Lumba on the table</i>] ...with [<i>places Legacy Animated Bumblebee toy on the table</i>] Legacy Animated Bumblebee. [<i>grabs the toy and brings it back off camera and video cuts</i>] And of course with the original [<i>places original Animated Bumblebee toy on the table</i>] Animated Bumblebee because it's precious! Also sticky animated precious! ZOOM! [<i>video cuts</i>] And of course Bumba Lumba does come with some accessories. [<i>places the accessories on the table</i>] Get a pair of lovely stingers. Bzz bzz, bzz bzz. <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC-isms#Z\" title=\"CWC-isms\">Zap it up to the extreme</a>. You got all the lovely silver paint on the transparent blue plastic which I feel like that's the way it works. And you got these lovely little turbo rockets that at silver paint and just all good and all that. And of course to store these in vehicle mode because you don't have a port for those stingers here, and put them onto these... pockets and put them right here on the door like that just pushing forward push. [<i>slides the toy car back and forth on the table and then stops</i>] And of course uhh you know it's blasting forward whichever way you want or of course you can store it back here as was the case with the original vehicle. [<i>screams precious and pushes Animated Bumblebee across the table</i>] Oh so precious woo! [<i>video cuts</i>] So that is basically it for the vehicle mode, so let's get down to the transformation shall we. [<i>spins Bumba Lumba around</i>] Let's get a really good spin on him, spin it, spin it to win! Woo, woo, woo! Hehheh delightful, delightful. Alright so let me just rotate the camera up a little bit. Okay, right down to it. Course move the [<i>?</i>]. And what I like doing on this uh I- I say we start by folding up what's in the trunk, so we just split the shoulders up just pop that up there and then we pull these out. Pull them like that doo doo. At this point we can just go ahead, go and take the hands out. Close that up. See the little flip arms, they close up like that and we just want to wiggle these out, they're on a double hinge. And we definitely want to get that down to business, so we are going to bring down the legs. Work with it as you got do as you want, but anyway bring that down you want to rotate that 180. And then let that click let that click into place. I'll just go ahead and put these elbows in the right orientation... Hehh... And then let's see, oh right got to split the legs and then we flip the hoods up, pull these black sections down those be his kneecaps. Sometimes it can be a little tricky, might need a makeshift splitter for that. There you go. And give that a 180 rotation... Hmm put the heel spurs out the knees and then rotate put the feet down you close up the gaps here... And of course you just rotate this vvoop. And then reveal the lovely Bumba Lumba Meister mode and shift the shoulders up. And that is pretty much basically uh we done, yes we're done. Weee done. And that is b- and that is, there you go. There you have Bumba Lumba in his robot mode. I say its simplicity and size is small in stature. This works even for an update of an animated feature. So let's get in, let's look in those det- let's get close ups soon not on those che- not on tha- chest bu- where's the autofocus on this camera. Oh well, we'll just make do with what we have but. You got this lovely detail on his face. Cute little smirk, his eyes, this lovely little painted black crest on the head just like you see on the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Secret_Shipfic\" title=\"Secret Shipfic\">Secret Shipfic</a> Folder card. Those are going to be available on the <a href=\"/cwcki/Etsy\" title=\"Etsy\">Etsy</a> store soon! Pluf for the Etsy store! The money does go.\n</p><p><b>Bumba Lumba:</b> The money does go to Chris Chan Prime, she gets that money so you go on the Etsy store. You buy and purchase from there. She gets a big chunk of that money. You are doing a good service for her like that, okay. There's a shameless plug, they got time to show. \n</p><p><b>Chris:</b> Anyway so we do look down got a lovely look at those flames and then just love if you got like those flames. It's like a nice update, when you look at that picture from that particular card that was just mentioned. And then go up the back. Feels little heels, you got a little backpack going on there, that's cool. Articulation wise, the head is on a ball, you got a lot of wiggly waggly going on. You can look, he can look down and up a- he can look up a lot! Do a total squirrel or he can use that transformation joint into a total squirrel and then some. Squirrel squirrel. B- flying forward Jjooo hehehh. That's fun and of course he can rotate and do a full 360 with getting the chin out from above the sharp pieces. Arms can only go up that far and back that far. You got a joint at the shoulder here. You got a joint at just above the uh bicep here. So you got some range of movement, you have this joint if you want to dislocate anyway. But still you can give you good poses this way and of course uh arms can do like rotate at the bicep, careful. You get 90 degrees of bend there that you got hand rotation there. You got a little inward outward rotation if you open this up. That's make do for transformation. You have waist rotation. Legs... go that far back then go that far outward. You can pretty much do a full splits. You have thigh rotation. You got a really good range of knee bend there. It's like over 90 degrees of bend at the knee. Feet can go up a little bit, can go down and ca- can't go down. You got a little bit of ankle tilt there. [<i>video cuts</i>] Now as far as his weapons go. Of course uh you can do them multiple ways, so of course you can hold them in his hands... Come on, work here. There we go. You can hold them in his hands he can zap zap, zap zap pew pew ba ba. Or like without the rocket [<i>?</i>]. Zap zap, dooboosh, zap zap, bloosh bloosh. I don't think you can get any blooshes within that tiny hole. I'm wondering though, let's see there's more bloosh I mean Emgo was like nope. But did that work, did that work, not really. Okay, well we tried it's like disappointing he didn't. But aside from that of course uh we can put these on his back and I could store on there like that. Be like somebody in the comment section be like \"hey, that one connected when she put them on the back\". Anyway but there you go and of course with a full upright hit and that, there you go. Be like boosh into outer space. Byeerrsh brooosh berrrsh hehheh oooo delightful. And then of course the fun detail. [<i>unintelligible mumbling</i>] because. Open these up, flip the hands in... I will just mention this since he didn't mention it, so of course uh put this little stinger on there just like that. It's kind of awkward when you think about the position of that stinger. It's like um how am I supposed to sting something like this? I mean even just [<i>stutters</i>] it is like he wants a hand out. \"Hey give me give me some change, give me some change we're not happy\", nope ehehehh. I think obviously we could do a little work around with that just turn one be like that's a little better that's a little better. Alright so we just get that there. Just go ahead put that there. And I put two together and you got that good that lovely little bit of two-heading stinger action going like bzz, bzz, bzz bzz bzz, bzz, bzz zap it up to the extreme bzz bzzps. Let's see here, let's see if we can do this. Let's do this live on camera. Kind of, sort of? Eh-you know what that works, I'll take it. So yeah, now we can do a lovely zapping Bumba Lumba! I don't have a graphic for this so, I apologize for that so I'll do [<i>?</i>] here. <b>BOOOOOOOOOOOOSH!</b> [<i>the laser accessory falls off the Bumba Lumba toy</i>] And then it completely fe- fell off. Hahehehehehh. [<i>video cuts</i>] And for comparison, here is Bumba Lumba with [<i>Netflix Bumblebee toy is placed on the table</i>] Netflix Bumblebee. [<i>grabs Netflix Bumblebee toy and moves it off camera</i>] With... [<i>Punislav is placed on the table</i>] Punislav. [<i>grabs Punislav and moves it off camera</i>] With... [<i>Gwenmi Mikoto is placed on the table</i>] Gwenmi. [<i>grabs Gwenmi Mikoto and moves it off camera</i>] With... [<i>Cybertron Deluxe Skywarp is placed on the table</i>] a to be updated Crackder. [<i>grabs Cybertron Deluxe Skywarp and moves it off camera</i>] With... [<i>Swindle (Animated) toy is placed on the table</i>] a to be updated Scoundrel as Vessel. [<i>grabs Swindle (Animated) and moves it off camera and video cuts</i>] With... [<i>Earthrise Optimus Prime toy is placed on the table</i>] Prime. [<i>grabs Earthrise Optimus Prime and moves it off camera and video cuts to an assortment of Transformers toys on the table</i>] And here's how Bumba Lumba compares in scale with the other the combiners of CWCville including combiner form Excelina. [<i>video cuts to a different assortment of Transformers toys on the table</i>] Here's how Bumba Lumba scales with the trio of of uh Chris Chans between the origin form on the right, the main Christ- Chris Chan Prime autobot in the center, and of course uh the combiner form Chris Chan on the da left along with rung in both ways. [<i>video cuts to a different assortment of Transformers toys on the table</i>] And here's how Bumba Lumba scales with Son-Chu, Excelina, Silver, Armoraxe, Prowler, and Jet. An awesome dynamic battle scene where they're defending the city of CWCville. Hehehh. [<i>video cuts to just Bumba Lumba on the table</i>] With [<i>Legacy Animated Bumblebee toy is placed on the table</i>] Legacy Animated Bumblebee. [<i>grabs Legacy Animated Bumblebee and moves it off camera and video cuts</i>] And of course last but not least. Here he is with the original [<i>places original Animated Bumblebee toy on the table</i>] Animated Bumble Baby because he's so preciouuuus! Oh so preciouuuuuuuuuus! Jjoo. [<i>grabs original Animated Bumblebee and moves it off camera and video cuts</i>] So there you go and yeah as [<i>?</i>] I do really love I really like this figure. I mean just size quality and updated to uh just you know [<i>?</i>] updated to precious figure mention earlier. It's actually is quite good. I like the uh how it can stand good on his feet, makes really good shorts. Just obviously if I was to give it like a little comparative mod, maybe just like you know the ends of the arms where the boo- where the little stingers could connect to could be more flat. That's my one grievance with it, but they have to give it like do something to make it like connect there and then make it like you know go vvv vvv  vvv vvv you know give it something to go back and forth there that would glide more easier. And hey, who hasn't thought about us- actually using the rocket boosters to give him <b>FLIGHT</b>? Because that's one thing they can do. I mean I think that was also portrayed- that was also portrayed sometime. Anyway yeah there you go Bumba Lumba can fly, but he's not a Bumblebee. But anyway aside from that, if you want to heat the backstory for Bumba Lumba and all the other individuals of the autobots of CWCville you can look at that <a href=\"/cwcki/December_2023_livestreams#Fan_Mail_and_Cwcville_Autobots\" title=\"December 2023 livestreams\">previous live stream</a> I did, so there you go. [<i>video cuts</i>] Now I pick this up in a lovely little collab personally with <a href=\"/cwcki/Hasbro\" title=\"Hasbro\">Hasbro</a> hehh. And you might be able to find this on Hasbro Pro sooner or later, but if you would like the similar figure you can always get the Transformers Animated Bumblebee figure from Hasbro Pro or even like bigbadtoystore.com or your local Target, your local Walmart, whichever comes up at that time. But anyway I think that's about it, so there you go. You don't stop sayi- you don't stop playing because you grow old grow old because you stop playing. Be geek, be proud. <b><a href=\"/cwcki/CWC-isms#P\" title=\"CWC-isms\">PFFFAAAAALM!</a></b> [<i>Chris puts his hand on the camera lens and video cuts to <a href=\"/cwcki/Christine_Doll\" title=\"Christine Doll\">Christine Doll</a> 2.0</i>]\n</p><p><b>Christine Doll:</b> Okay so everybody knows this particular outtake that we are doing right now is not canon with the present animated project in progress.
