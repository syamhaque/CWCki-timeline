server and there was a lot of uh exceptional behavior going on that day to the point where i i don't know if you know who Darkseid Phil is but Darkseid Phil is this individual who does let's plays and he was yeah and uh that on that day he he got kicked off of twitch so everybody in that server was freaking out over that and then half the internet went down because of cloud player so once so by the time you showed up in the in in the mat at the internet server people quite literally couldn't believe that that was that that was Sonichu because yeah and also in the past uh there's also a lot of people also a lot of people you know you obviously know this but there's people who've been pretended to be Sonichu on discord and and on other platforms so they p probably thought it was a fake and since they did and since they don't know you and how you know your your particular style of writing like any any true chritorian would have been able to look at that and tell like oh yeah that's that's\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> ...yeah especially with all the things that I've seen and experienced\n</p><p><font color=\"#FE2E2E\"><b>Bismuth:</b></font> yeah i i like the way i like the way you bantered back and forth uh forward because you were expecting or you know so uh you know i i don't i'm \nnot sure what you were expecting i don't want to assume anything but the way you said like go ahead and show me your pick you're the the troll \nyou know like you you took care of it like like a boss you were ready to take to take them on and i like it because but if you notice nobody nobody said anything because you know they know even though even though mine is not in there some of the the people who matter in that server know that i'm bismuth that's why that's why i said hi that's why i tagged you and tagged you and said hi i know you've been playing uh dnd recently because you used the term you know chaotic uh you know chaotic good and that confused that that confused some people and i and i was trying to tell them like it's a it's a you know it's a dungeon in the dragon's term you know come on\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> yeah \n</p><p><font color=\"#FE2E2E\"><b>Bismuth:</b></font> yeah like read a book you know (giggling)\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> but yeah i wanted to make sure i was i wanted to make sure they knew that it was me and that meant not mom and not mama Chris chan so yeah i just essentially put my foot \nforward i'd be like hey i like my dick's mostly pink!\n</p><p><font color=\"#FE2E2E\"><b>Bismuth:</b></font> yeah that \nwas but yeah that was funny as fuck that that made me laugh so hard um and you you like just just just as like uh just as Josh you know said to you you brought so much you you bring and you brought so much fucking joy to this world and you continue to do so that's why one of the reasons why you know we you need to remain safe\n</p><p><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>Spade:</b></font> yeah you're amazing Sonichu\n</p><p><font color=\"#FE2E2E\"><b>Bismuth:</b></font> yeah we want nothing but the best for you\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> (mumbling)\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> i must be in the same dimension as Rosie that's the most valuable thing i think she's right next to me so it's like we're literally so near yet so far\n</p><p><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>Spade:</b></font> yeah \n</p><p><font color=\"#FE2E2E\"><b>Bismuth:</b></font> ...That's that's that's really sweet i wish i wish more wish more people didn't try to use didn't uh i wouldn't try to weaponize a Roseachu against you because they know you know that that i i love that little couplet that you wrote you know as long as the birds tweet you shall be my heart sweet\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> (laughing)\n</p><p><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>Spade:</b></font> it was adorable yeah so corny but cute\n</p><p><font color=\"#FE2E2E\"><b>Bismuth:</b></font> no it's not even corny it's cute i like i like it fight me it looks cute still is\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> that's a big cuteness oh boy and i like and then i definitely like what the trick was this trick quite tricky at her book you know hey i can see i can hey are you a ship cause i can see us doing meows to me out\n</p><p><font color=\"#FE2E2E\"><b>Bismuth:</b></font> that is pretty funny\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> it's just you know the stupid cheesy corny flirt lines or something Rosie and i did have back in the day (mumbling)\n</p><p><font color=\"#FE2E2E\"><b>Bismuth:</b></font> oh so oh sorry it's just a uh it's an interview with this uh fella named uh Darkside Phil the person that i was mentioning they're doing a little interview with him he's trying to explain why he was kicked off of Twitch\n</p><p>Speaker 3: who's twitch who's interviewing him?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FE2E2E\"><b>Bismuth:</b></font> oh uh he's interviewing he's interviewing himself because he's too afraid to because Darkseid Phil is a genuinely like nasty person so he won't go on he won't speak to\nanybody unless they pay him\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> so he's just like interviewing himself is he like playing two different characters himself and somebody entirely different\n</p><p><font color=\"#FE2E2E\"><b>Bismuth:</b></font> he's just uh he'll state he'll state uh one thing he'll say like so my detractor said this and then he'll respond to himself\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> okay\n</p><p><font color=\"#FE2E2E\"><b>Bismuth:</b></font> yeah it's called it's called it's called a hug box and that's one of the reasons that's one of the many reasons why you know you're awesome because you don't you know you're willing to go outside uh yeah you're willing to go outside that box\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> yep\n</p><p><font color=\"#FE2E2E\"><b>Bismuth:</b></font> not a lot of people are they just want to stay in places where oh you know their their narrow minded views are reinforced\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> yeah and then also some also\n</p><p><font color=\"#FE2E2E\"><b>Bismuth:</b></font> exploring!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> yeah if they are talking to somebody else they want to make sure they are being clearly understood that they are understanding the other people that's uh that's kind of like the reasons why mama doesn't typically have her ears doesn't like you know phone conversation as much especially when you got the person in the other room that's (unintelligible)\nconversation with kai and more than half the time uh look at this (unintelligible) all right so it's like he definitely confirms the magic (unintelligible)\n</p><p><font color=\"#FE2E2E\"><b>Bismuth:</b></font> yeah it's it's okay it's okay does he does he really speaks yeah does he does he speak that quick? or does he just simply bombard you with information\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> yeah he he literally kind of like did the combination of fast and low talking uh he took a baby test he had drank like a bunch like some energy drinks and some sodas before\n</p><p><font color=\"#FE2E2E\"><b>Bismuth:</b></font> so yeah soda's not nice soda's does not good for you you know you gotta you know you gotta mix things up\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> and he also definitely definitely drinks some water at times as well so there's that yeah\n</p><p><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>Spade:</b></font> so it's kind of like a fast mumble?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> yeah that's what it sounds like yes\n</p><p><font color=\"#FE2E2E\"><b>Bismuth:</b></font> hmm that's why i try to articulate my words\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> yeah you know i get the same level you know according to memory when mama tried talking with Jake over the phone the uh vocals the way that he speaks that's about the same amount that's about nearly this similar difficulty i get from high school it's not exact but similar\n</p><p><font color=\"#FE2E2E\"><b>Bismuth:</b></font> yeah that's well that's not a good sign you know you you're into it yeah yeah use your intuition you know it to be true you know\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> but of course uh yeah kai is definitely different from Jake he's like the total opposite\n</p><p><font color=\"#FE2E2E\"><b>Bismuth:</b></font> well yeah well what i mean by what i mean by that is can you know people who are confused sometimes tend to tend to be the same it's not that he's possibly even malicious but it's just that he could just be another confused person you know because we because we we still don't know uh like uh does did he know did he know about did he know about mama before all of this? did he know about mama from from the documentaries? or what\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> no he never knew yeah he never knew about mama Chris chan until the day she went to that first dungeons and dragons session and met him there\n</p><p><font color=\"#FE2E2E\"><b>Bismuth:</b></font> i i don't understand how that's possible i i don't understand how that's possible though your mom is so famous yeah my mama's infamous especially remember\nuh mama left that sign uh out in front of that that how uh out in front of there and even the store owners knew it was news from mama yeah so it's so weird\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> and kai is not one of those it goes goes on often with the social medias\n</p><p><font color=\"#FE2E2E\"><b>Bismuth:</b></font> oh well he so he had no power so he so he and the rest of the group did not really have much prior knowledge about mama (unintelligible) and everything so it just decides they have they chaos the internet on that point so that was definitely a good thing that we said that channel the others sat down and foreseen in that particular dnd group\n</p><p>Speaker 4: um if i may ask Sonichu is this the person you drew a picture for for their Sonichu oc?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> yeah darkri Sonichu \n</p><p>Speaker 4: yeah that's right because i remember i remember you telling me that that's very interesting i was just curious if that was\nthe same person\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> yeah that's yeah that's him\n</p><p>Speaker 4: okay\n</p><p><font color=\"#FE2E2E\"><b>Bismuth:</b></font> uh yeah no that was a good question to ask yeah that's actually something that you\n</p><p><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>Spade:</b></font> try to talk to us and like hang out we're not\n</p><p><font color=\"#FE2E2E\"><b>Bismuth:</b></font> yeah exactly just come yeah yeah just come hang it just come hang out with us you know we all\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> difficulties as well\n</p><p><font color=\"#FE2E2E\"><b>Bismuth:</b></font> i mean we i mean every each of us each of us here do come on like let's we're we're all we're all we're all friends\nhere we we all do i don't know there's nothing yeah there's nothing for him you know there's nothing for him to be scared of\njust\n</p><p><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>Spade:</b></font> and It feels like he's avoiding us and that makes me feel suspicious and i feel like it would just make everything yeah... \nit makes me nervous\n</p><p><font color=\"#FE2E2E\"><b>Bismuth:</b></font> yeah well uh that val really doesn't like it either because uh for obvious reasons\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> yeah well val's psychic and you know he can always ask for protection let literally go find kai and visit him personally\n</p><p><font color=\"#FE2E2E\"><b>Bismuth:</b></font> well kai won't speak to val no on on any on any level that's why that's what's worrying he keeps blocking himself off\nyes yes on every on every level on every on every level in every place and multiple times ... i know i yeah i i understand it's\nfrustrating and it's not and it's partially not your problem but the thing is kai has inserted himself into your life\nand into you know into mama's life and sonni and Sonichu's so just be careful\n</p><p>Speaker 4: it's something that you know that would pique interest you know it's a very specific interest\n</p><p><font color=\"#FE2E2E\"><b>Bismuth:</b></font> yeah yeah and and also the whole dungeons and dragons thing and not knowing it just you know doesn't something\n</p><p><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>Spade:</b></font> how do you live in Ruckgersville and not know who Chris chan is that's just kind of \n</p><p><font color=\"#FE2E2E\"><b>Bismuth:</b></font> yeah\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> (unintelligible) Virginia \n</p><p><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>Spade:</b></font> oh \n</p><p>Speaker 4: okay that makes a bit more sense\n</p><p><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>Spade:</b></font> yeah okay\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> (unintelligible) 64 to take y'all to keep that strictly confidential\n</p><p><b>Everyone else responds:</b> yeah\n</p><p><font color=\"#FE2E2E\"><b>Bismuth:</b></font> well you know you you know anything that you anything that you or mama tell us is confidential stays confidential\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> yes thanks\n</p><p><font color=\"#FE2E2E\"><b>Bismuth:</b></font>any time\n</p><p>Speaker 4: the other thing that um piqued my interest was the fact that kai you know i'm still new i'm i'm not i don't know too much\num ... huh? \n</p><p>Speaker 3: uh i'm not really too familiar but go on it's all right\n</p><p>Speaker 4: um oh shoot my train\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> (unintelligible)\n</p><p>All: (laughter)\n</p><p><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>Spade:</b></font> sorry\n</p><p>Speaker 4: i was just like wait\n</p><p>Speaker 3: um by the way how you how's your night going Sonichu\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> well going fair going as well as it can be to just go to this dress up earlier today as was telling everybody else and uh\nand very much taking a break by binging stuff bending cartoons on hbo max\n</p><p><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>Spade:</b></font>: i hope yeah i hope you're enjoying it because there's a lot of good cons on hbo max right now\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font>: they got hannah barbara classics on there\n</p><p>Speaker 5: do they have any 90s cartoons on there by any chance?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font>: 90s cartoons?\n</p><p>Speaker 5: yeah \n</p><p>Speaker 4: like rocco's modern life cat dog\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font>: yeah they don't have nickelodeon on there\n</p><p>Speaker 5: no i'm talking no cartoon network i'm talking about old school cartoon network do they have it because hbo is owned by warner\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font>: yeah uh the only thing i found on there that's from past day cartoon network so far was og powerpuff girls\n</p><p>Speaker 5: oh awesome\n</p><p>Speaker 3: i don't like the new version of the powerpuff girls\n</p><p>Speaker 5: no that no that person sucks ass\n</p><p><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>Spade:</b></font>: like why did they take the boobies away like what's so offensive about boobs people have them they feed their children with them\n</p><p>Speaker 5: miss Bella\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font>: were children they weren't supposed to have\n</p><p><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>Spade:</b></font>: oh no not the powerpuff girls like all the other female characters in the show they like removed all well\n</p><p>Speaker 4: like like the mayor's assistants and all that and the teacher and stuff they just like it just seemed really unnecessary to\nchange their designs in that way\n</p><p>Speaker 4: um i haven't watched the reboot i just saw like the one episode where they were all twerking and i was like i i can't i'm sorry\n</p><p>Speaker 5: i don't blame you yeah that show is a piece of shit anyway it's like that new uh uh my little pony cartoon that just showed up\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font>: and even and i even yeah i mean i'm continuing to watch that you know at least once one time per episode\nand just you know continue to monitor it they have pure new voice and discord now\n</p><p>Speaker 4: yes my favorite my favorite peter knew my my big mac sorry geeking out\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font>: and the premiere episode get this mount volcan nope oh yeah okay that came out yesterday\n</p><p>Speaker 4: i did i did i need to catch up on that\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font>: yes and uh also even dr wolf commented like you know you got these you got these short episodes are like about five minutes or so\ni'm trying to fit a life lesson in in in them but it's like there's definitely not enough time to validate such such lesson as\nas well as in the episode g and the episode g4 did\n</p><p>Speaker 4: here's like here's my like personal view on it i feel like it's pinkie pie's view of her friends that's what i feel like\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font>: yeah it's a quote dr wolf when i heard him it's all go go go go go\n</p><p>Speaker 4: yeah it's to me pony life seems like just the pinkie pie and\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font>: just not think about it to even get the most bit of enjoyment out of it and even even with this brain it just essentially stays\noff and i was going and i went into the into the uh pilot of the series you know which is neutral expectations even though i\neven know everybody have foreseen how bad it was going to be and then you saw the uh the tweet at post sales like just drowning\ni just couldn't help but crowd the majority of this show \n</p><p>Speaker 4: oh yeah well for me it was like you know it's just like the only thing i could ever credit is they literally took the my\nlittle pony and made them my little ponies that's pretty much all they did but \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font>: and by the way captain yeah we might heard it about this but kathy west sucks not watching spike in go pony but top of the sink\n</p><p>Speaker 4: yeah and i heard i was like hmm that's really interesting but you know i mean it would be nice to have the original spike\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font>: yeah basically i mean the main six are original voice actresses but yeah discord saying nope\n</p><p>Speaker 4: that discord meme where it's like he takes out his eyes and he he rolls them like dice and throws them away that's how i feel\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font>: that one yeah i mean our original discord in c197s equestria definitely is like rolling his eyes all over the place but having\njust seen you

documentaries they're awesome\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font>:(unintelligible) where kai was living previously for like well over a year uh he has not he has not had too much access to cable\ntelevision so he has highly unlikely seen this vice channel at all\n</p><p><font color=\"#FE2E2E\"><b>Bismuth:</b></font>: is that one of the reasons why he had to borrow money for groceries\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font>: no no no that's not the case it's not that he needs a no he did not it was not borrowing money at all it's just that he was\nlow on money for himself and he needed more food so i opted so i opted to help him out there\n</p><p>Speaker 4: that's very kind of you yeah you know\n</p><p><font color=\"#FE2E2E\"><b>Bismuth:</b></font>:

color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font>: don't know we all have cloudy brains\n</p><p>Speaker 4: yeah well you know how my brains work it's like an archive of libraries you pull a book and then sometimes you lose\nthe book and you misplace the book it's it's it's very different um but i was flipping through channels and i saw a commercial for vice um\nand it caught my eye because i saw it said chris chan and i was like hold on that's very odd so that's why i tagged\nyou in that twitter tweet saying well your mom i tagged your mom in that twitter tweet saying would you would you watch\nthis because i was i didn't know if you were aware but yeah i i know a lot of people watch vice especially for documentaries or just you\nknow that's what they mainly do if i'm correct i don't watch too much of it but i know that mostly cops and reality shows are on there\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font>: hmm i'm trying i'm looking i'm just googling uh you know vice channel and chris chan and i'm not seeing much results for\ncable channel although there is apparently there's a vice tv app\n</p><p>Speaker 4: yes they have an app too but it's a channel on dish network because my parents haven't but it's too expensive\nfor me i can't afford cable or the cable dish packs stuff of that nature\n</p><p>Speaker 5: who even watches cable tv anymore i just fucking pirate \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font>: um yeah we still have we still have cable we may and we definitely mainly end up using it for our wi-fi but we also have it on for\npretty much the music channels yeah pretty much been doing we've been pretty much doing the majority off television show watching via\nthe via the internet\n</p><p>Speaker 4: yeah that's fair i mean nowadays hulu netflix those kind of channels are taking over cable because it's more accessible and\ncheaper you know but yeah i didn't know vice had an app i just saw it um on the television and then on the twitter\non twitter um it talked about airing on a sunday i remember ...\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font>: let's see \n</p><p>Speaker 4:i can send you that in the um discord server

color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>Spade:</b></font>: ironically i like turtles i am that meme i suppose they're just such cute little critters!\n</p><p>Speaker 4: um my friend actually saved a huge soft shell turtle on the road the other day he sent me a picture of it and i was like whoa \n</p><p><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>Spade:</b></font>: poor baby i hope i'm really glad he saved it oh yeah he's doing the middle of the road though silly think i know it was\nmind you it's a flat those flat soft shell turtles like they normally stay in the water i'm they anger pancakes yes they they zoom\nthey zoom but yeah like i think it was because it was raining that day and um i live in the south so a lot of creeks and stuff rise and\nfall in this area because of the humidity so yeah it might have got out of the creek or something\n</p><p><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>Spade:</b></font>: yeah it's possible that it didn't have enough water or food to sustain it so he's looking for a new puddle to curl up in\n</p><p>Speaker 4: yeah but it's like it was huge it's like about it's like um it's a very thick turtle\n</p><p><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>Spade:</b></font>:i like soft shells they're funny looking\n</p><p>Speaker 4: my favorite ones are the little yellow belly sliders oh yes ... (unintelligible)\n</p><p><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>Spade:</b></font>: there's the ornate box turtle which has like a little yellow belly and yellow spots on it yeah that's probably not what you're\ntalking about though if it's slider anyways turtles\n</p><p>Speaker 4:  it's the ones with the red on their side of their face\n</p><p><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>Spade:</b></font>: oh yeah yeah i know what you're talking about that's a red-eared slider yeah i thought they were yellow bellythat might have\nbeen my mistake nah they have yellow bellies they just they're called the red eared slider common for pets because they're so cute\n</p><p>Speaker 4: but people just don't know how to take care of them and it makes me upset it's\n</p><p>Speaker 2:really sad\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font>: they really have red ears?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>Spade:</b></font>: um yeah they have red markings that go across their ear sort of moon shaped ones it's \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font>: they're very very tiny and they're super super fast they are turtles are super super fast\n</p><p>Speaker 4: yeah well some of them some of them some of them watch out wisely rabbit\n</p><p><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>Spade:</b></font>: indeed\n</p><p>Speaker 4: definitely\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font>: let me see some maybe cecil tortoise was one of those red red moon turtles\n</p><p>Speaker 4:probably\n</p><p><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>Spade:</b></font>: it would make sense\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font>: yeah and that name is actually memory cause mama and murray and likes the looney tunes show\n</p><p>Speaker 4:  oh\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font>: you know she remembers you know that that turtle is his name is cecil and yeah by a cecil turtle and he was working in an office out\nof his chair he has his co-worker julie she'll help him take it off that back (unintelligible)\n</p><p><br/>\n</p><p>Transcribed up to 30:20\n</p>\n<center><b>    Chats and calls</b></center>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n</p>\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"navbox\" style=\";\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"padding:2px;\">\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"nowraplinks collapsible mw-collapsed mw-collapsible\" style=\"width:100%;background:transparent;color:inherit;;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<th class=\"navbox-title\" colspan=\"2\" style=\";\"><div style=\"float:left; width:6em;text-align:left;\"> <span class=\"noprint plainlinksneverexpand\" style=\"white-space:nowrap; font-weight:normal; font-size:xx-small; ;;border:none;;\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"/w/index.php?title=Template:Classic_Chris_era&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" title=\"Template:Classic Chris era (page does not exist)\"><span style=\";;border:none;;\" title=\"View this template\">v</span></a> <span style=\"font-size:80%;\">•</span> <a class=\"new\" href=\"/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Classic_Chris_era&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" title=\"Template talk:Classic Chris era (page does not exist)\"><span style=\"color:#002bb8;;;border:none;;\" title=\"Discussion about this template\">d</span></a> <span style=\"font-size:80%;\">•</span> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"//sonichu.com/w/index.php?title=Template:Classic_Chris_era&amp;action=edit\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#002bb8;;;border:none;;\" title=\"You can edit this template.
