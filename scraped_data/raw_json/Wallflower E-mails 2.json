You are a well-detailed and creative storyteller. Maybe you can write a book were everything is from the wise owl's perspective. Take <a href=\"/cwcki/Harry_Potter\" title=\"Harry Potter\">Harry Potter</a>'s owl; he tells Harry's story and guieds him, but surely there is more to the owl, like did he have an owl family of his own? Or if he was originally a king or a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bob\" title=\"Bob\">wizard</a>, how does the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Wife\" title=\"Wife\">wife</a>/<a href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart\" title=\"Sweetheart\">sweetheart</a> and/or his human/half-owl children feel having an owl to look up to, especially while he's flying? And going into Owl Biology can inspire a more in-depth look at owls from your view.\n<p>I'll bet you wrote a lot of papers on Owls in High School that earned a lot of \"A\" grades. When I wrote paers for my classes, I did very well, including research on which is better caffiene-wise and better for people, soda or coffee. I also wrote great stories, poetry and literature essays.\n</p><p>Although what I enjoyed most from my H.S. days, was being around my circle of friends. I was very sad when I hd to leave them behind, but I am looking forward to the reunion lter this year. I was also manger/water-boy for the varsity basketball team during my freshman year... I think I've mentioned that before. :)\n</p><p>TTYL.

It's one of  my favorite things to do. I'd like to do more often.<br/>\n<p>Btw, Harry's owl is Hedwig and she's a female owl. I have written a couple of stories dealing with the owl universe. And this was before Guardians of Ga'Hoole, a total owl fantasy, and my number one favorite series, and Hoot.<br/>\nI wrote one back in highschool, called the &lt;CENSORED&gt;. This was about the same time I wrote this other one, &lt;CENSORED&gt;, cause it basically had the same 'human characters'.<br/>\nAnyhow, in &lt;CENSORED&gt;, the story was told in two characters pov's, one was a female owl and a girl, who ran the observatory. The girl's mission was to save the owls in Owlwood, from the hunters/bullies from her and her friends' school. Somewhere, the owl and the girl's two world collide with each other. Harper, a goshawk (I can crossbreed birds), is a pet of the main owl hunter, Turner. They both wanted one thing; Harper wanted the female owl, and Turner wanted the girl. But the girl's guy friends came around and helped her the female owl.<br/>\nMind you, this explanation is from my memory, and I've only read it a few times, when it was completed.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<dl><dt>February 18</dt></dl>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>I take it you are referring in working together on the owl's point of view story.

Monday sounds good for the Pizza outing. \n</p><p>I like what you've come up with for our owl story. One detail, \"Owl <a href=\"/cwcki/Transformers\" title=\"Transformers\">Transformation</a>\", it is okay; have you considered that &lt;CENSORED&gt; could have more natural or elemental powers along with transformation, although we will be seeing that a lot from her? Like she can have the wizard powers to heal, increase attack and defense and so forth. I'm thinking she could say, \"Mystical Owl <a href=\"/cwcki/Power\" title=\"Power\">Power</a>\", followed by the desired spell, \"Transformation to (owl breed)\", \"Healing\", \"Attack Increase\", etc. \n</p><p>Assuming we're still on base with the King being an owl most of the time, it may be good to think of a few characters he has advised with wisdom to aid them in their <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Education\" title=\"Education\">education</a>, battle or quest, because in the war between him and the crows and goshawks, the students can come in and aid our King Owl in his battle. \n</p><p>We should also come up with a title for the book (series), \"King Owl\" is good for start. We may come up with a possibly better title that may feature both the King and &lt;CENSORED&gt;; it should be direct, yet subtle. One title idea I had thought of earlier, to play on the family part, \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Family_Guy\" title=\"Family Guy\">Family Owl</a>\". \n</p><p>I'll wrap it up for now, and I look forward to coming by your house later today. \n</p><p>Stay Safe,<br/>\nChristian C.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<dl><dt>February 27</dt></dl>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#F2CECE; border:1px dotted #BFA3A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Hey,\n<p>Sorry this is short notice, but I forgot that Mom had something planned for me on Monday.

Thunderstone, then heads home to his family after seeing the dude's safe and well. I also was thinking that <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Zelina\" title=\"Zelina\">Zelina</a> and &lt;CENSORED&gt; can be mentor-type friends, where they hang out and advise each other in their family or royalty situations. <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Darkbind\" title=\"Darkbind\">Darkbind</a> can be another of Alister's students. And <a href=\"/cwcki/Clawdorf\" title=\"Clawdorf\">Clawdorf</a> can be the ringleader of the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Kitty\" title=\"Kitty\">enemy animal</a> clans. I'll go further in detail next time we talk or meet.\n</p><p>And I wanted to check, where in Heartland are the Castle Virginanaus and Temple Athena Pathenon located, compass-wise?\n</p><p>Something else that happened to me today, I got in the mail a Birthday Present from one of my fans.

Speaking of LBP, I am thinking of creating a level based on our first Guardian of the Owl Kingdom story. Most likely, I will create new story plots and arcs in the process, and I look forward to reading your most valued input from your future thinks and ideas. I have created about 5 to 10 levels which have been uploaded onto the LBP server, one of which is based on my first episode of <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a>; his and <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu\" title=\"Rosechu\">Rosechu</a>'s origins.\n<p>Also, just to make it clear, Zelina and Darkbind, of the kingdom of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Rulecwc\" title=\"Rulecwc\">Rulecwc</a>, are Rosechu and Sonichu respectively. And Clawdorf is a kind of warlock monster character; all I have of him is a 3 or 4 finger hands and a black cloak and hood, but he can be a combination of all of the enemy creatures we have come up with so far. \n</p><p>What I have so far on that can be read in some of my comic pages. But in short, Darkbind Sonichu and Princess Zelina Rosechu have been sweethearts. In a cave in Rulecwc forest one day, Clawdorf released the power of the seven Chaotic Crystals (A.K.A. <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_Ball\" title=\"Sonichu Ball\">Sonichu Ball</a> Crystals); he turned to stone and Zelina fell into a deep slumber. A few years later, the original Sonichu donned the power of the 7 Crystals and reawakened Zelina (Clawdorf was also destoned in the process). \n</p><p>The King and Queen of Rulecwc have no biological children. But from the Chaotic <a href=\"/cwcki/Rainbow\" title=\"Rainbow\">Rainbow</a> of Sonichu and Rosechu's Origin, many Sonee and Rosey (baby Sonichu and Rosechu) eggs were released throughout the world, time and space. One egg landed in the audience of their highnesses, and Zelina Rosey hatched out; they adopted her and dubbed her successor to the throne. The egg with Darkbind Sonee landed somewhere in Rulecwc Forest; after evolving to Darkbind Sonichu, he was found by a rogue master swordsman (sort of like Link from Legend of Zelda) and trained under his guidance, also with later guidance from our owl, King Alistair. \n</p><p>But I digress (as I learned that quote from the owl, Blathers in <a href=\"/cwcki/Animal_Crossing\" title=\"Animal Crossing\">Animal Crossing</a>). \n</p><p>It is nice that you had an enjoyable and good day yesterday.<br/>\nPerhaps we can still make it a dinner and a movie night between the Tip Top and The Lightning Thief.

It's good you've decided on Feb. 28 for Rachel, but if you want to make it clear, you could let your vet determine that for you.<br/>\nWell, Mary Poppins has a great animated segment with dancing penguins, a fox hunt, horse race and a magical carousal, and altogether is a great movie starring <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Julay\" title=\"Julay\">Julie</a> Andrews and <a href=\"/cwcki/Dick\" title=\"Dick\">Dick</a> Van <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">Dyke</a>.

I bet you get a great view from the upper central arch window; see the stars, the early morning sunlight and all that. My room is a big room, but I have a lot of stuff in it; it can be more spacious, yet I'm unsure where to put some of it all. LOL Mostly, though, I do get the majority of the upper floor to myself, including the main fridge and kitchen, and the bathroom with a tub. I had a bedroom with a door to a bath with a standing shower, like you have, when my family and I were living in the Newberry Town area during my High School years. Personally, I enjoyed the standing shower better than the tub w. shower head.

She wears a golden, oval shaped necklace, given to her by her mother at birth. Inside is a silver carved owl and on the other side, has her title written in Greek handwiting: Daughter of Athena, protector of the owls.  And at the bottom of her title, has the words, Owl Tranformation written below it. When she wants to transform, she has to say, 'Go owl transform' and the owl's given name: example is, \"Go Owl Transform, Tyto Alba!\" Meaning, the barn owl.\n</p><p>How she is summoned:<br/>\nA. when the silver owl turns RED, the owl is either in trouble, sick, or is dying.<br/>\nB. when the silver owl turns GREEN, her owl friends wants to hang out.<br/>\nC. when the silver owl turns BLUE, there is an urgent meeting that she needs to attend to.\n</p><p>4. the 'owl kingdom' is called Owlwood, and it surrounds the capital where the palace is located in.\n</p><p>The rest we can come up with together.

Also, I am going to check the routing of my cable to my VCR, DVD Burner and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/TV\" title=\"TV\">TV</a>; I also need to check the power link on my VCR. It went out like during the 20-inch snowfall during the half-hour power failure we had here. IDK why I didn't get to it sooner; I was likely doing well between the cable and the digital videos. For my setup, normally it would be VERY hard to get behind there, but all I really have to do is dishook and temporarily remove my Genesis, Dreamcast, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Wii\" title=\"Wii\">Wii</a> and the shelf they're sitting on in my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Room\" title=\"Room\">entertainment center</a>. Afterwards, it's like poking your head and upper torso through an open window. \"Hey, Neighbor, you left your RF Switch and AV on my lawn again!\" LOL \n</p><p>I've learned a bunch of my techno know-how and connections from my father; he taught and showed me which male ends go into which female ends (a cable term for each respective ends of any cable, which are visually obvious). I used to have like 5 to 10 RF switches linking my consoles; the links were good, but the farther away from the TV it was, the more lousy the picture/audio would be due to the multiple refresh relays. I am now on a pair of switch boxes, as well as the Composite/Component (Red/White/Yellow and Red/White/Red/Blue/Green respectively) and the HDMI on my HDTV. With that experience, I probably would have made a good \"<a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_the_Cable_Guy\" title=\"wikipedia:Larry the Cable Guy\">Larry the Cable Guy</a>\", but without the slurry attitude and <a href=\"/cwcki/Obesity\" title=\"Obesity\">bigger body type</a>, and the fact that his name was NOT really Larry and that he was never in reality a Cable Guy. Still, he was good at voicing Mater in Disney's \"<a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cars_(film)\" title=\"wikipedia:Cars (film)\">Cars</a>\". \n</p><p>But I digress. I'll call you tonight to set up our next day together, and any other new story ideas and topics. You mentioned that you were also on AIM (AOL Instant Messenger); we could have been text-talking on that instead of waiting for my YIM to be Mr. Fickle-to-Install this whole time. Still, we learn. \n</p><p>I'll TTYL.

So I re-routed the cable and the AV to go through my DVD Burner; I can record the two \"<a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin_(TV_series)\" title=\"wikipedia:Merlin (TV series)\">Merlin</a>\" episodes onto a blank DVD-R, which I have plenty of those.\n<p>Also, I had a VHS in the VCR, so I had to play surgeon with my phillips screwdriver and a pair of tweezers to remove the VHS, very carefully. I succeeded in the removal, then I put the VCR back together the way it was; I will most likely be taking it, and its remote control, to a Goodwill, where their tech people can try to get the VCR operational again, then sell it to someone else. I tell you, I have taken apart a few of my old game consoles, and I took a PC Upgrading course at <a href=\"/cwcki/PVCC\" title=\"PVCC\">PVCC</a>; you would be amazed how the inside of those wonders of technology would look. The VCR was a new one to me today; I had no idea it literally lifted up the back flap of a VHS, then pulled the tape towards the reading mechanisms. I always thought the VHS went directly downward onto the reading parts; I never thought it would lift up that flap part. \n</p><p>Technology is amazing. \n</p><p>Anyway, I got to warm up something to eat.
