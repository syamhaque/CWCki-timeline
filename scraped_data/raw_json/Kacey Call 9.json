However, one second later, he says that Kacey telling him they're just friends is like \"stabbing him in the heart\".</li>\n<li>Chris nervously asks if Kacey has ever drank <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Alcohol\" title=\"Alcohol\">alcohol</a>; apparently Chris briefly drank a lot, but now he only drinks \"socially\".</li>\n<li>Chris is confused and disappointed that Kacey still has feelings for <a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris\" title=\"Liquid Chris\">Liquid Chris</a>.</li>\n<li>Chris angrily recounts his one date with <a href=\"/cwcki/Faeryn\" title=\"Faeryn\">Faeryn</a> and how she told him \"I'm just not into you\", and she totally \"said that out of nowhere\". He mentions that he got drunk, and touched her \"a few times\" without her consent.</li>\n<li>Chris needs more \"guy friends\" to hang out with.</li>\n<li>Kacey says he was probably \"too girly\" for the other guys. Chris says he has done \"boy things\" such as playing soccer, volleyball, and football in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/High_school\" title=\"High school\">high school</a>. Chris blames his <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">autism</a>, his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Father\" title=\"Father\">father</a>, and other males for his not having male friends.</li>\n<li>Kacey says women are way more evil than men. Chris says \"that's stupid,\" then goes on to say that he knows more about women than Kacey due to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/TV\" title=\"TV\">TV</a>.</li>\n<li>Kacey asks for a story, and Chris starts whining and raising his voice about his memory and how Kacey is asking too much of him.</li>\n<li>\"I don't remember spoken words or what I've said\".</li>\n<li>Some kid punched Chris on the bus and knocked his glasses off. HE KNOCKED HIS <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Glasses\" title=\"Glasses\">GLASSES</a> OFF. Chris claims he fought back. (Note that he tells a different version of this story to <a href=\"/cwcki/Jackie\" title=\"Jackie\">Jackie</a> one year later.)</li>\n<li>Chris recounts his traumatic short bus experience and how he was regularly bopped on the head by a \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Slow-in-the-minds\" title=\"Slow-in-the-minds\">slow-minded individual</a>\". He describes his bus driver as being \"all <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Lesbian\" title=\"Lesbian\">butch</a>\", which Kacey is taken aback by. (He meant that the driver had a deep voice.)</li>\n<li>Chris starts raising his voice and Kacey threatens to hang up.</li>\n<li>Kacey suggests for him to type his stories up and to put them on <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia\" title=\"CWCipedia\">CWCipedia</a>. Chris thinks if the trolls hear about this they will mock him for it, but then says he'll think about it.</li>\n<li>Chris gets stressed out and asks permission to get off the phone.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Video\">Video</span></h2>\n<center>\n<table style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa; background-color: #f9f9f9; color: black; margin: .5em auto .5em auto; padding: 0.2em; font-size:89%; width:260px;-moz-border-radius:10px\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFFF00\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size:110%; color:#008080;-moz-border-radius:10px\"><b>Kacey Call 9</b><br/>\n</td></tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<td colspan=\"2\"><div class=\"thumb embedvideo autoResize\" style=\"width: 328px;\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo autoResize\" style=\"\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideowrap youtube\" style=\"width: 320px\"><div class=\"embedvideo-consent\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo-consent__overlay\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo-consent__message\">Click to load content</div><!--\n--></div><!--\n--></div><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" data-src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vHgqvNt1YCo\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"180\" loading=\"lazy\" modestbranding=\"1\" width=\"320\"></iframe></div><!--\n--></div><!--\n--></div>\n</td></tr>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#696969\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;-moz-border-radius:5px;color:#ffffff;\"><b>Stardate</b>\n</td>\n<td>3 September 2009\n</td></tr>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#696969\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;-moz-border-radius:5px;color:#ffffff;\"><b>Featuring</b>\n</td>\n<td><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris\" title=\"Chris\">Chris</a>; <a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey\" title=\"Kacey\">Kacey</a>\n</td></tr>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#696969\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;-moz-border-radius:5px;color:#ffffff;\"><b>Saga</b>\n</td>\n<td><span style=\"display:none\">Liquid</span><a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris\" title=\"Liquid\"><img alt=\"Liquid\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"32\" src=\"/w/images/8/85/Liquid_saga.png\" width=\"32\"/></a> Liquid Saga\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" style=\"background-color:#FFFF00; color:#008080; color:#008080;-moz-border-radius:10px; font-size:120%; padding:0.25em; text-align:center;\">Audio Recordings\n</td></tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%;\" valign=\"top\">\n<td><b>previous</b> <br/><a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey_Call_8\" title=\"Kacey Call 8\">Kacey Call 8</a>\n</td>\n<td><b>next</b> <br/><a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey_Call_10\" title=\"Kacey Call 10\">Kacey Call 10</a>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n</center>\n<p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hello?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Hey, Chris.

And uh… you know, I’m still-I’m still gonna be friends with you. I just want to let you know about that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Y-you get over it? What do you mean by that?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> C’mon, didn’t you get the email I sent you last night?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Yeah, I did. You told me to watch some movies. I already did, and I was like, I don’t get it.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Telling somebody you’re gonna be– telling somebody whose hopeful expectations of something better than being just friends [unintelligible] <a href=\"/cwcki/Friend_zone\" title=\"Friend zone\">just friends forever</a>. That’s like stabbing him- that’s like stabbing him in the back or in the heart.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> And you think that trying to push attentions on somebody who’s in love with someone else isn’t like stabbing them in the heart?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I did not say that and I did not… I…\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Chris, you just can’t predict the future and you can’t force things on people, like I just want you to respect how I feel right now. I mean, actions speak louder than words. I mean… just, right now… I mean, I’m not saying I know what’s gonna happen, but you can’t either. I mean… just, right now it’s like, you’ve gotta understand what I’m going through.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> And for you to go behind my back and tell people that I’m gonna be your girlfriend… I mean, just, you know… you would ruin anything you could’ve had anyway. Just, right now is not the time, and you need to respect that. I’m not saying that I hate you or anything. I’m just saying… no.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b> </font>Okay. I’m sorry.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I mean, do you not understand how much pain I’m going through?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I do understand. I do understand, you know? Yeah, <a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris\" title=\"Liquid Chris\">the guy</a>… he left you…\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, I don’t think you do. I mean, do you… do you even know what love is? What is love to you?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Love, to me, is like a lot of things. It’s complicated to talk about, like most anybody else would, but you know, when I feel love, it’s like I feel… I feel the tingle-I feel the happy tingling and I feel happy, elated, ecstatic… and the-and it just feels-it just feels really really good. And I still…\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Yeah, but love is pain too, you know, right?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I mean, love is just intensity.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Love is intensity?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Yes. I mean, it could go either way. It’s not always good and it’s not always bad.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, OK. Actually, I understand that. Mmm… yeah, anyway… uh… I don’t really have much on my mind right now. Actually, I do have one question I had-I did want to ask you.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> It may not be appropriate, but… yeah. Have you ever… drank? You know, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Alcohol\" title=\"Alcohol\">alcoholic beverages</a>.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> O-of course I have. I’m over twenty-one.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> OK.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I mean, I had my celebratory twenty-first birthday dinner at least. I mean, I don’t drink a lot, but… I-I have had drinks. Why do you ask?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I was just wondering, 'cause yeah, you know, I’ve had-I’ve had some myself and I don’t drink as much either. [pause] I mean, it’s like, you know… uh… you know, at first I-I did more-did more often, because, you know, it just felt good, but then I realized that’s how bad it was. And then I-and then I stayed of it and I don’t do it as much.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I-it’s not that bad if you do it in moderation. I mean, one drink won’t kill you or anything like that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, one drink in a d-one drink in a day.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, I mean, you can have more than one drink, it’s just that you don’t want to get to the point where it rules you, where like, you always have to have a drink.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b> </font>Yeah. I don’t-I don’t feel like I have to have a drink every day.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, that’s good.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> 'Cause, you know, I’ll drink socially.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Y-yeah, most people are social drinkers.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, OK. I just wanted to ask. Get that question out of the way.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> OK, umm… yeah, OK. So, you’re still having feelings for… uh… for <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Liquid\" title=\"Liquid\">Chris</a>, yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> O-of course I did. I was-I was gonna marry him. I mean, I know we didn’t know each other for very long, but… I fell for him really hard. I mean, you don’t know much pain I am-I’m in. I-I-It sucks that I can’t even see him, that I can’t hear him, that I can’t even touch him. I mean, i-it sucks. It hurts.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I’ve had that happen to me before, you know. It’s like, you know, I had high expectations myself. You know, yeah, with the-with the women I talked to one at a time, of course you know, with them. And they either-they either turn out to be <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">trolls</a> or they died.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> O-or they died?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. Like… uh… <a href=\"/cwcki/Sarah_Jackson\" title=\"Sarah Jackson\">Sarah Jackson</a> for one was in an auto-automobile accident between her car and a truck. <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sarah_Cassandra_McKenzie\" title=\"Sarah Cassandra McKenzie\">Sarah Cassandra McKenzie</a> was involved in that brushfire last- brushfire last January.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Chris, how many times have you been in quote-unquote love? [pause]\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I don’t know. I do not-I have not kept count, but I’m talking about, like you know, yeah, w-we have actually talked to each other for a standard amount of time… and then they-and then they-either they turn out to be trolls or they died. [pause] And this is over the internet, by the way, like it happened between last- between last August and… uh…\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Would you really call that love though? I mean, if you can go in and out of it so easily?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I felt it. I felt it and I still feel for those- for those lost hearts, especially the ones…\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> For all of them?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Well, the ones that died. I-I can’t really say that I have positive emotions, you know, for that <a href=\"/cwcki/BlueSpike\" title=\"BlueSpike\">thirteen-year-old brat</a> who pretended to be a twenty-year-one… twenty-one-year-old girl for two… two-three… two-three months. So, [mutters incoherently] …was the first one that got into my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Playstation_Network\" title=\"Playstation Network\">Playstation Network</a> account and conned me-and he con-and that little brat conned me out of so much DLC and even the [unintelligible] version of Burnout Paradise when it was just twenty dollars. [pause]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Yeah, uh… I guess that would make you angry.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I mean, you just seem-you just seem more worked up about the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Video_games\" title=\"Video games\">video games</a> than you do talking about love though. I mean, look at-look at the passion you showed, and then I asked you about love and you’re like, “whatever.”\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [sighs]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I think… that’s just not cool.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, you’re right. It’s not. I mean, it’s just that I never learned love beyond… c’mon… it’s like, you know, I never even had my first <a href=\"/cwcki/Dating\" title=\"Dating\">date</a> up until a few weeks ago, when I-when I went out on that one date.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> W-with who again?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I only-I only out with one date-on one date in my lifetime and that was with <a href=\"/cwcki/Faeryn\" title=\"Faeryn\">Faeryn</a> [mutters incoherently] a month-a couple- a month or two ago.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oh, was she pretty?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, she was pretty, but after-but after one date, she was like “Oh, I’m not into you.” And then she just broke it-and then she just broke it with me like that. I mean, I was not-I did not feel the pain immediately, because I did have-because I did have one, and this was at the Apple-we had our date at the <a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_restaurants#Applebee's\" title=\"List of restaurants\">Applebee’s</a>. You know, it was a Monday night?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Uh-huh.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I had one. But, it’s like, you know, her-it’s like, the emotions didn’t get me right away, but then… y’know, after I sober… uh… after a while, I sobered up and then it all-then it all…\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, I mean, if you weren’t sober, did you do anything inappropriate? Maybe that turned her off.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Wait, what?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You said that you weren’t sober. Did you do anything in the date that was inappropriate? Maybe that turned her off.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [sighs] Well, yeah, maybe I did touch her a few times.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Chris, we’ve talked about this!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I know, but this was-this was before I met you. This was before I met you.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> But, you should know that anyway, you’re twenty-seven.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Um… you know, it’s just common sense. Well, I mean… um… since you said she was pretty… uh… what did she look like?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Oh, yeah. You saw the picture. Remember that trading card I gave to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Kim\" title=\"Kim\">Kim</a>?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> O-oh, that was her?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, in the-in the second half of the heart-shaped balloon. Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Um… I-I really don’t remember that well. I-I mean, it’s like, I just kind of looked at Kim’s picture, cause you remember, I just commented on that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, you did.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> So, so… uh… maybe you could re-describe her for me.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, she heav-yeah, she was a heavy-set girl. Kind of a redhead. Short, short hair. Uh… I think she was about your height. Uh, no wait. I’m sorry. She was a little bit taller. Um… [pause] yeah, she was-she was like… uh… she was-she was a wild, fun one, kind of. She worked at a book sto- she works at a book store over at the downtown mall.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oh, OK. Cool.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Mmm, all the details, I can’t remember off the top of my head, but the point it is… end-end of date num-at end of date number one, she just told me “I was not at all that into me-all that into you.” She was not all that into…\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [interrupting] What prompted her to say that? Did she just say that out of nowhere? Or did you-did you… proposition her? \n</p><p>[pause]\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, she pretty much said that out of nowhere.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> That seems odd. Well, if she would do something like that, she probably wasn’t very nice to begin with. I mean, I don’t do that when I meet guys. I don’t go up to them and go, “By the way, I don’t like you!”\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I agree with you. [pause] But, you know, the point is though, I do-I do get lonely a lot, especially during night-during the nighttime, when I’m not talking to anybody.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well… uh… maybe you should go out and get some friends, like I, you know, suggested.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, Kim and I were just talking about that. Yeah, need to make more-need-need some more guy friend-need more <a href=\"/cwcki/JERKS\" title=\"JERKS\">guy friends</a> to hang out with.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oh, yeah. That’s definitely good. You definitely should.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Mmm… yeah…\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Some <a href=\"/cwcki/Commissions#&quot;Boy's_Night_Out_at_Cheers_with_Jugs,&quot;_Dated_7/20/2014\" title=\"Commissions\">boys' nights out</a>.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uh, yeah, Kim can tell you more about what we talked about in that conversation. But, yeah, it’s not that easy…\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, why can’t you?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Why can’t I make guy friends? Well…\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> No, why can’t you tell me? I mean, should I get my information from Kim?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Well, I can’t ‘member all the details. I can tell you what I remember.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> No, that-that’s fine. Just… um…\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah… uh… anyway, it’s like, you know, yeah. I just basically- I just never cared for guys that much and… uh… I didn’t- I rarely socialized with guy-with men-with boys grow-growing up. Mostly-I mostly socialized with girls.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> D-don’t… OK. I mean, I don’t see why. If you-if you get friends with someone, it doesn’t really matter what gender they are. I mean, it seems like you’re being kind of biased, for no reason. I mean, that’s kinda gay. [Chris sighs] Look, most guys who have a lot of girlfriends would be like that. [chuckles]\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah… uh… well, I mean, I will admit, I did have a few-I did have a few buddies in my-I did have a few buddies in my lifetime. But, yeah. But, it’s like, you know, they… came-they came and gone. You know. But, you know, we hung out like-like-like a coup-couple of-like <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">straight men</a>, you know. It was OK. But, any-but, anyway, most-anyway, other than that… uh… I just never really- rrreally socialized with men as much as I did with women. Uh… boys…\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> But, like I said, i-it feels like you did that because… you’re… biased. Not because the guys weren’t-were really mean or anything.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, well-yeah, think about this, though. I mean, this way like, all growing up, this-this is go-this is going on. My neighborhood consisted mostly of young girls. [stammers] …we were the same age. You know, we played together and all that. And, you know… [pause, sound of clock ticking, mutter incoherently] …I had more <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Gal_pals\" title=\"Gal pals\">gal pals</a> than I did… dude-than I did dude buddies.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oh, I mean… what about in school? There had to be way more guys in school you could interact with.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I did-I did talk-I did- I told ya, I made-I had a few buddies in high-between the school life… but the point is, you know, yeah. I did not-I just did not have that many guy friends. [pause] It just never happened for me.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I-I mean, but was it because… of you, your biasness, or just because… I don’t know.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I would say it would contribute to my <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">autism</a>. You know…\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Autism doesn’t make you hate genders, Chris.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [yelling] Oh, forget about genders! It’s like, you know I rarely talk to pe-autistic people rarely talk to other people, and they rarely…\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> That’s bullshit, you know that, right? [Chris sighs] I mean, yes, they have social problems, but… I mean, you’re talking to me now. I have experience with this. Don’t try to bullshit me and play that card.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, OK, but I’m just saying, it’s like, you know… it was more… It’s like, OK, growing up I had the girls in the neighborhood. I was introduced to the girls and they were nice to me, they were friendly to me, and…\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK, and who’s to say the guys wouldn’t be? Maybe you just didn’t do a lot of guy things. Maybe you were too girly for them or something. Cause that’s the only way I could see, like, little boys picking on another boy. [pause]\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I have do-I have done boy things. I’ve played sports.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Like what?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> You know, like basketball, volleyball, baseball…\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Volleyball’s not really a guy-sport. That’s really a girl-sport.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [interrupting] Soccer! Soccer. I’ve played a foot-I’ve played a little football.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, I mean, then you should’ve been able to talk to lots of, you know, other boys your age. [pause]\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, and all consider this: <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bob\" title=\"Bob\">my father</a>, he just constantly picked and picked on my nerves. He calls it teach me how to spaaaaar argumentatively and in talking. He just-he just called it that excuse. But, because of like, you know, he has to put it in that sense… it just, pretty much, paints a very sharp-very sharp, high-definition picture in my head about how boys would likely…\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> That’s just your dad, Chris! That doesn’t represent every male in society. Maybe he’s just trying to be your father. Maybe he’s just trying to teach you something.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, but still, I mean like, you know… and also, I have watched <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Television\" title=\"Television\">television</a> and I have often seen…\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Chris, we’ve talked about this. Television does not equal real life. You can’t use it as a basis.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. Yeah, but, you know, you definitely find in real life that… uh… men often do pick fights, in real life.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> No! Women pick more fights than men do. It’s what women do. I mean… you’ve gotta be kidding me. Haven’t you ever heard of a catfight?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I’ve heard catfights.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Yeah, women are way more evil, of the two genders, I promise you.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Now that’s-now that’s stupid. No, no, no…\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> That’s not stupid at all! [chuckles] Obviously, you haven’t been around women enough. I mean, I’m a woman, I would know these things.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I have been around woman a lot in my lifetime, believe me. [pause]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, I mean, I just don’t think you could speak for that unless you’re a woman, and you’re not a woman, are you?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos#Chris_the_lesbian\" title=\"Homos\">No, I am not.</a>\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Then you wouldn’t really know, now would you?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I guess that-would not know, I’m not a mind reader. [pause, belches] Excuse me.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [obviously disgusted] You’re excused. But, I mean, I, yeah, I think Kim’s right. I think you should go out and get some more guy friends.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I mean, OK, you’re a guy too. Have you ever started a fight?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> L-let me ponder about that… that would be diving into my memories, right there.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> H-how can you ponder about it? You’ve either started a fight or you haven’t. If you’re saying, “all guys start fights,” then you should’ve.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [sigh] Yeah, OK, well, I have-I have started fights, in retrospect. In return, I have picked on my father’s nerves, and gotten to start argument-and started fights with him.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK, how?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> You know-you know, it’s like, you know… I don’t know. It’s… like a current topic that comes up… I just… I don’t know, I just… find a nerve-I just randomly find a nerve that he’s bothered about and… uh… it’s like, you know, I end up picking on that and then he-and then he raises his voice at me, and then we get into an argument.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You know, that sounds like stuff women do, but can you give me an example?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [high-pitched yelling] I… just gave you an example!\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You didn’t give me a real one, like you didn’t tell me like, what you said.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [still frustrated] Well, I don’t remember all the audio details.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You don’t remember any details.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I do. I remember…\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Don’t raise your voice at me.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I remember-I remember details. It’s just, they’re mostly photographic. I can’t-it’s like, you know, I don’t ‘member spoken words or what I said.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Pho… [sighs] never mind.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> But, ye- I mean, but, yeah, it’s like, you know, when it really sinks in, I can-I can remember what was said. When it really sinks in.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, I mean, OK, have you ever started a physical fight, like you accuse other boys of doing? [pause]\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I can honestly say I have not started a physical fight, even though I was physically beat on myself a few times in my life.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Did you swing back? I mean, did you do anything? [pause]\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I did fi-I did fight back. [pause]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> When? Like, do you know of a time when you did that?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Oh, yeah. Yeah. I know this one-yeah, I know the one time when on the scho-on the… uh… <a href=\"/cwcki/Manchester_High_School#The_Bus\" title=\"Manchester High School\">school bus</a>, on the way home. It’s like, you know, I was a constant-I was, like, in constant... you know, I was sitting in the front seat of the bus, and this guy was sitting across the aisle, in the front seat as well… and uh… it’s like, you know, we were in constant competition with each other, and then when he… and then-and one of those times, when he really wanted to really get the jump on me and be the first out of the bus… it’s like, you know… yeah, he gave me-he gave me a physical… hit in the… hit in the-I don’t remember exactly where. But, yeah-but, yeah. Then I pun-then I punched back and then… and then… a couple more punches and then… he kno-he punched me so hard in the face, it knocked my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Pedo-glasses\" title=\"Pedo-glasses\">glasses</a> off. He knocked my glasses off! [pause]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, did you bleed?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yes, I did bleed.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Like, from your nose or something? Or your lip?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I had a few bleed spots from my face. I think-yeah, I had a nosebleed.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> What did your parents do? O-or was that when they took you off the bus and put you on the short bus?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> That was when-right after that happened, they took me off the regular bus and they put me on the stupid handicapped bus.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, I mean, you got to leave class a little early. Wasn’t that cool?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> No, I did not have to leave class early. I left cla-I left class at the same time as everybody else.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oh, OK.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Buses-all the buses left at the same time.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Sorry, most schools… uh… those buses leave earlier.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [sigh] Yeah, those-those buses did not leave earlier. They left at the same time. [pause] Anyway, I-anyway, I did-anyway, I cared not-I cared not care much for any of those handicapped bus rides, especially with the one reta-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Why?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> OK, I can definitely name you a few reasons, like there was this one [stutters] …there was this one <a href=\"/cwcki/Slow-in-the-minds\" title=\"Slow-in-the-minds\">slow-minded individual</a> named Tony. He was like as big as-he was as big and strong as an ox. He just kept on making all the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress_sigh\" title=\"Stress sigh\">moanings and noises and whatnot</a>, and he sometimes even-even-a couple of times he even spat on me, and he even bopped me on the back of the head once or twice during the whole-during the whole time I knew him there.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Why didn’t-why didn’t you just move?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I was sitting in my usual seat, you know, front…\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, why didn’t you just move? [pause] I mean, if somebody’s doing that to you, isn’t it common sense to move?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I did not want to move. My constant-my con…\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b> </font>Well, then it didn’t really matter that much…\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> My con… [quickly quiets down] My constant…\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b> </font> Uh-uh.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I’m talking. My constant routine…\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Doesn’t mean you need to…\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> …was riding on the right side of the bus.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [sternly] Don’t you. Don’t you! Stop! You raise your voice at me again and I will-I will leave this phone call.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> OK, but still. It was my constant routine that I ride on the right side of the bus, on the front seat, and this guy was, like, two seats behind me.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK, well then he really shouldn’t have been able to reach you, and even then, if it was bothering you that much, couldn’t you tell the bus driver or just move? Would it really have killed you to move?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Actually, no. Uh… yeah, I did-I did not like breaking my routine-oh, wait. I did eventually move. But, any-but, yeah, I did tell the bus driver. I also told the special aide… person that rode on the bus practically every bus ride. I did not care for much-much for her either. I mean, like, you know, I tried being friendly-I tried being friends with her, but… still, it’s like, you know, she was all-all butch and…\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Chris!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Very forceful. It’s like, you know, I just didn’t care much for her.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> What do you mean, “she was all butch?”\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> You know, she constantly raised her voice, for one thing.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Maybe she was just trying to establish authority. But, how does that make her butch?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Her tone of voice was butch.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> A-are you saying she had a deep voice?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yes, she did have a deep voice. Yes she did.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Have you ever thought of writing these stories down in the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia\" title=\"CWCipedia\">CWCipedia</a>, so that people might be able to understand you more? You know, see what you’ve gone through?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I can’t think of everything for me to put on the Cwcipedia, and plus that kind of information is one that-only the trolls would just mock me about. “Oh, you rode on the handicapped bus! You were…”\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Yeah, but you’re… OK, but the trolls already know that, don’t they? Wh-maybe if you put these stories on there, your fans would appreciate you more.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I’ll think about it. I’ll think about that. [pause] Yeah, it’s a whole-so much-so many stories in my lifetime I-and I do remember them all. It’s just, you know, most of them are buried in my head, and it would take me a while…\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, I mean… well, how about… uh… old essays from <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/High_school\" title=\"High school\">high school</a>, you know, so even-at least I could see more of your high school life? Like <a href=\"/cwcki/Manchester_High_Leaks\" title=\"Manchester High Leaks\">old English essays</a> or something?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, okay, I have some of those.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK, I would definitely be interested in seeing those on the CWCipedia soon.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> OK. I will definitely think about that and… uh… and I will consider putting-putting-looking-finding those and putting those in the CWCipedia, and I emphasize finding those…\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, don’t think about it. I wasn’t you to do that, okay. Can you do that for me?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I’ll put up a few on the CWCipedia, yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Thank you. Thank you. That means a lot to me.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> OK. [pauses, then sighs] Yeah, I’m kind of tired right now. Ummm… is it okay if we end-if we end-end it for now, tonight? We can talk-we can talk again tomorrow night.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> No, that’s fine.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> OK. Alright, well you take care. Stay safe.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Talk to you later.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Alright, bye.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<p><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.4shared.com/mp3/-VpYg-7nba/Kacey_Call_09.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">MP3 Phone Call</a>\n</p>\n<table style=\"width: 90%; max-width: 600px; height: 70px; margin: 1em auto 1em auto; border: 0.15em outset #000; background: #eee; vertical-align: centered; color:#000;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"width: 33%; max-width: 200px; text-align: center; color:#000;\">⇐ <a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey_Call_8\" title=\"Kacey Call 8\">Kacey Call 8</a><span style=\"color: #000\"></span>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33%; max-width: 200px; text-align: center; color:#000;\"><span style=\"color: {{{textcolor}}}\"><strong><a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey_calls\" title=\"Kacey calls\">Kacey Phone Calls</a></strong></span>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33%; max-width: 200px; text-align: center; color:#000;\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey_Call_10\" title=\"Kacey Call 10\">Kacey Call 10</a><span style=\"color: #000\"></span> ⇒\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p><br/>\n</p>\n<center><b>    Chats and calls</b></center>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n</p>\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"navbox\" style=\";\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"padding:2px;\">\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"nowraplinks collapsible mw-collapsed mw-collapsible\" style=\"width:100%;background:transparent;color:inherit;;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<th class=\"navbox-title\" colspan=\"2\" style=\";\"><div style=\"float:left; width:6em;text-align:left;\"> <span class=\"noprint plainlinksneverexpand\" style=\"white-space:nowrap; font-weight:normal; font-size:xx-small; ;;border:none;;\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"/w/index.php?title=Template:Classic_Chris_era&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" title=\"Template:Classic Chris era (page does not exist)\"><span style=\";;border:none;;\" title=\"View this template\">v</span></a> <span style=\"font-size:80%;\">•</span> <a class=\"new\" href=\"/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Classic_Chris_era&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" title=\"Template talk:Classic Chris era (page does not exist)\"><span style=\"color:#002bb8;;;border:none;;\" title=\"Discussion about this template\">d</span></a> <span style=\"font-size:80%;\">•</span> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"//sonichu.com/w/index.php?title=Template:Classic_Chris_era&amp;action=edit\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#002bb8;;;border:none;;\" title=\"You can edit this template.
