this one is\njust another drop in the bucket and you\nknow what I'm going to do yeah I think\nso go for\nit yeah we're electric hedgehogs you bag\nof boats oh\nmyos yeah right your\nrats there you go there's your\nreference hey what's up YouTubers jesus\nChristi Prime here once again with\nanother light power review and today\nwe're going to be looking at the next\nfigure in the Transformers Legacy Night\nBurst N Deceptic Clone Scandal as\nVessel so here we are and there it is\nand first and foremost as always we'll\ntake a quick look at the packaging so\nright up front right here we got pretty\nmuch a simplistic type of artwork of the\nuh more common\nsavv but then you got to really\nappreciate all the shape work that went\ninto that art look at it this is fun\nanyway trust bird it is a deluxe class\ndelet classic\nclass and here we go decepticone ass I\nscoundre vessel to fuzz on this side of\nthe box you got some rather simple yet\nuh decent artwork kind of reminiscent of\na see as a scene from within the uh\ncomic book pages i believe um book\nnumber nine was uh that featured that\nbunch of them yeah this essentially is a\ncloseup and once again SAV scandalous\nvessel and subronian writing on this\nside of the box you got half of the uh\nlovely poster artwork and that guy I did\nmention last video but I mention it now\nbut just this art is a lot better than\nthe previous one the background is\nreally intense and good anyway there's\nthe top of the bots and uh there's the\nbot with the words dates barcodes and on\nthe back of the box you got your\nobligatory product this that the other\nand uh you got your little bio if you uh\ncan read that but yeah once again this\nwill be on the quick light blog the low\nwow if it's not already on there by the\ntime this video is uploaded and that's\nbasically it\nfor the\npackaging and moving right along here we\nhave the more common type of SAV the\nDecepticone and uh you can tell it's uh\nyeah it's obviously a Jeep it's a Jeep\njust like the uh first SUV it's a Jeep\nare you shocked it's a Blake Jeep and I\njust noticed when I put this back in the\nvehicle mount that thing feet let me\njust get let's get closer look at the\ndetails so yeah I think very much uh\nsame as what you saw on the first day\nbut yeah here you go as opposed to what\nthey had there's the actual Decepticon\nsymbol right there on the hood and it's\na I believe you'll be able to see in a\nmoment when we do the comparisons\nthere's a it's a liar shade green as\nopposed to the first but then yeah just\nuh yeah pretty much a copy paste but\nthey can always fit it's an SAV and they\nwere so common they just pretty much was\nrunning around everywhere but at this\npoint only one has that really big gun\nbut yeah there is the top there is the\nbottom it does roll as well hooray for\nrolling crabbing slashing scoundrelized\nvesseling\nthings and now for\ncomparison here it is with uh\nCC82\nwith Prime right\nthere that more in the\nshot with the optimist his name is\nOptimus\nwith Sonu right there\nand now here is this common savv with\nthe quick veil combiner team wave\narmorats fire shot chapper and of course\nMr roll out we'll do a closer comparison\nbetween those two in a little\nbit but yeah pretty much we're going to\nget this triple jeep comparison out of\nthe way really quick so once again\nthat's the comore combo Decepticon SAV\nwith Mr rolet and now with uh the first\nSAV with its with his big gun right\nthere what are you doing firing with the\nenemy i'm not firing at the enemy i'll\njust take her out right here get this\nreview done like you did anyway we'll do\nsome uh comparisons so give you the\nwho's who what's where's how i mean uh\nhere it's kind of like uh you got the\ndifferences but the roll with the roll\nout more clear you got lots of silvers\ngoing on this one's definitely uh basic\nand um yeah the first AV is a darker\nshade of green i feel like it can't be\nmore clear than that of course you guys\nbig gun right there but we'll give you\nall they give you the full turn around\nlet you see who's who what's what's r\nwhere's how and of course there's the uh\nbetter Decepticon symbol right there on\nthe back so that's how you can tell them\napart and there's the Allboard on Roll's\nchest hanging out right there\nso I kind of feel like uh between the\nthree you could definitely tell one\napart from the other oh I'll tell you\nwhat let me give you this closeup\nbetween the between the first and the\ncommon did you see that as well so yeah\nthere's the uh promote there's the\npromoted Decepticon symbol right there\non the the first one and the uh BBCC\nSizen like uh symbol and of course\nthere's the one Decepticon symbol on the\nclone oh yeah and the Decepticone right\nthere on the big gun so yeah there's\nthat and now for the main comparisons\nwe'll start with the one other\nDecepticone that we have so far reviewed\nso here it is with the Deceptic Clone\nCracktor right there looking all fine\nand dandy and that was his superior so\nhere he is with the Well we already did\nit first but yeah here's Punlab the\nfirst what are you doing you young\nripper snapper go back in your ranks\nyour group your low life me\nyeah\nwith Megatron right\nthere\nwith\nCrasher and yep they didn't try to take\na liking to Crasher's little leadership\nof course with uh the boss lady Gwen\nMakoto\nme\nwith combine the wars\nwindow and now for the obvious big\ncomparison that you've been long waiting\nfor so here it is with animates window\nbecause it's\nprecious\nalso used to have the big gun but don't\nprecious so there you\ngo all right so now with this\ndecepticone you only get two accessories\nso you get this uh I'm dropping it you\nget this little gun right here just you\nknow it's a little trip barrel shooter\ntype of gun you got the more details\ngoing on all over in uh the black color\non the gray plastic looks like and you\ngot the you got combiner mode hand right\nhere you got to uh hand it to someone or\nanother and um yeah so you got a few\noptions of course in regards to uh\nstorage for these two you got uh two\nports on top and that one peg right\nthere and this one's got the uh right\nhole in it so you can just easily put\nthat right there and uh we can just uh\npop this out like that put the thumb out\npop the fingers in put the thumb in and\nthere you go\nnow more common Decepticone has a few\nlittle\nguns and just go ahead and state this\nnone of them are compatible so no all\nright so yeah that's basically it for\nthe vehicle boat so let's get down to\ntransmission shall we let's There you go\nthere's a single decent th spin so once\nagain we're just going to go straight\ninto combine mode first and uh as you\nsee between the row out and the first AV\nthat's simple you just uh rotate out the\ncombiner limb and you uh pop the feet\nforward and up\nand simple as it gets good as it gets\nthere's your jeeping\nleg and now it's getting to arm mode\nonce again so we keep that out and uh we\npull this up raise that up you're gonna\nwant to lift the arms out a little bit\nso we can get the legs unclipped and\nseparated there you go down and out you\ngot that we got once again got that\nlittle thing that little groove the\nlittle peg right there is going to go\ninto the SL right there satisfactory and\nuh the same on the other side you clip\nthe two together then you bring these\nback in you tuck that up here oh that's\nright i forgot how often do I forget\nwhen I do this it's the head you got to\njust pull this out like halfway and then\nyou pull this up put up there like that\nand then rotate and there you go now\nit's an arm simple as it gets it's just\nan arm and uh you know goes either way\nyou can uh have it one way or the other\neither get your full range of uh elbow\nmovement or just you know uh up to 90\ndegrees of bend at that elbow and robot\nmode think cop got the second verse just\nlike or third verse just like the first\nand the second ro put the comb peg down\nseparate the legs pull these\nback them forward rotate the uh forearms\nand uh bring the head forward rotate the\nhead and make sure this thing is secure\nagainst the back right here and there\nyou go there you have the more common\nsavv in its robot\nmode And uh simple is as simple does i\nmean after all what else can you do on a\njust a little bit of a low budget that\nGibby Makoto has and just having to put\nup with whatever whatever Megatron could\nafford to give so again close here look\nat the detail so you got your simplistic\nhead right there yeah look at a little\nbit spindly maybe a little swindly\nwhatever pun you want to make there i\ndon't care but there's your more common\nDecepticone Sav head make definitely\nseparates the first from that you get\nthe comparisons be more clear anyway so\ngot all the bolded detail once again all\nthroughout the body it's just uh a lot\nof the lighter shade of green and uh\ngoing up the back pretty much uh common\nplace which you seen before and yada\nyada\nyada just that's about just decent\nenough now articulation on worries what\nwe got what we got i'm going to tell you\nonce again in regards to this mode so\nthe head is on up joints you got your\nwiggly waggly wiggly waggly you can look\nup a little bit look down but if you do\nthat trying to do the transformation\njoint you can get to squirrel squirrel\nand hit rotate do a full 360 arms can do\na full 360 and they can move in and out\non that ball joint you got uh bicep\nrotation and uh you get over 90 degrees\nof bend at the elbow and nothing at the\nwrist nothing at the waist legs can move\nforward that far back about that far\noutward to\nthe well almost to the full splits but\njust don't want to stay up there you got\nthigh rotation and uh up there at the\nknee joint as well 90 degrees of bend at\nthe knee and uh feet cannot move up they\ncan move down quite a lot and you have\nyour ankle tilted\nall right so let's run through the uh\ntwo bits of accessories right there so\nof course uh you got your hand right\nthere you know we've seen in the that\nconfiguration before but of course you\nknow we can do that just uh put that\nthat's it gun you got 5 mil ports this\non either side of the arm of course\nuh you can make this little this more\ncommon SAV to hold both these big guns\nand there you go it just a bit more\ncommon bang bang and uh all that good\nstuff right there and of course we'll\njust go ahead and show this off real\nquick so just Yeah side of the arms just\nstorm right there get out of the way and\nyep there you go now take more common\nSAV has a bit more beefy\nshoulderage and now for comparison here\nis the common SAV\nwith\nCC82\nwith\nPrime\nwith\nOptimus\nwith\nSonu and now in the group shop here is\nthe SAV with the wave fire shot chapper\narmorats and roll\nout and now here's kind of a uh creep\nparty the three jeeps with the common\nSAV next to roll out and an SAV the\nfirst Jeepers creepers what a Jeep\nparty anyway so we'll give you the uh\nturn around as opposed to what you see\nup front here you got I mean it's\ndefinitely face the budget not as many\ndecals this guy supposed to sip the\nfirst and the row out but we'll give you\nthe quick turn around between all three\nof them let's see the color differations\nand who's who what's when's where why\nwhat's\nhow yep\nand I suppose we'll make this uh cheap\nparty a bit more cheap by bringing the\nhost combiner wars\nwindow\nyeah yep\nwith Punislav the\nfirst\nwith\nMegatron\nwith\nCrasher\nwith\nMakoto and of course last but not least\none more time in his Encore debut is\nstanding next to the old boat here he is\nwith classic animated window because\nit's\nprecious also classic anime big gun\nprecious so there you go so there you\nhave Decepticone SAVV and um yes another\nshameless reuse of the jeep mode\ncombiner but you know what the first ACV\nwas a Jeep and all of those were rather\nJeepish so of course the trend is going\nto continue to the Decepticons\nthemselves that came out much later but\nanyways so yeah just uh overall once\nagain a little bit of a fan of this mode\nbecause you know good mode thing and uh\njust all that good stuff there uh are\ngood and everything it's so simple\ndirect to the point as opposed to\nthey're supposed to roll out than the\nfirst SAV that's got more detail and\ngoing on with them yeah just it's more\nlike a more budget friendly SAV if you\nwant to give it if you want to put it\ndown like that and that doesn't have\nthat much going on for it and there's\njust so many of them they're practically\na dime but a dozen anyway so uh so there\nyou go now I picked this up from Target\nyou can there's pop it up in your other\ntargets as well as Walmart your big bad\nbig bad toy store Entertainment Earth\nAmazon.com and all of that and don't\nforget to check out me on my socials\nincluding of course Quicklight i'll put\na link in the description down below and\nuh I think that's pretty much it so like\nsubscribe and all that for the algorithm\nand everything so yes this is\nTransformers Legacy Diverge Decepticone\nSAVV Scoundrel as Vessel and this is\nJesus Christ son your prime say remember\nyou don't stop play because you grow up\nyou grow up because you stop play be\ngeek be\nproud all right so Basher that's\nessentially just the uh top Mach five\nturbo engine for you yeah that's right i\nwant to go really fast i want to go\nfaster than all them real rats and uh\nhey can I just anything you know if you\nbuy one give one free I'll give you a\nmassive discount on the\nthird h Well me personally I'd like to\nget some Voyager class ammo i mean I'm\ncertainly never going to have a gun\nthat's going to outmatch SAV the first\nyeah and uh me personally I kind of feel\nlike the gun I got is big enough but I\nfeel like I can go much bigger so give\nme the ultra deluxe model in comparison\nto this one shut up you two nothing for\nthem they're on a\ndiet oh bossley bossly bam\nma'am\ncrusher long time no see has it it seems\nlike just last week I left you here to\nactually just mind the business i'm gone\nbut then I end up being thrusted forward\nin time and I find you trying to take\ncharge to place it over my troops how do\nyou explain yourself there young Missy\nwell what else is there to explain i\nmean you weren't here so I decided to\ntake charge and I actually improved a\nfew things around here\nmotto I've seen what you've done around\nhere you essentially made things a lot\nworse it looks a lot more ugly than when\nI last remembered i mean I've been only\ngone for a little while you already\nturned my place upside down\nCrasher i think I approved it for the\nbetter i disagree you're not that any\nbetter than Starscream how dare you\ncompare me to Starcream i ought to stop\non your foot for that not if I purchased\npsycho first\ncrusher oh well I think this is a bit\ngetting a little too uncomfortable here\nso I'll just take the order I got here\nand uh I'll come back here with the\ndelivery and I'll set the pave then\nbye i think Megatron will be very\npleased with the changes I made around\nhere and I believe you and Psycho will\ngive me some applause as well maybe\npsycho would have no longer known you\nlonger than I have but that does not\ngive you an excuse for this plague\ncrusher i had just been flown miles and\neven a week ahead of time thanks to that\nChristian\nPrime i think that's a lot worse than\nanything you've gone through isn't\nit maybe so but my changes are for the\nbetter and I'm going to stand strong and\nbite them i'll fight you for it really\nwell I just unfortunate I wasn't able to\njoin that last fight and actually help\nout we could have won against that\nMedatron yeah of course you're right you\nyou big galoot i be have to roll all you\ncan do is just fall you know cuz you're\nso big yeah whatever p you're just a big\nold Oh nothing i just sent you a big old\nUh-oh i think the boss lady and Crasher\nare having another fight\nhere obviously I think we know who's\ngoing to lose it's not going to be the\nboss\n[Music]\nlady it doesn't get done to what floor\nagain haven't you\nyeah well at least I'm big enough to\nknow that that is just not\nfunny at least I didn't fall backwards\nlike the rest of the\ncharacters oh you think that's funny huh\nwell wait till I step on your feet that\ntime you know what i think I'll do it\nright now\now ow\now\noh your feet are too strong as usual\ntractor i am going to go stop by crush\ntraces out on the training grounds\n[Music]\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Transcript\">Transcript</span></h3>\n<center>\n<table cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\"
