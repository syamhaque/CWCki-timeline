Though he also claims that had he not \"bonded\" with her, Barb would have died. He also states that if he is not found innocent, there will be a premature apocalypse.\n</p><p>Notable statements include:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Chris got in trouble in jail when he \"tried to enlighten the stage by highlighting a Portal\".

I am certain you've been keeping yourself very well and safe. Are you enjoying the indirect popularity from <a href=\"/cwcki/Kiwi_Farms\" title=\"Kiwi Farms\">Kiwi Farms</a>, as well as the direct increase on your <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Kengle\" title=\"Kengle\">Onion Farms</a>?\n</p><p>Also, I and my Body have read some of the Qur'an, including all of <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryam_(surah)\" title=\"wikipedia:Maryam (surah)\">chapter 19</a>, as you've recommended. I do appreciate your earlier hierarchy/spirituality level comparisons between Judaism, Muslim, and Christianity. Rest assured, my personal updates on Christianity to Neo Spiritual Christianity in the near future after my Second Coming shall offer even Higher Levels of Spirituality and even freedom.\n</p><p>Anyway, the Qur’an is literally all over the place; Not to offend nor make jest, but there’s only Some new insights and takes Heavily from the Bible. The Qur’an is to the Bible as <a href=\"/cwcki/Family_Guy\" title=\"Family Guy\">Family Guy</a> is to the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Simpsons\" title=\"Simpsons\">Simpsons</a>. And with the Fact that Allah is actually a God manifested from a piece of my mother, Emanuel, the Mulslims Have been indirectly praying to Her through Allah. The Muslims would actually do better to be More Open-Minded to and for the other Religions, including Christianity, as well as Greater Spirituality, so they are Not Blinding Themselves from the Greater Truths and Insights. I had spoken with Allah, and he was Greatly Concerned over his followers in Islam, as they are so heavily strict, defensive, violent, and closed off from other inputs.

Are they pretty cool? \n</p><p>Mostly Good, but the boneless chicken breast is Dry, and the meatballs from a Banquet TV Dinner are better than the meatballs, here.
