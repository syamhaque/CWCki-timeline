I don't get asked out much, and finding my lady Sweetheart and eventually being married and having a family has been an ambition of mine. Recently, I ended up informing my mother a reminder about all that. And amidst the discussion, she says to me, \"On my own death bed, I do not care rather or not you have any children at all.\" It registered to me equal to \"your future children can go to hell.\" It Hurt Deep, like a gunshot that pierced not only through my heart, but knocked my soul back far. I ended up crying, and I had an upset with gut pains and sweat that cleared up after the poo got out of my system. Either way, I am still recovering, and still feeling sad about this.\n</p><p>I want to add, and This Should Be a Life Lesson to ALL Parents, so please be sure to tell Everyone upon answering the question on your show:\n</p><p>\"Parents, NEVER EVER tell your children or their children that you do not care if they never have children.

I used to sit at the front and to the right side of the bus; right by the bus' door. I remember it was at a time after I started having to wear glasses for being nearsighted, since I was examined by my optomologist doctor, who is also my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/David_Chandler\" title=\"David Chandler\">half-brother</a>, And got my glasses on the same day in '97, Groundhog Day; February 2.

One day, that boy upped and punched my face, Just to be first off of the bus that day. AND the punch was so hard, he literally knocked my glasses off of me. The glasses did not get broken, but I was really hurt and upset. I walked and cried as I walked home from the bus stop that day. I told my parents about it; they contacted the school, and I ended up with the bad end of the deal: the boy got off scott-free, while, with being High-Functioning Autistic, got Demoted to riding on a handicapped bus for the rest of my High School years. Ugh! It gets worse, as I ended up with this really <a href=\"/cwcki/Slow-in-the-minds\" title=\"Slow-in-the-minds\">worse-off mentally challenged person</a>, who could hardly ever speak other than \"rrr\"; that boy <a href=\"/cwcki/Kick_the_Autistic\" title=\"Kick the Autistic\">bopped me on the back of the head for his own laughs</a>.

The Dimensional Merge was not evoked by myself, but evoked by necessity and mutual wishes from all intelligent and mentally able inhabitants between both Dimensions.

For example: Stan Lee wished to hang out and work with his Marvel creations, and Tony Stark and the others have been most wanting to with him. And even the fan artists/creators, including those in the Brony Analyst Community, have wish to be with their OCs, like Amy Methvan with Mary Sue and Maddy (though she will end up meeting Christine’s Gary Stu as well, since he and Mary have been together now; finally have their one child). As well as most Everyone around the Earth and throughout the Galaxies and Beyond in this Dimension 1218, and the same in C-197.\n<p>Many a “mythical being” such as unicorns and dragons that were real back in the early AD years and castle ages who all Did exist in 1218 were banished to the other side of the Dimensional Curtain into C-197. And many a similar figure, even deity type, fell into that dimension as well, but always kept watch over both Earths. And over the centuries, many an OC continued to be created and discovered by the Creators, Artists, Authors and Chroniclers of 1218, and they all wished they could see, meet and/or hang out with the OCs once again or for the first time.\n</p><p>This plan had been retroactive and in planning and processing for about a millennium or so by the Deities, including Fate and Destiny; they all have been collaborating in this as well.
