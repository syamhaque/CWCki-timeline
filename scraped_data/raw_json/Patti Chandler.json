It should be noted though that in an email Chris sent to <a href=\"/cwcki/The_Wallflower\" title=\"The Wallflower\">The Wallflower</a> on 28 <a href=\"/cwcki/February_2010\" title=\"February 2010\">February 2010</a>, he wrote that he learned what Patti's birthdate was after a veterinarian determined it for him.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup> It is doubtful that a veterinarian can determine the precise date in which a dog was born, making the birth date Chris reports as dubious. If it's even roughly accurate though, Patti lived a very long life for a dog.\n</p><p>As Chris tells in Patti's eulogy, he picked her up as a puppy from a litter at the house of his <a href=\"/cwcki/Aunt_Corrina\" title=\"Aunt Corrina\">Aunt Corrina</a>. On September 1993, Chris and Bob moved from Ruckersville to Chesterfield County.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup> This led to him being separated from Patti for 3 years, as Barbara did not accompany her husband and son, but rather stayed in the Chandlers old home along with the pets. Only in early 1996 did Barbara move to Chesterfield along with Patti and the rest of the family's pets.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Chris brought Patti back to life in <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_6\" title=\"Sonichu 6\"><i>Sonichu</i> 6</a> as <a href=\"/cwcki/Patti-Chan\" title=\"Patti-Chan\">Patti-Chan</a> (a character created by <a href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Schroeder\" title=\"Megan Schroeder\">Megan Schroeder</a> to help Chris <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_coping\" title=\"Chris and coping\">cope</a> with the loss of his beloved pet), where she somehow gained the ability to walk, talk, and apply for <a href=\"/cwcki/Monthly_tugboat\" title=\"Monthly tugboat\">welfare</a> in <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a>. Patti is allowed no rest, as her soul remains in Chris's fantasy world, alongside <a href=\"/cwcki/Clover_and_Snoopy\" title=\"Clover and Snoopy\">an anthropomorphized version of Snoopy</a> when that animal died over a decade and a half later. According to <a href=\"/cwcki/Asperchu_is_a_Horrendous_Joke\" title=\"Asperchu is a Horrendous Joke\">a video from January 2010</a>, Patti now feasts on human souls. While this may seem to be at odds with the canon of the Sonichu comics, it makes perfect sense if you consider the distinct possibility that CWCville <i>is</i> Hell.\n</p><p>There is not a single known picture of Patti indoors, suggesting that she was just left in her pen in the backyard all the time. According to Chris, her wood-and-plastic doghouse weighed between \"5-10 tons\".<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-father_call_1-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-father_call-1\">[1]</a></sup> While a normal person might say something like that figuratively to represent the emotional weight it would take to move the home of a deceased pet for the last time, Chris seems to <a href=\"/cwcki/11042009_51_50\" title=\"11042009 51 50\">honestly believe that's how much it weighs</a>.\n</p><p>When confronted about his <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_remorse\" title=\"Chris and remorse\">insensitivity</a>, or when someone tries to point out that he has never experienced any substantial hardships, Chris is quick to point out that he experienced the loss of Patti.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-father_call_1-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-father_call-1\">[1]</a></sup> Indeed, Patti seems to be the pet that Chris was closest to, being one of the only living things that he truly loved beyond a sense of obligation, and <a href=\"/cwcki/Borb\" title=\"Borb\">Borb</a> more or less alienated the rest of Chris's family from him, so it makes sense that he'd point to Patti's passing as a traumatic experience.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Eulogy_for_Patti,_as_written_by_Chris\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Eulogy for Patti, as written by Chris</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Current_activity\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Current activity</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Gallery\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Gallery</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#External_links\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">External links</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span id=\"Eulogy_for_Patti.2C_as_written_by_Chris\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Eulogy_for_Patti,_as_written_by_Chris\">Eulogy for Patti, as written by Chris</span></h2>\n<blockquote><i></i><p><br/>Patti Chandler\n<br/>March 17, <a href=\"/cwcki/1980s#1988\" title=\"1980s\">1988</a> to June 27, <a href=\"/cwcki/2006\" title=\"2006\">2006</a>\n</p><p><br/>Eulogy written by Christian Weston Chandler, June 27, 2006\n</p><i><div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:091-PattiMemory.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"223\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/9/96/091-PattiMemory.jpg/300px-091-PattiMemory.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/9/96/091-PattiMemory.jpg/450px-091-PattiMemory.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/9/96/091-PattiMemory.jpg/600px-091-PattiMemory.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:091-PattiMemory.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Patti, you sweet, unlucky dog.</div></div></div></i><i></i><p><br/>My family, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_sex#Bestiality\" title=\"Chris and sex\">furry</a> friends, (anyone else present), we are gathered here today to pay our last respects and wishes to our dearly beloved beagle/spitz, Patti, who has departed from our world here on earth to a <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">doggy heaven where she will be happier</a>, because she will run free and play with all the other dogs who are already having fun up there. And she will often look down upon her beloved family, me, Christian Chandler, my mother, <a href=\"/cwcki/Barbara_Chandler\" title=\"Barbara Chandler\">Barbara Chandler</a>, and my father <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler\" title=\"Bob Chandler\">Robert Chandler</a>, and the <a href=\"/cwcki/Chandler_Cats\" title=\"Chandler Cats\">cats</a> who have grown fond of Patti.\n</p><p><br/>I will always remember Patti for all the lovely memories she has shared with me from:\n<br/>-When I picked her out of the litter at my <a href=\"/cwcki/Aunt_Corrina\" title=\"Aunt Corrina\">Aunt Corina's</a> house in Redoak, Virginia.\n<br/>-The many walks I have shared with her around this neighborhood, as well as the neighborhood in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris%27s_homes#Newberry_Towne_Subdivision\" title=\"Chris's homes\">Newberry Towne subdivision in Richmond, Virginia</a>.\n<br/>-The time I watched my old best friend, <a href=\"/cwcki/Sarah_Nicole_Hammer\" title=\"Sarah Nicole Hammer\">Sarah Hammer</a>, take Patti by her front paws and danced a bit.\n<br/>-The times I've watched her stand on her hind legs and then rewarded her with a biscuit bone.\n<br/>-The time I took my camera to her pen and took this lovely picture of her and me, and I made a big deal how she'll be like a movie dog star.\n<br/>-The times I've just sat with her in the yard and petted her head. I've always given her a \"Bally-Scratch\" where I stroke her head with all five fingers like as if I was gently squeezing a rubber ball.\n<br/>-The many times I've fed her a can of food and a cup full of dry food, and refilled her bucket with fresh water so she can drink it and wash her face.\n<br/>-There was also the one time I saw her resting on top of her doghouse (not on her back like Snoopy).\n<br/>-<a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_collie\" title=\"wikipedia:Border collie\">I've often wondered why between both her ears, why one was bent and the other was straight like an arrowhead</a>.\n</p><p><br/>When Patti was brought to the vet on that <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_English\" title=\"Chris and English\">faithful</a> day, I was distraught with fright and concern for her health. I stayed with her during her final moments with a hand on her head and a tear in my eye. When my mother was brought the paper that gave the doctor permission to send her on her way, I didn't want her to be the one to sign it. I raised Patti since she was a six-week old pup, and I wanted to take the strain for signing the one-way ticket (it was hard for me, but it was for the best). So I signed that paper, with a crying <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(character)\" title=\"Sonichu (character)\">Sonichu</a> face saying, \"We love you, Patti.\" After that, I gave her my final pets, hug, hand-to-paw hold, eye-contact, ear-rub, cheek-to-fur rub, and I sadly waved her for the final time, and I said, \"Good Bye, Patti, I Love You.\" As I stood outside, I heard Patti's last barks saying, \"I will always love you, Chris. Thank You.\"\n</p><p><i>\n<br/>But we all must move on with our lives with our beloved lucky mutt in our hearts and in our memories. So, Patti, may your old dog house and surrounding flowers forever memorialize your blessed heart, your barks at the stars and strangers, and your loyal love that you have blessed upon me and my family and friends. Bark on, and rest in peace, our beloved lucky Patti.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]</a></sup></i></p></blockquote>\n<p>Take note that Chris actually shoehorned <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(character)\" title=\"Sonichu (character)\">Sonichu</a> in his dog's eulogy.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Current_activity\">Current activity</span></h2>\n<p>Not content with an eternity of biscuit bones and \"bally-scratches\" in doggy heaven, Patti has apparently taken time out of being dead to <a href=\"/cwcki/Dreams#The_Patti-chan_dream\" title=\"Dreams\">assure her former master</a> of her peaceful afterlife in a dream. Also, Chris has averred that her vengeful spirit will seek out <a href=\"/cwcki/Alec_Benson_Leary\" title=\"Alec Benson Leary\">Alec Benson Leary</a> and his cohorts for allegedly besmirching her memory and proceed to, in no particular order, give them nightmares, consume their souls and kill them. Yet, as always, Chris still thinks of himself as a <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_anger\" title=\"Chris and anger\">kindhearted</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_religion\" title=\"Chris and religion\">Christian</a> individual.\n</p><p>Patti's physical remains rest underneath her 10-ton doghouse in the Chandlers' backyard. The notion of exhuming and desecrating her bones has become a popular running joke among trolls, to the point that Chris, in <a href=\"/cwcki/Haters_Gonna_Hate.MOV\" title=\"Haters Gonna Hate.MOV\">a September 2010 YouTube video</a>, took the time to fiercely deny any rumors that the corpse of his dog was anywhere except where he had buried it.\n</p><p>Ironically, in a video created about a year after that one, Chris pretended (while dressed as a hooker) to <a href=\"/cwcki/It%27s_not_that_cold\" title=\"It's not that cold\">dig up Patti</a> and repurpose her as a coat. It seems that not only is Patti an unholy weapon of soul-sucking revenge, but a snuggly, warm coat, too.\n</p><p>The doghouse <a href=\"/cwcki/14_Branchland_Court#Tour_of_the_Chandler_Yard\"
