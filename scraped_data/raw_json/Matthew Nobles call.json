Um, I'm an employee at the GAMe PLACe.

Um-<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Bob:</b></font> I didn't know he had been to your store early in June.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> When he attempted to ge-<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Bob:</b></font> I knew he-<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> Oh, you were unaware of-<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Bob:</b></font> He- I knew he, uh, had some, a lot of problems with you people several years ago. [<i>Matthew attempts to answer, Bob continues over him</i>]<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Matthew</b></font> [<i>interrupted</i>]: Well, uh, what happened was, uh...<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Bob</b></font> [<i>continuing</i>]: When you basically kicked him out and everything else for no reason of his own.<br/>\n<font color=\"#66FF00\"><b>Barb:</b></font> [<i>in the background</i>]: And his mother.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Bob:</b></font> And his mother. And everybody else. I don’t really like your place, now what’s it gon--I didn't know he'd been there in June, hmm, ow tell me about this.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> Well, basically what happened was he came in, he wanted to talk to our manager, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Mike\" title=\"Mike\">Mike</a>, about getting himself unbanned. Um, Mike refused to speak with him about the matter.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Bob:</b></font> Well, I think that's the Mike that threw him out. Mike's been <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Kick_the_autistic\" title=\"Kick the autistic\">persecuting him for years</a> and I don't like Mike. I'd like to speak to the owner of the place I think lives up here, up the road from me. In <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison,_Virginia\" title=\"wikipedia:Madison, Virginia\">Madison</a> or somewhere. This whole thing is a setup from the very beginning with my son. Now I don- didn't like it then and I still don't like it. Now what happened in June?<br/>\n<font color=\"#66FF00\"><b>Barb:</b></font> [<i>interrupts</i>] Bob?<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Matthew</b>:</font> [<i>interrupted several times</i>] Well, sir, the point is that- Sir, I... sir. Well after he left, uh, when he couldn't get himself unbanned, he came back several days later and <a href=\"/cwcki/The_GAMe_PLACe#The_GAMe_PLACe_Photograph\" title=\"The GAMe PLACe\">was taking pictures of people in the store</a>-<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Bob:</b></font> <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_the_law\" title=\"Chris and the law\">Well, that's not illegal!</a><br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> Um, one of the patrons... He... Some people felt that he was threatening them, to be honest. One woman said that he was taking <a href=\"/cwcki/Pedofork\" title=\"Pedofork\">pictures of her son</a>. I don't know if that's true or not, but uh, Mike was there and he became angry and called the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jerkops\" title=\"Jerkops\">police</a> because your son was trespassing<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Bob:</b></font> Well he hadn't told them he- didn't come in there, it's a business place. Now, Mike, and Megan are the ones that conspired together with a couple of other people- kids there that I think were <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">gay</a>, to persecute and torment Christian for years. OK, I don't like Mike. I would like to talk to the owner of the store. I could really tell him about the people he employs there. OK, I could tell him a lot.<br/>\n<font color=\"#66FF00\"><b>Barb</b>:</font> [<i>in the background</i>] Megan lied.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> Sir... Well, regardless of that sir, I don't know about any of that all I know is that your son was banned from the store and he trespassed<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Bob</b>:</font> [<i>Talking over Matthew</i>] Well regardless of that, that all figures within to this stuff. That all figures into this stuff. It certainly shouldn't and what should- It certainly should-<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> Well that certainly- But I just called to- Sir I called to inform you- I called to inform you that even though the police came and made your son sign a trespassing notice that he continued to harass our store online. That's what I called to inform you of.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Bob:</b></font> Well he probably- People are harassing him from all over the world! Let me tell you something fella, you know what some damn crazy fools that I think started at your store with Megan, and Mike, and two or three more. You know what they just did a week ago? They just broke into his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Money\" title=\"Money\">checking account</a>, got his checking account numbers and routing numbers they- they broke into his <a href=\"/cwcki/Best_Buy\" title=\"Best Buy\">Best Buy</a> Mastercard number, and they stole his ID, and- and all of his uh... Password information they went into that Best Buy checking account, trying to ruin his credit, and made a payoff on a check that had no funds in the checking account. Which got him a whole bunch uh- of of non-sufficient fund fees. Now this all transpired a week ago. Now I'm not going to listen to your petty stuff, OK? You have people including Mike, and I can tell you two <a href=\"/cwcki/Lucas\" title=\"Lucas\">more</a> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Mimms\" title=\"Mimms\">names</a>, but I can't think of 'em right now but the third one is Megan. And I'm sure you've heard of Megan or know Megan, right there in the store.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> I've heard about Megan. Sir, I don't understand why you're not concerned about your son trespassing.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Bob:</b></font> They're the people that are terrorizing Christian! They're the people that are <a href=\"/cwcki/Twin_Falling_Towers\" title=\"Twin Falling Towers\">terrorizing</a> Christian! Ok?<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> This really has nothing to do with the GAMe PLACe, sir. I just called to inform you about your son trespassing.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Bob:</b></font> It has something to do with the GAMe PLACe because that's...the pla--well, you're from the GAMe PLACe, right?<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> Sir, the GAMe PLACe didn't break into his bank accounts. I don't know why you're telling me about this.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Bob:</b></font> Well, we think that people that come to your place do, including one of your employees named <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Manajerk\" title=\"Manajerk\">Mike</a>.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> Well, we don't control all of our customers.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Bob:</b></font> Including one of your employees named Mike. Now, if you would like to have me talk to your owner I would be glad to- and my wife would be glad to go to a meeting with him about your place and how it's <a href=\"/cwcki/Private_Villa_of_Corrupted_Citizens\" title=\"Private Villa of Corrupted Citizens\">corrupting</a> the whole neighborhood!<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> I kind of doubt that Mike himself is the guy that broke into your son's account. I kind of doubt that, sir. I just called to inform you that your son trespassed. Sir, your son was banned from the store and he came back and told me to-<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Bob:</b></font> No but he and Megan and that group- Fine! <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh#Possible_Reconciliation\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Send us a letter!</a> Send us a letter! Send me a letter, sir! Ok? I don't know who you are. Do you work for the store?<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> Well I know tha- I overheard that the police, when he was talking to the police I overheard him say that he was very adamant that he didn't want you to be told about this. He wanted his- said something about his <a href=\"/cwcki/Rocky_Shoemaker\" title=\"Rocky Shoemaker\">counselor</a>.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Bob:</b></font> Well- Do you work for the store?<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> Yes I do sir.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Bob:</b></font> Do you work for the store? Can you answer the question?<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> I just said that I do, sir.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Bob:</b></font> I beg your pardon?<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> W-What question sir? I missed your question, sir.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Bob:</b></font> Do you work for the GAMe PLACe?<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> I just answered that, sir.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Bob:</b></font> No you didn't. Do you work for the GAMe PLACe?<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> I said, \"Yes I do, sir.\" I answered that three times in a row.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Bob:</b></font> Ok, what is your position at the GAMe PLACe?<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> I'm an employee of theirs, sir. I'm a supervisor.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Bob:</b></font> You're a supervisor. Now what does that exactly mean? That mean you're a shift manager?<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> ...Yes.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Bob:</b></font> Yes, OK. Now, will you tell me the owner's name, or do I have to subpoena it?<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> Sir... [<i>stress sigh</i>] ...look, I'm- honestly, I'm getting a little tired of this, sir. I'm just calling to inform your son trespassed and he's <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Diary#July_2005\" title=\"Diary\">getting arrested</a>.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Bob:</b></font> Well, sir, I'm getting a little tired of your place. OK? I don't want to be harassed by your place.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> Fair enough. We don’t like your son harassing us.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Bob:</b></font> You left me a pretty threatening message on the thing to start with. On my telephone.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> What? Sir, I left a message saying I had a sensitive matter to discuss with you. How is that threatening?<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Bob:</b></font> Yeah, but it was your tone of voice and attitude.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> Sir, I didn't have an attitude. I was perfectly polite.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Bob:</b></font> Oh, no. No, no you weren't.<br/>\n<font color=\"#66FF00\"><b>Barb:</b></font> Get his name.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> I don't know how to disagree with that, sir.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Bob:</b></font> How do you spell your last name? How do you spell your last name?<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> Nobles. N-O- Sir. This isn't threatening. I feel that it was irresponsible of us not to inform Christian's parents. That’s why I called. To inform you about his trespassing.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Bob:</b></font> Well... Just wait a minute now.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> He wanted us to talk to his counselor instead.<br/>\n<font color=\"#3300FF\"><b>Bob:</b></font> 'Cause when was he told- N-O-B-E-L or N-O-B-L-E?<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> I wasn't there the initial time years ago when he was banned, sir.
