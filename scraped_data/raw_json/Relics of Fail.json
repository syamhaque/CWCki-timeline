Formerly thought to have been destroyed during the fire of 2014, Chris later rediscovered it in a damp and grimy bag of clothes.

The document chronicles the lives of its two title characters and the (almost non-existent) relationship they had while depicting them (and several of their friends and family) as Sonichu characters. The tract's current fate is unknown, although it is more than likely to have been thrown away by Sarah shortly after receiving it.</li>\n<li><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Medallions_of_Fail\" title=\"Medallions of Fail\">Medallions</a> - Hunks of Crayola-brand modeling clay fashioned into the shape of Sonichu's head, among other characters' heads. Once believed by trolls to be the source of his power, though they were swiftly corrected when Chris began showing off the Amnyfest Ring to show that his videos are true and honest. Chris eventually began production selling new medallions on <a href=\"/cwcki/EBay\" title=\"EBay\">eBay</a> in <a href=\"/cwcki/2014\" title=\"2014\">2014</a>.</li>\n<li>Letters to sweethearts.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_sex#Contraceptives\" title=\"Chris and sex\">Condoms</a> - Never used correctly, Chris once used one that <a href=\"/cwcki/Mia_Hamm\" title=\"Mia Hamm\">Mia Hamm</a>, the hooker he lost his virginity to, purchased.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Ohio_trip\" title=\"Ohio trip\">Receipts from Ohio trip</a> - Chris bought some food from Sonic on the way to Cleveland.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Apparel\">Apparel</span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/cwcki/Amnyfest_Ring\" title=\"Amnyfest Ring\">Amnyfest Ring</a> - Since the Sonichu medallions were stolen, Chris has claimed this <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_English\" title=\"Chris and English\">mysteriously</a>-named high school ring is the TRUE source of his power. He has since put the ring up on eBay, claiming his true source of power is within himself.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Medallions#Sonichu_Medallion\" title=\"Medallions\">Sonichu medallion</a> - A medallion Chris crafted himself from <a href=\"/cwcki/CHRIS!!!_CHANDLER!!!\" title=\"CHRIS!!! CHANDLER!!!\">CRAYOLA FUCKIN' MODEL MAGIC AND ACRYLIC PAINT</a>. The medallion used to store his power to transform into <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris-chan_Sonichu\" title=\"Chris-chan Sonichu\">Chris-chan Sonichu</a>, before it was revealed that it was actually the above ring.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Anime_Wings\" title=\"Anime Wings\">Anime Wings</a> - A pair of women's hairclips that Chris got at <a href=\"/cwcki/Anime_Mid-Atlantic\" title=\"Anime Mid-Atlantic\">Anime Mid-Atlantic</a>.

His other CDs wouldn't have their tracklists publicly released until Chris listed them for sale on <a href=\"/cwcki/Cwclight\" title=\"Cwclight\">Cwclight</a>.

Chris later sold the Wiimote and his console altogether in <a href=\"/cwcki/2018\" title=\"2018\">2018</a>.</li>\n<li><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/List_of_Chris%27s_games\" title=\"List of Chris's games\">Various video games</a> and their respective consoles - Thousands of dollars have been spent on them, most of it right from the pockets of either his parents, or American taxpayers.

Nobody can copy Chris' hand drawn style, no matter how hard you try.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_Totem\" title=\"Sonic Totem\">Sonic Totem</a> - A demonic looking papier-mâché Sonic that Chris made, and appears in few videos.

Thus, Chris added being an inventor extraordinaire to his long list of \"accomPLISHments.\"\n</p><p>In <a href=\"/cwcki/November_2009\" title=\"November 2009\">November 2009</a>, Chris received an <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_1#Chris_the_inventor\" title=\"Mailbag 1\">e-mail</a> from a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Troll\" title=\"Troll\">fan</a> roleplaying as the late Leonardo da Vinci, one of the great artists with whom Chris has compared himself <a href=\"/cwcki/Hotel_Ricky_Ricardo\" title=\"Hotel Ricky Ricardo\">in the past</a> (managing to forget the great Italian's name and misspell his surname). Leo ironically stated that he considers Chris his <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_art\" title=\"Chris and art\">\"artistic equal\"</a>, and asked if the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Autistic\" title=\"Autistic\">autistic</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_English\" title=\"Chris and English\">genius</a> has a similar knack to making inventions, for which Leonardo himself was famous. Being the egotistical and vain person he is, Chris could not allow even Leonardo da Vinci to excel him in any field. Chris was quick to assure Mr. da Vinci in his <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag\" title=\"Mailbag\">Mailbag</a> reply that he is, indeed, an inventor as well, and proceeded to list three of the most outstanding of his inventions.\n</p><p><b>The Four Great Inventions of Christian Weston Chandler</b>\n</p><p><b>I.</b> The \"One set of Inventions\" including:\n</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(species)\" title=\"Sonichu (species)\">Sonichu</a>;</li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu_(species)\" title=\"Rosechu (species)\">Rosechu</a>;</li>\n<li>City of <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a>.

This is something that may have been a significant accomplishment for say, a 9-year-old, but when a 28-year-old man lists something he built with Lego as an \"invention,\" it can only evoke facepalming.
