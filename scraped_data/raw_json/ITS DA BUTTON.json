uh well um dishonorable\n</p><p>mention to the toxic\n</p><p>ones but I'd like to offer a little bit\n</p><p>of a reminiscent tour if you will a\n</p><p>little bit of nostalgia since uh we've\n</p><p>reached such the\n</p><p>Milestone the things are all this\n</p><p>started like obviously for the day I was\n</p><p>born and\n</p><p>everything but obviously I came to learn\n</p><p>myself as I am being the one Avatar of\n</p><p>all existence and everything a lot of\n</p><p>soul searching and digging deep within\n</p><p>and connecting with everything\n</p><p>to realize\n</p><p>this and of course you remember classic\n</p><p>book\n</p><p>zero and of course you got to thank the\n</p><p>green screen for doing that detail the\n</p><p>grass in the bottom or this is being\n</p><p>upgrad and still in progress to book\n</p><p>zero HD the big binder is right next to\n</p><p>me but of course you know this is what\n</p><p>I'm supposed to be known for\n</p><p>SM Interruption there this is what I'm\n</p><p>work for and part of what I am not just\n</p><p>to be a YouTube Creator or content but\n</p><p>because of the sa and Roose shoes and\n</p><p>the see a quick video and all that and\n</p><p>the progression we're making so far and\n</p><p>my inspiration to everyone and I just\n</p><p>cting the old classic but zero and uh\n</p><p>I'm making an audable mention once again\n</p><p>to the two fan fic to the two fan fishs\n</p><p>one of which is one of which is canon\n</p><p>this one in an alternate\n</p><p>timeline but yeah just uh look at this\n</p><p>stack of the books you got your book\n</p><p>zero we got your one two three\n</p><p>four thick book five\n</p><p>six seven\n</p><p>eight n\n</p><p>11 why is it doing that on yellow\n</p><p>12\n</p><p>12-9\n</p><p>and bonus but yeah nice star G4 getting\n</p><p>on back on track everything is\n</p><p>manifesting as I have foret told\n</p><p>numerous times beforehand and now and of\n</p><p>course we can't forget\n</p><p>the secret ship F folder cards obviously\n</p><p>insired by the MLP game but who said it\n</p><p>had to just be limited to the\n</p><p>ponies but we are looking a way to get\n</p><p>these Mass printed inexpensively so we\n</p><p>can add these all the individual cards\n</p><p>and we'll do bonus promo cards at at one\n</p><p>point or\n</p><p>another and whatnot but just that's\n</p><p>still to be confirmed in the future\n</p><p>later on and of course\n</p><p>the toys the abble figures personally\n</p><p>made the old prototypes but if we can\n</p><p>kind a way to get the Amo chips in the\n</p><p>bases then that would definitely be much\n</p><p>better but we're that's one detail we're\n</p><p>looked into we may be able to manifest\n</p><p>that a little bit later on with the\n</p><p>things are in process that we are\n</p><p>planning but anyway so on that so\n</p><p>Sonu discovered son Prime discovered\n</p><p>within my premonition mind on March 17th\n</p><p>2000 though\n</p><p>literally as I have written and made\n</p><p>obvious and Canon Sanu was born on Sonu\n</p><p>Prime as a Pichu was born on April 20th\n</p><p>1992 and Rosie Rose Shu Prime born as a\n</p><p>Pichu on January 8th\n</p><p>1992 so age difference decide yada yada\n</p><p>yada she's a little bit older than\n</p><p>him but anyway\n</p><p>so April 20th and not to be confused\n</p><p>with that joke of 420 or whatever so\n</p><p>just no no no April 20th that's when son\n</p><p>Prime was\n</p><p>born anyway so aside from\n</p><p>that all the progressions on the way\n</p><p>because I did want to focus a lot on\n</p><p>sichu and rosi and all the special sichu\n</p><p>and rosu and just I was so focused on\n</p><p>the the sweetheart search of mine once\n</p><p>upon a time\n</p><p>no longer a\n</p><p>thing I'm doing much better now but yeah\n</p><p>just then the progressions all on the\n</p><p>way with the sweetheart search and yeah\n</p><p>I I did a bunch of videos on YouTube and\n</p><p>some of which were\n</p><p>obviously influenced by certain few but\n</p><p>they will about be\n</p><p>named\n</p><p>but their judgment is\n</p><p>set and so on so\n</p><p>forth but anyway so aside from that I've\n</p><p>grown and developed along the way and\n</p><p>definitely learned and uh here's the\n</p><p>thing Internet Security and make sure\n</p><p>you do not DOD yourself and don't DOD\n</p><p>anybody\n</p><p>else but honesty and authenticity\n</p><p>between individuals still does remain\n</p><p>good and just so if you're looking to\n</p><p>actually become friends with somebody on\n</p><p>the\n</p><p>Internet seriously don't fake\n</p><p>don't hate just keep it all authentic\n</p><p>and\n</p><p>good and as long as you can do that\n</p><p>especially in loving yourself\n</p><p>authentically and deeply and everything\n</p><p>and appreciating yourself and everything\n</p><p>that has led you to get to this point\n</p><p>that shall be good for you as well even\n</p><p>if you are among the lowest ranks or\n</p><p>dredges or even if you're a billionaire\n</p><p>but still not very happy because you're\n</p><p>not feeling like you're so fully being\n</p><p>fulfilled and all that so you think\n</p><p>about that middle of the road is Tech is\n</p><p>technically good cuz it's like you take\n</p><p>the good for the\n</p><p>bad and find your own way for the bear\n</p><p>but of course you got to remember your\n</p><p>roots where you came from as you were in\n</p><p>past lives and so on and so\n</p><p>forth and which individuals you may\n</p><p>actually be The Reincarnation of at this\n</p><p>point outside that\n</p><p>enjoy life as you will and keep it all\n</p><p>good the Bible does remain a good guide\n</p><p>but we are meant to think outside the\n</p><p>Bible eventually so just remember\n</p><p>that preach praise but still keep it\n</p><p>good and light powered and\n</p><p>positive but of course as there is a\n</p><p>good point to be spoken when one does\n</p><p>tend to become famous or just to record\n</p><p>a video and put on the internet it\n</p><p>should not be done for attention it\n</p><p>should be done for projecting a valid\n</p><p>reasonable point or\n</p><p>perspective or just a even a random\n</p><p>silly thought whatsoever but as long as\n</p><p>you do it for the good and yeah quoting\n</p><p>from rainbow from equest Girls Rainbow\n</p><p>Rocks the music inside you what is\n</p><p>resonant and true from within your heart\n</p><p>your soul and everything inside about\n</p><p>you that just emits\n</p><p>brilliantly but obviously if you're\n</p><p>meting Darkness then you know you are in\n</p><p>the wrong but if you me light power and\n</p><p>good then you know it is\n</p><p>good it's like I have a crowd that chear\n</p><p>my name but it's like I don't need that\n</p><p>I didn't really come online seeing\n</p><p>seeking infamy or fame and yet it has\n</p><p>happened to me from time to time but\n</p><p>what I bring is truth and authenticity\n</p><p>the best of my abilities even though in\n</p><p>the past I have made mistakes regards to\n</p><p>the theoretical OS I had those that were\n</p><p>online that faked me and hate me and all\n</p><p>that but of course as you know which\n</p><p>that which has been proven good and\n</p><p>which is true and\n</p><p>fact so yall remember that keep it true\n</p><p>keep it\n</p><p>good and light powered just know you are\n</p><p>in the right when it is good to\n</p><p>you especially the good habits and\n</p><p>everything and of course just treat\n</p><p>yourself good go on keep yourself on a\n</p><p>healthy route as best you are able\n</p><p>to drink lots of water caffeine is good\n</p><p>in reasonable amounts of course but you\n</p><p>don't want to go too much just\n</p><p>mentioning that but observe your body\n</p><p>let your body when your body feels bad\n</p><p>take it easy because you love yourself\n</p><p>you love your body you love as an\n</p><p>individual\n</p><p>and when you love to spread yourself as\n</p><p>an individual and everything that\n</p><p>good then you will attract those who\n</p><p>appreciate\n</p><p>you and love you for themselves\n</p><p>especially those that have found Soul\n</p><p>searched deeply I encourage you to Soul\n</p><p>search and look deep into yourself as\n</p><p>well what you were what you are what you\n</p><p>are meant to do you may actually have\n</p><p>prophetic Visions in your dreams a lot\n</p><p>of us do have a little bit of psychic\n</p><p>power and the very few of us have the\n</p><p>heavy psychic power and everything that\n</p><p>is\n</p><p>good\n</p><p>anyway the Big Bite button we have made\n</p><p>to this achievement and I thank\n</p><p>everybody that has help me to get to\n</p><p>this point I shall\n</p><p>continue in good stride\n</p><p>instead with my works and everything and\n</p><p>the updates that come in from time to\n</p><p>time thank you all very much\n</p><p>have a great safe
