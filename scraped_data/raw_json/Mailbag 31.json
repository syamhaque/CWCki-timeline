Compared to most other <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag\" title=\"Mailbag\">mailbags</a>, his answers were slightly more in depth and <i>vastly</i> more disturbing.

Chris also stated that he would rather let an innocent man die than have <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">gay sex</a>, implied that he expects <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_religion\" title=\"Chris and religion\">God and Jesus</a> to personally inform him whenever he's in error, and told us all that <a href=\"/cwcki/Magi-Chan\" title=\"Magi-Chan\">Magi-Chan</a> psychically watches everybody in <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a> have sex, so anybody doing it wrong can be arrested.

It is good to know that I have reached the top rank. I am currently in talks with the fellows on the Cartoon Network to possibly do a series of ASPERCHU-based short cartoons (3-5 minutes) that will air during their <a href=\"/cwcki/Adult_Swim\" title=\"Adult Swim\">Adult Swim</a> Broadcast; telling them that you have given me the Blessing as a Professional <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Art\" title=\"Art\">Artist</a> will speed up the talks most certainly. Thank you as well for providing such a detailed answer to my question. I confess that You have confused me greatly. You say several things that make me wonder what it is you mean, and I would like if you can clarify.\n</p><p>For example, You say the sentence \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Aspergers\" title=\"Aspergers\">Aspergers</a> supposed being similar to Autism, which although I have accepted that, I still disagree heavily on it being even ASSOCIATED with Autism as a type. Aspergers is NOT a Type Of Autism Whatsoever.\" Now, in the first part of that sentence, you say that you have accepted that the Aspergers is similar to the Autism, but in the next several words you say that Aspergers is NOT related to Autism. Your sentence has two parts, which each contradict the other.\n</p><p>In another part of your response, You say that \"I accept no relation between [Asperchu] and my works and characters, and with that I stand behind my statement of and labeling of Asperchu as a Parody.\" Now, this confuses me because a parody by definition is RELATED to its parent work, as parody is a deliberate imitation of the work on which it is based, yet you say that my ASPERCHU is not at all related to your Sonichu. That is true - My ASPERCHU is in fact my own ORIGINAL creation and not in any way related to your Sonichu. But then only several words after admitting this, you say that you stand behind your belief that ASPERCHU is a <a href=\"/cwcki/Parody\" title=\"Parody\">parody</a> of Sonichu. I do believe that perhaps you do not have the good understanding of just what a Parody really is, and my attempt to show you through drawing an actual parody page has failed.\n</p><p>Please clarify both of these statements, Christian, as as they are now it seems you are trying to have two outcomes that are the Mutually Exclusive be true in each one of them, which of course is not possible. Either Aspergers is related to Autism or it is not (IT IS), and Either ASPERCHU is a Parody of Sonichu or it's not (it is NOT).\n</p><p>Also, I do have one last point to query about. You remark that I have made ASPERCHU into a \"blatant homosexual male with such drawings of such dictation\". I am confused by this, as I have NEVER drawn ASPERCHU to be making any dictations (by which I mean speaking, as that is the definition of the word) about being a homosexual; in fact throughout the Issues of the Comic he has pursued several <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Gal-pal\" title=\"Gal-pal\">GAL-PALS</a> to make into a SWEETHEART, which is the heterosexual thing to be doing. In fact, you should read the conclusion of the latest Issue, as he does in fact acquire a <a href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart\" title=\"Sweetheart\">sweetheart</a>, the wonderful, caring, sweetest Dixie Chu. Perhaps your critical eye sees something in my Creation that I Myself did not notice putting in there, but to me ASPERCHU has always been a beacon of Heterosexual Virility and Pride. Conversely, you have yourself drawn Sonichu as being of the Homogay persuasion quite frequently, such as whenever Sonichu has intimations with his Boyfriend Rosechu, and also the Most Blatant Example is when you drew that Graphically Hardcore honeymoon comic where you had Sonichu turn blue and make sweet passionate love to that redheaded fellow.\n</p><p>So please, be so kind as to explain these quandaries to a wondering mind such as mine.\n</p><p>Your Protege and Bestest Joy-Boy,\n</p><p>Alec Benson Leary\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:AsperchuNoHomo.JPG\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"364\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/0/06/AsperchuNoHomo.JPG/300px-AsperchuNoHomo.JPG\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/0/06/AsperchuNoHomo.JPG/450px-AsperchuNoHomo.JPG 1.5x, /w/images/0/06/AsperchuNoHomo.JPG 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:AsperchuNoHomo.JPG\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>The drawing Chris refers to.</div></div></div>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>I have NEVER given you such an Outrageous Blessing to work with Adult Swim.
