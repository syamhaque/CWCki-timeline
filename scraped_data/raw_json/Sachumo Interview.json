I hope you all enjoy this opportunity to come out and see what we're gonna be doing. Uh, right now, we're just going to have a little chat. I mean, this has been... a long time coming, don't you think?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Mm-hmm. A lot of people have wanted us to finally just talk and... you know what... just why not. We'll just talk. That's, that's what I wanted to do, you know. \n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Have some fun, um. Alright, it's hard to read the chat. There is a lot of people watching right now. Oh my god. Okay. I can't even read the chat. Okay. Uh. Alright, so we're here with the famous Christine Christian Chris-Chan Christopher Ricardo... Weston Chandler. (laughs) You have many names.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hey everybody. (<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress_sigh\" title=\"Stress sigh\">stress sigh</a>) (laughs) Yeah. That... just go with my current one, I think.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Christine...\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hey everybody.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Yup... chat... chat is like usual, saying some very odd stuff. Um... Yep, I can never... I can never control them, no matter how hard I try, but you know... you know how the Internet is.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yup, it's a little crazy.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Chris_Chan_Documentary_and_My_Little_Pony_.280:03:31-0:10:18.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris_Chan_Documentary_and_My_Little_Pony_(0:03:31-0:10:18)\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_Chan_Documentary_(Sachumo)\" title=\"Chris Chan Documentary (Sachumo)\">Chris Chan Documentary</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/My_Little_Pony\" title=\"My Little Pony\">My Little Pony</a> (0:03:31-0:10:18)</span></h3>\n<p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Mm-hmm. Yeah. So, for those of you who don't know, uh, but do know about Christine, I'm the creator of the Christian Weston Chandler documentary that was posted in <a href=\"/cwcki/2015\" title=\"2015\">2015</a> I think? When I was around 15-16, I made it for a high school project... um... and... here we are almost three years later.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, about that.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Mm-hmm.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> That's a good deal.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Mm-hmm.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I mean the documentary was, uh, good, at least the first 50-55 percent of it, and then it just kinda ended up cringeworthy to me, but, uh, I feel like, with my input and everything, we can... we can make it better. Make a better documentary. \n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Yeah, definitely. Um... yeah, if I like, assemble the crew or something, we got... if we got some funding, then you know... why not? Just do it... an interview for a day or two... and then we go home and I edit something together. But uh... it's nice to finally get to talk to you. Um... I've always imagined... what this would be like... and I never expected it... to be honest, because it, it... because eh... it's hard to describe... it's like... you've only heard about someone, but when you finally meet them, it's different than everything you'd expect.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Ha! I know, you're just like, \"Whee!\" in the mind, and so happy and so excited! But then you reali- but then you start calming down and realize, \"Well, it's happening, it's good. It's a good thing. I'm calming down, this is finally happening, been waiting for this forever.\" And... it's all good, and everything.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Yeah... Exact- like when you meet, um... Did you ever meet <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tara_Strong\" title=\"Tara Strong\">Tara Strong</a>?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> No, I haven't had that pleasure yet.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Mm. Uh, I was trying to make a, uh... maybe a comparison but... when... when you meet someone you... you look up to, it... there... You realize they're people. You know? You don't see them as, like, these entertainers in the video. You see them... as people! Which really is a... an odd experience. \n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, actually we can- we can find a good comparison with that when I met uh... <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Sheridan\" title=\"wikipedia:Kelly Sheridan\">Kelly Sheridan</a> and... <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy_Weseluck\" title=\"wikipedia:Cathy Weseluck\">Cathy Weseluck</a> at the <a href=\"/cwcki/BronyCon_2017\" title=\"BronyCon 2017\">BronyCon last August</a>.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Mm. I'm...\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Oh, and, uh... when... and... and I met... and I got to listen to Cathy at her... panel before uh... getting her- before uh, getting her to <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://sonichu.com/w/images/4/47/Signed_Sonichu.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">autograph</a>... my copy of <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_0\" title=\"Sonichu 0\">Sonichu #0</a> on the inside cover.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Mm! You got her to autograph it!\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> <i>[talking over Sachumo]</i> And having- and having a picture taken, since... Uh, I had her do that since it's- she voices Spike as well as the May- as well as Mayor Mare and Coco Pommel. Uh, Spike loves his comic books!\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Mhm. Mhm. I- I remember watching the show a little bit, when I was... I think, like, thirteen, back in <a href=\"/cwcki/2011\" title=\"2011\">2011</a>. I watched the first two seasons, 'cause I wa- Di- You remember when <a href=\"/cwcki/My_Little_Pony\" title=\"My Little Pony\">bronies</a> were, like, the big thing, you know? They were really huge back then in <a href=\"/cwcki/2011\" title=\"2011\">2011</a>.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Still going on, bronies and pegasisters all alike.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Yeah, there's- there's still a lot of them, but, I remember, like, everybody [Chris's dog howls in the background.] in <a href=\"/cwcki/2011\" title=\"2011\">2011</a> was a brony. Everyone. It's a pretty wild time.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. You know a fun fact about, uh, bronies in generation 1 <a href=\"/cwcki/My_Little_Pony\" title=\"My Little Pony\">My Little Pony</a>, they were introduced in episode  all in one herd, these male ponies, coming in, and then they all start saving the day of all the bullies to get possessed by something magical and, uh, deceptive carnival.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Mm. I- I...\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> So that- so... so that should- so that- should more accurately be where the term \"bronies\" come from, that ep- that classic G1 episode.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Mhm. Mhm. I think I remember that, um, I- I- I remember, my favorite character was the one with the rainbow tail? Um...\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hm.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> I forgot her name. I know her name has rainbow in it...\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> (Sigh) It can't be Rain- I don't thi- I don't know if it's Rainbow Dash.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> That's right! It's Rainbow Dash, that was my favorite character.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Oh, were you talking about G4? I'm talking about- I'm talking G1. So, you kinda skip-\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Oh, G1. Yeah. Mhm. Well, that- that's more, uh, your era cuz- you were around when, uh, being a brony wasn't like, it wasn't like, the big thing it is now. It was- especially before the new show came out, you know what I mean?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. I was amongst the classics born 1982... and you've still got a lot of learning to go, young fella.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Yeah... I'm only 19 right now. Um...\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Got a lot to learn, so much more wisdom to pick up for yourself, and share with others.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Mhm. Um... so... what- what was your- what was your favorite, uh, the new generation episode? Uh, just- just out of curiosity, cuz I think mine- mine was, uh, the one where they prepare for winter.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Winter wrap up, winter wrap up!\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Mhm. Yeah, that one, that one. Mhm. What is- so what- what's, uh, what's your favorite episode? Cuz I- I- I- I got to check out the series again.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> (Sigh) Yeah, you gotta catch up, we're up- we're- just finishing season seven right now... and the movie just came out earlier this month, the new movie... and you got the four Equestria girls movies, and the specials, and all the sh- music video shorts, and other not-music video shorts aside from that... you really gotta catch up!\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Yeah, I've been watching, um, Avatar lately... Avatar: The Last Airbender. Have you- have you seen that?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I've heard of- I've heard of Avatar, I haven't really gotten much into it.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Mhm. It's pretty- it's pretty good. I've seen uh... the first season was kind of, uh, kind of underwhelming, because I guess- I guess it was like a kid- it was- at that time, when- when you start a pilot or a new show you can't- you can't really push the boundaries of the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCC\" title=\"wikipedia:FCC\">FCC</a>, especially with kid shows... and then as the series went on it got a lot better. Right now I'm season three... it's- it's pretty good.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Okay, quite so... but anyway, my favorite, uh, <a href=\"/cwcki/My_Little_Pony\" title=\"My Little Pony\">My Little Pony</a>: Friendship is Magic episode, I have a combina- I actually have two favorites, uh, my earlier favorite, uh, I'd have to give it to <i>Slice of Life</i>, which was episode one hundred.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Mhm.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Barb_interrupts_My_Little_Pony_discussion_.280:10:18-0:12:06.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Barb_interrupts_My_Little_Pony_discussion_(0:10:18-0:12:06)\"><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Barb\" title=\"Barb\">Barb</a> interrupts My Little Pony discussion (0:10:18-0:12:06)</span></h3>\n<p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> It brought six of our favorite background ponies to the spotlight. Derpy and Dr. Hooves, and uh, Lyra and Bon Bon, and Octavia and Vinyl. (sigh) Would you excuse me just for a second? <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Barb\" title=\"Barb\">My mom</a> wants me. What is it, mom? [Chris leaves to talk to Barb, their conversation unintelligible.]\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Alright. I'll read the chat for now. \"Don't talk about <a href=\"/cwcki/My_Little_Pony\" title=\"My Little Pony\">My Little Pony</a>...\" Um, we're just- we're just- we're just talking, I wanna, y'know... I wanna talk about what Chris wants to talk about, it's- it's not about... y'know... it's not about... the other stuff. Um.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Alright, I'm back. Sorry about that, my mom was calling down to me. I had- had to check on her... (sigh) but anyway...\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Mhm. Yeah, how's your mom doing?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> She's okay. She's, uh, she's going on- well, she just turned... I keep misremembering! Uh, she just turned 76 earlier this month.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> 76. Wow.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, but anyway- anyway, I liked <i>Slice of Life</i> cuz not only- yeah, they brought the six background ponies, including my favorite, uh, Vinyl Scratch, or DJ Pon3 also known... I also like Octavia Melody, I definitely like Derpy Muffins. Derpy thy name is Muffins!\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> (laughs)\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, but anyway- anyway, that was a good episode.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Yeah.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> And, uh, I also, uh, did like, uh, the, uh, one that came up- brought up in season seven, we finally get introduced to Apple Jack's parents... <i>Perfect Pear</i>, there it is... but my favorite, uh, episode, I definitely- would definitely have to give it to, because it relates to me so much, and means a lot to so many people, <i>Fame and Misfortune</i>.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Hypothetical_Sonichu_animation_.280:12:06-0:19:20.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Hypothetical_Sonichu_animation_(0:12:06-0:19:20)\">Hypothetical Sonichu animation (0:12:06-0:19:20)</span></h3>\n<p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Interesting. Someone just, uh- someone just asked, they wanted to do a... animated series on the first issue of Sonic- or I mean <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a>, god... it- it- it's a tongue twister almost, um... Yeah, what do you think of, uh, what do you think about people making animations? Cuz I think that would be a good idea... Cuz Sonichu has-\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah!\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> -a lot of- of action that could be, y'know... cuz it- it's like two- two franchises that are both pretty awesome, action-packed, you got <a href=\"/cwcki/Pok%C3%A9mon\" title=\"Pokémon\">Pokémon</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonic\" title=\"Sonic\">Sonic</a>, and then- if- if you put them together it would be y'know, double- double the action.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, plus he has his actually- has his own life as, uh, expressed, uh, be- ever since- over the years in book 0... but yeah, I would definitely like to see a good animated series of Sonichu, um... Eventually, I mean- you can put it on <a href=\"/cwcki/YouTube\" title=\"YouTube\">YouTube</a> and have somebody else temporarily voice Sonichu, and- or... Hm... I guess, you could let- you could- I- or I guess if, uh, I- I see the pilot of the animat- of the animated show and see that is was actually good to the source material, and full of the heart and love of passion, not just slapped-dashed together like <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Titans_Go!\" title=\"wikipedia:Teen Titans Go!\">Teen Titans Go</a>.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Hm.

Mhm. I used to really-\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> -like, uh, Teen Titans but I've heard- I've heard pretty bad things about the new- the new, uh- can- can you even call it a reboot? It's more like a butchering of the original show.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> A <i>de</i>boot.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Yeah, a deboot.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Das Boot.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Das Boot, yeah.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> (laughs) Das booted, ouch!

Uh, someone asked, didn't you describe Sonichu's voice as like, uh, like yours but a little higher pitched? Is- is that true?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. Yeah, I would definitely say quite a bit, uh, for me to voice Sonichu, uh, give a moment I will have to get into character.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Yeah, so you've done this- you've done Sonichu before, like the voice.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [Chris does his Sonichu voice.] Well at least I done it in practice! This is me, I'm Sonichu, I zap to the extreme, and I'll zap <a href=\"/cwcki/Kel\" title=\"Kel\">Kel</a> to the extreme if she puts Rosey in the PC box but she never will because she crushed the Pokéball Rosey was in, but Rosey was out of it... I misspoke on that one but it's okay, I'm not perfect I just keep on going, I'm running, I'm doing good, I'm a good dad to my Roberta, Sarah, and Christine, and they doing great, and I love my wife so much, even though ma- how- big she gets! I had a nightmare recently- I had the nightmare years ago as talked about in the recently released number twelve book! Awesome book! It's Christ- it's our Christine Chandler's love letter to the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/LGBTQ\" title=\"LGBTQ\">LGBTQ</a> community, with so much, uh, going on from my kids as well, it's a really good book. If you wanna see how Sarah and Christine evolved, you'd have to watch- check out book eleven before that!\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Mm. That was- see, I can imagine it like that, because you're so connected to Sonichu. Especially in the comics, you're kinda- it's almost like a- like a soul bond between each other. You know what I mean? And, um, not like a relationship-\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yes.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> -but like you know, you guys... are close.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yes. Psychic link.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Right, right, and... So I would imagine it's similar to your voice. But so- you know- I mean, why not voice it?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I mean, plus I just gave you the example, you just- you might wanna play that back after, uh, having this thing fully recorded, uploaded later, like y'know, me as Sonichu just a moment ago and me normal right now.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Right, right.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Anyway, that's it- anyway, that's the big difference there. Uh, yes, uh, ever since the beginning when I came up with Sonichu on the fateful March 17, <a href=\"/cwcki/2000\" title=\"2000\">2000</a>, we had become psychically linked between the dimensions of, uh, where his por- where the- where the portion is where <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Cwcville\" title=\"Cwcville\">Cwcville</a> will reside, um, ended up, uh, being more specifically located in Virginia, the North part, just opposite the, uh, Southern shore of Maryland.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Hm, okay. Um, someone just asked have you watched <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JoJo%27s_Bizarre_Adventure\" title=\"wikipedia:JoJo's Bizarre Adventure\">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a>?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uh, I have heard of it but I have not watched it.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> It's a pretty good series, um.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I know- I know in <a href=\"/cwcki/Excel_Saga\" title=\"Excel Saga\">Excel Saga</a>- parodied JoJo.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Mhm. Mhm. Uh, yeah, I've seen it, uh, a little bit. I- I- I think it's an alright show, but there's a lot of iterations of it, um.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> \"Il Palazzo!\"\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Hm.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> (chuckles) Not really. \"I'll tell this world who's corrupt! And we must do what we can to seize and rule the world so we can make it a whole lot less corrupt. Are you with me, Excel?\" \"Yes, Il Palazzo, I am!\"\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> (laughs) Someone just said that this day is more historic than the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Berlin_Wall\" title=\"wikipedia:Fall of the Berlin Wall\">fall of the Berlin Wall</a>.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Oh dear.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> (laughs) Yeah, I- this is- this is something people have talked to me about for a long time. I'm- I'm sure people have asked you about it, uh, you know, over the years to watch the- the movie, but... I- I- it's- it's gotten almost like, uh, a joke now of how- how much people ask me to get your opinion on it, and when it's finally happened, people don't know what to do with it! They're like \"Please, we wanna hear his reaction!\" and then, um, and then once that's over, it just- it- it just- it doesn't fulminate into anything. Like, uh, they wanna hear Christine, they wanna hear what you have to think, and it just- it just ends up being... what's the word? Uh...\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> It's eh, it ends up being, uh, you're finally satisfied but because it's over you held onto the expectation for such a long time, you lose the expectation because it's done and over with, you're like \"Eh!\"\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Yeah, exactly! Cuz, it- it- they expects- they expect it to be this momentous thing, we finally get to talk, and what do we talk about? <a href=\"/cwcki/My_Little_Pony\" title=\"My Little Pony\">My Little Pony</a>. I mean, why not. It's fun. Y'know, I don't wanna, you know, interrogate you.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, we're having fun.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Yeah.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> We're doing good, this is okay.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Sonichu_lore_.280:19:20-0:25:24.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sonichu_lore_(0:19:20-0:25:24)\">Sonichu lore (0:19:20-0:25:24)</span></h3>\n<p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Someone asked me, um, what my favorite character of Sonichu was, and... that's a good question. I think I liked, um, uh, <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Mary Lee Walsh</a> mostly. Uh, just because- you know, people have criticized you over the years of- of, kind of interjecting your own personal life into the comic, but I kind of think that's cool because it's- it's in a way it's taking your life and making it this big action adventure, you know?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> (sigh) Yes, plus we didn't- plus, uh, when I started- when I started the book series I originally did not have much to go on in the character range. I mean essentially when I started book 0 all I had was Sonichu, Rosechu, and <a href=\"/cwcki/Blake\" title=\"Blake\">Blake</a>, and myself, and even <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Naitsirhc\" title=\"Naitsirhc\">Naitsirhc</a>, and, uh, I ended up bringing <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Slaweel_Ryam\" title=\"Slaweel Ryam\">Slaweel Ryam</a> into the mix... and finally coming up with the whole- with the differing villain character <a href=\"/cwcki/Count_Graduon\" title=\"Count Graduon\">Count Graduon</a>. The entity and soul has been trapped in that spear for many, many a year, encapsulated there by the Cherokees after having- after having been possessing, and- and archeologists who uncovered the orb when it was- covered in his soul from a different encapsulation when it was- when he was in England, back during the castle days... and before he- before his soul was put into there after he was beheaded, he was the dark magician! He could never feel love! And there is a word I learned recently about that, which I'll tell y'all in just a moment, but yeah he could never feel love, and he can- he just- and all he could feel was neutral or hatred, eh, I mean, he could identify love from other people but it's like he could never feel it for himself... but- and of course, he was like \"Okay, well if I can't feel love, then nobody else will either!\" and that's essentially the premise of why the bad guys wanna make finding true love and all that illegal in Virginia and worldwide.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Mhm. Mhm.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> (sigh) Typical villainy. Anyway, yes, uh, as I have learned from, uh, <a href=\"/cwcki/Planet_Dolan\" title=\"Planet Dolan\">Super Planet Dolan</a>, their upcoming episode, which I got to see early on, uh, <a href=\"/cwcki/Patreon\" title=\"Patreon\">Patreon</a>, apparently there is a mental condition that- or personality type portion that make- that makes people not be able to experience love. It's called alexithymia.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Mm.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> A-L... uh, let me type that up here... A-L-E-X-I-T-H-Y-M-I-A.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Ales-hymia?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Alexithymia.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> I think I have a friend with that condition. Her name's, uh, uh, Margaret. Um, yeah that's- that kinda sounds like her.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah but anyways, essentially it's an ili- in- in- <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">inability to identify, express, or understand feelings</a>.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Mhm.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> And- and it's- and sometimes it's, uh, rela- it- it's associated with a range of psychological orders, um, though, I- I mean just to name a few they did, but, uh, just to note here, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Graduon\" title=\"Graduon\">Graduon</a> is not autistic. That's one of the things there.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Mhm.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> And it's also associated with depression and schizophrenia.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Right. Um, so it would- it's similar to autism, but different... in- in a way.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. Yeah but anyway that answers the question, \"What has <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Graduon\" title=\"Graduon\">Graduon</a> been suffering from?\"\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Mhm. Okay, um...\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Back in the ear- back in the 1500s he was suffering, and up to now he still suffers from alexithymia.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Mm. So there's a little backstory for the viewers.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> A further backst- a further backstory detail.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Mhm. See, we're learning things about Sonichu that we never thought we'd learn.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Or at least just learned a bit about <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Graduon\" title=\"Graduon\">Graduon</a>.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Mhm. But, in the- I mean Sonichu universe.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, you'll definitely learn more about <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Graduon\" title=\"Graduon\">Graduon</a> when I get to drawing book 14, after I finish up with my current project 12-9 special, talk about OC <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/MLP\" title=\"MLP\">MLP</a> character, hers- backstory and everything, Ms. <a href=\"/cwcki/Night_Star\" title=\"Night Star\">Night Star</a>.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Mm. Okay.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> She- she can view and traverse other dimensions, and she has- all the- she has all the psychic powers, which she still is not- she still is not perfect because, uh, [Dogs howl in the background.] between the mental link that she and I shared as well, she suffers from a- she suffers from- she suffered from a touch of <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">autism</a>... and there go my dogs barking at something that's happening across the street. You can probably hear them now.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Yeah, it's okay. I mean, y'know, that's what dogs do.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [Chris imitates the howl noise.]\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Um, okay... so- you have, uh, you have cats and dogs? Does that- I- I thought that doesn't, y'know, it's, uh, old, old saying, it doesn't mix? Do- or do they get along?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uh, well- they- they get- they get along fairly well. Um, yeah, we have two Eagle Hounds, three- three cats inside, and 2-3 cats outside.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Mm. Okay, um, so- that's interesting, because I've never, about the- the similar to autism, cuz I always- I've always- I noticed, um, working in- in the field, I've done- I've done a little bit of, uh, of work with special needs children, and I've noticed that any time something's like... different about someone, they just kind of... blanket term them and put them into the autistic spectrum when really that's not always the case. It- I guess- I'm- I'm not sure why they do that.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Sexuality_and_political_correctness_.280:25:24-.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sexuality_and_political_correctness_(0:25:24-)\">Sexuality and political correctness (0:25:24-)</span></h3>\n<p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> (sigh) Yeah, I don't know why, it's just some- I don't know, it's stereotyping or something... but yeah, that's just- that's just stereotyping, mislabeling... um, yeah, you don't wanna just mislabel anybody like that, that's not cool. It's just like, uh, labeling somebody as gay when they were not at the time... and then- unless something develops in where apparently that- where apparently in a way that did become true. I mean, ended up being true for me except I'm lesbian.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> So you're, uh, uh, a trans lesbian.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yes, I'm a lesbian transwoman.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Okay, there we go... um, okay, one second, uh...\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> There go my dogs again.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> So, a trans lesbian, that's- that's not very common. Have you- have you met other people like that, or- or- or is it just unique to you?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I met, uh, I actually found a, uh, transgender support group and I have a trans friend at the, uh, Pokémon league, not mentioning her name. Uh, but yeah, there's- there... actually a number of them out of the group, and counting my friends at- at the league, where... they actually still prefer women over men.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Mhm.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I mean, it's just a personal choice. It has nothing to do with, uh, them personally. I mean, y'know, will still be friends with, uh, all genders and colors regardless...\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Right.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> It's just our- it- it's just our internal preference. Our own individual preference.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> There's- there's no shame in it. I mean, it's <a href=\"/cwcki/2017\" title=\"2017\">2017</a>, you can be whatever you want. Um, maybe certain parts of the country will judge you but... those are usually the minorities... of- of- the minority opinion, y'know. It's not what everyone thinks.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yep, we're overtak- overtaking the popular flow. We are more powerful than the min- we are more powerful than those that oppressed us, which are now- which they are the minority.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Hm. Right. So- so, okay. Do- do these, uh- not- not to get any personal information about them but, so- do they- are they into the things you like or is it, um, or is it just you just hang out because of the similarity that you share?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uh, well, I would say, uh, hang out towar- cuz the similarity, but in general, they are, uh- in general they are good people, and I'm a good person... I keep an open heart, uh, for- for people that I, y'know, people I like and care about, and new people, as long as they, uh, don't offend and essentially aren't- ba- aren't bad, y'know.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Mhm. Sometimes you can't help offending people, cuz there's just people that really wanna go around getting offended, but, if you can- if- if you- if- if you can help it, then y'know, at least try not to offend people. Cuz I- I do that a lot on my channel, but it's mostly just- people don't understand I'm doing it as like a joke. Like, I say pretty, uh, silly things that are just so out there that it's amazing how people can think that I actually think that.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, it just depend- it's- always depends on perception and you'll end up, uh, getting mixed responses... in that sense. So. it's just more advisable to be more cautious.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Mhm. See, I- I've- I've kind of made my, uh- with- with the Chris-Chan documentary, I- after that I kind of went into more edgy comedy, which really, uh- I kinda liked doing but you do get bored of just saying really horrific things all the time, because then when you say things enough they kinda lose their- their- their gusto, their value. Y'know?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, like the episode of <a href=\"/cwcki/South_Park\" title=\"South Park\">South Park</a>, of, uh, too many shits.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Shits.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> They said the word too many times. More than a hundred.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Oh yeah. Mhm. Mhm. Or the one where they had, uh, uh, people on Harley-Davidsons and they were calling them faggots... and- and they- they went all the way to like the Supreme Court and when- to like get the word changed. Do you like <a href=\"/cwcki/South_Park\" title=\"South Park\">South Park</a>?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I've watched, uh, most of the series, I haven't watched it in a few years. Uh, I'm afraid I haven't seen that one with the Harleys you just mentioned. That might've been a later season episode.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Yeah, it was a while ago. Um...\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I de- I definitely have heard though that the principal of the school had changed... and there's this like tough dude with glasses now... sunglasses.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Um, yeah, he's- it's like- he's called PC principal, I think that's his name. Uh, yeah, they changed the- the, uh- someone in chat correct me if I'm wrong, they changed the principal to a new person and he's like muscled out and he's worried about, uh, like new wave, uh, issues I think that go on in- in the country that people worry about now, like offending people, and not being racist and things like that, so it- it- it's a pretty interesting turn what, uh, <a href=\"/cwcki/South_Park\" title=\"South Park\">South Park</a> is make- making, or doing at least.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Definitely a good show.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Although, it can- although- although it still can offend some people.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Yeah, I mean, you can't- you can't please everyone. I think you know that too. You can try, but you can't make everyone happy. You know?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. You're just better off appreciating the ones you can make laugh.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Mhm. Yeah. Uh, reading the chat... let's just uh...\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Reading the chat!\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Yeah, it's just wow... it is just a... a mess. The chat is always a mess. Talk about offending people, if people want to get offended, read the chat. Oh my god!\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> (laughs)\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Oh, this is a ... this a good, uh, question... or something I've always wondered about. Have you, uh... Do you know who Oney is? From Oney Cartoons?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Um, no.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> He's like, uh, an animator who talks about you a lot, uh... or talks about your history more because when people say they talk about Chris Chan, I'm doing that in quotes, uh... or Chris Chan, they think like, uh, you know, that- that guy in <a href=\"/cwcki/2011\" title=\"2011\">2011</a> who wore a striped shirt. But, they really don't, uh... they don't see- they don't see the- the- the actual you, which is the new, you know, the trans lesbian after the transformation into this, uh, into this woman, you know? \n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah.\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> I think it's just cuz, um, people see it as- as- that's like, when they think Chris Chan, they think of that. You know? Do you have any problem with people thinking of you that way?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Um... no because they might not have, uh, been informed about my updates since, uh, as early as, you know, let's say <a href=\"/cwcki/2011\" title=\"2011\">2011</a>...\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> Yeah.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> And uh... and... they just- they just need a little update in their noggins, let them know all this happened. And I am who I am... I still am the person I was, except I'm much happier now.\n</p><p><br/>\n</p><p><br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> good yeah I've noticed that uh it seems the the more happy you are the less uh the less stuff you do online or actually you know that's a weird thing it used to be that way where when you weren't online as much you were you were out doing things and having fun with people now it's like you've you've come to some Crossroad where you realize not everyone is is out to get you and there's people like me or or Meriwether that all want to you know just talk to you and just hear what you have to say and let other people let my audience know what you have to say\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> yeah definitely made a difference was burnt was Barney kind of this year last August uh a lot of people a lot of people who recognize me and they were like just just a whole I was made with a whole lot of sincere kindness and love it was just best weekend ever and and all they wanted to do was talk a little while have a selfie to have a selfie share memory in a moment and that's all and that's always very well and good and I appreciate the kindness very much\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> you gotta you gotta find what's that thing uh Mr Rogers used to say in times of of heartbreak and tragedy look for the people who are there to help because there are in this sea of trolls there are some will you ever go on an only place episode someone just asked me if I would ever go on an Oni plays episode yes I would um\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I'd have to say what what an only place episode plays out before I can answer that question\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font>

color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> good\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> at least until we can uh find a way uh to get these books on this complicated bookstore shelves uh without without sabotage\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> right um so that you're really uh on the up and up because just how I think two years ago or no about three years ago there was a fire in your house and now you're you're turning into an Enterprise almost uh or at least at the very start of one\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> so uh yeah it has far was kind of a life changer I did I had to do a lot of the heavy lifting that after that happened and uh we lost a number of things but fortunately we were able to keep most everything I feel like uh really that fortunate because we got boxes occupying the room or two and we'll get them cleared out eventually\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> eventually yeah it's that's a success story you know I mean not everyone can recover from that um\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> yeah I just kind of feel like uh also I put plain I liked the game like this strange and they released uh episode two for the new before the storm game and at the end of the episode spoiler alerts uh we actually get to go inside Rachel's house and uh I meet her parents and their house is just clean and organize it just look into that I was like somebody like that used to be that clear and organized but nowadays is yeah like Lottery\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> yeah I've now you wouldn't consider yourself a hoarder just a more of a more just cluttered right because I I mean I've I've seen videos of it it there's a lot of stuff but it it's not like there's nothing there's nothing too bad about it it's just just it can be a little messy you know\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> yeah it's not like I've hoarded Ramen out of Christine's eyelids I said forexes let's just put that into thousands\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> yeah\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> like some people did\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> yeah\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I don't know I was definitely referent I was definitely thinking of the Back to the Future video game when I thought that that was episode one episode episode two where oh where Marty won that when the apartment of that old lady who had all the newspapers I'm just saying\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> everyone spammed Kappa in chat someone named Clyde cash donated that's uh that's pretty bad timing uh wow have you heard uh from any of the old old day trolls\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Chad asked about s-o-b-e-r-t-s nothing ask if he has taken him to the vet or at least as far as at least as far as I know I tend to mostly uh I tend to ignore most uh email contacts and uh and spam see a thing I mean I respond to those that respond to some that respond to multiple messages sometimes uh you know now and then uh I'm just not uh solid good on responding to every single person because that's too much\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> too much last I heard uh liquid Chris was like a uh he was researching like cancer cures or something and I'm not even joking transgender woman does that mean that it is a trap kids that hella gay uh I can't answer that for someone so against gay PPL okay but\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> you're talking about liquid Chris\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> yeah his name's uh I think it's like John Duckworth or something he there's a video game yeah there there's a video online of him talking about how he had bone cancer when he was a child and that today he researches it so I you know there's an update I guess on him if people wanted to know what happened to him I don't know about any of the other uh the other kind of uh well-known trolls I have no idea what happened to them but there's something about uh liquid Chris did you ever did you ever talk to liquid Chris\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> uh obvious uh well during the time I ended up doing so yeah Ramon Chris's\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> yeah Pennsylvania that that makes sense because I think in the video there was like snow behind him or something or whatever and whatever I was thinking of um yeah I see really it's kind of weird how the trolls they just they come in and then they go and then I'm sorry Chris for the horrible stuff you've had to go through\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> yeah\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> someone just said I'm sorry uh Christine for the horrible stuff you've had to go through\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> thank you\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> so there are there are people who do care I mean like I said you just gotta find the good and and if someone if someone wrongs you then chances are there's 10 more people that want to help you at least at least that's what I think and I'm pretty much I'm pretty optimistic\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [Music]\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> wow uh interesting so okay someone just asked me a pretty interesting question what does Chris think of sachimo I know you you really you don't know or I'm just I can't assume but I guess you only know just the documentary but have you have you ever heard of me before\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> um yeah not before he had the documentary I heard about the documentary actually around when it originally came out\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> yeah\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> um but as foreign Congratulations by the way\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> thank you thank you uh yeah I just saw that teacher a few days ago he's a pretty pretty good guy he gave me insight into um into not see if if I were to remake it knowing what I know now I would have I would have definitely just kind of put more effort into making it more neutral because there's just some you know it's it's hard to to dance around this but there's just some some things you've done that that you've recorded that you've regretted and me putting those in in the documentary really just uh it was kind of just to do it for other people but if I really wanted to make something neutral I wouldn't have put those in there so I definitely would change a lot um\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I want to think of you as the person I see you as a decent good person\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> thank you thank you that means a lot um because I I don't think I could I could be able to live with myself knowing that I I would have hurt someone you know some someone impacted someone negatively with more than just words because I have no problem with uh making fun of someone who deserves it someone who does something horrible you know I'll make fun of them on my channel but as far as you've done I I don't I can't pinpoint anything and you know that most of it's just reaction to trolls\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> thank you\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> okay is uh you're staying\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> next question\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> oh uh someone uh Meriwether actually messaged me asking what was your favorite anime\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> we just went we did not answer that question normally well I definitely like uh Sailor Moon at South Saga steel Angel kurumi and Nana Nana yeah it's the uh anime where two adult women uh moved to move into an apartment together both named Nana\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> um\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> it's a very good it's a very good series I highly recommend it great story\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> well there you go check out nana I don't watch very many anime or very many anime I don't watch much anime but uh why not you know it\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> yeah you know I don't watch Anna bike but when I do I drink I drink micheloba I did I had to I don't know what I know is those are keys I misremembered the advertisement and I made the joke go wrong\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> it's okay I don't remember that advertisement very well either it was a pretty it was a good one though lose period\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I don't watch many anime but when I do I watch what I like that that's better\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> there we go foreign uh so what do you uh just to kind of throw that question out there because I'm you know just why not uh so what do you do in like your what's your daily ritual you know what do you what do you do when you wake up\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> well nowadays I for when I do end up doing that then I end up hanging out in the bed I don't smoke but it's it's like I'm white it's like I'm Waking and baking again I don't smoke but it's like um like myself up I get my mind I actually get my mind together do a little meditate and uh soon enough after I feel like my brain's fully operational from being asleep for a few for the few hours I get out of bed and uh and I guess and I get something to eat um I got through my I go through what I'm doing for a day uh including drawing writing or covering the pages or depending on how to or whatever depends depending on how I feel um and days are varying except for like Thursdays or and Sundays or on Thursday and evenings are good Pokemon Chris if you could go back in time and stop anything from happening to you what would change usually would stick around at home and uh and uh yeah you know um so then but yeah I do get some answers I do get some walking in to get plenty I'm getting up exercise in and I do dinner have Dukes of cooking here at home uh for my mom and whatnot and definitely before I hit the hay I take a shower every night I took a shower and I put my my turby Twist on and my PJs and hell I put on my nice shirt and I'm already but I'm more and I'm wearing my leggings I'm I'm worn I've worn throughout that they were going to wear it switch them out every other day um and now I go to bed I video on YouTube and I listen to listen to my arrow beats to further my transformation to Womanhood and help uh increase my mental capabilities\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> new transformation into Womanhood\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> yeah\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> so it's continuing it's not it's not already done\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> yeah it's continuing uh and I'm still in transition okay it's like when I fully transformed or had the operations which I'm hoping the transformation does happen first binaural beats happen one one happen in good ways and then you gotta have faith it just depends on how much time it just depends how much time you have available to you and I'm having I believe and I do have faith in uh the binaural beats and the transformation I have seen really positive results are that\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> binaural beats uh I've never heard that what what is a binary beat\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah by narrow Beach there are different frequencies that go want to go one ear and one go on the other earbuds are recommended they meet in the middle of your head and right and then they go into your body from your brain to make the effects happen and there's like a good number of things like uh you can develop your psychic skills among which uh you can even change your eye color and for and definitely things for male to female or female to male transformation on the uh suburbanal frequency hypnosis wizard by narrow Beats channel on YouTube\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> it can change your eye color so but hasn't that already happened to you uh because you have\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> yeah but that but that was a different that was a different occasion now in my freshman year of high school I had pink guy in my right eye and I was prescribed the eye drops to get the pink eye out and something in the medication changed the pigment in my right eye\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> really\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> so it's so it's more green than the original blue it was\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> so it can it can make you or or it can transform you slowly into in into a woman but it can also uh give you psychic powers is\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> yeah there's a whole number of different uh binaural brief speech frequencies that does each one that does each effects yeah it's best to go to the channel I just mentioned the this stuff hwb Beast of mineral frequency hypnosis wizard binaural beats Channel on YouTube\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> and check that out so you do you have psychic powers\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> uh I yes I actually did have I did I have realized and found that I did have psychic powers throughout my lifetime everybody it has at least a little bit of psychic power when they're born and if they are blessed to have tremendous psychic power after they're born and that's a big wowie unicorn Rarity there\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> um so it can like amplify them not not not give them to you but make them refined I guess better\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> yeah refined Stronger Yeah but of course you have to practice them yourself and I definitely would recommend looking at books for developing your psychic skills alongside with that so you can better understand how to use how to use your how to use them from your own to make objects move with your mind with your aura that's the uh pretty much just to that\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> interesting so you've so you you you're not you're slightly psychic is what you're saying so you you can't you can't move things so what what what can you do like what what are the extent of your psychic abilities\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> well I've actually been able to see into the future and into the into the and well into the past uh at least in my dreams I've had many a Deja Vu moments\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> um\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> yeah Deja Vu to set the sensation of doing something that uh you feel like you have done before\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> right so like you you you get Visions saying wait I remember doing this except it didn't happen yet\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> yeah\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> it's interesting so can it can it work can the binary be or not to not to interrupt but can the binaural beats work in the opposite direction can a woman become a man\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> yeah that like yeah like I just mentioned there are frequencies for male to female and female to male Transformations\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> interesting interesting so how long does it take for the the full the full transformation\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> uh well defend you it's definitely one that you want to have patience and belief in globally then before going to keep an open mind you know literally in that sense uh it could take uh up to about six months to a full week to about a year um like more on the more extreme things like that for a woman transformation but my first uh interpretation I got actually worked out for me I increased my brush size from B to D in less than a month by narrow things yeah\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> that's pretty crazy I mean um plastic surgeons giving them a run for their money because that's a lot of a lot of women would pay for that typically\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> yeah this was not this wasn't wholly natural\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> I see I didn't know about this I would assume it would take about 18 years because that's how long it takes for a woman to develop you know so I I would guess it would take 18 in the other direction but in a year that's that's pretty fast you know\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> yep\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> so it's but you're also taking um hormone uh treatment right\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> yes I am on the homo replacement therapy and taking the astrodial and spirometoline and you know how I remember it's spirometoline I remember Spyro the Dragon\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> there you go so how does how does it affected you\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> uh it's affected me in the right direction because I definitely was a female so when I dropped my life and this fashion makes me feel more like more generally myself I felt like uh the testosterone and those kind of things uh that Dario typically would Define a male\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> right\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> that not not all that was me and this and even like uh I go into talking about how the Ravi Sani who came out as a trans woman lesbian trans woman herself uh to figure figure herself out uh she grew up she couldn't understand uh the fascination of boys like in these death explosions and all these crazy things destructive\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> no boys are typically not they're not elegant or fine have finesse like uh a lot of women do so it I mean right so you feel more you feel more you with the the hormone treatment it feels feels uh like yourself you know\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> yeah\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> no so so you've had a gender dysphoria which I'm sure you know what that means right\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> yeah yeah you may say I did have gender dysphoria\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> well everyone who uh transitions they they have it at some point you know because you're questioning is this is this who I am am I really do I really want to be a woman or do I really want to be a man it just kind of it turns into a a big debate in your head and it can really affect people negatively\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> well this was definitely a debate in my head that was an easy win because throughout my lifetime I actually had inclinations of wanting to be a woman including like you know I'd like to be you know I look at myself in the mirror and I could pull my females my female self out or or like you know to switch places with or switch swap bodies with her and you know I've had all I've had all those thoughts before and everything and it's just it was all well good and definitely made me realize for the better my eventual\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> mm-hmm\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> thoughts\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> people in the chat are uh they're criticizing me for not see this was never an interview and people want an interview with there's there's already one with Meriwether you know we're just having this is chatting\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> which is yeah we're just chatting uh what's the narrative yeah we are doing this is a chat type interview\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> uh yeah I mean there's really only because people just want me to say some horrific shit to you honestly they want me to\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> We're not gonna we're not We're not gonna lie horrific shit\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> there you go uh my friend wants to know what's your favorite food what kind of\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> like\n<br/><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Sachumo:</b></font> what kind of stuff do you like\n<br/><font

the best combination to make an Arnold Palmer which is a combination of lemonade and sweet tea it's over at McDonald's between their Minute Maid Light Lemonade one part stacked and then three parts
