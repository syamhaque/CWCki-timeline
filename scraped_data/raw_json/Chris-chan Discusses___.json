Guru Larry is the second big-name fan of CWC, along with animator <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Harry_Partridge\" title=\"Harry Partridge\">Harry Partridge</a>.\n</p><p>While a normal person would see Larry is clearly insulting Chris to his face, Chris's <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">autism</a> prevented him from comprehending Larry's blatant sarcasm. The only thing Chris picked up on was that Larry was using the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulk_and_Skull\" title=\"wikipedia:Bulk and Skull\">Bulk and Skull</a> theme from <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Power_Rangers\" title=\"Power Rangers\">Power Rangers</a></i>, which has negative connotations. This was the second time that Chris gave a public interview.\n</p><p>Chris obviously has no idea whatsoever how to conduct an interview, shifting all of the pressure to Larry and trying to avoid answers which force him to be creative or think a bit, especially in the beginning. He constantly cuts off Larry and has no tact.\n</p><p>For a long time, only selected extracts were available, until Guru Larry released the full interview on 30 <a href=\"/cwcki/August_2012\" title=\"August 2012\">August 2012</a>.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Director's_Cut\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Director's Cut</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Transcript\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Transcript</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Excerpts\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Excerpts</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Preview_(Cumming_Soon...)\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Preview (Cumming Soon...)</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Transcript_2\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Transcript</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Chris-chan_Discusses..._BILLY_MAYS\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris-chan Discusses...

Anyhow, um, okay, we'll talk about the first thing, I don't know if you know about this, um, Microsoft, um, what do you think about their new camera? ...That got out, that you can interact with things.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hmm. Umm... I don't know much about the... Xbox- uh, you're talking about the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Xbox\" title=\"Xbox\">Xbox</a> camera?\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Mmm. Well it's- it's sort of a... they're trying to- it's sort of like, uh, the next level of EyeToy, really, the same thing where you sort of interact with it, so you can watch what you're actually doing in a game, like if you're doing- you're doing a steering wheel, and it can actually copy what you're doing, and that, so I was just wondering if that's- if that would ever interest you into ever purchasing an Xbox, or...\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Mmm. Mmm, yeah, that sounds pretty good. I mean I saw wha-dat- I saw the thing that they did for the, uh, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PlayStation_Eye\" title=\"PlayStation Eye\">PlayStation Eye</a>, with the uh, two six.

Still, they way they uh... shake that candle bit, that's good enough.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Yes. And, uh... Also-uh, what else? uh, what is your opinion on <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Turismo_(series)\" title=\"wikipedia:Gran Turismo (series)\"><i>Gran Turismo</i></a>?

What date was that at the E3?\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> And, uh, it's a pretty good racing game.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Hm. That's good. <i>(the two stutter as they try to decide who speaks first)</i> ...You go first, go on.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Okay, and I still have the, uh, <i>Gran Turismo</i> HD thing that they released before they did-a long time before the, uh, GT5 prologue.

So, what's, uh, what was your views on Nintendo's outshowings this year?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hm. I didn't see much about their take on-about what they did at the E3, because I only had the, uh, what Sony did over at the E3 downloaded from the PlayStation Network...\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> But uh, yeah, you know, whatever Nintendo is doing, uh, you know, they have my support.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Okay.

And it's gonna be four players, so it's gonna be- It's a bit like <i><a href=\"/cwcki/LittleBigPlanet\" title=\"LittleBigPlanet\">LittleBigPlanet</a></i>, and it's gonna be like, you know, four people can play at the same time.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Alright.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> So, what do you-what do you think of that sort of game?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> That sou- that sounds pretty good.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> So yeah, that's coming out later. And they're also bringing out a sequel to <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Galaxy\" title=\"wikipedia:Super Mario Galaxy\"><i>Super Mario Galaxy</i></a>, <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Galaxy_2\" title=\"wikipedia:Super Mario Galaxy 2\"><i>Super Mario Galaxy 2</i></a>.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I've heard of that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> So, yes. Is that- is that- <i>(Chris tries to talk over him and fails)</i> Something that you'll be buying, or...?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I might buy that, I mean, the... I like the <i>Super Mario Galaxy</i> 1. So, <i>Suboio Galaxy 2</i> sounds like something I might, uh, go- I would consider buying. Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Oh, that's good. And, uh, there's <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroid:_Other_M\" title=\"wikipedia:Metroid: Other M\">a new <i>Metroid Prime</i></a>- there's a new <i><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroid\" title=\"wikipedia:Metroid\">Metroid</a></i> game coming out, and it's  made by the people who made <i><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja_Gaiden\" title=\"wikipedia:Ninja Gaiden\">Ninja Gaiden</a></i>, as well, that's coming out.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Huh.

Yeah, it was a bit dry this year, actually, for uh, <a href=\"/cwcki/Nintendo\" title=\"Nintendo\">Nintendo</a>, I mean there wasn't too many announced, I mean, uh, but how about- How about the, umm, the new uh, the new <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Remote\" title=\"wikipedia:Wii Remote\">Wiimote</a>? The uh, the uh, motion controller. What do you think about that?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hmm, yeah, it's a- yeah I think it's pretty good, I mean, gives a more uh, ease of controlling the uh, Wii-the, uh, Wiimote, among other things. Yeah, sounds like a pretty good peripheral.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> You know- you know, I think it's something they should have really put in there in the first place, rather than make us pay a game for something that they left out.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hm.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> So, yeah. And also, um, what do you think about [<i>unintelligible</i>] metal-new <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Metal_Gear\" title=\"Metal Gear\">Metal Gear Solid</a></i> games coming out on <i>Metal Gear</i> games?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Oh, yeah, I like- Oh yeah, I'm a- yeah, those like, yeah, the <i>Metal Gear Solid</i> games, yeah, those are- yeah, they sound, uh, pretty good, especially the uh, I mean the- I mean, I mostly heard about the Peacemaker, they're doing for <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PSP\" title=\"PSP\">PSP</a>-\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Alright.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> -Sounds better than-it sounds better than what they did previously on the previous, uh, <i>Metal Gear Solid</i> games for the PSP.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Ah. So you did buy the, uh, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Playstation_3\" title=\"Playstation 3\">Playstation 3</a> version, then? <i>{{w|Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots|Metal Gear Solid 4]]</i>?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uhhhhh, not-not yet, but I'm planning to.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Oh, that's good. So yes... Uh, what else can we talk about then, uh, for E3? Um... how about uh, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonic\" title=\"Sonic\">Sonic</a> games? Have you, um, there hasn't been much in the way of new... [<i>unintelligible</i>] Sonic games released, so...\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Oh, yeah, I mean- I mean I know they're doing the, uh, that a new <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Rally\" title=\"wikipedia:Sega Rally\"><i>Sega Rally</i></a> race for... Yeah, <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_%26_Sega_All-Stars_Racing\" title=\"wikipedia:Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing\">Sega Super Stars Racing</a>.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Oh, yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> And Sonic and Tails get their car. Get cars. It's pretty mu-it's pretty much, uh, I mean, I feel like it's- like, uh, <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Drift\" title=\"wikipedia:Sonic Drift\"><i>Sonic Drift</i></a> and <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Drift#Sonic_Drift_2\" title=\"wikipedia:Sonic Drift\"><i>Sonic Drift 2</i></a> get an upgrade for next generation, and, uh, I like it.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Do you think Sonic actually needs a car, being if he runs so fast?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Heh. No, I don't think he needs the car, but it's like, you know, it's a, it's a car racing game, so it just makes it m- it just makes it more appropriate. I mean, they gave him- I mean, I mean in <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_R\" title=\"wikipedia:Sonic R\"><i>Sonic R</i></a>, they gave him a chance to race against, uh, vehicles in <i>Sonic R</i>, that was fun.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Hm. Yes, that's- I did actually like <i>Sonic R</i>. I must admit, I do enjoy the music in that game. <i>(Sings the first verse from the game's theme song)</i><br/>\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. Yep.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> So yes, did uh, did you own- you owned a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/List_of_Chris%27s_games#Sega_Saturn\" title=\"List of Chris's games\">Saturn</a>, uh, do you still got one?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I'm sorry, what?\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> I said, you- you owned a Saturn as well, don't you? So you must've, you must own <i>Sonic R</i>.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. I do.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Oh, that's good. So yes... also, uhh... ano- another thing a lot of people have been asking me to te- ask this. Uh, what do you think of the voice actors for <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog\" title=\"Sonic the Hedgehog\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>? [<i>pause</i>] I mean there's- I must say there's- there's somebody out there on <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/The_Internet\" title=\"The Internet\">the Internet</a> who's uh, very opposed to, uh, <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Griffith_(voice_actor)\" title=\"wikipedia:Jason Griffith (voice actor)\">Jason Griffith</a>. Uh, doing the voice of Sonic the Hedgehog. What do you think about that? You bothered with the voice?\n</p><p>(<i>Chris strokes his chin thoughtfully.</i>)\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Y- I pretty much like the- uh, original voice they've been going with this whole time. Uhh... changing it, uhh... would be uh, I don't know- I don't know if it- well it depends, I would have to compare the new voice and compare it to the old voice to - um, make an opinion. Although I will s- although I will say this. In comparison to the animated series, y'know, where they had the- uh, <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaleel_White\" title=\"wikipedia:Jaleel White\">kid who was Urkel</a> originally voicing Sonic the Hedgehog... versus uh... what- who they have for <i><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_X\" title=\"wikipedia:Sonic X\">Sonic X</a></i> and the video games... uhh.. I'd say- I'd say the newer voi- I'd say the newer guy does it much better.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Ah.. No. There's uh- There's uh, two guys doi- uh, there was the guy doing it in <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Adventure\" title=\"wikipedia:Sonic Adventure\"><i>Sonic Adventure</i></a> and <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Heroes\" title=\"wikipedia:Sonic Heroes\"><i>Sonic Heroes</i></a>, it was a guy called <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Drummond\" title=\"wikipedia:Ryan Drummond\">Ryan Drummond</a>. But then they- uh, they fired him because he couldn't make it to New York. They hired this guy called <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Griffith_(voice_actor)\" title=\"wikipedia:Jason Griffith (voice actor)\">Jason Griffith</a>, and they uh-\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>speaking over</i>] Oh, that's too bad.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> So yes. So yeah, basically, uh, everything you hear now at the moment is Jason Griffith, and I was just wondering if you thought- y'know- If you notice any difference?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hmmm. I didn't really notice a difference.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font>  Oh that's good. So you- yeah. So... you reckon that someone made uh- started making... per- petitions to uh, have him fired and that, is a bit over the top?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hmm.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> I mean, would y- would you say that's going a bit far or...\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uhhhmm... yeah, probably. Sounds like it was going a bit far, yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Oh that's good. So yes. So th- It's a- It's a guy called, uh, <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://encyclopediadramatica.rs/Spax3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spax3</a>. Have you ever heard of him?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uhhnn... I'm sorry... uhh... dax three?\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Spax. S-P-A-X. 3.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Oh! Spax... uhh... no, I've never heard of that one.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Ah. Yes, it's a guy, yes. He's not a very nice person. He uhm, he uh... he actually has fantasies about <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Sonic_the_Hedgehog_video_game_characters#Cream_the_Rabbit\" title=\"wikipedia:List of Sonic the Hedgehog video game characters\">Cream the Rabbit</a> as well, don't know if you know about that.\n</p><p>(<i>Chris's eyes bug out and start to dart around the room</i>)\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Ohhh...[pause]...oh... huh. [<i>another pause</i>] Uhm, is this- is this like a villain character, this Spax?\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> No! No, no! He's a- He's a real person. He's a real person. Uh, he- uh, he- uh, doesn't like people saying that. That, he- uh... likes... rabbits. He gets very upset about it. Yeah, he says he has uhh... y'know, there's a big thing on- loads of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Troll\" title=\"Troll\">trolls</a> on <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/ED\" title=\"ED\">ED</a> who want to keep saying that he likes having sex with a rabbit.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Huh...\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> He wants to have sex with a six-year old rabbit. So. So, do you- do you find that disgusting at all?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Mmm... Well, I mean, that's his decision but I personally do not promote <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_sex#Bestiality\" title=\"Chris and sex\">bestiality</a>, as a matter of fact, I'm against it, and <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_religion\" title=\"Chris and religion\">the Bible</a> is against it, so uh... I- y'know uhh... he has his opinions, and he has his rights to his own opinions but personally, I'm against it.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Even if they're half-human?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> ...Uh... even if...?\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> I mean, 'cause they're like, Sonic the Hedgehog, he's- he's sort of half-human, he's not like a proper hedgehog, he's like half-human. He's got two legs and stuff, so.. does that SORT OF count?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uhhmm... uhhh... I don't there is, uhh... any hu- any half-human there... uhh... Yeah, I'd still say he's uh... all-animal. I'd still say they're all-animals. They just been given-uh... human form... it's not necessarily making them \"half-human\".\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> No. So, so- uhhh... So you wouldn't say there's any human in Sonichu or anything, either then? When he's, uh, completely a <a href=\"/cwcki/Electric_Hedgehog_Pok%C3%A9mon\" title=\"Electric Hedgehog Pokémon\">Hedgehog Pokémon</a>. Or there's no, other way 'round it... even though he stands on two legs?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> ...Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> And-uh, also, uh, how about, uh, we'll go back to gaming now, actually, so uh, uh, what else can we think of, uh, how about, yeah. Are you uh, are you buying a new <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DSi\" title=\"wikipedia:Nintendo DSi\">DSi</a>? Or have you bought one already?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uh, I'm thinking 'bout buying one. It's pretty-it sounds pretty good, it's got like uh, like, it's own built-in camera, it's good for on-the-go [<i>unintelligible</i>]-thinking.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> It's got two cameras. It's got two cameras. It's got two-\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Okay.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Yeah, it's got two cameras. One you can film yourself, one you can film other people. And it's also got, like, uh, it's like a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Wii\" title=\"Wii\">Wii</a>, as well, it's like, you got like a Wii shop where you can buy DS games on there. So far.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. Yeah, no, it's uh, it's too bad that the- Yeah, it's too bad, though, they took away the uh, GBA slot, so it's like, you could not play- you could not play <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/GBA\" title=\"GBA\">GBA</a> games, or, uh, even the <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Guitar_Hero\" title=\"Guitar Hero\">Guitar Hero</a></i> on there.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> No. Uh, I think they do that because, uh, basically, they, they think they might- do they make GBA games anymore? Can you still buy them new?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Sometimes, yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Of course. That's good. So yes. So uh, yes, so what do you think about the future of gaming, what would-what would you think is the next big thing in gaming? What I mean-what would you like to see in effect?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> <i>(coughing fit)</i> Excuse me.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Is that <a href=\"/cwcki/April_16_Fetish_Vids\" title=\"April 16 Fetish Vids\">Fanta</a>?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> No. <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_beer\" title=\"wikipedia:Root beer\">Root beer</a>. (<i>Chris says this with a slight tone of malice.</i>)\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Okay. Has it got <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Alcohol\" title=\"Alcohol\">alcohol</a> in it?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I'm sorry, what?\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> I said, has that got alcohol in it?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> No, root beer does not have alcohol in it.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Oh, that's good.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I mean, it's a soda pop.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Oh, okay. No, I think- I think that it has alcohol in it if you're in Germany. They have alcohol in lots of stuff. You can now- you can buy alcohol from <a href=\"/cwcki/McDonald%27s\" title=\"McDonald's\">McDonald's</a> in Germany.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Huh.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Yes. So you can have a <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Mac\" title=\"wikipedia:Big Mac\">Big Mac</a> and a beer. Stuff and all that.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Okay. Um...\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Ah yes, interesting fact.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Um... Yeah. Might talk to <a href=\"/cwcki/The_Wallflower\" title=\"The Wallflower\">Damien</a> about a thing like that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Yes.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> My sweet thang. Mmm... Umm... Yeah, I definitely um, would like to see... Yeah. Um, a little-A little bit more motion sensor control actions in like, <a href=\"/cwcki/PlayStation_3\" title=\"PlayStation 3\">PlayStation 3</a> games, I mean like, I mean like in <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Velocity_Bowling\" title=\"wikipedia:High Velocity Bowling\"><i>High Velocity Bowling</i></a>, they did pretty good with y-using the- taking the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3_accessories#Sixaxis\" title=\"wikipedia:PlayStation 3 accessories\">Sixaxis controller</a>, and uh, and then this, and then you make like, like that's a bowling ball, and you're throwing that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I'd like to see more, uh, stuff like that in the PlayStation 3, cause then that would give them, like, an edge, er, uh, against the, I mean, um the competition with <a href=\"/cwcki/Nintendo\" title=\"Nintendo\">Nintendo</a>, with the motion sensors and the Wiimote and <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Remote#Nunchuk\" title=\"wikipedia:Wii Remote\">Nunchuk</a>.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> You don't think this, uh, this controller they're bringing out is trying to compete with the Wiimote, then? The one with the lollipop at the end?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. [<i>cough</i>] Yeah, I figure that's a fair-it's a fair competition. I mean, like, you know, final version, yeah, they should definitely do something like, you know... You know, it doesn't look all that similar, but, you know, it has all the buttons of the Sixaxis on it as well, yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Ah, that's good. Is that-is that something you'll be getting?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Do you reckon they'll have-probably use it for <i><a href=\"/cwcki/LittleBigPlanet\" title=\"LittleBigPlanet\">LittleBigPlanet</a> 2</i>, or something, or...?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Oh, that's good. So yes. And, uh, you're no- you're not into PC gaming at all or anything, are you?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I'm not into PC gaming.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> I know, so what do you think of the announcement that s- uh, that <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Xbox\" title=\"Xbox\">Xbox</a> Live might be free soon as well, that they're... the only thing you can do is uh, they put adverts on the [<i>unintelligible']</i>\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> <i>(talking over)</i> Oh, really? Oh, really, they're gonna make that free?\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Well that- they say that, the trade-off's that you'll have to watch some adverts on the main screen, that's it. I mean, would you, would you get an Xbox, would you get on on Xbox Live if it was free, but you had to watch a couple adverts?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, probably.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> And you can actually finally play <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo:_Combat_Evolved\" title=\"wikipedia:Halo: Combat Evolved\"><i>Halo</i></a> as well then, sorta get into that. What do you play online at the moment, apart from life? PlayStation home, I mean.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Mmm... yeah, yeah probably.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Okay. Um. No, I mean what are you into at the moment in online gaming, I mean what sort of games do you play?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Um, like online, uh, I like playing <i>LittleBigPlanet' online, uh, among other game titles, I can't remember the names of them. I can't remember the names at the moment.</i>\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Ok.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> That's that would be uh, that's a lot for me to think about though, yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Ok uh, did you buy <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Ghostbusters\" title=\"Ghostbusters\">Ghostbusters</a></i> as well?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uh no I didn't get that yet, but yeah but I like what I've seen so far, if they release a demo then I would download that...\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> If I don't buy the game first...\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> So what was the last game you bought?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uh, yeah, last game I bought... which one was that [<i>coughs a bit</i>] yeah I bought the new <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Transformers\" title=\"Transformers\"><i>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen</i> (video game)</a>, that was pretty good.</i>\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Oh, that's good.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah I like and I've seen and I saw the movie last Wednesday and I thought it was awesome. I don't care what the critics- how the critics put it down... I thought it was a very fun movie and it did have a good story to it and I enjoyed the story.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> That's good. Yes there's enough-\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I mean you know, critics will be critics... I mean like you know some of 'em get paid to praise it and some of 'em get paid to haze it, and you know I just think like you know in general I don't care for those who haze it. I mean, I mean like you know, <a href=\"/cwcki/Transformers\" title=\"Transformers\">Transformers</a> has been uh ve-, has been uh very good and they have their own history, especially in <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers:_Generation_1\" title=\"wikipedia:Transformers: Generation 1\">generation one</a>, you know in generation one they had some humor, and uh, whatnot, in uh, in the characters and in the story, so I'm thinking so I'm feeling like uh the uh movie is very much following that theme, and I think I think <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bay\" title=\"wikipedia:Michael Bay\">Michael Bay</a> is doing a good job with that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> So yes, <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimus_Prime\" title=\"wikipedia:Optimus Prime\">Optimus Prime</a> did die in <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers:_Revenge_of_the_Fallen\" title=\"wikipedia:Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen\">the second one</a> then?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, he died but yeah [<i>clears throat</i>] but they brought him back to life shortly enough with the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_of_Leadership\" title=\"wikipedia:Matrix of Leadership\">Matrix of Leadership</a>.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Yeah, that's good because you don't want any kids to lock themselves in their rooms for several days, and all that...\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, yeah, especially like you know in the generation one, they brought him back to life episodes later in the two part episode.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>fake-sounding cough</i>] Excuse me. I got a frog in my throat! He's using my tonsils for a lily pad!\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Oh dear!

I thought we had a bit of a ruckus at a wedding or something.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> No, no, did not have a ruckus at the wedding. It was a nice wedding.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Oh I see. What sort of wedding was it?

Uh, yeah, but it's just, y'know, I think, uh, couple of, I think uh, I'd like to address a couple more <i>LittleBigPlanet</i> issues.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Okay.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, let's see, we talked about linki- linking up with- between the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PSP\" title=\"PSP\">PSP</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PS3\" title=\"PS3\">PS3</a> versions... With the copying the costumes and the stickers and all that... Mmmm... See, it's like... <a href=\"/cwcki/Butt_garments\" title=\"Butt garments\">Expandable</a> memory usage, for like, y'know, y'know, people are just gonna <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">continue collecting the objects</a> from the custom levels And uh, creating their own levels, but it's like, y'know, you keep on go- you keep on creating and collecting and like, you g- it's not- it's- you collect too much, and then uh, you won't be able to save your profile. Uh, on your, on your, on your hard drive. I'd like to see, like, y'know, like expandable memory, like, y'know uh, it, like, it grows as you collect, the memory?\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, so, yeah, I'd like to see that. And, uh, also, another thing I'd like to see - a soundtrack to uh, music on <i>LittleBigPlanet</i>, cause it's good music.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> I think it's all licensed and it'd be pretty hard to-\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> <i>(cuts in)</i> Pretty good music, I'd like to, uh, see it...\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Yeah, a lot of it is licensed, that might be a bit hard.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I liked it. Yeah, especially uh, also the uh... Heh. I mean, like, y'know, I guess, y'know, people probably pirate the uh, one song that put the game in the question that delayed it's release by a week or two. Remember that?\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Oh. Yeah, it actually got released in Britain with that... My copy had it on.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> ...Heh.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> It's actually on the disc- It's actually, the song is actually on the disc, but they released a patch to remove it.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. I've heard about that, yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> So if you got rid of that patch... If you got rid of that patch you could actually listen to it.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, yeah I know, I've heard- I've heard about that, but... Still, I mean, like, y'know, game soundtrack would be good. Yeah, even, like, y'know, if they released it in the PlayStation Store, like they did with soundtrack to, uh, <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PixelJunk_Monsters\" title=\"wikipedia:PixelJunk Monsters\"><i>PixelJunk Monsters</i></a>.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> And then put that up for sale, yeah, I would, uh, definitely pay, like, ten, twelve bucks to, uh, download those tracks.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> That much, eh? So yeah. So what would you...\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> What would you like to have included into <i>LittleBigPlanet</i> in future. I mean, what sort of, uh, characters and designs and stuff?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I- I mean, like, y'know, I liked what they're doing about the uh- What they talked about at E3, uh, doing Disney characters? But I'd like to see... <a href=\"/cwcki/Transformers\" title=\"Transformers\">Transformers</a>. Like, y'know, Me- like for y'know, <a href=\"/cwcki/Optimus_Prime\" title=\"Optimus Prime\">Optimus Prime</a>, <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumblebee_(Transformers)\" title=\"wikipedia:Bumblebee (Transformers)\">Bumblebee</a>, <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starscream\" title=\"wikipedia:Starscream\">Starscream</a> and <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megatron\" title=\"wikipedia:Megatron\">Megatron</a> or even, like, <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundwave_(Transformers)\" title=\"wikipedia:Soundwave (Transformers)\">Soundwave</a> from Generation 1, that'd be cool.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Yes. I agree.\n</p><p><br/><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Make it even, like, y'know,two sets of costumes, y'know, one from Generation 1 and one for the movie.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Hm.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> And a whole buncha stickers!\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Ah.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> That- That'd be awesome.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Yes, it would be then, yes. Also, uh, oh, another thing about <a href=\"/cwcki/Sony\" title=\"Sony\">Sony</a>, what do you think about the new <i><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_of_the_Colossus\" title=\"wikipedia:Shadow of the Colossus\">Shadow of the Colossus</a></i>  game coming out?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Oh yeah, I've heard about that. Yes. Yeah, yeah it sounds pretty good.\n(<i>Larry attempts to talk but is shot down</i>)\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, yeah, yeah I saw I- yeah, I saw the, uh, I saw the, uh, stuff about <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Guardian\" title=\"wikipedia:The Last Guardian\"><i>The Last Guardian</i></a>, yeah. It looks pretty good.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Oh, that's nice. (<i>He is once again interrupted</i>)\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, well also there's also [<i>incoherent</i>] <i><a href=\"/cwcki/LittleBigPlanet\" title=\"LittleBigPlanet\">LittleBigPlanet</a></i>, <i>Little Big Pla</i>- I played the, uh, the uh, <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Ico\" title=\"wikipedia:Team Ico\">Ico</a> level, I don't know if you uh, played that or not, but, you know, it's go- it goes really in-depth, it's got, uh, you know, you can't, uh, win it, you don't get a prize for anything yet, because, you know, the- you know, the game where you have to pass the way to move on.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I mean, it's a level that- yeah. You know, I think you know what I'm talking about, but you drag the lil- but you drag the lil, but you drag the uh, glass sword along with you, and you, uh, play along with this, uh, glass sword... that you have to wield in order to defeat the witch at the end. Yeah, th-that's I-I-I would like that level, a lot of people did too, it's like, possibly one of the, uh, greatest levels anyone's ever created on <i>LittleBigPlanet</i>.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Oh. That's good. (<i>Larry's sentence is interrupted by Chris's violent coughing.</i>) What do you think of this notion that you may have to pay for some levels on LittleBigPlanet as well, they announced that at the beginning, would you ever pay for any, or...?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uh, I'm sorry, what was the question?\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> I s- uh, at the bit- when a little bit of panic when it first came out, they said that some people are really good at le- at levels and they might charge for them, so I don't know if you'd ever be prepared to pay for any.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Mmm. Uh, yeah, uh, yeah that does not sound- that does not sound good to me, uh, it should continue to be free.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Even if it was for a dollar or something, like a dollar or something...?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Mmm. Uh, yeah, I would disagree with that. It does not sound good to me, I mean playing a level- for uh, paying a dollar to play a level that I cou- that I could previously could play for free, yeah, charging to play a level, tha- ju- that's not good. That's not good.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> That's not cool. So what do you think- (<i>Chris's coughing interrupts him again.</i>) Uh, so would you ever charge for a <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a> level, if there was a Sonichu level, would you charge for a Sonichu level, or would you let people have it for free?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uh, yeah, I mean, like, I'd let them- yeah, I would say, uh, let 'em play for free, yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Yes, then you could spread the love of Sonichu to the world.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> So uh, what are your plans at the moment in terms of Sonichu, what are you working on at the moment?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I'm working on some more comic pages, and, uh, som- a little something for <i>BigPlanet</i>. Yeah, I-go-I gotta lot going on in my noodle here. The wheels are turning, and uh, inspiration comes and goes. But, it's be- its be-\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> You should write them down, you should write them down before you forget.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I write them down.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Oh, that's good. Always have a notepad handy.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yep.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> So yeah, you can't- you can't give any sort of secrets or anything that might be big happening in the Sonichu world?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Well, I'll say- I'll say this one thing, <a href=\"/cwcki/Son-Chu\" title=\"Son-Chu\">my car</a> is an autobot.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Oh! Wow. Is it- is it definitely a good one, or a <a href=\"/cwcki/Transformers\" title=\"Transformers\">Decepticon</a>? \n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Oh come on, I just sa- I said it was an autobot.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Oh, that's good. Cause you're on the side of good aren't you?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> So, yes.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Yes, that's good. Umm, so what else are we gonna talk about, as well as, umm, so what- is <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">Clyde Cash</a> going to be involved in <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\">your comic</a> anymore, now that he's dead?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uh... oh. No, no, no, no. No. No, I don't think that, uh, he's gonna be anywhere in my comics.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> So his- his image won't defile your pencil with his vile facial features.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Oh, that's good. Uh, is uh, are you gonna be announcing <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Billy_Mays\" title=\"Billy Mays\">Billy Mays</a>' death in your comic as well or anything, or...?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Oh... oh yeah, well lemme just, uh, I mean, I've already uploaded a video onto youtube but lemme just say that once again, I neve- he never was the mayor of <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a>, when I made that segment(?) on the <a href=\"/cwcki/YouTube\" title=\"YouTube\">YouTube</a>, I was blackmailed into doing that by, uh, the uh, quote-unquote <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Julie\" title=\"Julie\">Julie</a> [<i>inaudible</i>] a little thirteen-year-old brat, so I was lying out my ass when I said that.\n</p><p><br/>\n<font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Ah.  Yes-\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> So I've been- So I've always been the Mayor of CWCville and I still am. There's no question about it.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Now it was- it was quite hard to tell if you were lying or not, 'cause then we couldn't see if you were holding Optimus Prime, so... if it was on video, we would have noticed right away you was lying...\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> (coughs) Well, yeah, well, I was lying right out of my ass when I said- when I said that, um, that I was a... <i>homosexual</i>... lyin' out my ass when I said that, when everyone knows I'm damn straight.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Yes, of course! You're indeed a fine role model for us heterosexuals!\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> (visibly hesitates) ... Yeah.  Thank you.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> You're welcome. ... So, um... yes... what else... anything else that you'd like to announce, like...? (mumbles things to announce)\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uh... no, I don't think so, not at the moment.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Any sort of, uh, announcements for trolls, or anything -- just to get rid of them -- disgusting, vile people! (Chris starts to speak) I <i>HATE</i> them! I wish cancer on them!\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, well, I'd say, well- very much down with the, uh, ED website, and, uh, I'd tell the trolls -- just leave me alone.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Yeah... that's good, yes... you should, you should, they should... ere they feel your wrath!\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> (hesitates again) ...yeah...\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> And what's happening with your Wikipedia page, as well, how's that developing?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uh, yeah, it's coming along. Uh, one day- one day at a time, one upload at a time... I'm workin' on it.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> That's good... what do you think about people saying that you have to have it notable, [<i>unintelligible</i>] proof, rather than just 'cause you said it?  That's the bane of Wikipedia.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> (coughs) I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand the question.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> (speaks up) I said, a lot of things, a lot of times, on Wikipedia, you have to make it noteworthy... you know, you have to find proof of what you say is true.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Oh, yeah-\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Have to, uh, walk around that.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Mmmm. (strokes chin) I would say, uh... go with the word of faith.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Yes. (pauses) Yes, very wise-\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I mean, uh, it's like, you know, you find out Wikipedia, you know it's true, like you know, I read in the, I read the announcement video about Billy Mays, about, well, I quoted Wikipedia about Billy's cause of death, which was basically something like a heart attack.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p>(Chris and Larry talk over each other for a moment.)\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> You do know that he was involved in a plane crash the day before, as well.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Oh...\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Yes.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yes, I suppose that would put a lot of stress, then... to, uh, further induce the heart attack, yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> So, yes, uh... that could be... you weren't, you weren't flying the plane, though, we'll get that straight, were you flying the plane?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I was not- Yeah, I was not flying the plane, I was in Red Oak with my mother and my relatives.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Okay... okay, so you've got no ulterior motive towards his-\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I have no ulterior motives. I want to- in fact, I forgot to say this in the video: \"I have often confused <a href=\"/cwcki/BILLY_MAYS\" title=\"BILLY MAYS\">Billy Mays</a> with Richard Karn from <i>Home Improvement</i>, 'cause they both look and act- both looked, acted and sounded alike.\"\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> You mean they're both fat and got a beard?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uh... no... I'm talking about the- you know, aside from the beard, like you know the other facial features,  and the voice... I just often confused, uh, Billy with- with Richard Karn.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Yeah, I often confuse people with fictional characters as well, so... It's- it is quite easy to do. So, uh-\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> So what- what do you think of the people calling for, uh, <a href=\"/cwcki/Adam_Stackhouse\" title=\"Adam Stackhouse\">Adam Stackhouse</a> to be the new mayor of CWCville, as well?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uh. No, no, no, no. I'm still Mayor of CWCville, there is no elections. I mean, that's just a whole bunch of, uh, rumors on the internet, that the, uh, trolls are, uh, just talking amongst themselves... <i>(Short pause)</i> Uh, just do not believe anything that comes from the trolls...\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Okay.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> It's all just a bunch of, uh, rumors- all bunch of false rumors and lies. \n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> <i>(Nods)</i>\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> <i>(Short pause before Chris coughs into the camera)</i>\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Ah-\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, excuse me, I've come down with a bit of a bug in my throat.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Ah.

Uh, what do you think of the voice actors for Sonic the Hedgehog? [Pause] I mean there's- I must say there's- there's somebody out there on the Internet who's uh, very opposed to, uh, Jason Griffith. Uh, doing the voice of Sonic the Hedgehog. What do you think about that? You bothered with the voice?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Mmm... Y- I pretty much like the- uh, original voice they've been going with this whole time. Uhh... changing it, uhh... would be uh, I don't know- I don't know if it- well it depends, I would have to compare the new voice and compare it to the old voice to - um, make an opinion. Although I will say this. In comparison to the animated series, y'know, where they had the- uh, <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaleel_White\" title=\"wikipedia:Jaleel White\">kid who was Urkel</a> originally voicing Sonic the Hedgehog... versus uh... what- who they have for <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_X\" title=\"wikipedia:Sonic X\">Sonic X</a> and the video games... uhh... I'd say- I'd say the newer voi- I'd say the newer guy does it much better.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Ah... No. There's uh- There's uh, two guys doi- uh, there was the guy doing it in <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Adventure\" title=\"wikipedia:Sonic Adventure\"><i>Sonic Adventure</i></a> and <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Heroes\" title=\"wikipedia:Sonic Heroes\"><i>Sonic Heroes</i></a>, it was a guy called <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Drummond\" title=\"wikipedia:Ryan Drummond\">Ryan Drummond</a>. And they- uh, they fired him because he couldn't make it to New York. They hired this guy called <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Griffith\" title=\"wikipedia:Jason Griffith\">Jason Griffith</a>, and they uh-\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [speaking over] Oh, that's too bad.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> So yes. So yeah, basically, uh, everything you hear now is Jason Griffith, and I was just wondering if you thought- y'know- If you notice any difference?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hmmm. I didn't really notice a difference.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Oh that's good. So you- yeah. So... you reckon that someone made uh- started making... per- petitions to uh, have him fired and that, is a bit over the top?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hmm.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> I mean, would y- would you say that's going a bit far or...\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uhhhmm... yeah, probably. Sounds like it was going a bit far, yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Oh that's good. So yes. So th- It's a- It's a guy called, uh, Spax3.

He uhm, he uh... he actually has fantasies about <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream_the_Rabbit\" title=\"wikipedia:Cream the Rabbit\">Cream the Rabbit</a> as well, don't know if you know about that.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Ohhh...[pause]...oh... huh.[another pause] Uhm, is this- is this like a villain character, this Spax?\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> [Speaking over] No! No, no! He's a- He's a real person. He's a real person. Uh, he- uh, he- uh, doesn't like people saying that. That, he- uh... likes... rabbits. He gets very upset about it. Yeah, he says he has uhh... y'know, there's a big thing on- loads of trolls on <a href=\"/cwcki/Encyclopedia_Dramatica\" title=\"Encyclopedia Dramatica\">ED</a> who want to keep saying that he likes having sex with a rabbit.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Huh...\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> He wants to have sex with a six-year old rabbit.

Well, that's his decision but I personally <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_and_Rosechu%27s_Luv_Shack\" title=\"Sonichu and Rosechu's Luv Shack\">do not promote bestiality</a>, as a matter of fact, I'm against it, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Religion\" title=\"Religion\">and the bible is against it</a>, so uh... I- Y'know uhh... he has his opinions, and he has his rights to his own opinions but personally, I'm against it.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Even if they're half-human?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [Pause] Uh... even if...?\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> I mean, 'cause they're like, Sonic the Hedgehog, he's- he's sort of half-human, he's not like a proper hedgehog, he's like half-human.

I don't there is, uhh... any hu- any half-human there... uhh... \n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I'd still say he's uh... ALL-ANIMAL. I'd still say they're all-animals. They just been given-uh... human form... it's not necessarily making them \"half-human\".\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> No. So, so- uhhh... So you wouldn't say there's any human in <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a> or anything, either then? When he's, uh, completely a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Hedgehog_Pok%C3%A9mon\" title=\"Hedgehog Pokémon\">Hedgehog Pokémon</a>.

I mean like you know some of 'em get paid to praise it and some of 'em get paid to haze it, and you know I just think like you know in general I don't care for those who haze it. I mean, I mean like you know, Transformers has been uh ve-, has been uh very good and they have their own history, especially in generation one, you know in generation one they had some humor, and uh, whatnot, in uh, in the characters and in the story, so I'm thinking so I'm feeling like uh the uh movie is very much following that theme and I think I think Michael Bay is doing a good job with that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> So yes, Optimus Prime did die in the second one then?\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, he died but yeah [clears throat] but they brought him back to life shortly enough with the Matrix of Leadership.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Yeah, that's good because you don't want any kids to lock themselves in their rooms for several days, and all that...\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, yeah, especially like you know in the generation one, they brought him back to life episodes later in the two part episode.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009900\"><b>Larry:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"blue\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [Fake sounding cough] excuse me.
