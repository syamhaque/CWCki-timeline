My real name is <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Junior_Jenkins\" title=\"Junior Jenkins\">Junior Jenkins</a> (Scooby-Doo was the inspiration behind the \"Jinkies\"). LOL. I had a <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris%27s_birthday\" title=\"Chris's birthday\">birthday</a> recently on the 16th of July, so now I'm 15. I couldn't celebrate it with my friends like I would have wanted to, because I was hitchhiking my way to <a href=\"/cwcki/Ruckersville,_VA\" title=\"Ruckersville, VA\">Ruckersville</a> from Boston. I'm crashing at a house where I have some relatives there (They're the fucking Black Sheep of the family, and they're not close within the same house. It is cool, because they won't rat me out to my parents and siblings. Like I need another damn minute with those assholes who overlook me). And a better part, their house is across the street from <a href=\"/cwcki/14_Branchland_Court\" title=\"14 Branchland Court\">Chrissy's house</a>. Sadly, though, the blinds to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris%27s_room\" title=\"Chris's room\">his bedroom</a> are always closed, but I still get some sights of him and the family out of their house. \n</p><p>I've arrived at my new home a few days ago on the 20th. I'll be spending my Sophmore year and so on in Greene County's High School. I promised I'd write to my gal back in Boston, but what happens here she doesn't have to know. <a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Emot-dong.gif\"><img alt=\"Emot-dong.gif\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"15\" src=\"/w/images/5/51/Emot-dong.gif\" width=\"30\"/></a> I'll have to make some new friends come September, but I'll be cool; I'm a stud! \n</p><p>I'll also miss my favorite duo of dudes, Jerry and Dino. They taught me the ropes of high school life; they both were 16. I looked up to them (like I would have for <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Carol_Chandler\" title=\"Carol Chandler\">my older sister</a> if she wasn't such a fuckin' cunt). They were a <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">gay</a> couple, and they respected me as a friend only. I made it my Final Realization I was not gay with the help of Jerry and my <a href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart\" title=\"Sweetheart\">girlfriend</a>, Lisa. Sweet little whore took me in with gratitude on my 14th birthday. She had a few exes from <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Middle_School\" title=\"Middle School\">Middle School</a>, and her mom was a Bondage Queen. \n</p><p>Before then, I had a gay experience in Summer Camp when I was 7. My bunkmates were experimenting, and made me their mo-fo unwilling guinea pig. I was blindfolded during the whole thing, feeling an 8-year old's <a href=\"/cwcki/Pickle\" title=\"Pickle\">dick</a> up my ass. I was not thrilled from the ordeal. But <a href=\"/cwcki/January_2010\" title=\"January 2010\">last January</a>, I became curious from the recalling of the feeling, so I asked Jerry to show me a night. At first it was neutral, then he made out with me; his breath was minty with a hint of garlic from something he ate; it was cool with me. Then he told me to suck his dick, and I did; the taste and sight did not thrill me. And he sucked <a href=\"/cwcki/Duck\" title=\"Duck\">mine</a>. He got a rise out of me, but then I started to feel uneasy. It was minor at first, and I promised myself I'd see this through. Finally, he was in me doggy style. As he humped me, I was feeling it both in my penis, and in my gut; worsening as he went on. And eventually, I embarrassed myself grossly. I came AND fucking threw up simultaneously. Jerry had not come yet himself, and out of respect, he withdrew himself and asked me if I was okay. He cleaned me, and my mess on his floor up. I felt soo damn ashamed, but Jerry was kind and understanding to me. And it was then I confirmed it for myself that I was not gay, and Jerry and Dino agreed with me. So with that, I was able to move forward feeling more confident in my orientation. <a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Emot-spergin.png\"><img alt=\"Emot-spergin.png\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"25\" src=\"/w/images/9/9f/Emot-spergin.png\" width=\"20\"/></a>\n</p><p>Anyway, after moving here, I have studied the times of exits and entries from the Chandler Chateau, looking for a pattern.

Although, I did mess up the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Cats\" title=\"Cats\">cats</a> a bit by stepping on their paws; the scratches and bites were worth it. All of the doors were locked (big surprise). Their garden was a big jungle (only half my height, though; about 2 feet high max). I found no incriminating evidence in their garbage.\n<p>But recently, I made a call to their house and pretended to be a fan of <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\">Sonichu</a>. Bob was bored I guess, and he talked to me. After mentioning the Trolls, Bob said to me, \"Sissies that hide behind screen names and the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Internet\" title=\"Internet\">internet</a> are the biggest bunch of cowards and the scum of the earth. They are afraid to come out one-on-one, face-to-face. <a href=\"/cwcki/Hooker_incident\" title=\"Hooker incident\">They would hide behind their mothers' skirts.</a>\" Then he directed to one of our own he found out somehow, \"Females are the worst; such as <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miranda_Cosgrove\" title=\"wikipedia:Miranda Cosgrove\">Miranda \"Enjoy The Big Pickle\" Cosgrove</a>.\" That surprised me greatly, but in defensefor you, Miranda, Bob would be of no match against you. \n</p><p>Then Bobby said, \"Meet me in person at <a href=\"/cwcki/Burger_King\" title=\"Burger King\">Burger King</a> in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ruckersville\" title=\"Ruckersville\">Ruckersville</a> Any Day between 9:30 &amp; 10:30 AM, and I will talk to you and your friends and answer your questions.

We are <a href=\"/cwcki/Slow-in-the-minds\" title=\"Slow-in-the-minds\">simple</a> and above bored.\" We chatted some more and then he hung up. \n</p><p>I'd say let's troll Bobby further to get to Chrissy. I went there this morning; he was civil and gave me some info on Chris, such as that he has a complete collection of <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_State_quarters\" title=\"wikipedia:50 State quarters\">the United State Quarters</a> on a Map (What a dumb way to save <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Money\" title=\"Money\">money</a>). He also calls Chris a good boy (I agree with him; he ain't grown up). And, ooh, this is a good one; Chris tried to roller skate, and fell multiple times, even though he did a lot better on Ice Skates at the Ice Park (a class he took at <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PVCCitizens\" title=\"PVCCitizens\">PVCCitizens</a>). \n</p><p>I'm sure the more of us that go to Bobby and talk to him, the more information we can get out of him about Chrissy for our schemes. \n</p><p>I'll continue to keep watch and let y'all know when something new and lulzy comes up. \n</p><p>Junior Jenkins.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3><span id=\"Damn.21_.28Wed_25_Aug_2010_5:42_AM.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Damn!_(Wed_25_Aug_2010_5:42_AM)\">Damn!

Wrists, Ankles and Neck still being hand-held, the child ghost leaves my mind, and then I hear a deep womanly voice, Growling at me as I smelled the stench of a dog's breath surrounding my nostrils. The voice says, \"Do not mess with my master, my family or me, you infidel!\" Next, I feel the sting of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Patti\" title=\"Patti\">the dog</a> biting into both of my ankles, one after the other. At that moment, I struggle back, leaving behind the lit flashlight I dropped earlier when my arms were being stretched out. And I limp as fast as I can back to my house, closing and locking the door behind me, gasping for breath and dripping with sweat. I limp to the bathroom with the shower and look in the mirror; what a gross mess I looked like. And I see a Big, Red Rash on the right side of my neck, and rashes on both of my wrists, from the hands that held them in place. And my pant legs were ripped, and he saw on both of my ankles rashes, and Teeth Marks of a Dog. I tried to scream again, but it was another silent scream. And I was unable to speak at all for Four Hours. \n</p><p>I have encountered the Spirits of Young Christopher Weston Chandler and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Patti\" title=\"Patti\">Patti</a>, protecting the Chandler Household. I warn you all right here and now, Stay Away from his house, and Patti's Grave. It is NOT worth it to have to suffer the Nightmare that can render you as damned silent as the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Autistic\" title=\"Autistic\">Autistic</a> child.

I had just gotten home from an outing with my family, when at about 4:00 on the afternoon of this Saturday the 28th, I saw Chris walk outside of his house with his Camera in one hand, a pair of workers gloves in his back pocket, and his PS3 in the other hand. I was curious, so I followed him to his backyard, where I watched from behind the gazebo. Thank God I was not seen by him. Yet Fuck Me for forgetting MY Camera.\n<p>Anyway, he had taken a busted Air Conditioner from his Junk Pile, placed his console onto it, placed the tripod to one side and detached the camera from it to get a close up of his fat face. I don't remember his shitty speech fully, but it was some stuff of finding peace within himself and was about to destroy the \"vessel?\" which held his \"lonely, anguished self\" from the past three years. Then he reattached the camera to the tripod, relocated it for a closer view, walked in front of it, put on the gloves, picked up the nearby brick and started WAILING on it. I was just all Shocked, I could barely move and believe my eyes. He was smashing the thing like asteroids at fucking Armageddon. He looked like he was not going to stop. But after a minute, he put down the brick, took off his gloves and turned the camera off. Also, he had removed the Removable cover with his decals on it; said he was keeping it as a momento or something. And he walked back to the house, carrying his camera and the pieces of his own Smashed PSTriple. \n</p><p>I would have posted sooner, but I was paralyzed with shock for hours; it was Horrifying to me. And later at about near 10:45 that night, I watched from the window of my room as he laid the smashed PS3 on his gravel driveway, and recorded Driving Over it with both of his Left Tires, about 4 or 5 times! My Shock continued more. \n</p><p>I finally recovered about a couple of hours ago, ate a Hungry Man Dinner; I could not eat at all since the first smashing. Then I remembered that I should really be posting this, so here I am.\n</p><p>OMGMGMGMGMGMGMGMGMGMGMGMGMGMG...\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p><br/>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"
