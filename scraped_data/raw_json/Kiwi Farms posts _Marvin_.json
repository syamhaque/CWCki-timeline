It's so painfully obvious to anyone on the outside that you have a fake profile specifically designed to troll him. Just about every paragraph holds a clue against you. The fake license was a pathetic effort, but one you knew would work well enough on someone naive. Too bad you used the wrong font, didn't match the background color, made your fake signature longer than the signature box would allow, and forgot to put the second signature over the picture.\n<p>I don't care what you're hoping to get out of this--whether you want to troll him to do something funny, or simply get him to trust you to ultimately help him. You are doing far more damage than you think. You're messing with an autistic man who simply won't see the truth because he wants the lie so badly. And that's sick. You're not just messing with him, though--you're messing with his mom, and you're messing with me.\n</p><p>Whatever your opinion of his mom is, it doesn't give you the right to break her heart either. She doesn't deserve to be given false hope that maybe her son HAS found a soul mate and WILL be taken care of after she's gone. Because that's her greatest fear, and you're playing on it like a predator.\n</p><p>So just stop. I know you're probably pretending to be upset with him right now so that you'll get him desperate enough to do whatever you tell him. It's obscene. Let it go, walk away. Delete the fake accounts, and never do anything like this again.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>Marvin commented:\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #edf2ce; border:1px dotted #4b5320; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>(I just want to point out: Anna doesn't know Barb.

He can't get in trouble because there's nothing for him to get in trouble about. He doesn't need to change at all to fit in at Impulse, aside from appearing nominally trans.

For example, Liquid and Kacey working together to troll Chris is a conspiracy. Just by definition.\n<p>The point I'm trying to make is that we knew Chris' psychology very well, so we knew what to say to him to get him riled up. But those situations were very artificial. The trolling makes people think Chris just randomly gets mad and starts yelling at people if you call Sonichu gay. Or call Sonic gay.\n</p><p>The youtube videos leave out all the calls and messages from e-girlfriends that built up Chris' reaction. For every trolling saga, there was a bunch of stuff happening in the background.\n</p><p>Without trolls, Chris is pretty different. I mean, not in his personality, of course. He's pretty much the same person regardless. But his reactions on youtube were highly inflated by troll girlfriends whispering shit to him behind the scenes. \"Oh Chris, you're not just going to take that, are you? Chris, I need a man who can stand up for himself, not just a little wuss...\" It takes quite a bit to whip Chris up into a frenzy.

Not much, but I kinda sensed something like that. Maybe I imagined it.\n</p><p>After a bit, the PD went up to the judge and they called Chris up. Chris starts getting impatient with Barb. He said something like \"are your ears clogged up??\" and then \"wanna follow me so you can hear what's going on?\" Then she got up and trundled up there to accompany Chris.\n</p><p>This says a few things to me:\n</p><p>Perhaps Barb's hearing is wearing down. This fits in with her being frail and old.\nChris is being kind of bossy to Barb.\nChris expects Barb to be his bookkeeper so far as his punishments go.

He had to sleep closer to Barb, because she needed to be able to yell for him to go to sheetz and buy her crap, and he wasn't able to hear her up in his bedroom.

He can latch onto concrete points of interest, like noses, eyes, mouth, but he has trouble noticing if someone's nose is a little too wide, or someone's got bigger lips than average. That's subtle comparison and he's not good at that.\n<p>For this reason, I think Chris really doesn't notice how unfeminine he looks or whether or not he's ugly. He looks in the mirror and sees nose, eyes, mouth and he's like \"oh, that's... attractive? I think? or maybe not? this is hard\". It's also why he autistically focuses on tits and vagina, and completely ignores ass. The difference between a nice ass and a saggy gross ass is harder than the binary choice of vagina vs no vagina.\n</p><p>Honestly, I didn't personally believe his face blindness was that severe until I experienced it myself. I met Chris IRL on two occasions, pretty closely together, and Chris looked me dead in the face and didn't recognize me. Shit was weird.\n</p><p>As this applies to his goofy beliefs, Chris really respects hard, concrete \"true or false\" narratives. But since you can't really disprove supernatural stuff, it's not falsifiable, Chris gets to just wade around in his fantasies forever without anyone being capable of spoiling his fun.\n</p><p>Chris declaring that the dimensional merge will happen, by the end of 2018, obviously contradicts that. That's something that'll be falsifiable. I believe Chris has only done that out of desperation. Chris is having money troubles, Barb's always at death's door, and he really wants something to fix everything. I believe only desperation has forced Chris to bet everything on black, that the \"true or false\" narrative will come out in his favor.\n</p><p>If Chris had infinite money, I don't think we'd have a dimensional merge.
