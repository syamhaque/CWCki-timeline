Chris also claimed that <i><a href=\"/cwcki/My_Little_Pony\" title=\"My Little Pony\">My Little Pony</a></i> characters were working to stop the pandemic problems in the real world.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup> This disease had also made its way to <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a> in <a href=\"/cwcki/Dimensions#C-197\" title=\"Dimensions\">C-197</a> and some neighboring dimensions, but was somehow cured in all of them by mid April 2020. (Chris would eventually state that in his fantasy land, the \"Devil's Breath\" virus released by Doctor Octopus in the 2018 <i><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_(2018_video_game)\" title=\"wikipedia:Spider-Man (2018 video game)\">Spider-Man</a></i> video game was analogous to COVID-19's spread in the real world. Given that the virus is dealt with fairly quickly in-game after the outbreak, this could be in-line with Chris's timeline, even if the game is set in Autumn rather than Winter/Spring.)<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Chris's beliefs in how COVID-19 factors into the Dimensional Merge are also incredibly contradictory. Chris has claimed that this pandemic is a part of the convergence as a way of <a href=\"/cwcki/Dimensional_Merge#Beliefs_on_the_Merge\" title=\"Dimensional Merge\">evening out the population</a> on both sides of the iron curtain before it can occur. He says this virus <a href=\"/cwcki/Nazis\" title=\"Nazis\">will help remove those who are</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Honor_roll\" title=\"Honor roll\">mentally</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/I_AM_STRONG\" title=\"I AM STRONG\">physically</a> weak. However, he also claims that <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">he will use time travel to undo the pandemic in our timeline</a> so he can attend <a href=\"/cwcki/BABSCon\" title=\"BABSCon\">BABSCon 2020</a>, which directly contradicts his own stated beliefs in the Dimensional Merge saying that everyone who dies will make the process easier.\n</p><p>Furthermore, his statement that he used a <a href=\"/cwcki/Spirit_possession\" title=\"Spirit possession\">\"body swap\"</a> to attend BABSCon 2020 in C-197 makes the entire idea of Chris time-travelling and saving millions from contracting the Coronavirus and hundreds of thousands dying entirely irreconcilable with the idea that all of the people that died needed to for the Dimensional Merge to happen; after all, why bother with all that death and Merge preparation if he's just going to set things back by time travelling to create a new timeline where the event was never cancelled? On top of that, the idea that the people who die in Dimension 1218 as a result of the Merge being resurrected in Dimension C-197 does nothing to \"thin the herd\", and thus the oncoming world's populace would suffer from overpopulation problems after the Merge.\n</p><p>Chris, of course, conveniently ignores these issues because <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Mathematics\" title=\"Mathematics\">he can't put two and two together</a>, because <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_writing\" title=\"Chris and writing\">he just can't keep his shitty narrative straight</a>. These inconsistencies reveal that this entire diatribe, down to Chris pretending to be his own fictional character for more than half a year, is nothing more than an elaborate <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_coping\" title=\"Chris and coping\">coping mechanism</a> where he can create a scenario in his mind that allows him to go to a convention that got cancelled instead of just <i>imagining</i> that he did in his fantasy world. Eventually, he got bored of pretending to be Sonichu and reverted to being himself in February 2021; he continues to believe that the Merge is coming, although he's seemingly come to terms with the fact that the 2020 and 2021 iterations of BABScon are not coming.\n</p><p><a href=\"/cwcki/Weens\" title=\"Weens\">Weens</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/A-Log\" title=\"A-Log\">A-Logs</a> have tried to <a href=\"/cwcki/August_2020_social_media_posts#Very_Distant_alt-timeline\" title=\"August 2020 social media posts\">crowbar</a> a more severe outbreak into C-197, with one known attempt using the Corona-Chan meme, but Chris has so far dismissed them as taking place in yet more alternate dimensions. However, since <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roleplaying\" title=\"wikipedia:roleplaying\">roleplay</a> writers do not have to include the pandemic in their universes for any reason, Chris could have just said that COVID-19 simply did not happen in C-197, and that would have been it.\n</p><p>While in <a href=\"/cwcki/Jail_Saga\" title=\"Jail Saga\">jail</a> - now deep in the delusions that he was <a href=\"/cwcki/Messiah_complex#Jesus_Reborn\" title=\"Messiah complex\">the reincarnation of Jesus Christ</a> - Chris <a href=\"/cwcki/Jail_Letter_-_11_May_2022\" title=\"Jail Letter - 11 May 2022\">wrote a letter</a> in which he stated that the pandemic was a test of faith, while reiterating that the pandemic would result in \"healthier individuals\" by eliminating the \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Slow-in-the-minds\" title=\"Slow-in-the-minds\">Left-Behinds</a>.\" He also blamed <a href=\"/cwcki/Jacob_Sockness\" title=\"Jacob Sockness\">Jacob Sockness</a> for having \"cursed\" the United States with the disease.

I wish to make it very direct and clear that this is very sincere and serious, and when talking with me about it, it is not at all to be in humoring anyone.
