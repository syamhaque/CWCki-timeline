Revising this page will be a difficult task. Altering this older portrait of our \"selfish but harmless idiot\" would make it harder to illustrate the changes in him and his ability to justify all of his own actions, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_sex#Incest\" title=\"Chris and sex\">however depraved</a>.</b></div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>Like his beliefs on <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_religion\" title=\"Chris and religion\">religion</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_gender\" title=\"Chris and gender\">gender</a>, Chris's stance on morality is difficult to interpret. Chris often claims that he is a kind, good-natured, saintly person that doesn't deserve scorn. To a certain extent, he's right, but for all of the wrong reasons.\n</p><p>Despite what one may think about Chris, the reality is that he is relatively harmless and is somewhat capable of distinguishing right and wrong. But that is only scratching the surface, as Chris's selfishness and <a href=\"/cwcki/Na%C3%AFve\" title=\"Naïve\">naivete</a> often turn out to be the main culprits behind him doing immoral actions, rather than true malevolence.\n</p><p>One infamous example of this behavior is when he foolishly drew and uploaded <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/SheCameForCWC.jpg\" title=\"SheCameForCWC.jpg\">SheCameForCWC.jpg</a> onto Encyclopedia Dramatica as a means to combat all of the pictures of <a href=\"/cwcki/Duck\" title=\"Duck\">ducks</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Pickle\" title=\"Pickle\">pickles</a> he found on the site, as well as to <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos#Fear_of_being_a_homo\" title=\"Homos\">prove his straightness</a>, not thinking about how <a href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Schroeder\" title=\"Megan Schroeder\">Megan</a> might respond to being depicted in such an undignified manner in a shoddily drawn piece of porn. Megan, who was looking for just about any reason to stop talking to Chris,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]</a></sup> was understandably revolted. However, what cements the fact that his naivete was partly responsible is how Chris tried to explain to Megan what happened in the picture itself, thinking that she was inexperienced with <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_sex\" title=\"Chris and sex\">sex</a>, and didn't understand what was going on, rather than the obvious fact that she was depicted in such a demeaning situation, and that Chris obviously wants to pound her.\n</p><p>An outsider's account has confirmed this, specifically that of <a href=\"/cwcki/Mimms_and_Lucas_Q%26A\" title=\"Mimms and Lucas Q&amp;A\">Mimms and Lucas</a>. Mimms stated that Chris didn't seem aware he had committed wrongdoings to justify getting banned from <a href=\"/cwcki/The_GAMe_PLACe\" title=\"The GAMe PLACe\">The GAMe PLACe</a> (but he certainly knew he was no longer welcome there)<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-7\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">[7]</a></sup>. Though Chris didn't seem to recall anything beyond a so-called <a href=\"/cwcki/Jackie_E-mails#Chris_hates_authority\" title=\"Jackie E-mails\">\"Wii incident\"</a> or \"<a href=\"/cwcki/100_2261.MOV\" title=\"100 2261.MOV\">shout(ing) a loud outburst twice</a>\", he still saw fit to try and <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_remorse\" title=\"Chris and remorse\">apologize</a> to <a href=\"/cwcki/Michael_Snyder\" title=\"Michael Snyder\">Michael Snyder</a> (in a predictably failed bid to have his ban repealed).\n</p><p>Whoever Chris acts kindly to depends on who he would classify as <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Gal-Pals\" title=\"Gal-Pals\">his \"friends\"</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">his \"enemies\".</a> If someone gets in the way of whatever he wants to do, or he shifts the blame on someone else for his own fails, Chris will deem that someone as a troll that wants nothing more of him than to make him miserable, showing very little respect of whoever inconvenienced him. Whoever Chris doesn't classify as a troll or feels \"temporarily\" joined the side of the trolls are his friends. Typically, Chris will attempt to befriend internet celebrities and staff members of the media he enjoys.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Empathy\">Empathy</span></h2>\n<p>Chris has a very warped understanding of empathy. This could be attributed to his autism, as autistic people generally have difficulty empathizing with others, although Chris's case has much more to do with his upbringing.\n</p><p>His dubious (if virtually nonexistent) ability to empathize has also led him to denounce most anyone with whom he had a conflict as <a href=\"/cwcki/Michael_Snyder_is_ColdHearted_and_Mean\" title=\"Michael Snyder is ColdHearted and Mean\">mean, heartless</a> or even <a href=\"/cwcki/Private_Villa_of_Corrupted_Citizens\" title=\"Private Villa of Corrupted Citizens\">flat out villainous</a>, irrespective of all evidence pointing towards responsibility for turmoil falling on him. Despite fervently chiding them for allegedly lacking a heart, he often neglects to take <i>their</i> thoughts and feelings into consideration <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_hypocrisy\" title=\"Chris and hypocrisy\">himself</a>, preferring to instead jump to conclusions just because they happen to deviate from his extremely simplistic ideals (not to mention deny him what he feels entitled to have).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Motivations_for_doing_good\">Motivations for doing good</span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Love_Quest_and_gal_pals\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Love_Quest\" title=\"Love Quest\">Love Quest</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Gal_pals\" title=\"Gal pals\">gal pals</a></span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:202px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Doopie_White_Knights_Chris.jpg\"><img alt=\"Doopie White Knights Chris.jpg\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"185\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/3/35/Doopie_White_Knights_Chris.jpg/200px-Doopie_White_Knights_Chris.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/3/35/Doopie_White_Knights_Chris.jpg/300px-Doopie_White_Knights_Chris.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/3/35/Doopie_White_Knights_Chris.jpg/400px-Doopie_White_Knights_Chris.jpg 2x\" width=\"200\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Doopie_White_Knights_Chris.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div></div></div></div>\n<p>While socializing with his alleged pals, Chris always takes the time to act as kind as possible to them, to the point where it becomes downright disturbing. Unsurprisingly, Chris has used Social Media as a means of continuing his <a href=\"/cwcki/Love_Quest\" title=\"Love Quest\">Love Quest</a> and finding the <a href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart\" title=\"Sweetheart\">sweetheart</a> he has desired for over a decade. Because of that, most of the people <a href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart_from_the_Ground-Up\" title=\"Sweetheart from the Ground-Up\">Chris attempts to befriend are girls</a>, with and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Boyfriend-Free_Girl\" title=\"Boyfriend-Free Girl\">without boyfriends</a>. \n</p><p>In terms of friendships on social media, whenever he feels he's up the creek without a paddle, Chris will almost always doubt that he is in any way responsible for anybody turning against him because, in his eyes, he is too kind for anyone to simply block him on Twitter or to be hated by the masses, and instead <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_remorse\" title=\"Chris and remorse\">shifts the blame on the trolls</a>. This coupled with the fact that Chris refuses to see the worst out of his friends unless he gets the hint that they denied access to their <a href=\"/cwcki/China\" title=\"China\">china</a> makes it sound even more disturbing.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Defending_others\">Defending others</span></h3>\n<p>As mentioned above with the Doopie saga, Chris has a tendency to believe he is doing good when in reality, he isn't. A common motivation for doing what he believes to be good is so that he can 'defend' someone he thinks is close to him; Chris has demonstrated this numerous times with Troll-created <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sweethearts\" title=\"Sweethearts\">Sweethearts</a>, such as attempting to 'defend' <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Julie\" title=\"Julie\">Julie</a> from <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">Clyde Cash</a> in voice chat sessions, then <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ohio_Trip\" title=\"Ohio Trip\">driving all the way to Cleveland</a> in his belief that she would be there. Chris has also attempted to shift the focus of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Weening\" title=\"Weening\">Weening</a> against Doopie to himself in his <a href=\"/cwcki/HarassCWCdirectly\" title=\"HarassCWCdirectly\">Twitter campaign</a>, when in reality the situation, far less serious than he thought it was, could have been resolved had Chris simply quieted down.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Avoiding_trouble\">Avoiding trouble</span></h3>\n<p>In other instances, Chris will only act kindly to people to avoid getting into trouble. Whenever he tries to apologize to anyone, it's usually for reasons such as getting his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PSN\" title=\"PSN\">PSN</a> account back, or in an attempt to get back into places he was banned from.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Personal_benefit\">Personal benefit</span></h3>\n<p>In general, the reason for Chris's acting kindly towards others is his thinking that doing so is the best way to manipulate them into doing whatever he wants them to. This is possibly due to his misunderstanding of simple etiquette and manners.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"How_Chris_demonstrates_kindness\">How Chris demonstrates kindness</span></h2>\n<table class=\"wikitable\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_remorse\" title=\"Chris and remorse\">Apologizing</a>\n</td>\n<td>As mentioned above, Chris has a very limited understanding of empathy. On the rare occasions in which Chris admits his misdeeds and apologizes for them, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_negotiation\" title=\"Chris and negotiation\">ulterior motives</a> are usually, if not always, present. This is in part to <a href=\"/cwcki/Borb\" title=\"Borb\">his upbringing</a> and otherwise due to other things such as <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">autism</a>, all of which limit his ability to understand empathy. Curiously, Chris seems to lack the tendency to over-apologize for things, a trait known to be found in people on the spectrum, and normally will remain obstinate and particularly stubborn in his opinions unless forced to admit he was wrong, or if apologizing for some self-serving purpose.\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Using pet names\n</td>\n<td>To refer to a gal-pal in a \"kind\" nonsexual manner, Chris will often refer to them as either <a href=\"/cwcki/Darling\" title=\"Darling\">\"darling\" or \"dear\"</a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-8\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">[8]</a></sup> However, since Chris obviously doesn't understand how creepy it is to refer to a girl he's just met on the internet as a \"darling\", most girls who talk to Chris online will be set off by Chris's misuse of the word.\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gift-giving\n</td>\n<td>Chris has shown several times his belief that kindness can be equated to simply furnishing others with luxuries such as video games, movies, comic books and other such gifts, not realising that charity alone is not the only virtue required to be considered kind. Perhaps the most noticeable instance of this was during his friendship with <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Megan\" title=\"Megan\">Megan</a>, in which he carried out a protracted program of gift-giving practically right up to <a href=\"/cwcki/ShecameforCWC.JPG\" title=\"ShecameforCWC.JPG\">the moment it all came crashing down.</a> The <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_manipulation\" title=\"Chris and manipulation\">manipulated</a> this aspect of Chris's beliefs on kindness to have him be extorted into providing them with vast sums of money, alongside brand new video games and consoles, as revealed by invoices provided by Chris to the <a href=\"/cwcki/Guard_Dogs\" title=\"Guard Dogs\">Guard Dogs</a> during the early stages of <a href=\"/cwcki/Guard_Dogs#Extortion\" title=\"Guard Dogs\">Operation Kingsnake</a>.\n</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Genuine_acts_of_kindness\">Genuine acts of kindness</span></h2>\n<p>During <a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris\" title=\"Liquid Chris\">Liquid Chris</a> saga, Chris wanted to get Liquid arrested, and therefore placing him in prison. However, after talking with <a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey\" title=\"Kacey\">Kacey</a>, he decided that he \"would hate to see you in jail, out of respect, and of care, because she would be heartbroken.\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-9\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">[9]</a></sup> It's worth mentioning that only a few seconds later, he threatens to get him tried in court, so this should be taken with a grain of salt.\n</p><p>Chris once participated in raising funds for <a href=\"/cwcki/Alex%27s_Lemonade_Stand\" title=\"Alex's Lemonade Stand\">Alex's Lemonade Stand</a>, a charity program that works to raise awareness of childhood cancer. Although he did it in memory of his <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler\" title=\"Bob Chandler\">deceased father</a>, who actually passed away as a result of heart disease rather than cancer, it was still considered a positive contribution Chris made to society. \n</p><p>He also donated to Red Cross in the wake of Hurricane Harvey in September 2017.\n</p><p>On a relatively minor note, <a href=\"/cwcki/Lucas\" title=\"Lucas\">Lucas</a> of <a href=\"/cwcki/The_GAMe_PLACe\" title=\"The GAMe PLACe\">The GAMe PLACe</a> recalled Chris brought in his <a href=\"/cwcki/Nintendo\" title=\"Nintendo\">Wii</a> for a tournament on the release of <i>Super Smash Bros.
