In spite of this, <a href=\"/cwcki/Nudes\" title=\"Nudes\">visual evidence</a> suggests it is at least an inch shorter (five inches being closer to the average size), and Chris <a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_Chris%27s_lies\" title=\"List of Chris's lies\">readily lies</a> about <a href=\"/cwcki/Obesity\" title=\"Obesity\">the dimensions of his body</a>. In a Let's Read of the 'Giant Penis' comic, one reader speculates that the duck is about 3 inches long (7.5 cm). This is possible, considering Chris did indeed trace his duck onto the paper at the request of Ivy, and more than likely he used standard computer paper - 8.5 inches by 11 inches - and the duck looks to be about 1/3 of the paper width.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Duck_edited.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"240\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/4/4b/Duck_edited.jpg/300px-Duck_edited.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/4/4b/Duck_edited.jpg/450px-Duck_edited.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/4/4b/Duck_edited.jpg/600px-Duck_edited.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Duck_edited.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>A <a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris\" title=\"Liquid Chris\">TRUE and HONEST</a> duck</div></div></div>\n<p>Chris at least concedes that his penis is of no more than average size, which is a source of some insecurity for him. In <a href=\"/cwcki/File:Evan_responds_to_his_death.png\" title=\"File:Evan responds to his death.png\">an e-mail</a> to <a href=\"/cwcki/Evan\" title=\"Evan\">Evan</a> during their feud over <a href=\"/cwcki/Simonla_Rosechu\" title=\"Simonla Rosechu\">Simonla Rosechu</a>, he took off on a peculiar tangent about penis length: \"There ARE those with dicks longer than 7 inches; yes I am jealous of those individuals, not just you.\" In <a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey_Call_11\" title=\"Kacey Call 11\">Kacey Call 11</a>, Chris asked Kacey for details as to the size of Liquid Chris's penis and expressed regret that his own was not as large. He once attempted to enlarge it with <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExtenZe\" title=\"wikipedia:ExtenZe\">ExtenZe</a>, a supplement advertised to enlarge penises, but he said it didn't work.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-7\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">[7]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-8\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">[8]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Toward the very end of his <a href=\"/cwcki/Jackie_E-mails_23\" title=\"Jackie E-mails 23\">communications with Jackie</a>, Chris claimed that his penis has grown larger and straightened itself out since it was last photographed for public consumption. This claim was disproven in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Tomgirl_Pictures\" title=\"Tomgirl Pictures\">Tomgirl</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/File:TG20.jpg\" title=\"File:TG20.jpg\">images</a>, leaked in <a href=\"/cwcki/April_2011\" title=\"April 2011\">April 2011</a>, wherein his penis is still visibly bent and the same size it always was.\n</p><p>Many of his nude photos show that Chris shaves most of his <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pubic_hair\" title=\"wikipedia:pubic hair\">pubic hair</a>. While this sometimes has the effect of making the penis seem more prominent, in Chris's case, it just draws attention to the abundant pubic fat surrounding his genitalia. This can not be described as an attractive effect.\n</p><p>When he announced the alleged loss of his <a href=\"/cwcki/Virgin_with_rage\" title=\"Virgin with rage\">virginity</a> on <a href=\"/cwcki/Facebook\" title=\"Facebook\">Facebook</a>, Chris claimed his sex partner praised his duck for its size, saying it was the biggest she had ever seen, and put all past partners to shame. This sex partner was later confirmed to be a <a href=\"/cwcki/Mia_Hamm\" title=\"Mia Hamm\">prostitute</a>,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-9\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">[9]</a></sup> so while it is likely that she said it, its sincerity is dubious.\n</p><p>As of 2014, Chris <a href=\"/cwcki/Un-clit\" title=\"Un-clit\">now actively <i>despises</i> his own duck</a> in the wake of his <a href=\"/cwcki/Transgender\" title=\"Transgender\">transgenderism</a>. It is common for transsexuals to detest their own genitalia, which they perceive as incorrect, and in fact, he even uses a homemade device to hold it in. However, the fact that Chris loathed ALL penises is more indicative of issues with his sexuality than with his gender. In 2016, Chris began listening to <a href=\"/cwcki/Subliminal_Frequency_Hypnosis\" title=\"Subliminal Frequency Hypnosis\">Subliminal Frequency Hypnosis</a> to try to magically convert his duck into <a href=\"/cwcki/China\" title=\"China\">china</a>. In July of that year, he grew tired of waiting and made a <a href=\"/cwcki/Self-inflicted_taint_wound\" title=\"Self-inflicted taint wound\">self-inflicted taint wound</a> to try freeing the vagina, which naturally failed. Also during that year, Chris began taking MTF hormones, eliminating what was left of his sex drive.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:1256079873949.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"195\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/f/f7/1256079873949.jpg/300px-1256079873949.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/f/f7/1256079873949.jpg/450px-1256079873949.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/f/f7/1256079873949.jpg/600px-1256079873949.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:1256079873949.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Anatomical analysis of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Giant_Penis_Comic\" title=\"Giant Penis Comic\">traced penis</a>.</div></div></div>\n<p>Nonetheless, Chris has been seen using his duck <a href=\"/cwcki/All_Star\" title=\"All Star\">in a 2018 sex tape</a>, perhaps indicating that he still enjoys masturbation in spite of his claims to the contrary. His turn to <a href=\"/cwcki/Bisexual\" title=\"Bisexual\">bisexuality</a> may have had something to do with this. However, it should also be noted that he appeared to be deeply uncomfortable while filming the scene, which was later revealed to have been orchestrated by the <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys</a>.\n</p><p>During the infamous <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Incest_call\" title=\"Incest call\">incest call</a> and the <a href=\"/cwcki/Incest_fallout_chat_leaks\" title=\"Incest fallout chat leaks\">Incest fallout chat leaks</a>, Chris revealed, <a href=\"/cwcki/Honest_Content\" title=\"Honest Content\">in excruciating detail</a>, that he had been having sex with his own mother through a variety of means, including penile penetration. Chris claimed that his duck still worked just fine, despite using estrogen supplements for years before having sex with Barb, and that he wore condoms during these encounters, despite the fact that she is well past the age of getting pregnant and that neither of them have STIs.\n</p><p>Prior to going to jail, Chris had contemplated <a href=\"/cwcki/Transgender#Interest_in_sexual_reassignment_surgery\" title=\"Transgender\">gender reassignment surgery</a>, a medical procedure which would rid him of his duck for good.
