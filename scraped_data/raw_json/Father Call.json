In this call, <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler\">Solid Chris</a> spends 2 hours on the phone with <b>Matthew Devoria</b> (born <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/1957\" title=\"1957\">1957</a>), the father of his would-be <a href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart\" title=\"Sweetheart\">sweetheart</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey\" title=\"Kacey\">Kacey</a>, and a retired <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps\" title=\"wikipedia:United States Marine Corps\">U.S. Marine</a> who served in the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War\" title=\"wikipedia:Gulf War\">Gulf War</a>. Chris uses the opportunity of speaking to the dad of his sweetheart by boasting of his now-legendary <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Honest\" title=\"Honest\">honesty</a>, before flimsily attempting to defend himself from an angry father.\n</p><p>Their conversation is illuminating. What follows is probably the bluntest personal assessment Chris has ever received to date: Matt berates Chris for his <a href=\"/cwcki/Monthly_tugboat\" title=\"Monthly tugboat\">laziness</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">egotism</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_kindness\" title=\"Chris and kindness\">lack of empathy</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">inability to grow up</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_health\" title=\"Chris and health\">unhealthy lifestyle</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Obesity\" title=\"Obesity\">obesity</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Women%27s_rights\" title=\"Women's rights\">treatment of Kacey</a> and general failure at life. To this day, Chris has never taken any of Matt and Kacey's advice to heart; throughout the call he retorts by saying that he leads a hard life, which includes such laborious tasks as doing menial <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chores\" title=\"Chores\">chores</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_Fighter\" title=\"CWC Fighter\">mowing the lawn</a> and <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Tour_of_Chris%27s_House\" title=\"Tour of Chris's House\">cleaning the house</a></i>. He also claims to be <a href=\"/cwcki/I_AM_STRONG\" title=\"I AM STRONG\">strong</a> and that he <a href=\"/cwcki/Guitar_Hero\" title=\"Guitar Hero\">exercises</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Mass_debating\" title=\"Mass debating\">regularly</a>, as well as eating healthy by going to <a href=\"/cwcki/McDonald%27s\" title=\"McDonald's\">McDonald's</a> only once per week and shoving <a href=\"/cwcki/Barbara_Chandler\" title=\"Barbara Chandler\">vegetables</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">down his throat</a>.\n</p><p>After being berated with insults for two hours (or so he says), Chris became increasingly more <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress\" title=\"Stress\">stressed</a>, frequently making insensitive statements towards Matthew. In general, Chris greatly offended Kacey and her father, causing her to rethink her relationship and go back to <a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris\" title=\"Liquid Chris\">Liquid Chris</a>.\n</p><p>Chris recorded his <a href=\"/cwcki/11052009_Kacey,_I_Love_You,_and_I_Need_You\" title=\"11052009 Kacey, I Love You, and I Need You\">5 November video</a> as a follow-up to this conversation, hoping to repair his relationship with Kacey. He then had another <a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey_and_Liquid_Call\" title=\"Kacey and Liquid Call\">phone conversation with Kacey</a>, which, to put it bluntly, ended equally as poorly.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Summary\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Summary</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Video\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Video</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Matthew_Makes_the_Scene_(0:00-4:26)\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Matthew Makes the Scene (0:00-4:26)</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#The_Pokémon_Volunteer_Who_Lives_with_His_Parents_(4:28-11:01)\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The Pokémon Volunteer Who Lives with His Parents (4:28-11:01)</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Financial_Situation_and_Crystal_the_Tard_Baby_(11:01-18:28)\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Financial Situation and Crystal the Tard Baby (11:01-18:28)</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Prophetic_Dreams_and_Bob_Chandler_(18:28-24:18)\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Prophetic Dreams and Bob Chandler (18:28-24:18)</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Kacey's_Boobs_and_Fame_(24:18-33:24)\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Kacey's Boobs and Fame (24:18-33:24)</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#The_Shit_Hits_the_Fan_(33:24-39:17)\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The Shit Hits the Fan (33:24-39:17)</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#Maturity_and_Chores_(39:17-48:08)\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Maturity and Chores (39:17-48:08)</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Death_and_Fake_Internet_Women_(48:08-54:05)\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Death and Fake Internet Women (48:08-54:05)</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#More_Shit_Hits_the_Fan_(54:05-58:09)\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.9</span> <span class=\"toctext\">More Shit Hits the Fan (54:05-58:09)</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#Kacey_Returns_(58:09-1:02:35)\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.10</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Kacey Returns (58:09-1:02:35)</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-13\"><a href=\"#Literature_and_Health_(1:02:35-1:13:17)\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.11</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Literature and Health (1:02:35-1:13:17)</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-14\"><a href=\"#Liquid_Chris_and_Minimum_Wage_Jobs_(1:13:17-1:19:04)\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.12</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Liquid Chris and Minimum Wage Jobs (1:13:17-1:19:04)</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-15\"><a href=\"#Respect_and_Listening_Skills_(1:19:04-1:24:45)\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.13</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Respect and Listening Skills (1:19:04-1:24:45)</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-16\"><a href=\"#Chris's_Pathetic_Life_and_Diseased_Ticker_(1:24:05-1:36:33)\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.14</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris's Pathetic Life and Diseased Ticker (1:24:05-1:36:33)</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-17\"><a href=\"#Chris_Blows_It,_but_He's_an_American!_(1:36:33-1:41:33)\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.15</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris Blows It, but He's an American!

A turret from the game can briefly be heard 1 hour, 22 minutes and 22 seconds in.</li>\n<li>A couple times, Matthew whispers portions of his sentences after saying them, in a possible exhibition of <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palilalia\" title=\"wikipedia:palilalia\">palilalia</a>. Palilalia often appears in individuals with autism or other developmental disabilities.</li>\n<li>Chris <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress_sigh\" title=\"Stress sigh\">sighs</a> constantly during the call – to the point where Matthew points out the constant sighing <i>3 times</i>.</li>\n<li>The call begins with Chris talking to Kacey and making some rather dubious-sounding claims about his weightlifting prowess, saying he <a href=\"/cwcki/11042009_51_50\" title=\"11042009 51 50\">just got done lifting 50 pounds</a> 51 times with each arm, a total of 102 reps according to Chris. Kacey doesn't bother to question Chris on the truth of these claims, and instead hands the phone over to her father, Matthew.</li>\n<li>Before she hands the phone over, however, Kacey claims she has to lift at least 100 pounds for her job. Chris does not question how or why a waitress would have to lift that many pounds.</li>\n<li>Matt starts out being fairly civil toward Chris, though it's immediately obvious that he doesn't have much respect for him. Matt begins by calling out Chris on his <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_work\" title=\"Chris and work\">underwhelming employment record</a>, and tells him that no sane employer would take his claim of being a <a href=\"/cwcki/Pok%C3%A9mon\" title=\"Pokémon\">Pokémon</a> Gym Leader/babysitter seriously.</li>\n<li>Upon being questioned as to the source of his monthly income, Chris reveals his <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">autism</a> and the corresponding <a href=\"/cwcki/Monthly_tugboat\" title=\"Monthly tugboat\">monthly tugboat</a>. Matt asks if any hypothetical children (or \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Slow-in-the-minds\" title=\"Slow-in-the-minds\">'tard babies</a>\", as he says) of Chris and Kacey would also be autistic, and while Chris denies that they would be, Matt checks with Kacey, who confirms that autism is more often than not genetic. This is the first of several times Chris lies during the call, and while Matt goes easy on him this time, he won't be so generous the next time Chris does it.</li>\n<li>Chris reveals his dream about God promising him a daughter named <a href=\"/cwcki/Crystal_Weston_Chandler_(daughter)\" title=\"Crystal Weston Chandler (daughter)\">Crystal</a>. Not only does Matt consider the idea of God sending Chris messages to be <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_Prophet\" title=\"wikipedia:False Prophet\">blasphemous</a>, but he also doesn't even like Crystal as a name and believes it's more appropriate for a <a href=\"/cwcki/Little_Tomboy_Blue\" title=\"Little Tomboy Blue\">stripper</a>, or <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristal_(wine)\" title=\"wikipedia:Cristal (wine)\">an expensive brand of</a> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Alcohol\" title=\"Alcohol\">champagne</a>. Chris corrects him with the pronunciation of the name to not sound like a stripper, \"Chris-tul\", not \"Chris-tal\" (he also misspells the name). Chris ignores the fact that Kacey does not like the name that much either, as Matthew points out.</li>\n<li>After indirectly confirming to Matthew that he was interested primarily in Kacey <a href=\"/cwcki/Women%27s_rights\" title=\"Women's rights\">for her looks</a>, he is questioned on why the great and powerful Liquid was impersonating him. Solid's response is to claim that Liquid was jealous of his success with <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\">Sonichu</a></i>. Matt is at first completely bewildered as to why Chris is spending so much time on <i>Sonichu</i>, before using it to make the point that Chris has completely failed to move on from his teenage years. Matthew commits a potentially damaging mistake when he points out that Sega owns the rights to Sonic the Hedgehog, despite having earlier claimed not to know anything about the character, leading to him clumsily backtracking on his statement; fortunately, <a href=\"/cwcki/Slow-in-the-minds\" title=\"Slow-in-the-minds\">Chris doesn't notice this</a>.</li>\n<li>The tone of the conversation takes a significant turn for the worse when Matt brings up the subject of <a href=\"/cwcki/Twin_Falling_Towers\" title=\"Twin Falling Towers\">Twin Falling Towers</a>, and says that he found that said video to be especially offensive since his mother (Kacey's grandmother) was one of the casualties in the World Trade Center on 11 September 2001. Chris's only response is to blame it all on <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">Clyde Cash</a>, because <a href=\"/cwcki/Mumble_9.5\" title=\"Mumble 9.5\">he was being \"mean\" to Chris</a>; Matthew is unsurprisingly baffled as to why Chris tried \"getting back\" at a random guy on the internet by mockingly comparing him to the subject of one of the all-time biggest American tragedies.</li>\n<li>Chris tries to elicit sympathy by claiming to have undergone \"war-like tribulations\" in his life. Matt tells Chris what war is <i>actually</i> like, recounting his Gulf War experiences, particularly an incident where he had to carry a dead colleague back to base. Chris retracts his statement about his problems being \"war-like\", but carries on whining about the hard burdens he's had to deal with, like pulling weeds, standing up to <a href=\"/cwcki/Guitar_Hero\" title=\"Guitar Hero\">play guitar</a>, mowing the lawn, moving furniture, and burying his beloved <a href=\"/cwcki/Patti_Chandler\" title=\"Patti Chandler\">dog</a>. Matt is even more offended by the insinuation that this is equal to the death of his mother, and even points out his grandma with <i>arthritis</i> pulled weeds.</li>\n<li>Chris also seems to believe a dog house made of plastic and wood weighs 5 to 10 tons (10,000-20,000 pounds), and believes the doghouse would weigh more than any tombstone (which tends to weigh an average of about 80 pounds). He also tries to gain sympathy by saying Patti's doghouse was essentially a tombstone. Chris believes plastic and wood would weigh more than solid stone, retracting the previous claim to saying the doghouse weighed 100 pounds. A small dog like Patti would not need a dog house that heavy or large.</li>\n<li>Chris isn't discouraged by the fact that his attempts to earn sympathy aren't working, and rants semi-coherently about how the evil <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Troll\" title=\"Troll\">trolls</a> have <a href=\"/cwcki/Kick_the_Autistic\" title=\"Kick the Autistic\">made his life a misery</a>. Not only does this self-pitying whining severely annoy Matt, Chris unwittingly digs himself a deeper hole by revealing details about the <a href=\"/cwcki/Ohio_trip\" title=\"Ohio trip\">Ohio trip</a> in the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Julie\" title=\"Julie\">Julie</a> saga, causing Matthew to angrily question him on why he wouldn't come to D.C. to meet Kacey if he were willing to drive +800 miles to another state to rescue a girlfriend he eventually found out didn't exist (and was really a <a href=\"/cwcki/BlueSpike\" title=\"BlueSpike\">13-year-old boy</a>, to boot).</li>\n<li>Matt accuses Chris of acting like a child and mentions the state of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris%27s_room\" title=\"Chris's room\">his room</a> as proof that he's lazy and unwilling to take responsibility, remarking Chris's plan to be a house-husband. Chris just tries to blame <a href=\"/cwcki/Barbara_Chandler\" title=\"Barbara Chandler\">his mother</a> for not helping him, hypocritically saying that Barb is lazy. Matt sarcastically comments on his lack of maturity, but Chris misses the sarcasm and thinks he's actually agreeing with him.</li>\n<li>In an unbelievably insensitive move even by his standards, <i>Chris compares the effort that tidying his house would entail with the effort Matt spent carrying his dead colleague back to base</i>. Matt is rightfully <i>furious</i> at this comparison and gets Kacey back on the phone to tell her how full of shit Chris is. Kacey tells Chris that he needs to respect Matthew more, before handing the phone back to her father. Chris tries to say he was being respectful and Matthew treats him like a child. Kacey points out he needs to be nicer and more respectful to Matthew (not to mention, throughout the call, Chris is acting <i>like</i> a child, which Matt doesn't overlook). After being yelled at by Kacey, Chris \"apologizes\" to Matthew, with Matthew seeing past his crap.</li>\n<li>An off-hand remark about the library leads Matt to question Chris on his reading habits. Chris says that the last book he read was <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>. Matt points out that's a book generally already read by high school students, and then asks him what he learned from the novel. Chris proceeds to describe the plot of <i>Of Mice and Men</i>. Upon having this pointed out, Chris remembers which book he's talking about and gives a <i>vaguely</i> correct description of the plot, but seems to have only read (or paid attention to) the first half of the story. When Matt brings up the court case (a major part of the story) and the character of Atticus Finch (who is the main character's dad), Chris seems to not know what he's talking about.</li>\n<li>Matt says that Kacey reads books like Chris stuffs candy down his throat. Chris <i>completely</i> misses the point of that comparison, and angrily claims he has a healthy lifestyle. Matthew thoroughly mocks Chris's lack of basic comprehension skills and challenges him to produce a video of himself exercising in order to prove his obviously false claims of being healthy.</li>\n<li>Returning to the subject of Crystal, Matthew asks Chris how he intends to support himself, Kacey, and a child on his tugboat and a minimum-wage job. Chris tries to claim that $8/hour is plenty for a family of three, to which Matt points out that not only is that amount of money nowhere near enough, the minimum wage is actually $7.25/hour. Chris takes a sneering tone during this debate, only serving to piss Matt off even more, and causing Kacey to again tell Chris to respect Matthew. By this point, Kacey is getting pissed off with Chris's disrespect and clear failure to listen to her and her father's advice.</li>\n<li>Matthew again questions Chris on his lifestyle and asks him to take his pulse. Chris discovers his pulse to be 84 per minute; Kacey overhears this and tells Chris that with his history of heart trouble and unhealthy eating, such a pulse indicates a serious problem. Chris doesn't seem at all bothered by him possibly risking death, which really annoys Kacey and causes her to storm off.</li>\n<li>Chris bizarrely attempts to make himself look better by boasting that he's American-born and bred, and has never even left the country, somehow thinking this will impress a man who fought in Iraq. Matt points out that not only is this irrelevant since Kacey and Liquid Chris are also American, but true patriots also wouldn't make videos mocking national tragedies.</li>\n<li>Matt decides to test Chris's memory and asks him various details about Kacey; Chris gets her favorite color vaguely right, has no idea what her favorite flower is, and takes forever to remember which of her family members died on 9/11 (which should've been easy for Chris because Matt told him <i>earlier in the conversation</i>). Matt tells Chris that he must be <a href=\"/cwcki/Na%C3%AFve\" title=\"Naïve\">naïve</a> to think he would have any chance with Kacey; Chris gets <i>really</i> annoyed by Matthew's usage of <a href=\"/cwcki/Niggos\" title=\"Niggos\">the dreaded \"N\" word</a> and actually implies that he would try to kick Matthew's ass were they in the same room. At least, until Matthew reminds him <a href=\"/cwcki/Kick_the_Autistic\" title=\"Kick the Autistic\">which of the two was formerly in the USMC</a>, causing Chris to quickly backtrack on his threats.</li>\n<li>Out of nowhere, Chris suddenly brings up his experience of being restrained by his <a href=\"/cwcki/Bruce_Johnson\" title=\"Bruce Johnson\">elementary school principal</a> and teachers. This is probably yet another attempt to gain sympathy, but Matthew just considers it more evidence that Chris has serious problems, and points out how hypocritical it is for him to accuse Liquid of being the crazy one.</li>\n<li>Matt brings up Chris's first meeting with Kacey (and her sister), and accuses him of acting in an inappropriate \"touchy-feely\" manner, which Chris just flat-out denies being true. This leads to Matthew questioning Chris on where he would take Kacey on a date, and in turn how much he would tip the server. Chris's response indicates that he believes the \"15% rule\" <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">to be a cast-iron rule</a>, rather than just a rough guideline for tipping.</li>\n<li>Chris abruptly tries weaseling his way out of the call, partly because of how late at night it is, but also because he thinks Matthew is being disrespectful to <i>him</i>. After some back and forth regarding Kacey, the future of Chris's relationship to her, her song dedication video, and Chris's <a href=\"/cwcki/My_Half_of_A_Whole_New_World_for_Kacey\" title=\"My Half of A Whole New World for Kacey\">own version of the song</a>, Matthew snidely congratulates Chris on getting Kacey and Liquid back together.</li>\n<li>Kacey comes back one last time and rails at Chris for being disrespectful and generally full of shit, as Matthew attempts to hold back laughter. She mentions Chris failing to make her a comic (presumably what would become the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_Special_4\" title=\"Sonichu Special 4\">Gun Comic</a>) and instead making her a <i><a href=\"/cwcki/LittleBigPlanet\" title=\"LittleBigPlanet\">LittleBigPlanet</a></i> level. Kacey reveals Chris asked her for her phone number, which she refused to give him until her parents trusted him – Chris claims he would have come to her if he knew where she was – despite earlier in the call implying after Julie, he would not travel to see any girlfriends. During this, she compares him to Liquid, who she says would've driven to see her soon as he knew she was upset (Chris didn't bother during the call to ask how she was when talking to Matthew). Chris doesn't give a clear answer to any of her accusations, resulting in her storming out of the call for good. The tape runs out before the call actually ends, but it's clear by now that Chris has fucked up big time.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Video\">Video</span></h2>\n<center>\n<table style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa; background-color: #f9f9f9; color: black; margin: .5em auto .5em auto; padding: 0.2em; font-size:89%; width:260px;-moz-border-radius:10px\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFFF00\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size:110%; color:#008080;-moz-border-radius:10px\"><b>Father Call</b><br/>\n</td></tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<td colspan=\"2\"><div class=\"thumb embedvideo autoResize\" style=\"width: 328px;\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo autoResize\" style=\"\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideowrap youtube\" style=\"width: 320px\"><div class=\"embedvideo-consent\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo-consent__overlay\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo-consent__message\">Click to load content</div><!--\n--></div><!--\n--></div><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" data-src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Jhp5WyvPWNI\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"180\" loading=\"lazy\" modestbranding=\"1\" width=\"320\"></iframe></div><!--\n--></div><!--\n--></div>\n</td></tr>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#696969\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;-moz-border-radius:5px;color:#ffffff;\"><b>Stardate</b>\n</td>\n<td>4 November 2009\n</td></tr>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#696969\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;-moz-border-radius:5px;color:#ffffff;\"><b>Featuring</b>\n</td>\n<td><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris\" title=\"Chris\">Chris</a>; <a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey\" title=\"Kacey\">Kacey</a>\n</td></tr>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#696969\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;-moz-border-radius:5px;color:#ffffff;\"><b>Saga</b>\n</td>\n<td><span style=\"display:none\">Liquid</span><a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris\" title=\"Liquid\"><img alt=\"Liquid\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"32\" src=\"/w/images/8/85/Liquid_saga.png\" width=\"32\"/></a> Liquid Saga\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" style=\"background-color:#FFFF00; color:#008080; color:#008080;-moz-border-radius:10px; font-size:120%; padding:0.25em; text-align:center;\">Audio Recordings\n</td></tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%;\" valign=\"top\">\n<td><b>previous</b> <br/><a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey_Call_24\" title=\"Kacey Call 24\">Kacey Call 24</a>\n</td>\n<td><b>next</b> <br/><a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey_and_Liquid_Call\" title=\"Kacey and Liquid Call\">Kacey and Liquid Call</a>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n</center>\n<h3><span id=\"Matthew_Makes_the_Scene_.280:00-4:26.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Matthew_Makes_the_Scene_(0:00-4:26)\">Matthew Makes the Scene (0:00-4:26)</span></h3>\n<p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hello?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Hey, Chris, it's Kacey!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hi, Kacey, how are you?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Um, I'm cool, um, I'm over at my parents' house, cause, um, they wanted to call [<i>Chris speaks over her</i>] 'cause they saw some of your videos and I gave them the letter.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Okay, all right.

You know, it's kind of a stripper name, CrySTAL, it's kinda like Cristal, that champagne…\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> No, no, no, no, it would not, it would not, it would not be CriSTAL, it would be CrySTULL. Does that make sense?\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> It's still pretty close.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> It's fairly, it does sound close, but it's not, you're not, you're just replacing the C-R-Y-S-T-L-E <i>(yes, he misspelled that)</i>, you're replacing the L-E with an A-L.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> Yeah, but even so… you said this all came to you in a dream… dreams, they don't pay the bills. It's just a dream. That's all just from your head. I had a dream once where, you know, I was flying. You don't see me doing that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hm. Yeah, okay, but I mean, it's like in, yeah. Flying, yeah, you're definitely not going to be able to fly on your own. Sure. But it's like, you know, when you see a dream that's actually reasonable, that you can actually picture yourself doing in the future while you're awake. You know? It's like a career thing. You know, it's like, yeah, you definitely, it's like, you know, when your child, there's a chance you could become a cowboy if you dreamed of being a cowboy. But, you know, that may not be, that may seem kind of far-fetched, if you're living in a place that's not near or in Tetsas, but if you're like, if you dreamed you want, if you want, if you dreamed you wanted to be, to become a teacher, that's more likely, that's more likely possible. You can get the degree and become a teacher.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> So? If you want to go do it, be a teacher, go to work in an office, GO WORK IN AN OFFICE! Go apply to an office. Don't dream about it, dreams do nothing for you, they don't pay the bills.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I am taking, I have been, I have been working on that, and I have been taking action on looking for good jobs. Definitely looking in office jobs.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Prophetic_Dreams_and_Bob_Chandler_.2818:28-24:18.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Prophetic_Dreams_and_Bob_Chandler_(18:28-24:18)\">Prophetic Dreams and Bob Chandler (18:28-24:18)</span></h3>\n<p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> You think you have some kind of powers of prophecy?

I'm not saying that. But, you know, it's definitely something that, you know, it's definitely something that I feel that God has promised to me and <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_religion\" title=\"Chris and religion\">I believe in God</a>, I go to <a href=\"/cwcki/Wesley_Memorial_United_Methodist_Church\" title=\"Wesley Memorial United Methodist Church\">church</a> every Sunday, and like, like in…\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> That sounds like <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality#Chris_the_Goddess\" title=\"Chris and reality\">being a prophet</a> to me.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, well, yeah, you do, yeah, there are prophets that are mentioned in the Bible. \n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> Yes, but.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I'm not, I am not, I, but, I am not saying that I am a prophet. Not saying that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> Son, I go to church every Sunday too, and I've never had any kind of dreams of anything telling me that something is going to happen. God doesn't do that. God doesn't tell you things like that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, well, yeah, you never know, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, it'll just, it depends on the people, you know? You never know it, but you know, you might actually have gotten a message in a dream that may have actually [<i>brief interruption</i>] but you might, you might not have caught on as quickly, or… and I do not mean to insult you, but, ah, yeah, right now, conflicted by, you know, retrospect, you might actually realize that could have been a message from God.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> Naaaah… if you think you see the future, that sounds like you're trying to be a prophet. That doesn't really sound religious, that just sounds like some <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_religion#Chris_the_Shaman\" title=\"Chris and religion\">mumbo-jumbo</a> to me.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I'm not saying that it is the definite future, but that it is a POSSIBLE future.

And if it's not a message from God, you should go out, you should do it. Why don't you go- don't wait for it, it sounds like you're just sitting around waiting for it. When did you have this dream, exactly?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I pretty much, I pretty much had it when I was between seven and nine years old-\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> Seven-wh-TWENTY YEARS AGO? Excuse me? And nothing has happened between then and now?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> <i>[floundering]</i> I was definitely, like, in my <a href=\"/cwcki/Nathanael_Greene_Elementary_School\" title=\"Nathanael Greene Elementary School\">elementary school years</a>…\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> And you hold onto this dream… I mean, you're almost thirty, you're, you know… time is gonna start working against you, you know? I mean, life is short.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yes, it is.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> And you're living with your parents. I mean, what do you do all day, exactly?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, well, I get creative by uh, I like to <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_-_Hand_Drawn_Original\" title=\"CWC - Hand Drawn Original\">draw and color</a>. And uh, sometimes I like to create with my hands, you know, I <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Medallions_of_Fail\" title=\"Medallions of Fail\">sculpt</a>. And, uh even as far as, you know, just tinkering with, anything I like tinkering with. I even have-I am even <a href=\"/cwcki/I_Pimp_My_Ride.MOV\" title=\"I Pimp My Ride.MOV\">technologically smart</a>. I even took a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Computer\" title=\"Computer\">computer</a> upgrading class where I put together a computer, a personal computer, from scratch.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> So… why aren't you working building computers or something? It sounds like something you could do.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>ignoring this fairly good point</i>] Hm, yeah, it is. Hm. Well I pretty much did get started on the techno-savvy, I would say, from my father. He's a retired technical engineer, he worked for GE for a number of years, he also, uh, was in the, well he was stationed over in Korea in the Signal Corps [<i>pronounced \"corpse\"</i>]. He-he designed the controls for the plastic auto machines for his other achievements. So without him we would not have the plastic for, at the very least, your soda bottles.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> That's all fine and good, I mean, your father… but I'm not talking about your father, I'm talking about you.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I'm just pointing it out as hinting at my technological influence.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> But… you haven't done anything, unlike your father. That's what I'm getting here. That's not good, son. I mean, when I was 27 I already had a wife and kids, I was working 40 hours a week.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hmm… umm… yes, well, my father didn't marry-my father did not marry the first time till he was 30 himself.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> Yeah but you know, he probably also had a job and was living on his own, and he was also in the military, like me. So I don't really care about what your father did, because that's what he did, that's not what you did.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I understand-I understand th-I understand what you're talk-I understand… talking about… and, you know, and your point.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> Right.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I mean, I make a, I am trying to make a valid point myself. I feel like that, you know, we both are definitely understanding each other.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Kacey.27s_Boobs_and_Fame_.2824:18-33:24.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Kacey's_Boobs_and_Fame_(24:18-33:24)\">Kacey's Boobs and Fame (24:18-33:24)</span></h3>\n<p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> Really? I must say, I'm not really impressed, but, uh, let's move on. Let's talk a little bit about what you think about my lovely daughter. What was the first thing you liked or noticed about Kacey?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I noticed her beautiful face.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> Her beautiful face.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. And her blue-green eyes are like a pair of swimming pools that I would just love to swim around and bathe myself in.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> [<i>extremely uncomfortable laughter</i>]\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I am very poetic as well, just to let you know, sir.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> So the first thing you noticed was her appearance.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>Interrupting</i>] But also I definitely like to take note over time, over talking to her, one day that she was very smart and very fun to hang around with, and she definitely knows what she's talking about. If anything [<i>laughs</i>] she could be a little bit sm- she could be smarter than me <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ego\" title=\"Ego\">on some things</a>.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> But still, the first thing that, uh, you noticed, was her appearance. So, were you looking for like a trophy wife or something? It's kind of funny…\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>stuttering</i>] The first thing I noticed about her in person, when we talked first, you know, between phone calls and e-mails, after kind of an indirect meeting there, but anyway. I actually learned first that she was smart and very delightful to talk to. And then after a while, she and I met in person, and then I got to appreciate her face. And the-the smart, charming wit behind it.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> This doesn't really add up to what Kacey told me, you know. The impressions I got from what she said about your first little… \"encounter,\" we'll call it… she said she was a little bit… uncomfortable around you, you know? And apparently when you first talked to her, you actually were <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Kacey_Phone_Call\" title=\"Kacey Phone Call\">pretending to be somebody else</a>, actually. You know, that <a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris\" title=\"Liquid Chris\">other Chris</a>.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, well he was, that was another thing. Yeah. All right, yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> She didn't like that much.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> My friend <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Kim\" title=\"Kim\">Kim</a>, she helped me, uh, get into that Chris's e-mail account. Before I ever learned about Kacey-\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> You know, that Chris was her boyfriend at the time, you know? I mean, I've actually talked to that guy and met him in person, he's actually a pretty nice kid.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, but if you watch his <a href=\"/cwcki/YouTube\" title=\"YouTube\">YouTube</a> videos he does get a little crazy. But anyway for the past few months now… he was, you know, he was pretending to be me, and a few months ago, he pretends, or I'm assuming he pretends, that he gets kidnapped and tied up, and sent to the desert. And then Kacey tells me that cops <i>[incomprehensible]</i> in the desert, but I'm going off track here-\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> That just doesn't make any sense to me. Why would he pretend to be you? Someone like you, guy who lives with his parents.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Okay. Okay, first off, I'm Internet famous for being the original creator of the, uh… it's like a combination of <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog\" title=\"Sonic the Hedgehog\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> and Pikachu [<i>Kacey's Dad groans</i>], so I was the original creator of <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu\" title=\"Rosechu\">Rosechu</a>, the Electric Hedgehog Pokémon. And I created him on March 17, <a href=\"/cwcki/2000\" title=\"2000\">2000</a>, and I drew the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Comic\" title=\"Comic\">comic</a> books… I originally started that back in 2000, and I've drawn a few books and I'm still doing some drawing, I don't like to leave an unfinished project finished. But-\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> [<i>Has been trying to interrupt for the last 30 seconds</i>] Okay, so… you know, I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about? I barely know what Sonic the Hedgehog and Pokémon is other than it's kids' stuff. So basically what I'm getting here is you took two kids' things and put them together, you know, two <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_copyright\" title=\"Chris and copyright\">copyrighted</a> kids' things…\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> But it's making up a whole new character, and my father has the knowledge with the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Copyrights\" title=\"Copyrights\">copyrights</a> and whatnot, and he verifies for me that I have been in the clear the whole time, from the beginning, to uh, to continue on with Sonichu being m-Sonichu and Rosechu being my original creation. And I create the original stories and everything, and the books, and I've done the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia\" title=\"CWCipedia\">CWCipedia</a>, which was originally on the CWC Sonichu site speaking of which, CWC is my name, Christian Weston Chandler. Anyway, I've been going on with that since 2000, uh-\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> Which means you were 18 when you made this. You were what, a senior in high school? You were playing with kids' stuff? And that's what you've been doing for… what, you know, since then? You're 27 years old? You're playing with kids' stuff? I mean, like, little kids' stuff. I mean, like, ten-year-olds.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, well, it may sound like that, but in a sense, it was definitely a fad that I was, uh, enjoying, and, uh-\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> But fads, they come and go.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> -until when I had to like, uh, which was just a year and a half ago, I had to let that go, and I let that go a year and a half ago. But anyway, getting back to, uh…\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> You said it was popular, still. But you're not making any money off it. You're just doing this while you sit around in your parents' house for no real reason, because like I said, you're not making any money off this, and you still wanna be a boyfriend.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, but, it is a thing I’m doing to make money off of, I could be, it is a thing that I am working on starting to make money off of, I am in talks with the com- comic book company, as well as Nintendo of America, about, uh, you know, about possibly, about the likelihood of me being able to, uh, of, uh, us getting together… making money off of this, cuz, obviously, since 2000 it became more and more popular on the, uh, Internet, and I became Internet famous and, uh, along with a bunch of the fans like that, I was, ah…\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> Don’t you… don’t you need permission from both <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/SEGA\" title=\"SEGA\">SEGA</a>, and <a href=\"/cwcki/Nintendo\" title=\"Nintendo\">Nintendo</a>? I mean, is that, Sonic is from Sega, right? I mean, I know a little bit about what my daughter was… my little daughter used to talk about… I kinda know what a Sega is, I think.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Okay, yeah, I have talked to Sega as well, but anyway, getting back to, anyway, getting back to, if I may finish… yeah. Anyway, yeah, I got Internet famous, I got the fans, and then I got the naysayers which were the Internet bullies and trolls… and, uh… and uh, that Chris, and uh, Chris over there, was uh, he was one of them, and uh before, and this is, uh before I met Kacey he uh, he started pretending to be me, on the, in YouTube videos. And, uh… \n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> This… okay, I’m sorry, this is just getting completely ridiculous, all this Internet, I mean you just, all this Internet stuff, I don’t, I don’t know much about computers, but I mean, that’s just… this sounds like just a whole waste of time, that I don’t care about, because it doesn’t pay the bills, and it DOES NOT help support Ka- my Kacey.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I- I- I understand that.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"The_Shit_Hits_the_Fan_.2833:24-39:17.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Shit_Hits_the_Fan_(33:24-39:17)\">The Shit Hits the Fan (33:24-39:17)</span></h3>\n<p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> I mean, I was in the MILITARY.

That’s honorable. That is honorable.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> But… and then what- and then YOU, you made this… Son-ni-chu thing. I mean… it’s like… ah, this is, something’s, something’s not right here, you know? But, but, but since you did bring up YouTube, I got, I got kind of an interesting little thing… that I noticed, in one of your recent videos, heh. I mean, I don’t know what exactly you were thinking, with this, um… you know, you did <a href=\"/cwcki/Twin_Falling_Towers\" title=\"Twin Falling Towers\">that video with the, ah… 9/11</a>.

You gotta run fast enough so you can get all of it in before the batteries run out. That would take like… half an hour at most.

And lazy.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Okay, well, I admit I do have a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Buddha_belly\" title=\"Buddha belly\">Buddha belly</a>, but I am not lazy, I do get out and about, I exercise, I jog and work out, and I eat healthy.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> Doesn't show at all. How often do you watch TV? And you said you jog for fifteen minutes.

And I have listened to her about that, and I have been taking the appropriate steps and abiding with her words in mind and heeding her advice as such.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> Really... Because she's still pretty worried about you, she says. She think something's gonna happen to you, you know. She thinks it's not looking good. And didn't she, she told me you were on <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atorvastatin\" title=\"wikipedia:Atorvastatin\">Lipitor</a>?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hmm.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> I mean, I know about that stuff. That's something people my age take. I don't take it myself, but I know people who do.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, well, for your information, my doctor got me off, took me off Lipitor a couple of months ago.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> Really.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yes.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> I still don't think you… You still don't sound like you're terribly healthy. Okay, watching TV aside, and you play video games, how long do you do that a day, huh? I mean, with how much you sit around, your metabolism must not be so hot.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> How long...do I sit around? I would not say that I sit around that much. I would say...\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> And play... Okay, how much do you play video games?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> About two hours in a day.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> Two hours a day.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yes.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> Okay, so that's at least six hours you spend sitting around doing absolutely nothing in your room. That's a quarter of a day. In six hours you could have worked a part-time job.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, well, I, but, the time I do not spend in front of the television is the time I spend exercising. That's about half of the day.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> You do not spend half of a day exercising. If you spent half a day exercising, you would have at least lost that little Buddha belly and those man-tits of yours.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>offended by phrases he used himself moments ago</i>] Okay, now I'm feeling insulted with those, with what you just said there.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> And you just told me fifteen minutes, so you're lying again.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, well, maybe, yeah, well, fifteen minutes jogging, upon the pacing of the spacing of the jogging.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> Okay, so you don't even run fifteen minutes altogether, at one time?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> It's fifteen, they're, fifteen minutes, they're fifteen-minute intervals, like I do fifteen minutes in one hour, then the next hour I do another fifteen minutes of jogging.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> But that doesn't help you at all. All that… That means there's 45 minutes of you doing nothing every hour. By then your heart rate has gone down, the exercise is gonna do nothing for you.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> My heart rate has been, has been good.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> [<i>chuckles</i>]\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I can guarantee that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> Do you even know what you're talking about?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yes, I do, I am talking...\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> Do you even know how to check your heart rate?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yes I do.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> Okay, how?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I put my fingers on my pulse, count the number of beats through ten seconds, and then I multiply by six.

I, you know, Kacey probably wouldn't like that if you tipped her that much. I mean, you know she's a waitress, right? Tips are pretty important to...to waitresses.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yep, I understand that, tips are important. But still, 15% of 10 is a dollar fifty.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> Eee...that's true. Okay, so how much would you tip if you paid, say, $80 for dinner? Which is very possible, if you go to the kind of places Kacey likes to go.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hm...let's see, hm...that would be about $12.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> You, so you would just pay $12, you wouldn't go up to, like, y'know, you wouldn't even just toss them a twenty or something? Can you even <i>do</i> math?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Well, I cannot say that my family is of the <i>high-class, hoity-toity, rich type</i>, type of people. We are on average income.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> You could at least...they're not rich either, and they still left a twenty.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Well, good for them.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> You're not even on an income.

And that she told you, like about the McDonald's and the video games and that sort of thing, when I am so much better than that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> And I have not seen any of this, because...it probably doesn't exist.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> It does exist.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> I mean, telling the truth isn't...it's not made of, uh, y'know, Pokeymans and all that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> It is not.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> I mean, and how are you better than all this?

Not say you could be better.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> At least I am HONEST when I say I could be better. At least I don't go around lying, pretending that I am an astronaut.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> [<i>laughs in disbelief</i>] You're not! You're not being honest.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> No, I have been honest. Otherwise I would have said that I was an astronaut, but that would be lying. And I have not been lying this conversation.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> Would have been a pretty bad lie, too.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I know, but that's just an example off the top of my head at the moment.\n</p><p><font color=\"#009966\"><b>Matthew:</b></font> You don't even have the eyes to be an astronaut, I mean, c'mon.

You just sit around playing video games, you made a stupid <i>LittleBigPlanet</i> thing for me. I mean, come on. All I wanted was the damn comic, all I wanted was you just to pay attention.
