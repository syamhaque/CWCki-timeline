I apologize for not picking up or e-mailing the past couple of days/nights; I went out to Fridays for a drink Thursday evening; made two new friends; a 22-year old pretty woman who's going through a divorce currently (lucky) and her best male friend. I also made a friendship with the owner of Fridays; I got a bit loud in the main drunk part, but she was a nice woman. Friday I went to FriAft5; I lured out a Troll who took a photo of me in front of me with a warning of \"Sorry, Dude, but I gotta take this\". I should have gone after him, but my only plan was to snap his picture back with my DSi camera, and I did not have a pursuit plan in my head. I later thought one up, putting aside the Snapping the Troll plan; next time, I WILL pursue, stare him down and make the S.O.B. delete the photo. No doubt the photo is on the Cwcki now, but I'm not going to give them their sick pleasure of attention. I did the sign again, but I added, \"Friendly and Naughty\", onto it. It worked better; I actually got the attention of a pretty woman with no ring on her hand; she seemed spanish to me. Anyway, between BOTH nights, I felt really sleepy and crashed early.\n</p><p>From the signage experience yesterday, I have later thought of what I have learned from the new trial; the sign worked better with Adjectives of Myself. Then on the way home, I hear on the John Tesh Radio Show ways of bettering the Online Dating Profile. Instead of stating what you want in your partner, TALK ABOUT YOURSELF in Selling Yourself like a New Car. I have a new idea now, instead of a sign stating of the \"Single Man Zone\" or \"I Need a Woman\", it will consist of Positive Adjectives of myself, THEN women who read it will have a chance to learn about me from the adjectives, and a better probable chance of getting them to hang out with me and converse.\n</p><p>In another note, I searched for Extra Kratos MNR Codes from the Gamestops around town; obviously most of them did not have any, but the one in Fashion Square HAD a FULL set of them leftover. The Mystery Mods with All of them though were All Gophers, so I am looking to trade them for the remaining two Mystery Mods need, the Cowboy and the Mouse. They Mystery Mod can be learned without Full Redemption of the code by entering the code, then the M.M. comes up, press Circle to back up all the way, and the code is Still Valid. Sadly, the Preorder Codes all expire tomorrow, so I have some Work to do.\n</p><p>I have just tried directly over the PSN in the ModSpot; no takers, just a bunch of youngsters playing around. So, I'm now going to try the GameFAQs MNR Board to offer the Trade. If you can find me any leads, I would appreciate it.\n</p><p>I'll TTYL.

Has anything recently given cause for [REDACTED] to do what he did? Perhaps there was a lack of sexual or lovey-dovey energy between you two mutually; [REDACTED] may have felt a loss of that \"Spark\". He may have had a hard time getting it up for you, so he sought outside influence to make himself ready for you.

I suddenly felt the inspiration to get in contact with Mr. Koste (Principal) of Manchester High, so right now I am looking for his e­mail address.  I REALLY want this Reunion to Happen.  I still have my dreams of being back at M.H.S. taking classes again, and hanging out in my Newberry Towne Home, plus recently I created new mods: Two M.H.S. Basketball Players, a Varsity Cheerleader (all nameless; the\nCheerleader's face was based from old friend Laura Dorazio), myself from 1996 (when both of my eyes were blue) complete with M.H.S. Sweatshirt and my \"M.G.R.\" and Honor Roll Star Pins in the center of my embroided \"M\"s, a Mod with the M.H.S. Sweatshirt and \"M\"s (No Pins), and Bionic the Hedgehog.  And I created a Manchester High School (Party) Bus, with my initials on the upper back, and underneath a message, \"Class of 2000 Reunion Required Now!!!\".\n</p><p>So, currently, I am going to PUSH for the Reunion by insisting I talk to Mr. Koste, having him find the C.O.2000 student who put together the Seinor Prom, and getting him/her to put together the Reunion (Hopefully it can be arranged to be held in the M.H.S.

This morning, though, I created a new track; Cwcville 5/5 Beach; it is Awesome; first you're driving through a crowded beach with tents and umbrellas, then fighting a bit of street traffic; a dash through the mall, drift around the Lighthouse and off the cliff and into the Ocean (but not too deep; I have to have the track kept up to a certain level versus the water; otherwise the drivers would drown). You're dodging the other Boats puttering about as you drive through the twists and turns; there's an optional shortcut through the pirate ship wreck. It is Wild, Wet fun on the open seas.\n</p><p>I also put together another track I got from a dream; going uphill a central mountain with ModNation Castle on it with the city surrounding it, and a scenic only view of the ModSpot across from. It's okay; I let the computer autopopulate the track with the gameplay; item pods, devestators, etc.\n</p><p>And I created two Troll Mods (one male and one female), based on the flying little devils which infested my Tripod Site Warehouse in my 10th Book. In the details of each Troll, I added a word of advice in Internet Safety and Prevention of getting Trolled.\n</p><p>And I created a \"TrollBusters\" Truck; \"We're here to Bust the CyberBullying/Trolling Terror around the world.\" I souped up a garbage truck with radar, foglight and such, and I wrote a message on the back, \"CyberBullying is Not Cool!!!\" And in the license plate, \"Troll And Die.\" And the TrollBusters name and Logo are on both sides of the truck.\n</p><p>I'll be going out to eat with my family in a bit.\n</p><p>I want to be good back at you, so take tonight and tomorrow night off; don't worry about calling me.

And on that topic, when I said I had drawn a few drawings in the set number of days in a row, I didn't. The only things I've drawn recently were the rorschach-like free-style drawings and the circle-jerking drawings for Jackie. I have told my mother and father of that Friday Night when I attempted to snap the photo of Michael for a dartboard and got caught, but I still have not told them of my past PS3 being fully-functional before its destruction. And the past times when I said I applied for a job at anywhere at Fashion Square and Barnes &amp; Nobles; all lies. Damn all of those trolls for smearing my once good name soo bad that any background check would fail for me and NO JOB for the Christian Man! And I WOULD do things in the community to better my name, but I do not have any ideas of what I could do that would be even considered Television-News-Worthy that would better my rep. Another thing I liked about my High School years better than my adult life, I was not aware of the Social Reputations, or the \"Social Rules\", Status and such, and that state of mind continued on into up to when it started to matter after I've learned of the Trolls in November of 2K7.
