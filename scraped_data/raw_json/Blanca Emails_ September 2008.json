BTW,\nRosechu has been 18 since <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_5\" title=\"Sonichu 5\">Comic #5</a>; I've made the official correction\nstatement on Sonichu.net as well.\n</p><p>And on the Sonichu game front, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/JKProductions\" title=\"JKProductions\">JKProductions</a> said they got a \"notice\"\nfrom <a href=\"/cwcki/Nintendo\" title=\"Nintendo\">Nintendo</a> and Sega for JKProductions NOT to make any games of\nSonichu or Rosechu. So I'm dropping JKProductions with due respect.\nAnd I will wait to talk to Nintendo and SEGA for myself.

It pissed me\noff.\n</p><p>Aside from the stress, the #8 Comic is progressing well; I will add 3\nor 4 pages to the \"Spring Break\" Episode to depict the turning of ages\nfor all the Electric-Hedgehogs drawn up to now.

If so, you\nmay have a problem of staying awake during those classes. I've found\nAfternoon classes were better for me, because I was able to get more\nsleep, and I was more able to stay awake during those classes.\n</p><p>If it helps, you think of me being there with you in your classes,\nencouraging you to keep paying attention; this is important.

Honestly, and confidentially\nbetween you and me, I see the \"official\" videos from companies such as\n<a href=\"/cwcki/Sex_toys\" title=\"Sex toys\">Adam&amp;Eve</a>, not solely as a turn-on, but as a good education of what may\nbe done during the act. I also appreciate it more as a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Virgin\" title=\"Virgin\">virgin</a>, because\nit allows me to create a better idea for when I actually do it for my\nfirst time. And obviously I have seen a fair share in my adult years. I\nwould rather be well-advised about it and the practices of safe-sex\nthan be dumb on anything on the topic. But if you do not feel\ncomfortable with seeing pornographic videos, I will not ask anymore\nbeyond this paragraph. If I've made you feel uncomfortable, I humbly\napologize.

If you'd like, I am willing to offer my couch in\nmy bedroom for you to sleep on during your stay, although my room, and\na chunk of my house is cluttered.

You can meet\nmy <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Mother\" title=\"Mother\">mother</a> and father, chat with them a while and get to know each\nother. Then you and I, we can go upstairs to my bedroom to just hang\nout, watch <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/TV\" title=\"TV\">TV</a>, or chat a while. Maybe even some <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Video_game\" title=\"Video game\">video gameplay</a> with\n<a href=\"/cwcki/Guitar_Hero\" title=\"Guitar Hero\">Guitar Hero</a> or something. For dinner that evening, our First Date, I\nwill take you out to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/McDonalds\" title=\"McDonalds\">McDonalds</a>, Arbys, Burger King, or a small\nrestaurant like that. Then I'd let you go back to your hotel, or bring\nyou back home. NO SEX on the first night, but if you'd like to make\nout, I'd welcome it.\n</p><p>The Second Day: If you're in a hotel room, I would bring my PS2 or 3,\nand we can play some more and hang with each other some more. If at\nhome, we can still play and hang. For Lunch, I'd take you to this good\nall-you-can-eat Pizza/Salad/Soup/Desert Buffet that I know of in\nCharlottesville, then we can take in a Romantic Movie at the theater,\nor we can walk the Downtall Mall, and/or a walk in the park. I hope\nI'm painting a good picture for you. If we take in the movie, you and\nI can sit in the back, darker area. And if it doesn't bother you, I\nmay \"Yawn and stretch\" my arm around you to your other shoulder. If\nyou want to take it further, you may pull my hand on your shoulder a\nlittle closer to your breast (of course, this is optional), and I'd let\nyou cop a reach into the popcorn bucket, or under that to cop a feel.\nStop me if I'm bothering you any. And you and I can make out in the\ntheater. And if you feel like it that night in the privacy of mine or\nyour room, you can take my virginity, or we can wait till the third\nnight, if there is one before you have to go back to Kentucky. Either\nway, I would wear a condom then, and in the future until our Wedding\nNight. :)\n</p><p>And basically, I'd try to be better or equal for each future dates\nbeyond that. :) I hope I've put a smile on your face after the wild\nimaginings from those first two dates. :)\n</p><p>You may offer your humble feedback to all that in your reply.\n</p><p>Also, I would like to ask you, should you be here on a Sunday Morning,\nwould you be willing to come with me to my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Methodist_Church\" title=\"Methodist Church\">Methodist Church</a> as a\nVisitor?

After the First Playback; then it is good for 24 Hours from that\nvery second. The movie/show file will remain playable until the Expiration Time, when after that moment, the file will NO\nLONGER be playable.
