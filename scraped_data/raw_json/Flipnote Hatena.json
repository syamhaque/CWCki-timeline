Other users could comment on them either by text, or by creating a Flipnote of their own.\n</p><p>In <a href=\"/cwcki/June_2010\" title=\"June 2010\">June 2010</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris\" title=\"Chris\">Chris</a> was spotted at a <a href=\"/cwcki/Fridays_After_Five\" title=\"Fridays After Five\">Fridays After Five</a> event in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Charlottesville\" title=\"Charlottesville\">Charlottesville</a>. Among some very disturbing behavior, Chris was seen playing with his DSi for some time. It later came to light that, after <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/June062010.MOV\" title=\"June062010.MOV\">leaving the Internet forever</a>, he was now spending his time on Flipnote Hatena, drawing comments in reply to various Flipnotes. <a href=\"/cwcki/Na%C3%AFve\" title=\"Naïve\">Naïve</a> as ever, he helped <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">a valiant troll</a> to find him by registering with his full name. \n</p><p>After a little more than two weeks of shameless self-promotion and sharing his creepy sex fantasies with the world, Chris got himself banned. Chris's account became active again on 24 July, prior to the service ending on 31 <a href=\"/cwcki/May_2013\" title=\"May 2013\">May 2013</a>.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Chris's_Flipnote_career\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris's Flipnote career</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Chris's_Flipnotes_Return...\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris's Flipnotes Return...</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#...and_Then_Depart_Again\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">...and Then Depart Again</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Flipnote_Studio_3D\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Flipnote Studio 3D</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Chris's_Flipnotes\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris's Flipnotes</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Chris's_Comments\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris's Comments</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Chris's_Favorites\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris's Favorites</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Sockpuppets\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Sockpuppets</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span id=\"Chris.27s_Flipnote_career\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris's_Flipnote_career\">Chris's Flipnote career</span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:279px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:FlipnoteSonichu.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"213\" src=\"/w/images/e/e5/FlipnoteSonichu.png\" width=\"277\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:FlipnoteSonichu.png\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Further proof that Sonichu will dominate every aspect of Chris's life until the day he dies.</div></div></div>\n<p>Predictably, Chris's first contribution to the Flipnote community was a picture of <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(character)\" title=\"Sonichu (character)\">Sonichu</a>, posted on 17 June 2010. Over the next two weeks, he added several more Flipnotes featuring a mixture of his trademarks: whining about <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">trolls</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Random-access_humor\" title=\"Random-access humor\">random-access humor</a>.\n</p><p>Chris's Flipnotes freely <a href=\"/cwcki/Parody\" title=\"Parody\">swiped</a> from various sources of \"inspiration.\" He <a href=\"/cwcki/Things_Chris_has_ripped_off\" title=\"Things Chris has ripped off\">ripped off</a> some other users' Flipnotes almost wholesale, uses bases for his works, and even plagiarized the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/1983\" title=\"1983\">1983</a> animated <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Peanuts\" title=\"Peanuts\">Peanuts</a></i> cartoon \"Sally at School\" to produce two of his shorts. He stole the dialogue from the first few minutes almost verbatim (the word \"princess\" is replaced with \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Women%27s_rights\" title=\"Women's rights\">sexy, beautiful woman</a>\" because Chris has <a href=\"/cwcki/Love_Quest\" title=\"Love Quest\">a one-track mind</a>) and used them in <a href=\"/cwcki/Official_Videobooks\" title=\"Official Videobooks\">his crude animations</a>.\n</p><p>At the same time, he also posted a number of comments on other Flipnotes (excerpted below) and added a lot of stars on his own creations to give himself praise.\n</p><p>On 29 June 2010, Chris first drew the attention of the site's administrators when they removed several of his rule-infringing Flipnotes. For example, <a href=\"/cwcki/RomanticLabyrinth\" title=\"RomanticLabyrinth\">RomanticLabyrinth</a> was taken down for being disturbingly sexual. Other Flipnotes were removed from the site for other reasons – Chris autographing many of his Flipnotes infringes their rule about sharing personal information, and several of his other Flipnotes infringed intellectual property rights.\n</p><p>Over the next few days, Chris failed to get the message and repeatedly re-uploaded several of his deleted Flipnotes. On the third version of RomanticLabyrinth, Chris accused the trolls of trying to make him look like a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Homo\" title=\"Homo\">homo</a>, and stubbornly tried to reupload the Flipnote to prove otherwise. The site's administrators ran out of patience on 2 July 2010 and banned him.\n</p><p>Note that the moderators of the site were, by nature of their position, no doubt well aware of how trolling and various other forms of Internet harassment work. Despite what Chris would have you believe, they would never have punished him for what someone else did in his comments section. Unlike Chris, they didn't have an effectively infinite amount of time to dick around on the Internet, so they wouldn't take kindly to flag abuse, either. Someone didn't give him exactly what he wanted, so he decided to go out of his way to flip his shit and ended up getting himself banned, without ever understanding the reasons for being banned, from yet another public venue that <a href=\"/cwcki/The_GAMe_PLACe\" title=\"The GAMe PLACe\">dozens</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Charlottesville_Fashion_Square\" title=\"Charlottesville Fashion Square\">hundreds</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Piedmont_Virginia_Community_College\" title=\"Piedmont Virginia Community College\">thousands</a>, or <a href=\"/cwcki/YouTube\" title=\"YouTube\">millions</a> of people use every day without issue, proving once again that <a href=\"/cwcki/Kick_the_Autistic\" title=\"Kick the Autistic\">no one can troll Chris better than Chris himself</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Chris.27s_Flipnotes_Return...\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris's_Flipnotes_Return...\">Chris's Flipnotes Return...</span></h2>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">After the week was over, and I was able to again access the Hatena from my DSi, I had previously unlinked my DSi from my past account and relinked it to a New account with a different name.\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:11px; padding:0 0 0 16px; vertical-align:bottom; width:20px\">”\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\" style=\"font-size:smaller; padding:8px 36px; text-align:right;\"><cite>Chris, on <a href=\"/cwcki/Jackie_E-mails_3\" title=\"Jackie E-mails 3\">ban evasion</a></cite>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>Showing once again that he never learns, on 24 July a number of Chris's Flipnotes reappeared, including the \"tame\" version of RomanticLabyrinth. This time, though, he disabled comments on all his submissions, perhaps working on the assumption that it was the comments from viewers (and not the content of his Flipnotes) that led to his original ban.\n</p><p>Within two days after Chris's return to the site, several of his Flipnotes disappeared from his account, including RomanticLabyrinth and others that had been deleted before for violating the TOS. He later reuploaded the deleted Flipnotes. After the <i>sixth time</i> of reuploading these animations, none of them were taken down. Either this was because the mods got tired of dealing with his bullshit, or because <a href=\"/cwcki/Weens\" title=\"Weens\">vigilantes</a> had given up reporting them.\n</p><p>On 10 June, almost a year later, Chris made a <a href=\"/cwcki/3DS_Flipnote\" title=\"3DS Flipnote\">3DS Flipnote</a> complaining about how Nintendo wasn't making an update for the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_3DS\" title=\"wikipedia:Nintendo 3DS\">3DS</a> fast enough for his liking.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"...and_Then_Depart_Again\">...and Then Depart Again</span></h3>\n<p>On 31 May 2013, Flipnote Hatena was shut down, with Flipnotes now no longer visible from either the official site or the application itself. Luckily, Chris's Flipnotes have been mirrored on <a href=\"/cwcki/YouTube\" title=\"YouTube\">YouTube</a>. In total, Chris made twelve Flipnotes, got 24,465 views, received 22,482 stars, and received 604 comments.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Flipnote_Studio_3D\">Flipnote Studio 3D</span></h2>\n<p>On 13 <a href=\"/cwcki/March_2013\" title=\"March 2013\">March 2013</a>, it was announced that the DSi incarnation of Flipnote Hatena would be shut down on 31 May, in favor of another incarnation for the Nintendo 3DS, called Flipnote Studio 3D. It was released in Japan on 24 <a href=\"/cwcki/July_2013\" title=\"July 2013\">July 2013</a>, and after plenty of pushbacks and anticipation was released in <a href=\"/cwcki/February_2015\" title=\"February 2015\">February 2015</a> for American <a href=\"/cwcki/Club_Nintendo\" title=\"Club Nintendo\">Club Nintendo</a> users as a going-away present for the program's shutdown in <a href=\"/cwcki/June_2015\" title=\"June 2015\">June 2015</a>, nearly two years after its Japanese release. Owing to Chris's prior interest in the application and his current ownership of a 3DS, it seemed likely that he would join the new community, especially considering how he gushed about the game a day later on <a href=\"/cwcki/Facebook\" title=\"Facebook\">Facebook</a>.\n</p><p>Of particular note is that while the worldwide version of Flipnote Studio 3D is entirely free, the original Japanese version allows one to view and upload their creations online to other users, but would cost a monthly fee. Owing to Chris's <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_money\" title=\"Chris and money\">spending habits</a>, it is unknown if he used this version. Flipnote Studio 3D also allowed one to download previous Flipnotes made on Hatena, a feature that Chris could've abused.\n</p><p>Aside from using <a href=\"/cwcki/Miiverse\" title=\"Miiverse\">Miiverse</a> to spam the community with his <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_Boom_Protests\" title=\"Sonic Boom Protests\">Sonic Boom Protests</a>, he never reuploaded his old Flipnotes, including RomanticLabyrinth. Either he learned his lesson, or he was simply too lazy to try and reupload it again (most likely the latter).\n</p><p>Flipnote Studio 3D's online functionality was closed on 2 April 2018 without Chris doing anything of note.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Chris.27s_Flipnotes\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris's_Flipnotes\">Chris's Flipnotes</span></h2>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_Flipnotes\" title=\"List of Flipnotes\">List of Flipnotes</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<h2><span id=\"Chris.27s_Comments\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris's_Comments\">Chris's Comments</span></h2>\n<p>Chris's comments on Flipnote Hatena, much like his comments elsewhere on the Internet, were self-centered and devoid of any follow-up. \n</p>\n<center><ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\">\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\"><div style=\"width: 155px\">\n<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><div style=\"margin:30px auto;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Flipnote_Comment-Boo.png\"><img alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"90\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/2/2e/Flipnote_Comment-Boo.png/120px-Flipnote_Comment-Boo.png\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/2/2e/Flipnote_Comment-Boo.png/180px-Flipnote_Comment-Boo.png 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/2/2e/Flipnote_Comment-Boo.png/240px-Flipnote_Comment-Boo.png 2x\" width=\"120\"/></a></div></div>\n<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n<p>\"Boo!\"\n</p>\n</div>\n</div></li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\"><div style=\"width: 155px\">\n<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><div style=\"margin:30px auto;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Flipnote_Comment-Louder.png\"><img alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"90\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/3/3c/Flipnote_Comment-Louder.png/120px-Flipnote_Comment-Louder.png\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/3/3c/Flipnote_Comment-Louder.png/180px-Flipnote_Comment-Louder.png 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/3/3c/Flipnote_Comment-Louder.png/240px-Flipnote_Comment-Louder.png 2x\" width=\"120\"/></a></div></div>\n<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n<p>\"Could you make the voice louder + easier to comprehend, please?\"\n</p>\n</div>\n</div></li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\"><div style=\"width: 155px\">\n<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><div style=\"margin:30px auto;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Flipnote_Comment-My_Trolls.png\"><img alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"90\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/1/18/Flipnote_Comment-My_Trolls.png/120px-Flipnote_Comment-My_Trolls.png\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/1/18/Flipnote_Comment-My_Trolls.png/180px-Flipnote_Comment-My_Trolls.png 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/1/18/Flipnote_Comment-My_Trolls.png/240px-Flipnote_Comment-My_Trolls.png 2x\" width=\"120\"/></a></div></div>\n<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n<p>\"My Trolls did that to my <a href=\"/cwcki/Category:Chris%27s_websites\" title=\"Category:Chris's websites\">past websites</a> too.
