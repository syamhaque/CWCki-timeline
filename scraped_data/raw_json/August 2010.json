It began rather silently, with Chris hooked on <i><a href=\"/cwcki/ModNation_Racers\" title=\"ModNation Racers\">ModNation Racers</a></i> to the point where it seemed bigger than <i><a href=\"/cwcki/LittleBigPlanet\" title=\"LittleBigPlanet\">LittleBigPlanet</a></i> to him. However, a field agent's account of Chris at <a href=\"/cwcki/Charlottesville_Fashion_Square\" title=\"Charlottesville Fashion Square\">Charlottesville Fashion Square</a> revealed that Chris's hatred of the <a href=\"/cwcki/HEXBox\" title=\"HEXBox\">HEXBox</a> has risen to a new level when he saw Chris kicking a stall of Xbox 360 games while saying \"kick that hex-bawx\". Later, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bob\" title=\"Bob\">Bob</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Barb\" title=\"Barb\">Barb</a> (now thinner) were spotted eating at Chick-Fil-A. \n</p><p>For the most part, August 2010 was a very quiet month with little <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Internet\" title=\"Internet\">Internet</a> activity from Chris. However, towards the end, things would be blown wide open when <a href=\"/cwcki/Matthew_Nobles_call\" title=\"Matthew Nobles call\">a phone call audio</a> is released between <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler\" title=\"Bob Chandler\">Bob Chandler</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Alec_Benson_Leary\" title=\"Alec Benson Leary\">a worker at the GAMe PLACe</a>, revealing a number of things, including that his parents didn't know about his trespassing incident and that they feel that <a href=\"/cwcki/Michael_Snyder\" title=\"Michael Snyder\">Michael Snyder</a> is leading a conspiracy against their neighborhood and Chris in particular.\n</p><p>Also, to add to the newfound wave of activity from Chris, on August 27, Chris would break his vow of staying off the Internet in order to post <a href=\"/cwcki/EXCLUSIVE_Manchester_High_School_2000_Reunion_Required_NOW\" title=\"EXCLUSIVE Manchester High School 2000 Reunion Required NOW\">a video</a> demanding that his high school reunion happen. Also <a href=\"/cwcki/Stardate,_August_27,_2010\" title=\"Stardate, August 27, 2010\">there was a video</a> explaining that his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PS3\" title=\"PS3\">PS3</a> has been reformatted and the trolls have won. Two days later, to the joy of <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">people</a> everywhere, he <a href=\"/cwcki/The_MovingFoward_videos\" title=\"The MovingFoward videos\">trashes the bricked PS3</a>, subjecting it to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/I%27LL_BREAK_YOU_DEAD\" title=\"I'LL BREAK YOU DEAD\">all sorts of destructive acts</a> before <a href=\"/cwcki/ItIsFinished.MOV\" title=\"ItIsFinished.MOV\">violently finishing it off the next day</a> with his <a href=\"/cwcki/Son-Chu\" title=\"Son-Chu\">car</a>. All of this in <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_and_Tito_PS3_E-mails\" title=\"Clyde and Tito PS3 E-mails\">an attempt to get money from</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">Clyde Cash</a>. After the tragic loss of his beloved PS3, on the final day of August, Chris was sighted in public again, staring creepily at a young woman, awaiting his prize reward. Aside from this, Chris definitely ensured that August 2010 went out with a bang.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Events_of_August_2010\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Events of August 2010</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Activity\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Activity</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Audio\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Audio</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Chats\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chats</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Posts\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Posts</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Videos\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Videos</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Events_of_August_2010\">Events of August 2010</span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:PreCar2.JPG\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"225\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/8/85/PreCar2.JPG/300px-PreCar2.JPG\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/8/85/PreCar2.JPG/450px-PreCar2.JPG 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/8/85/PreCar2.JPG/600px-PreCar2.JPG 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:PreCar2.JPG\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Chris's <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PS3\" title=\"PS3\">PS3</a> on <b>29 August</b>, moments before he <a href=\"/cwcki/Random-access_humor\" title=\"Random-access humor\">hard drives</a> over it.</div></div></div>\n<ul><li><b>1 August</b> - Chris resists <a href=\"/cwcki/Jackie\" title=\"Jackie\">Jackie</a>'s suggestion that he sell many of his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Games\" title=\"Games\">games</a>.

Due to a miscommunication (the support lady, who had bad headphones, misheard him saying \"Formatting the Hard Drive\" as \"System File Recovery\", and he assumed that only meant the system's hard drive and not his external HDD), he goes through with the process, and once it's done, is shocked to see that all of the media he'd been saving for years got wiped.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup></li>\n<li>Chris makes <a href=\"/cwcki/EXCLUSIVE_Manchester_High_School_2000_Reunion_Required_NOW\" title=\"EXCLUSIVE Manchester High School 2000 Reunion Required NOW\">a new video</a> about getting a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/High_school\" title=\"High school\">high school</a> reunion organized, adding his two cents about <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">cyberbullying</a>.
