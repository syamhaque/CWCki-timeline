Having channels constantly flagged down on YouTube, he had to censor certain episodes of the cartoon and put the uncensored video files on Dailymotion. He was also a judge for the <a href=\"/cwcki/SingStar_Challenge\" title=\"SingStar Challenge\">SingStar Challenge</a>, due to being selected by <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Liquid\" title=\"Liquid\">Liquid</a>.\n</p><p>He ended the series once his interest in Chris dropped off, but the show's abandonment was also influenced by constant drama with voice actors and writers. In one episode of a podcast called Sleepycast, Spazkid revealed that another reason why he abruptly stopped the series was because he felt that Chris's life had become more depressing to the point where Spazkid starting feeling bad for him, especially when he found out about Chris's <a href=\"/cwcki/Transgender\" title=\"Transgender\">tomgirl</a> transformation and the death of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bob\" title=\"Bob\">Bob</a>, though he still thinks its funny that Chris still freaks out about Sonic to this day. He mentioned that he still gets tweets from die-hard fans asking him if he could bring back the series, but he wants them to let it die.\n</p>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">Chris-Chan is—he’s an enigma which to so many people—they thought he was a troll.

For four years, it ran for two seasons, with the first season consisting of 10 episodes and the second having one episode split into two parts. The series mocks Chris by making him look like a bigger idiot than he already is and with him always ending up in each episode being killed, injured, humiliated or doing something disgusting/stupid. Unlike the comics, Chris rarely wins and is rightfully told off many times, except by Sonichu, who loves and adores his \"father\"... <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">maybe a little too much</a>.\n</p><p>Since the series is a mashup of Chris's real-life adventures and his comics, many plot elements are taken from both Christorical <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sagas\" title=\"Sagas\">sagas</a> and the <i>Sonichu</i> comic. These events are usually heavily exaggerated for comedic effect. Many characters from both sagas and his comics make appearances such as Rosechu, <a href=\"/cwcki/Jimmy_Hill\" title=\"Jimmy Hill\">Jimmy Hill</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Schroeder\" title=\"Megan Schroeder\">Megan</a>, etc. The series also does things that Chris would absolutely hate, such as making Sonichu be abusive to Rosechu, him and Sonichu being engaged in gay sexual acts, most of his female characters having manly voices and appearances, and even Chris being raped by a black guy. \n</p><p>The series was animated in <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Paint\" title=\"wikipedia:MS Paint\">MS Paint</a>, with the style being reminiscent of <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ren_%26_Stimpy_Show\" title=\"wikipedia:The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show\"><i>Ren &amp; Stimpy</i></a> in that the characters are often drawn as more grotesque than they already are. It is also noted that many of the characters are drawn differently each time they are on screen. This may be a reference to how Chris's characters <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_art\" title=\"Chris and art\">never look the same in any drawings he does</a>. Animation wise, the show is often crude and simplistic for both comedic effect and in order to save time in creating episodes.\n</p><p><a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris\" title=\"Liquid Chris\">Liquid Chris</a> also contributed to the series, providing the voice of Chris in some episodes since he was at the time one of the few people who could imitate Chris perfectly. When it wasn't Liquid doing the voice, it was either Spazkid or <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCki\" title=\"CWCki\">CWCki</a> editor <a href=\"/cwcki/User:PhinnyCupcakes\" title=\"User:PhinnyCupcakes\">PhinnyCupcakes</a>. In some instances, audio clips from Chris's various videos, such as \"<a href=\"/cwcki/So_Need_a_Cute_Girl\" title=\"So Need a Cute Girl\">So Need a Cute Girl</a>,\" \"<a href=\"/cwcki/I_am_STRAIGHT#Part_2\" title=\"I am STRAIGHT\">I am STRAIGHT</a>\" and \"<a href=\"/cwcki/For_Julie%27s_Eyes_Only\" title=\"For Julie's Eyes Only\">For Julie's Eyes Only</a>\" were used.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References_by_Chris\">References by Chris</span></h3>\n<p>Chris mentioned the series when he was asked by <a href=\"/cwcki/Joshua_Martinez\" title=\"Joshua Martinez\">Joshua Martinez</a> in <a href=\"/cwcki/April_2009\" title=\"April 2009\">April 2009</a>.

After 4 hours of anal sex, Sonichu and Rosechu walk to meet chris Chris and run into Blake, who is publicly having sex with a <a href=\"/cwcki/Officer_Nasty\" title=\"Officer Nasty\">blowup doll</a>. Sonichu and him get into a spat, and Chris shows up to stop the nonsense. Sonichu is excited by his father's appearance as a 'censored' image fills the screen, as the narrator verbally depicts Sonichu sucking on Chris's manboobs. A Jerkop (<b><a href=\"/cwcki/Niggos\" title=\"Niggos\">a black one!</a></b>) appears to stop their intimacy.\n</p><p>The episode ends on this cliffhanger, the Narrator asking the audience if the Jerkop will be stopped, if Megan will be freed from the mirror, and if the seven Sonichus will ever be found. The first and second conflicts are resolved later on in the series, and the third is a nod to Dragon Ball Z, never further elaborated on past the joke. This end format is pulled straight from DBZ itself and most of the first few episodes end with rhetorical questions which are never answered.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Episode_2\">Episode 2</span></h3>\n<p>The episode opens with Sonichu and Rosechu ready to fight the Jerkop, who orders them to buy him <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_race\" title=\"Chris and race\">KFC</a>. Chris steps in and uses his Sonichu medallion to transform into <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris-chan_Sonichu\" title=\"Chris-chan Sonichu\">Chris-chan Sonichu</a> (depicted as Chris with a blue Pikachu-ear hat) and fight. Chris is raped and urinated on (<i>censored cuz of YouTube</i>, of course). The aftermath shows Chris laying facedown covered in filth, declaring \"all in a day's work!\" The Next Day, the trio are at the mall, Chris being seen with the <a href=\"/cwcki/The_Oversized_Drinking_Straw_of_Fail\" title=\"The Oversized Drinking Straw of Fail\">straw</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Attraction_Sign\" title=\"Attraction Sign\">sign</a>.

Chris exclaims it would be great if an orgy like that were a game. With encouragement from Sonichu, Chris sends in his idea and meets with Nintendo executives. They harshly turn him down, while Chris naively believes they will consider his Sonichu idea. Off-screen, the executive defecates on Chris's face and Chris ends up in the hospital with salmonella.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Episode_4\">Episode 4</span></h3>\n<p>Episode 4, \"Chris Chan Saves the Planet (Not Really)\" begins with an attempt at a recap of the last episode before cutting to Chris in his room playing Guitar Hero. Chris thanks Sonichu fans for helping him win a <a href=\"/cwcki/GameStop\" title=\"GameStop\">GameStop</a> gift card and how he now has the chance of appearing in a future Guitar Hero game. He goes on the internet to check on his fans. Watching an episode of The Animated Series, Chris becomes angry and craps himself. Chris then checks on his <a href=\"/cwcki/LittleBigPlanet\" title=\"LittleBigPlanet\">LittleBigPlanet</a> level and finds that he is at the bottom of the ratings.\n</p><p>Mary Lee Walsh makes her first appearance in the animated series, breaking into the house via the window and declaring that though he beat her up in <a href=\"/cwcki/Soul_Calibur\" title=\"Soul Calibur\">Soulcalibur 3</a>, he can't do it IRL. Chris Chan instructs Sonichu to attack. The scene cuts to footage of a brown bear standing in a river with dramatic backing music. That scene cuts to Mary Lee Walsh again, who begins to melt for some reason. Before she is completely dissolved, Mary presses a button that sets off a charger beneath the house. The explosion breaks the glass the mirror (mentioned in Episode 1) that Megan had been trapped in and frees her. Megan declares Chris is going down and wields her Yu-Gi-Oh cards.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Episode_5\">Episode 5</span></h3>\n<p>The episode begins with Megan about to deliver the finishing blow to Chris in a Yu-Gi-Oh battle, when Bionic throws a basketball at her face, killing her. Chris greets Bionic and asks how he is. Bionic tells him he has been sucking his girlfriend's dick. Chris sighs, saying Bionic is lucky to have a girlfriend. Megagi la Skunk appears, and Bionic leaves to \"tend to the beast.\"\n</p><p>Meanwhile, at the PVCC, The ninja from episode 2 appears and Mary asks if he has acquired Chris's the medallion. Upon learning he shoved it up his ass but did not record it, Mary explodes, saying the video was for her sexual pleasure. She fires crabs from her vagina at the ninja, who screams in agony.\n</p><p>The episode cuts to Chris, Bubbles, presumably Lolisa, and Angelica having a tea party. Angelica goes off about a dream she recently had in which God appeared, and told her he was going to fuck her, and he could do so because he was God and he made her. After that, she breaks out of her briefly psychotic state and happily declares tea time. Wild comes in, but is suddenly run over by the <a href=\"/cwcki/Ghostbusters\" title=\"Ghostbusters\">Ghost Buggy</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Episode_6\">Episode 6</span></h3>\n<p>After a dream sequence in which he is muscular and drooled over by Megan, Chris wakes up. He cries out in anger over this, and a poster of <a href=\"/cwcki/My_Little_Pony\" title=\"My Little Pony\">My Little Pony</a> Gen. 3 Pinkie Pie talks to Chris. Chris laments his sexual frustration to the pony. Pinkie Pie mentions how girls like boys who play in bands, giving Chris the idea to form one. Sonichu offers to play percussion, Wild says he can play the Sit and Spin, and a random black guy offers to play the washboard.\n</p><p>The band starts to practice in a garage, using audio from Chris's <a href=\"/cwcki/So_Need_a_Cute_Girl\" title=\"So Need a Cute Girl\">Original Song</a>. Wild comments how amazing they are as Chris wishes they had more popularity. Finding a random poster in a nearby steaming pile of dog shit, Chris declares it a sign from God himself. The scene cuts to the \"CWClub\" as Mayor Chris walks on stage. Only a few seconds after they start their performance, Christian and the Hedgehog Boys are quickly booed; Wild receives a brick to the face. Chris thanks everyone for their donations and is hit by a brick.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Episode_7\">Episode 7</span></h3>\n<p>The longest episode in the first season, episode 7 is based on Sonichu issue 8, episode 17. True to its influence, the episode begins with Sonichu and Rosechu about to engage in sexual activity. Chris pauses the scene to fill the audience in on Sonichu/Rosechu anatomy. He describes how- much like it's explained in the comic- Sonichu penises are in their stomachs, and they must tilt forward and have the genitals slip out \"like a Pez Dispenser\" to obtain a boner. Chris then moves onto Rosechu anatomy- they have giant airbags on their chest (he should know, he has a lot of sex dolls). \n</p><p>The episode mercifully skips the sex scene. After coitus, Rosechu calls Sonichu over to show him a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/4chan\" title=\"4chan\">Slanderous Website</a> that drags their image and Chris's reputation through muck. An enraged Rosechu grabs a camera, ranting about how she's going to go take nudes and nobody is going to photoshop a penis on her. Once she's gone, Sonichu starts to jerk off to the images found on the site.\n</p><p>Sonichu and Rosechu make it inside the building and look around. A flamboyantly voiced <a href=\"/cwcki/Beel\" title=\"Beel\">Beel</a> notices the pair. Sonichu says that he and his \"GF\" have a meeting with Jason. Beel demands that Sonichu suck his dick in order for them to advance. On the elevator ride up, an upset Rosechu glares at a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Navy\" title=\"Navy\">navy</a>-glazed Sonichu. After the couple arrive at Jason's floor (apparently the CEO of 4cent), who is a 20-year-old troll with an underage sex slave. He shows the pair pictures of him committing small crimes such as littering, carving his name into a public bathroom wall whilst shitting, and <s> streaking</s> jaywalking in a busy intersection. These crimes horrify Sonichu but he is silenced by Jason, who reveals that Chris's ED page will never be taken down. Jason throws a pickle at Rosechu, telling her to play with it. She picks up the pickle and crushes it in her hand, morphing into <a href=\"/cwcki/The_Incredible_Lioness\" title=\"The Incredible Lioness\">The Incredible Lioness</a> before yelling, \"I AM WOMAN, HEAR ME ROAR!!!\" and lunging at 4cent's CEO. Jason screams in agony off-screen as Sonichu watches the carnage. After Rosechu returns to normal, Sonichu asks her out, to which she happily agrees.\n</p><p>Jason survives Rosechu's attack due to dark forces which keep him alive, but he is never seen in the series afterwards.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Episode_8\">Episode 8</span></h3>\n<p>Episode 8 is based off Sonichu issue 8 episode 18, including a parody of the beach scene and the inclusion of Silvana Rosechu. The episode opens up with the Chaotic combo throwing a surprise party for Rosechu's 19th birthday. Bubbles Rosechu prepares to meet Blake over at his treehouse and gives him a cupcake, as it's his birthday as well. Blake can only respond by telling Bubbles to sit on his face.\n</p><p>The next morning, the Sonichus and Rosechus all hold a beach party. Silvana Rosechu overhears Blake's plans to have sex with Bubbles. In an effort to spread her STDs, she shapeshifts into Bubbles and meets up with Blake. After \"five panels of grotesque bum-sex,\" Blake comments how awesome she was, only for her to reveal that she was Sean Connery in disguise. Connery proceeds to kick Blake far out into the ocean. Meanwhile, a very <a href=\"/cwcki/China\" title=\"China\">\"AZN AMARIKN\"</a> Punchy and Wild Sonichu ogle over Angelica as she happily flies through the air. Punchy shoots Angelica out of the sky with a harpoon gun, and Punchy exits to have poop sex with her body. The real Bubbles finds Silvana disguised as Blake, and prepares for sex with him. Magi-chan telepathically warns her that Blake is a fake, but she is unconvinced. Jiggliami also warns it's a trap, but Bubbles punches her out of the way. However, Abraham Lincoln is able to get through to her. Sean Connery reveals himself, declaring that he is unbeatable. Bubbles summons Patrick Stewart, who transforms into the USS Enterprise and launches Connery all the way back to Scotland while the Chaotic Combo cheer.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Episode_9\">Episode 9</span></h3>\n<p>The episode opens as Chris furiously masturbates to Transformers, jizzing in a cup of Long Island Ice tea and recycling it. Sonichu and Rosechu walk in from \"their night of activities.\" Rosechu is greatly concerned for Chris Chan, as he is still recovering from <a href=\"/cwcki/Ivy\" title=\"Ivy\">\"the incident.\"</a> Sonichu recommends he put himself out there, as Chris begins searching for a job. He fails an interview for going off on a tangent about Sonichu, and is rejected by a convenience store for attempting to flirt with the manager. Ultimately, he obliviously stumbles upon a <a href=\"/cwcki/Impulse_Gay_Social_Club\" title=\"Impulse Gay Social Club\">gay bar</a>. After showing some concern regarding black homosexuals kissing in the corner, he accepts the job. Sonichu and Rosechu arrive to congratulate him, but they find out the truth and warn Chris that he's working at a gay bar. The final scene is of Chris recording a <a href=\"/cwcki/Captain%27s_Log\" title=\"Captain's Log\">Captain's Log</a>, reassuring his viewers that he is straight, having done nothing overtly homosexual during his tenure there, and that he is not \"that <a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris\" title=\"Liquid Chris\">brown-shirted imposter</a>.\"\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Episode_10\">Episode 10</span></h3>\n<p>Allison begins to complain about Chris's lack of mayoral duties, and accidentally walks in on him having sex with Julie. As she declines his offer to join in, a brick is suddenly thrown through the window of the office, revealing an angry mob of citizens demanding an impeachment. Chris reassures Allison that everything is fine and the citizens love him. BILLY MAYS breaks into the building, proclaiming himself as a contender for the position of CWCville mayor. Mary Lee Walsh hears the news and decides to run against Chris as well. Allison goes out to calm the angry mob, officially declaring a new mayoral election- the candidates being Chris, BILLY, and Walsh. The next day, contenders vie for votes. Chris is creating hand-drawn posters and attempts to get the attention of a local civilian. The man says he is voting for Mary Lee Walsh since she is going to suck him off. Chris jumps at the idea of free china, but Sonichu talks him out of it. Meanwhile, BILLY MAYS holds a rally, throwing an Oxi Clean ball at a dying cancer patient to the civilians' excitement.\n</p><p>The next day, all the votes are tallied. Allison's announcement of Soulja Boy as the election winner is interrupted by BILLY MAYS yet again, who <a href=\"/cwcki/BILLY_MAYS#Death\" title=\"BILLY MAYS\">ascends to the Big Washing Machine in the Sky.</a> Frustrated that she did not win, Walsh smashes the staff Graduon is held in, releasing a white light that consumes all of CWCville (and possibly the Earth). A time portal is created, and it flashes scenes from the series, ending the first season.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Episode_11\">Episode 11</span></h3>\n<p>After drinking his <a href=\"/cwcki/Semen\" title=\"Semen\">navy</a>, Chris experiences some sort of medical emergency and is taken to Magi-Chan who informs him that the only way to cure his woes is to clone and shrink himself so he can enter his own urethra. Inside Chris finds a peaceful society of sperm. Upon discovery, Chris is tried for mass murder (because of his recycling). In the trial, the sperm mock Chris and are ready to sentence him to death for destroying their chances of entering a woman. Before he can be executed, Magi-Chan interrupts remotely and in exchange for a pardon for Chris, teleports them to Lady Gaga's <a href=\"/cwcki/China\" title=\"China\">china</a>. The sperm find African American sperm who perform  \"Where the Womb at?\" in a parody of DMX's \"Where the hood at?\" Back at Magi-Chan's office, Magi-Chan declares Chris's health has improved greatly, despite the original Chris exploding. The series ends with Chris throwing back another glass of navy.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Reception_and_Impact\">Reception and Impact</span></h2>\n<p>The animated series was met with positive reception, with many claiming it to be the best-animated representation of Chris Chan. However, some trolls hated the show because they were worried it would bring more awareness to Chris due to its popularity. The YouTube video containing the entire series has over 800,000 views.\n</p><p>The series served as an introduction to Chris for many. <a href=\"/cwcki/Midnight_Moonflower\" title=\"Midnight Moonflower\">Midnight Moonflower</a> – who would become a friend of Chris – first learned of his existence through the series.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a class=\"external free\" href=\"https://youtu.be/PXdpSksFBok?t=878\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/PXdpSksFBok?t=878</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Vanessa_AIM_Chat_3\" title=\"Vanessa AIM Chat 3\">Vanessa AIM Chat 3</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-3\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-3\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Arthur_Spatchcock_Interview_2\" title=\"Arthur Spatchcock Interview 2\">Arthur Spatchcock Interview 2</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-4\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-4\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"/cwcki/December_2020_social_media_posts#Chris_begs_for_money\" title=\"December 2020 social media posts\">December 2020 social media posts#Chris begs for money</a></span>\n</li>\n</ol></div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL16A8CF016BC676A8\" rel=\"nofollow\">Playlist of the first season.</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2537D12307740BFD\" rel=\"nofollow\">Playlist of the second season.</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-lQDKuc6rw\" rel=\"nofollow\">Video containing the entire series.</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0pHC_W_8nk\" rel=\"nofollow\">Original versions of the first two episodes.</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://youtu.be/PXdpSksFBok?t=683\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spazkid's retrospective on the series.</a></li></ul>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n</p>\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"navbox\" style=\";\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"padding:2px;\">\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"nowraplinks collapsible mw-collapsed mw-collapsible\" style=\"width:100%;background:transparent;color:inherit;;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<th class=\"navbox-title\" colspan=\"2\" style=\";background:#FFC000;\"><div style=\"float:left; width:6em;text-align:left;\"> <span class=\"noprint plainlinksneverexpand\" style=\"white-space:nowrap; font-weight:normal; font-size:xx-small; ;background:#FFC000;;border:none;;\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Template:Sonichu\" title=\"Template:Sonichu\"><span style=\";background:#FFC000;;border:none;;\" title=\"View this template\">v</span></a> <span style=\"font-size:80%;\">•</span> <a href=\"/cwcki/Template_talk:Sonichu\" title=\"Template talk:Sonichu\"><span style=\"color:#002bb8;;background:#FFC000;;border:none;;\" title=\"Discussion about this template\">d</span></a> <span style=\"font-size:80%;\">•</span> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"//sonichu.com/w/index.php?title=Template:Sonichu&amp;action=edit\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#002bb8;;background:#FFC000;;border:none;;\" title=\"You can edit this template.
