I am very fond of your work as an artist and as a humanitarian(I red about your charity work at the Gym).\n</p><p>Now I also found out you are <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_Fighter\" title=\"CWC Fighter\">a formidable martial artist</a>, too. That links us as fellow brothers. Because back in Hong Kong, I practiced Kung Fu and when I moved to the US, I started to develope an own style, which I call Jun Fan Gung Fu(Based on my name). It is more reality based for self defense. So I have some questions of interest, from fighter to fighter:\n</p><p>1. What do you think is the most important in a fight: Strength, Speed, Intelligence, Simplicity?\n</p><p>2. I red you practiced Karate. If Yes, what style Kyokishin or Shotokan?\n</p><p>3. What martial art do you think is the best in the world?\n</p><p>Take care and stay strong.

These people are your fans who took the time to write you. To me, it seems as if you have a lot to hide. Also, I've noticed that elsewhere on the site you've begged the admin to censor the questions before they even get to you:\n</p><p>\"Please No Longer Include any messages addressing Autisim or Aspergers, or any that has even an inkling of homosexuality in it; I feel very stressed after having to read those messages; they really Grind My Gears.\"\n</p><p>Okay, I understand how hating homosexuals, acting like a homosexual and denying you're a homosexual all at once could cause stress. You've said on numerous occasions that you've had to push homoerotic thoughts out of your head. Heterosexual people do not do this. I'm not disputing that you like women as well. You're obviously bisexual and have great difficultly coming to terms with that.\n</p><p>But why refuse to answer questions about Autism, Chris? You've based a large part of your identity around having <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">Autism</a> and while you're not a medical doctor or a psychologist your personal experience on the subject is certainly relevant and valid. I'm sure your fans would love to hear all about your thoughts and experiences with Autism.\n</p><p>There are other questions where I don't see anything remotely offensive, yet you've refused to answer them. I find this extremely disrespectful.\n</p><p>As for my comics, I can only take your silence in response to my previous email as implied consent. I have also attached a new comic where you have explicit sexual intercourse with a number of Virginia State Troopers. I only hope that with it you can find peace.\n</p><p>Have a Nice Day,\n</p><p>Sean August Watley\n</p><p><br/>Sonichu is Gay: http://sonichuisgay.thecomicseries.com\n<br/>Sonichu is Dead: http://sonichu.thecomicseries.com/\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Let_me_get_back_to_you_on_that\">Let me get back to you on that</span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Whores\">Whores</span></h3>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #B48246; padding:5px; background-color:#FCC\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>From: orangepie@hotmail.com\n<p>Hey Chris, I've got a question.\n</p><p>Is prostitution legal in CWCville?

Prostitution is legal in parts of\nNevada and Rhode Island, and as you can see on Family Guy, Rhode\nIsland isn't falling apart nor is it a cesspool.\n</p><p>Are there brothels in CWCville?
