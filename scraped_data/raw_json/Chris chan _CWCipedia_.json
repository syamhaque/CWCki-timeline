For details on Chris-chan himself, please see <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler\">Christian Weston Chandler</a>. For details on the ED forum about Chris, please see <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris-chan_(forum)\" title=\"Chris-chan (forum)\">Chris-chan (forum)</a>.</i></dd></dl>\n<p>The <b>Chris chan</b> article on the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia\" title=\"CWCipedia\">CWCipedia</a> was an entry Chris uploaded to his wiki on 17-18 <a href=\"/cwcki/December_2009\" title=\"December 2009\">December 2009</a> in order to \"correct\" most of Chris's article on <a href=\"/cwcki/Encyclopedia_Dramatica\" title=\"Encyclopedia Dramatica\">Encyclopedia Dramatica</a>.\n</p><p>Chris did not simply copy and paste the text from the ED article; he retyped it completely, as he admitted at the beginning of his version. As a result, there are <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_English\" title=\"Chris and English\">several typos</a> in his version that were not in the version of the ED article that he copied. In addition, Chris omitted several paragraphs entirely from his version of the article, including one about the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Medallion_of_Fail\" title=\"Medallion of Fail\">Medallion of Fail</a> and another that concerned slanderous mockeries, such as the <a href=\"/cwcki/Nudes\" title=\"Nudes\">nudes</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Sex_tape\" title=\"Sex tape\">sex tape</a> (although he later acknowledged <a href=\"/cwcki/For_Julie%27s_Eyes_Only\" title=\"For Julie's Eyes Only\">the Kimmi video</a> in one of his comments).\n</p><p>It also confirms that Chris <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">cannot understand subtlety</a>. Parts of the page which are obviously not meant as serious (such as him being a <a href=\"/cwcki/Molvan%C3%AEa\" title=\"Molvanîa\">communist</a>) are taken seriously, while the 4Chan meme jokes fly right over his head. Further, while some aspects of the page could be considered personal opinions (and in some rare cases, Chris actually did correct parts of the article for truth, such as how many <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Attraction_locations\" title=\"Attraction locations\">attraction locations</a> he was kicked out from), most of Chris's \"corrections\" are blatant lies.\n</p><p>Immediately after typing this, Chris demanded that the CWCipedia <a href=\"/cwcki/ChrisChanSonichu_and_WikiSysop_correspondence#The_revised_ED_Page\" title=\"ChrisChanSonichu and WikiSysop correspondence\">Sysop</a> copy over all the hyperlinks from the original ED article so Chris can add those to his own wiki.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Note_that...\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Note that...</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#The_Actual_Article\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The Actual Article</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Behold,_the_Mistake_of_God:_Christian_Weston_Chandler._(The_Only_Mistake_of_God_were_THE_PEOPLE_who_contributed_to_the_Original_E.D._Page)\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Behold, <s>the Mistake of God:</s> Christian Weston Chandler. <i>(The Only Mistake of God were THE PEOPLE who contributed to the Original E.D.

Yes, he himself confirmed that as a fact.</li>\n<li>He bolds the statement accusing him of creating several sockpuppet accounts on ED to vandalize his ED page. He then reiterates that the reason behind his ED edits, which were the main cause of his subsequent downfall, was a <a href=\"/cwcki/Honor_roll\" title=\"Honor roll\">bizarrely ignorant</a> belief that an \"Information Overload\" (i.e. \"adding a lot of <a href=\"/cwcki/ShecameforCWC.JPG\" title=\"ShecameforCWC.JPG\">shitty porn pics</a> and other self-compromising info\") would somehow take his ED page down.</li>\n<li>He unfoundedly denies that he failed in his war against <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/ED\" title=\"ED\">ED</a> and other <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Troll\" title=\"Troll\">Troll</a> sites, and then bolds that his plea to his <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">\"fans\"</a> to not donate to ED failed.</li>\n<li>He refuses to admit that his nonexistent <a href=\"/cwcki/True_and_Loyal_Fanbase\" title=\"True and Loyal Fanbase\">Sonichu fans</a> are <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">nonexistent</a>, and that his \"fans\" didn't bring ED down (completely ignoring the subsequent explanation that it was caused by an issue related to the website as a whole)... and then bolds a completely unexpected revelation: that <a href=\"/cwcki/True_and_Loyal_Fanbase\" title=\"True and Loyal Fanbase\">the only people who pay attention to Chris</a> are ED donors.</li>\n<li>To top all of this, Chris sadly bolds that his reactions to <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">trolling</a> always make things worse.</li>\n<li>Chris surprisingly bolds a statement saying that Mary Lee Walsh was reasonable to assume that Chris was publicly soliciting for <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Hanky-panky\" title=\"Hanky-panky\">sex</a>. Getting back to Earth, he then quickly tries to correct himself, adding that he was not soliciting \"anything Other Than Honest <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Gal-pal\" title=\"Gal-pal\">Friendship</a>, that would etc. etc\"... thus actually admitting to being a solicitor.</li>\n<li>Chris  has generously \"forgiven\" <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Mary Lee Walsh</a> for her past \"misdeeds\". He also tells us that she tried to ask Chris unofficially not to loiter on <a href=\"/cwcki/Attraction_Location\" title=\"Attraction Location\">college grounds</a>, but the Chandlers chose to not accept her letter.</li>\n<li>Chris bolds that he still blames <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/ED\" title=\"ED\">ED</a> for breaking him up with <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Megan\" title=\"Megan\">Megan</a>, despite knowing full well that <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/ShecameforCWC.jpg\" title=\"ShecameforCWC.jpg\">the image that ended their friendship</a> was dreamt up, drawn, colored, scanned and uploaded to ED by himself. He also (finally!) admits, by bolding it, that Megan was never his <a href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart\" title=\"Sweetheart\">girlfriend</a>.</li>\n<li>Chris denies that he changes <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sweethearts\" title=\"Sweethearts\">sweethearts</a> frequently. He also bolds that <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Blanca\" title=\"Blanca\">Blanca</a> was <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Troll\" title=\"Troll\">real</a>, and adds that he <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Naive\" title=\"Naive\">trusted her</a>, and that he \"dumped her sorry ass\" after \"she\" destroyed his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Medallion_of_Fail\" title=\"Medallion of Fail\">Medallion of Fail</a>.</li>\n<li>He also expresses his belief that there is absolutely no difference between making a conversation with a <a href=\"/cwcki/BlueSpike\" title=\"BlueSpike\">9-year-old girl</a> and a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Julie\" title=\"Julie\">grown-up woman</a>.</li>\n<li>He bolds that he wouldn't date an autistic, high-functioning or otherwise. The explanation is that he doesn't want to date <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\"><i>high-functioning</i> autistic</a> women because he \"may be seeing a mirror\" reflecting what he would become if he were a <a href=\"/cwcki/Slow-in-the-minds\" title=\"Slow-in-the-minds\"><i>low-functioning</i> autistic</a>. To recap: he thinks that a <i>high-functioning</i> autistic woman acts like Chris would if he were <i>low-functional</i>. Is he being <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_Ego\" title=\"Chris and his Ego\">egotistical</a> or just <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Women%27s_Rights\" title=\"Women's Rights\">sexist</a>?</li>\n<li>He admits that his parents finally advised him <a href=\"/cwcki/Honest_Content\" title=\"Honest Content\">not to tell every woman he meets</a> that he's a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Virgin_with_Rage\" title=\"Virgin with Rage\">Virgin with Rage</a>. FINALLY.</li>\n<li>At first Chris vehemently denies that he owns <a href=\"/cwcki/Kimmi\" title=\"Kimmi\">blow-up sex dolls</a>. Then he bolds the statements about him owning a sex doll, taking part in all those <a href=\"/cwcki/For_Julie%27s_Eyes_Only\" title=\"For Julie's Eyes Only\">\"JULAAAY!\"</a> shenanigans, and buying <a href=\"/cwcki/Sex_toys\" title=\"Sex toys\">sex toys</a> and porn vids since <a href=\"/cwcki/2003\" title=\"2003\">2003</a>. Then in yet another comment he confirms that he purchased straight porn and sex dolls.</li>\n<li>Chris reveals that his vast knowledge about sex and relationships stems from MORE than just watching <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Rule_34\" title=\"Rule 34\">porn</a>! His other sources include: <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Date_Ed\" title=\"Date Ed\">Sex Ed</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/I_Love_Lucy\" title=\"I Love Lucy\">chick flicks</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Gal-pals\" title=\"Gal-pals\">gal-pals</a>' advice, and something called \"Relationship Management courses\".</li>\n<li>Then announces that he knows about <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_sex\" title=\"Chris and sex\">sex</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Love_Quest\" title=\"Love Quest\">relationships</a> \"a LOT\" more than any \"God-D***ed <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Troll\" title=\"Troll\">Troll</a>\" will ever know... including, you know, trolls who are actually <a href=\"/cwcki/JERKS\" title=\"JERKS\">in relationships</a> and are not <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Virgin_with_Rage\" title=\"Virgin with Rage\">Virgins with Rage</a>...</li>\n<li>The <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Geinus\" title=\"Geinus\">guru</a> continues to open our eyes, saying that everything we knew about relationships &amp; sex is wrong! \"Because while they ONLY think they know or even understand, they Really Do Not Understand At All; THEY ARE DUMBA**ES!\"</li>\n<li>Chris <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Naive\" title=\"Naive\">bolds</a> all excessive positive epithets used in the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/ED\" title=\"ED\">ED</a> article as <a href=\"/cwcki/Parody\" title=\"Parody\">irony</a>. He then denies that he has any <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">unwarranted self-importance</a>. However, a few paragraphs later, he expresses his honest belief that <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">actual real-world people would build a city in Virginia named \"CWCville\" and a \"CWCville Mall\" in this city, and dedicate them to Chris</a>.</li>\n<li>Chris also bolds a confession that he \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Life_Upgrade\" title=\"Life Upgrade\">upgrades</a>\" his self-confidence by using vitamins.</li>\n<li>He also bolds that <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC-isms#I\" title=\"CWC-isms\">HE CAN FEEL THE COSMOS</a>!</li>\n<li>Chris also denies several times... that <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a> is imaginary and fictional. <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">OH.
