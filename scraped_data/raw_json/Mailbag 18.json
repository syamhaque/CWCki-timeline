Even at my old age (I'm 80 years young), I can recognize a genius when I see one, so it's an honor to have a correspondence with you. Here are a few more questions that I have remembered that I had wanted to ask you:\n</p><p>1. What caused your old pastor to perform a background check on you? I think that's a shocking invasion of your privacy, so I'm glad that you've found a better church.\n</p><p>2. Thank you for your advice regarding my son. I've tried to help him to the best of my abilities and even with my attempts to clean him up (he puts so much emphasis on his singing that his hygiene is quite poor), but he just ignores me. How do you think I should discipline him? I've tried just about everything, including restricting his internet and video game usage, but nothing seems to work.\n</p><p>3. Have you ever considered hiring a manager? In my experience dealing with the entertainment industry (I managed one of my son's careers many years back), I know that it is a very tricky and cruel business. Like I've said, you possess a powerful talent, so you should definitely look into safeguarding it.\n</p><p>4. I don't mean to invade your privacy, but can you tell me anything about your parents? They've done a terrific job of raising you, and I'm curious to know what techniques they used. They should be very proud of how you turned out.\n</p><p>5. How did you decide to devote yourself to creating comic books? I was browsing through your gallery of original artwork on the CWCipedia and I was surprised by the sheer variety of your artwork... from <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Pokemon\" title=\"Pokemon\">Pokemon</a> cards to CD covers to magazine covers, and so on.\n</p><p>Again, thank you so much for opening up this line of communication to you. I look forward to seeing where <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a> will take you in the future!\n</p><p>Sincerely,\n</p><p>Joseph\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>I am not sure why the pastor did that, and I agree that it was an invasion of privacy. Offer him a REWARD for keeping clean; for each time he cleans himself, give him a Star Sticker on a sheet, and when he has earned 10 or 20 Stars, you treat him to his most favorite treat, or a new toy. I have already hired a manger for advice, thank you. Mostly Tender Loving Care. It's something that I am good at, and it can be profitable. --<a href=\"/cwcki/User:ChrisChanSonichu\" title=\"User:ChrisChanSonichu\">ChrisChanSonichu</a> 06:28, 15 December 2009 (CET)\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p><i>It is likely that Chris is referring to <a href=\"/cwcki/Vivian_Gee\" title=\"Vivian Gee\">Vivian Gee</a>, who offers Chris advice on advertising and other subjects.</i>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Instead_the_courts_were_on_the_side_of_justice\">Instead the courts were on the side of justice</span></h3>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #B48246; padding:5px; background-color:#FCC\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>From: Dan Ferraro (danqferraro23@gmail.com)\n<p>Chris,\n</p><p>I'm pleased to see that my favorite cartoonist is answering so much fan mail, and during the holidays when most people are so stressed out and busy! Some of these people are being extremely rude and I think you're handling it with a lot of poise and maturity.\n</p><p>I'm actually writing you because you've said in a video that you were asked to leave the Wolf Scouts (it was Wolf Scouts, right?) for your Autism. I know the Boy Scouts of America have undergone some high-profile lawsuits for excluding certain minority group, but I was wondering why they'd make someone with an obvious disability leave their group. This seems highly unfair and would be the kind of thing I'd make a big fuss out of it ever happened to my child. (I'm not meaning to imply that you're extremely disabled or low-functioning here either, I mean you can drive a car and graduate from college, which are pretty big accomplishments for an autistic person.)\n</p><p>Also there's the incident with the Green County School District where you say that multiple staff members held you down and recorded your screams: I might have some insight to this. Did you ever lose your temper as a child? Why, exactly, were they recording you? My wife works in Special Ed in the schools and they're actually allowed to restrain children that have violent temper tantrums if they're a danger to themselves or others. The faculty are all given extensive training to make sure they don't actually injure the child. Believe me, the Special Ed teachers are there to help the children grow into functional adults, not to hurt kids. Exactly how badly were you injured during this? I know this was almost 20 years ago but people have been able to sue and win for injuries that have happened long ago.\n</p><p>Sorry if I'm prying, my brother's an attorney who handles discrimination lawsuits, and my mind started wandering. Personally I would have sued the pants off of both groups. But that's just me.\n</p><p>Merry Christmas,\n</p><p>- Dan\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>We had tried to sue, but the courts were against us at the time.\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3><span id=\"In_which_Chris_believes_he_has_magic_powers_.28srsly.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"In_which_Chris_believes_he_has_magic_powers_(srsly)\">In which Chris believes he has magic powers (srsly)</span></h3>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #B48246; padding:5px; background-color:#FCC\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>From: Madison Glen-Ross (ker0pi1999@gmail.com)\n<p>Hey Chris!!\n</p><p>I love your Sonichu comics!! My friends and I always try to stay up to date on what's cool!! I have a couple questions I hope you can answer!! \n</p><p>1. I was wondering if you could tell me more about your real-life powers. They seem very interesting. Can you only curse and bless people, or can you do other things? How and when did you find out about your powers? Sometimes I wish I had powers in real life, but nobody I know has them so I don't think it's going to happen anytime soon. You must be really special!!\n</p><p>2. How come you don't wear those spiky wristbands and tattoo sleeves anymore? I had a bunch of those wristbands like Avril Lavigne but the school made me stop wearing them. Whatever!! Anyways I think they're really cool so you should wear them more often!!\n</p><p>3. Do you think it's all right for you to force your religion on people? I mean in the Sonichu comics you're supposed to dump a bunch of chemicals in the water supply so people will stop being <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Gay\" title=\"Gay\">gay</a> so they'll get into Heaven. What if they're already happy being gay? And since heaven is where you get to do whatever you love to most, they'll just start being gay again once they get into Heaven. And what's the big deal with being gay anyway? You said yourself that the Bible's just a guideline and you don't have to do everything it says to be a good person. My uncle Ricky is really really gay and he's the nicest sweetest guy ever!! He's a Priest so I'm sure he's getting into Heaven.\n</p><p>Anyways have fun!!\n</p><p>Madison, age 10\n</p><p>&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3\n</p><p>xoxoxoxox\n</p><p>PS PUT BELLA AND EDWARD FROM TWILIGHT IN YOUR COMICS!!\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Thank you for your kind loyalty and encouragement.

My job is sort of like a \"life coach\", I have to make the people I've been assigned to see things my way and do the things I need done. You'd think it would be easy considering the cools stuff I'm promoting, but it's actually really hard! Do you have any suggestions as to how to get people to follow your advice or do what you need them to do?

My boss, (a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/JERK\" title=\"JERK\">JERK</a> named Mr. Tape) works from the home office and is constantly sending me messages telling me how to do my job. These messages are all very stressful, and he often takes a very derogatory tone! What makes things even worse is that he's my UNCLE!

Again, maintain being nice to your Uncle; take in and fully understand his advice on how you can better your work. Show him that you are doing so, and he may not be so harsh with you.

(jacob_n333@yahoo.com)\n<p>Good day, Chris!\n</p><p>When I was re-reading issues of Sonichu the other day, I suddenly came to realize two questions. One is serious, the other not so much. To begin with the lighter question, pun only slightly intended: I've heard you cite your dog Patti's old doghouse as weighing from five to ten tons. Judging from the photos of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Patti\" title=\"Patti\">Patti</a>'s doghouse in an earlier issue of Sonichu, it couldn't possibly weigh more than fifty pounds, much less five tons--it's just wood and plastic. I remember that video where you lifted one \"fifty-pound\" box of soda in each hand (which of course only weigh about ten to twelve pounds)--is the \"ten ton doghouse\" another joke like that?\n</p><p>After thinking some on the doghouse, I of course soon remembered the dog, and something dawned on me. It seems weird that you memorialize your beloved pet by keeping her as a character in the comic, but that you memorialize the women you've loved by killing them off in ways even more gruesome than in real life (e.g. <a href=\"/cwcki/Ivy\" title=\"Ivy\">Ivy</a> perishing in a terrible elevator accident instead of hanging herself, Panda Halo not merely dying during the brushfires but exploding). Patti is still a character years after her death, but <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Panda_Halo\" title=\"Panda Halo\">Panda Halo</a>'s death seemed little more than an excuse to introduce some new characters and Ivy, despite all her buildup in previous issues, was killed off-screen and promptly ignored in favor of the ongoing plot. Why is that, Chris?\n</p><p>From where you readers stand, it seems that you love your pet dog--who was still just a dog, in the end--more than you love real flesh-and-blood women. Clearly that's not the case... so why do you immortalize your loved one's terrible deaths instead of who they were? I'm sure you didn't mean for it to come off that way, but I'm curious why you decided to do that in the first place.\n</p><p>Yours in the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Cherokee\" title=\"Cherokee\">Cherokee</a> nation,\nJacob Nathaniel Lights-in-the-Sky\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>To answer your first question, I do not have a full understand on feeling the weight of something versus their actual weight, so those numbers were originally only Estimates. The women characters who in real life were my girlfriends before their deaths. It was my mistake of putting in to-be girlfriends when they would see their own real-life deaths prematurely. I should have been in full confidence of them being my girlfriend CLOSE in real life than solely over the internet. Patti was my dog FOR REAL, and we actually had the caring master/dog relationship, so she WOULD be ongoing, because she WAS that close to me; NEVER over the internet.\n<p>If any of the women I had put into the books actually were my girlfriends Offline and Close in Real Life, then they WOULD be more likely to be ongoing in the series.\n</p><p>--<a href=\"/cwcki/User:ChrisChanSonichu\" title=\"User:ChrisChanSonichu\">ChrisChanSonichu</a> 06:06, 18 December 2009 (CET)\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris_on_the_homeless\">Chris on the homeless</span></h3>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #B48246; padding:5px; background-color:#FCC\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>From: Amanda Brown (ultimatefan88@gmail.com)\n<p>Chris,\n</p><p>Glad you've been keeping busy with so many updates!
