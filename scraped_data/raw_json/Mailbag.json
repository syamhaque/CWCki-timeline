This <b>Mailbag</b> marked the first time the words of other humans appeared on CWCipedia, which up to that point had been all Chris all the time.\n</p><p>The Mailbag quickly overflowed from its original page into a series of numbered pages, each one containing a random assortment of fanmail for Chris to respond to with his own special brand of <a href=\"/cwcki/Honest_Content\" title=\"Honest Content\">Honest Content</a>. This quickly became the best way to ask Chris any manner of questions about his deeply disturbing life, though Chris has become disillusioned with the practice over time (especially as letters increasingly focused on his many failures and <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">other shortcomings</a>). Chris ceased answering the letters in <a href=\"/cwcki/February_2010\" title=\"February 2010\">February 2010</a>, during which he was more focused on <a href=\"/cwcki/The_Wallflower\" title=\"The Wallflower\">The Wallflower</a> than his works and left them to rot after he \"abandoned\" the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Internet\" title=\"Internet\">Internet</a> and the original <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia\" title=\"CWCipedia\">CWCipedia</a> was deleted.\n</p><p>Over a decade after stopping writing responses to e-mails, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jail_letters\" title=\"Jail letters\">Chris began writing a number of letter responses from jail</a> as he awaited his hearings for the charge of <a href=\"/cwcki/Affair_with_Mother\" title=\"Affair with Mother\">incest</a> against his elderly mother.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Insight\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Insight</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Censorship\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Censorship</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#The_Twitter_feed\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The Twitter feed</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Insight\">Insight</span></h2>\n<p>This direct line into Chris's thoughts allowed curious trolls a brand new way to find the answers they so desperately sought: asking politely. Through these messages, several aspects of Chris's personality were either exposed or reinforced.\n</p>\n<ul><li><b>Chris doesn't want to help his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Fans\" title=\"Fans\">fans</a>.</b> Fanmail sections are supposed to be about the author going an extra mile for pleasing, informing, and otherwise helping the reader. Chris simply assumes that the way he does things is the only possible way of handling the Mailbag; he doesn't even stop to consider that there are some established conventions in answering fanmail, and that he's failing to uphold them. Basic politeness has long since gone out of window. So have any displays of effort in answering the e-mails. He also has the knack of stalling the discussions by requiring effort from the reader: he's — no kidding — asking for <i>definitions of words</i> which could be found with two seconds of Googling.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup> He can't even be bothered to make his replies easy to read for his fans with the use of bullet points, and instead. Autistically. Opts. For. One. Word. Replies. After. Another.</li>\n<li><b>Chris absolutely despises being corrected.</b> Repeatedly, Chris insisted that <a href=\"/cwcki/Asperger_syndrome\" title=\"Asperger syndrome\">Asperger syndrome</a> was \"nothing\" like <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">autism</a>, and refused to even look at information that would suggest otherwise, outright saying that he was \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_4#Chris_the_close-minded\" title=\"Mailbag 4\">closed-minded</a>\" on the subject.</li>\n<li><b>Chris's aversion to certain words is as strong as ever.</b> While Chris has apparently got over using the word \"dick\", his reliance on <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC-isms\" title=\"CWC-isms\">CWC-isms</a> remains unchecked, the most notable example would be referring to a swastika as a \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_5#That_wacky_Hitler\" title=\"Mailbag 5\">four-boomerang-shaped symbol</a>\". In a <a href=\"/cwcki/Common_Questions#22_February_2010\" title=\"Common Questions\">Common Questions</a> section, however, he did use the word \"<a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swastika\" title=\"wikipedia:swastika\">swastika</a>\", so he may be improving in this area.</li>\n<li><b>Chris is fully aware of the fact that he's plagiarizing.</b> When speaking about his inspiration, he said that his ideas were sometimes \"borrowed from a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Television\" title=\"Television\">TV show</a> or movie.\" He also treated fan suggestions as though he was going to take every single one of them rather than coming up with his own ideas, at <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_3#In_which_Chris_gives_someone_permission_to_make_characters_for_him_to_steal\" title=\"Mailbag 3\">one point</a> giving a fan \"permission\" to submit a character for Chris to use in a future story.</li>\n<li><b>Chris sure does hate <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">gay people</a>.</b> Not consistently, though. When Chris isn't going on about how <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_1#The_cure_for_homosexuality\" title=\"Mailbag 1\">he's going to cure homosexuality</a> or hoping that <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_49\" title=\"Mailbag 49\">the homos all die in foreign wars</a>, he's making vague attempts at damage control, saying things like he wouldn't hate a guy \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_5#Daniel_Tammet/Punching_your_baby_will_make_it_gay\" title=\"Mailbag 5\">for just one reason</a>.\" It seems like he's aware that his homophobia offends his audience, but his hatred is so visceral that he can't always keep it under wraps.</li>\n<li><b>Chris thinks the things he does are groundbreaking.</b> In response to a letter about inventions, Chris says that necessity is the mother of inventions and proceeded to name Sonichu and CWCville as inventions. Take that, <a href=\"/cwcki/China\" title=\"China\">China</a>!</li>\n<li><b>Chris is largely unaware of the outside world.</b> Obvious, of course, but he has now received letters from people claiming to be <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_9#Iranian_democracy\" title=\"Mailbag 9\">corrupt</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_3#Leadership_role_models\" title=\"Mailbag 3\">dictators</a> (or <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_6#North_Korea_is_pretty_cool\" title=\"Mailbag 6\">their kids</a>), <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_6#In_which_Chris_recommends_a_sex_store_to_a_serial_murderer\" title=\"Mailbag 6\">serial</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_7#Good_housekeeping\" title=\"Mailbag 7\">murderers</a>, a <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_5#That_wacky_Hitler\" title=\"Mailbag 5\">few</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_9#Deutschland,_Deutschland_über_alles\" title=\"Mailbag 9\">Nazis</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_1#Chris_the_inventor\" title=\"Mailbag 1\">brilliant artists</a>, famous <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_4#Gabe_Newell:_white_knight\" title=\"Mailbag 4\">video game designers</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_2#Sonichu's_Job\" title=\"Mailbag 2\">fictional</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_2#The_Guitar_Hero_workout\" title=\"Mailbag 2\">characters</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_9#Chris_the_illest_rapper\" title=\"Mailbag 9\">rock stars</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_55\" title=\"Mailbag 55\">internationally famous lounge singers</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_9#Request_hour\" title=\"Mailbag 9\">a bisexual German cannibal</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_34\" title=\"Mailbag 34\">the heroes of various cult-favorite video games</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_55\" title=\"Mailbag 55\">a deceased porn star offering a conditional date</a>, and <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_4#Hail_Satan\" title=\"Mailbag 4\">the Devil himself</a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup> The only person Chris has managed to recognize is horror author Stephen King in <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_26\" title=\"Mailbag 26\">Mailbag #26</a>, probably because Chris was familiar with the Stephen King-related <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Family_Guy\" title=\"Family Guy\">Family Guy</a></i> episode. In <a href=\"/cwcki/Alec_Benson_Leary_Phone_Call_8\" title=\"Alec Benson Leary Phone Call 8\">Alec Benson Leary Phone Call #8</a>, he says he confused \"Mike Jackson\" with Michael Jackson, <i>painfully</i> oblivious to the fact that there are a lot of people with same names, or that people could use pen names that happen to be inspired by famous people.</li>\n<li><b>Chris thinks girlfriends solve everything.</b> Inevitably, his advice to most of his correspondents who are having any kind of problem is that they should find a girlfriend. Since Chris imagines a girlfriend as a nurturing mother figure who provides for your every need in addition to giving up the <a href=\"/cwcki/China\" title=\"China\">china</a>, he reckons that they're the solution to any and all emotional or practical difficulties. In particular, this is his response to anyone who is worried that they might be experiencing \"homo urges\".</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Censorship\">Censorship</span></h2>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_censorship\" title=\"Chris and censorship\">Chris and censorship</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:184px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:CWCstalin1.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"214\" src=\"/w/images/a/af/CWCstalin1.png\" width=\"182\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:CWCstalin1.png\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Chris is fond of censorship.</div></div></div>\n<p>Perhaps the most telling parts of the Mailbags are not Chris's answers, but the letters Chris refuses to answer. In the first few Mailbags, all e-mails that did not lavish adequate amounts of praise on Chris were promptly deleted. A few that <i>did</i> lavish praise on him were also deleted, because they were written by people whom Chris found objectionable. These \"unwanted\" individuals generally consisted of <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">gays</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Niggos\" title=\"Niggos\">blacks</a>, and <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_religion\" title=\"Chris and religion\">atheists</a>. A couple of other individuals were silenced when they confused Chris with the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/CChanSonichuCWC\" title=\"CChanSonichuCWC\">other, better Chris</a>. Finally, one e-mail was only partially deleted, because the author stated that he was not fond of Michael Bay's <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Transformers\" title=\"Transformers\">Transformers</a></i> movies.\n</p><p>In later Mailbags, Chris deleted less mail, notably after a few messages called him out on his suppression of the press. His choices for deletion however, became more erratic, deleting messages from people who wanted to actually help him, or from people asking serious honest questions. Eventually Chris added a <a href=\"/cwcki/Rejected_Mailbag\" title=\"Rejected Mailbag\">Rejected Mailbag</a> page to the CWCipedia, as a place for e-mails he rejected, saying that they had \"offensive, or mislabeling, content that I, Christian W. Chandler, would not care to respond to.\" Oddly, he then typed full responses to several of these \"rejected\" letters, making the whole thing pointless.\n</p><p>His newest trick, though, is to use strikeouts (<s>like this</s>) to edit letters that make him uncomfortable. Mostly he edits out anything related to homosexuality, and replaces it with non-homo stuff. However, he has gone back and undone some of these strikeouts.\n</p><p>In the early hours of 19 January, Chris deleted the entirety of <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_41\" title=\"Mailbag 41\">Mailbag #41</a> and uploaded a manifesto in its place banning <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Asperchu\" title=\"Asperchu\">Asperchu</a></i>-related mail. This did not stem the flow of questions and comments about <i>Asperchu</i>, but Chris's hatred of the subject inspired him to once again carve up the Mailbags with gusto. <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_46\" title=\"Mailbag 46\">Mailbag #46</a>, for instance, saw three of its seven letters consigned to the memory hole.\n</p><p><a href=\"/cwcki/Alec_Benson_Leary_Phone_Call_3\" title=\"Alec Benson Leary Phone Call 3\">Alec Benson Leary Phone Call #3</a> shows that Chris knew that anyone can see the deleted mails through the page history. Yet, due to his general obliviousness, he doesn't know what people usually think when they see the Mailbag has been tampered with. Transparency can have averse effects on people.\n</p><p>With <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_52\" title=\"Mailbag 52\">Mailbag #52</a>, Chris has started a new sort of reply beyond deleting everything. Ten e-mails, many of which were derogatory (and even one coming from <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_death#Mike_Jackson_(1969-2010)\" title=\"Chris and death\">the widow of the man he helped push to suicide</a>), were all answered with this response:\n</p>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">Your letter has been read fully, and your thoughts have been <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_English\" title=\"Chris and English\">inputed</a> and accepted for better improvement.
