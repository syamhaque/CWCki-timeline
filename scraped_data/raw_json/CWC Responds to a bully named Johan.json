Chris explains how he has been bullied by a troll named <a href=\"/cwcki/Johan\" title=\"Johan\">Johan</a> after getting a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tomgirl\" title=\"Tomgirl\">lesbian</a> couple to accept fathering his child, only for them to back out due to Johan pointing out Chris is <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">autistic</a> and in turn, Chris sensibly insinuating Johan has AIDS due to his supposed past as a gay pornographic actor. Chris roleplays his account of events with <a href=\"/cwcki/Lego\" title=\"Lego\">Lego</a> minifigures while squeezed under a child's school desk. The ordeal is acted out in ramblings which become little more than background noise because he chose to play loud dubstep music over his speech, resulting in him being barely audible.\nChris seems to be acting the way he did before the <a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris\" title=\"Liquid Chris\">Liquid Chris</a> saga, claiming he is being bullied by doing impersonations of his foes and recounting any times trolls have made him do embarrassing things, even naming <a href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Schroeder\" title=\"Megan Schroeder\">Megan Schroeder</a>. \n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Video\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Video</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Description\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Description</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Transcript\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Transcript</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#See_Also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See Also</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Video\">Video</span></h2>\n<table style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa;

'bout what happened recently. And it'll be demonstrated through... <a href=\"/cwcki/Lego\" title=\"Lego\">the minifigures</a>.\n</p><p>So, that's to tell you the truth. So, my associate has introduced me to a <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">lesbian</a> couple who's looking to have their own little daughters... their little daughters, mkay? And they- and I was delighted to be made to be designated as a parent. But unfortunately throughout the few weeks, the initial few weeks there were miscommunications and we ca- an- and it was kinda spotty catchin' up with one another and one of them wanted to be artificially but the other one wanted natural. But, tonight, uh, earlier tonight, they mutually settled on both being natural, so we were plannin' on settin' up... because- uh, earlier in that day, they were- they were thinking about a second candidate though, so that left me feeling sad. But he didn't show up, and they liked the video that I sent them demonstrating my sexual prowess. I am quite... the acrobat. But she- that made me feel delighted.\n</p><p>So yeah, we were on the online chatroom, we were settin' up. We were talkin' about our meetin', and then comes along, dur- bit- dur- new guy.

And I defended my- and... I held my ground. [<i>pauses to fiddle with his toys</i>] I hold my ground, I, took two attacks. *pew pew* one attack at a time. *pew pew* I defended myself with the shield. *pew pew pew... pew... pew pew* And not stooping down to his level how he was phrasing his attacks... I offered my own, style and elegant... repertoire of... offence. *pew pew pew* Hit him a bit hard too. Again, some of them did not hit as hard. What? Not every attack is perfect.

I talked to my associate and a little birdie told em, a little birdie came in and, told me about- ooh- dark past about Mr. Johan. That's his name, Johanson, but as like to call 'em Johan. Hey everybody! look. it's Johan from the Smurfs. Hey! where's Peewee, Johan? Go ahead and make all the Smurf jokes you want! He laid so many s- he said he was a Smurftastic lay, or, satisfy <i>thirty women</i>! He laid so many Smurfs, I wonder how many of them little smurfs he laid actually like this guy... and now everybody else! along with me or in your own words! make up your own Smurftastic jokes about Johan! Even the more obvious one that yall be making up in a moment when I tell you when ya hear that this little birdie told me *cheep cheep cheep* little birdie tell me the dirt! Okay, Here's the dirt.\n</p><p>This guy, was... an ex... GAY PORNSTAR! Yep, laid with another male. [<i>blubbery sex noises</i>]\n</p><p>And, guess what? [<i>confused ogre noise</i>] aaanother big thing that's gonna take this g- is gonna take this... big- is gonna take this guy down a notch, guess what? He got FIRED from one of his... things. He got fired from one of his movies and you know why he got fired? Why? He failed the STD test!... and apparently in order to be fired from any porn act that STD had to be something lethal.\n</p><p>Possibly lethal as say, something like AAAAIIIIDSSS!?!\n</p><p>And yet, among the discussion that was talked about earlier... he said that he had no STDs... but the way he acted and behaved and all that... apparently he told filfey lies! Filthy lies! He lied!\n</p><p>So, with that, we'll leave it at that. Everybody in the audience: yes'm high functioning autistic. But you know what? Even a normal person, normal father, normal mother, whichever, can give birth to an autisti- an autistic child. And it's just about as much risk as me because I'm high functioning autistic, high functioning. so therefore, hi- there's a higher- probability of a child being normal, so there.\n</p><p>So, if your votes on... rather or not who has the better sexual style and activity, ability. Johan, by the way, did you do one of my- PEEWEEEEEEEEEEEEEE... heh, Smur- Smurftastic. Anyway: this guy, or, me! And they have praised me as acrobatic! Truthfully so, thank you very much it was the hi- it made my night. Hear that. There will be a voting page coming up soon, and my video on this channel and his video on his channel. There will be links in the voting page.\n</p><p>So, that'll pretty much do it for now. Details coming soon. Thank you. Goodnight.
