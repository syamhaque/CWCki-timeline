Backups.\nBackups. Because those cups are on the\ntake. But what do you expect for the\nenergy they make? Better as a bot or as\na car. They could go really excessively\nfar. Backups.\nBackups. Backups.\nBackups. But seriously though. Yeah.\nSeriously.\nFreaking shark cops.\nYeah. Hey, what's up everybody on\nYouTube? Jesus Christ Prime here once\nagain and today we are looking at the\nnext figure this wave of Transformers\nGalaxy Burge Decepticone Punis\nSlav. So yes, here we are. And there's\nthis up\njerk\ncop. Let's get a ghost right here. Look\nat the\npackaging. So, right out front here, we\ngot a well, not the best looking art of\nthe car. I mean, just like I feel like\nsomebody mooshed up on that hood there.\nJust not that great. Maybe the jerkoff\nwas turning left. Anyway, Transformers\nLego Decepticone Pund Slav and on the\nside of you got the rather simplistic AR\nartwork of the uh more common pun slab\nas opposed to PL the first apparently\nhe's got the most views on his video\ncompared to even the other Transformers\nin this line. Are you there? Anyway, so\nyeah, guys,\nsimplistic art of the Morcon Puzzl and\nyeah, Puzzl and Cyber. Now the focus\nworks on the side of the box, you got\nhalf of the lovely poster artwork going\non right there. Yep. And let's see. Yep,\nthere's a top and there's the B with the\nstage barcodes. And on the back of the\nbox, you have your obligatory product\ndoes this, that, and the other. It can\nbecome an armor leg for Pun for Punic\nCracker Bay. and a lovely little bio if\nyou want to read that as well. This will\nalso be on the bio page on the\nquickflight. And that's basically it for\nthe packaging. And moving right along\nhere, we have the more common the punish\ntype of pun left. The diamond dozen p\nthe diamond dozen\ndecept. And yep, he's a brown black\nbrownish brown and black police car. You\nshot? I know I am. the freaking do bunch\nof jerk cops. But let's get closer here.\nLook at the uh details. So, you got\nsilver her headlights and fenders and\nthere's a Decepticon symbol right there.\nApparently, something messed up on the\num shade of brown right here, but I\nguess that uh gives it a little bit\nbetter appeal. And then they got the\nside of the uh vehicle right there. It's\nlike a\npolice. Jerk cop is more like it for the\nside of that\ncar. Anyway, but they had to like\nprotect that. They have to be protected.\nPolice cars, you know. Anyway, yeah,\nthere's the back of the car with the\ntail lights. There is the top and there\nis the bottom. Yeah, he does roll as I\nthink should. Ready for rolling\nup pretend to be police cars type of\nboats.\nand for comparison. So, here is the\nDecepticone with the CC82 right\nthere.\nYeah.\nWith Christian\nPrime, I get decent center.\nYeah,\nwith\nOptimus\nwith\nSonu and here it is alongside the quick\nfield combiner team of all bots. Wave,\nroll out, Arborats, Fireshot, and\nChapper. And he's definitely under\ncustody for impersonating police.\nShe\nYes. And we have here a group shot of\none of each of all three Decepticones.\nAnd of course, the first Punislav, the\nfirst crafter, and the first\nSAVV. And um Yep. Well, we got their\nattention here. So, I'll give you the\nside the better side by comparison of\njust the two jerk cops right here. So,\ngot that going\non. Give you that shot as well.\nthe youngster Erdo\nBen. And there's the Morama Jerkop\nalongside Makoto Egg\nCrusher\nwith\nMegatron and with our special guest Mold\nBait comparison. Here he is with Kabider\nWars Street wise. There you go. an\nactual an actual police car with a fake\npolice\ncar. I'mma run you in. I'm going to\nsmash right into you. Just make sure you\nrun\nin. And now making this encore\nappearance within these reviews. Here is\nthe more common punch lab with movie one\nbarricade because it's\nprecious. Also jerk and offensive\nprecious.\nSo, there you\ngo. All right. So, you get three\naccessories with this guy. You get uh\nthe little gun right here all done in\nblue with the little bits of details all\nabout molded in and all that blue\nplastic. Looks like a little bit paint\nor something right there. Anyway, yeah,\nwe'll just go ahead and uh pop that\nright there because that's a bit more\ncommon thing to do in that mode. And of\ncourse, you get the combiner mode uh\nhand. I forgot to mention this last\nvideo, but yeah, this thing can also be\na foot. I might have mentioned this with\nthe uh in the Decepticone Cfter video,\nbut there you go. There you go. You can\nmake a foot out of this as well. But\nsince we have feet going with uh cra\nwith craft of the first, it's like you\ndon't really need this in feet mode for\nus. That type of foot actually works\nbetter than as opposed to this. So\nalternatively, yes, you can uh put that\nup here and you have\nuh this gun mode going on. Oh, actually,\nyeah, here you go. You can pop that in\nthere. You have that going on. So, yeah,\nthere you go. Just uh drive along and\njerk bang bang bang\nbang. Anyway, so then also it\ngets its own buzz saw. So, yep. Every\njerk up is a buzz saw to really disrupt\nthe poor citizens. H not really too much\nample real estate left after all this\ncuz I mean look around all over this uh\nthing that just has the uh Oh, there's\nthat five port back there. I suppose if\nyou wanted to see if we could do\nthis. Yeah, there you go. Butt gun. And\nput this up here. And yeah, this work.\nYeah, there you go. There you go. But\nsaw and the buzz saw does little saw\ndoes spin. It does rotate. So yeah, your\naccessories for this\nthing. All right, so that's basically it\nfor vehicle bus. Let's get a\ntransformation, shall we?\nLet's decent spin for a faking up\njerk up car. Pardon the language in that\none moment. But yeah, they really offend\nme. Grave me. All right, so we're going\nto go into combine mode first as uh\ntypically usual for these combiner bots.\nUh but yeah, essentially. So we're going\nto leg mode. So you want to take this\npart here. You might have to take a\nfingernail. It's a bit easier if you\nundo the hood as\nwell. Anyway,\njust get that a little bit to get this\nout. So, get your finger. Ah, here we\ngo. Get your fingernail in there and\npull that out like that. And then you\ntake all this. This goes all the way\nback like so. Why is that? Oh, I got a\nlittle tight. It's a double inch right\nthere. Why is this tight on my copy?\nThere we go. There we go. Okay. And then\nyou take the combiner peg and you fold\nthat out. And there you go. Now, I\nsuppose in foot, um, this jerk cop could\npotentially kick\nass. Yeah, I'd rather kick its ass.\nAnyway, so now we go into arm mode. So,\nwe want to put that kabir peg out to the\nside. We're going to split the\nlegs. secure. Anyway, this time I copied\nso you know it's secure. Anyway, so we\ngot that going on. You want to rotate\nthis out. You want and you're knowing\nthat the knees are getting rotated in.\nSo, but remember that just shortly. So,\nyou just continue on with that and get\nas far as you could. And then make sure\nthose knee joints are right there and\naligned. And you get that down. You take\nthis uh part right here. You rotate\nthat. You rotate that down. Get these\nlegs together. Now, you want to take the\narms here on the side. Go ahead and\nthrow them out like that. There's this\nlittle tab right here that's going to go\ninto this groove right there. You just\nwant\nto There you go. Just make sure you get\nthat in there. And same thing on the\nother side. Just put that up. Pop the\nlittle tab into the groove right there.\nAnd then uh just uh either way you want\nto go. But yeah, there you go. There's\nthis uh jerk cup as an arm. Yeah. And of\ncourse, you know the deal. The whole\ndeal. can uh get you could get your full\nrange arm moving right there or get your\nless than 90° bend or up to 90° if you\nrotate. But anyway, that's the the arm\nmode. Now, of course, robot mode. So,\nwe'll just go and get that orientated\nthe right way. We'll go ahead and take\nthe arms out and uh pull the hands out\nlike so. You definitely need a bit of a\nfingernail for\nthat. And you just uh get those down. We\nget\nunnot. So, go ahead and split the legs.\nTake the comb peg. Pull that down. And\nthen all this right here. Just want make\nsure that combiner that tubble hitch is\nup like that. And then you take this up.\nAnd uh just essentially want just go\nahead almost go back to half the vehicle\nmode. You got tabs slots right there.\nThese tabs are going to go into. So\nthat's secure. And then you take this\npart top half. Come on. Come\non. There we go. So, yeah, that just it\ngoes upside down like that, but then you\ngo down right there. And uh Yep, there\nyou go. That is basically the more\ncommon\npunish. If I can get to stand up\nstraight now and I can take the camera\ndown. There's the more common punish in\nits robot mode. And it's decently packed\nin robot mode. I see. He looks better\nasleep than the old bed, doesn't it?\nYeah. Just obviously she's a youngster.\nHe's a young\nman. So, let's get a closeup here. Look\nat the details. So, obviously for the\nhead sculpt, we got uh this uh silver\nbug, lots of silver on it, and uh red\nfor the eyes. And just uh lots of\nbrowns, some silver, some reds, and\nblacks. And then going down the crotch,\ngoing down a few full view joint, full\nview. And then uh Yep. And then going up\nthe back, there's the uh hood of the car\nfor the backpack. And just, you know,\nthat's the thing right there. But\nyeah. Yeah. Articulation wise, what have\nwe got? I'm going to tell you. So, all\nright. So, the head is on ball joint.\nSo, you got a little bit of wiggly wag.\nYou can look up only a tiny bit and can\nharden it up down. Um, you only get a\nlittle bit of side to side movement due\nto just how tight this thing is. At\nleast it might copy. So, your mouse\nshould bury. It's not going to do a full\n360, but feel 360. But, at least you get\nside to side. Arms can rotate a full 360\nand they can move in and out. You got\nthat shoulder joint that can go all the\nway up and all the way down if you\nneeded to. You have bicep rotation and\num you got over 90 degrees of bend at\nthe elbow and uh no wrist rotation, but\nthey can the hands can move in and out\nif you need them to. You have waist\nrotation. The legs can move forward that\nfar, back that far,\noutward that far. Definitely cannot do a\nfull split. Got thigh rotation right\nthere.\na little bit over 90 degrees bend there\nat the uh knee. You can't really take\nadvant You can't really take advantage\nof the double joint right there. But\nanyway, and there's no movement at the\nfeet. Okay, so let's run to those\naccessories one more time for the robot\nmode. You have like five mills on either\nside as well. So you got your weapon\nstorage right there. But yeah, you can\ngive him the uh buzz saw and either\nhand. And of course, you can give him\nthe uh little gun. And on that basic\nlevel, we can pew pew pack. Pew pew buzz\nbuzz pew pew buzz buzz and all that good\nstuff. But then of course\num you know how this works, gun mode,\nall that. So that can get a little bit\nmore fun this way. And just um yeah,\nthere you go. There's a little bit of\nextra pew pew pew pew to go with the\nbuzz buzz and all that. So yeah, there\nyou go. That's a bit full arm\nweaponizing right there. But yes, the\nbasic gun right there is Blouch\ncompatible. Yes, that's right. So we can\nuh take a Blouch and uh pop it right\nthere and we could do a big old faked up\njerk\ncop. And it was a very weak blouch. just\nwant like\na that shows you how cheap these guys\nare. They're a dime a dozen. They're so\nmuch. They're so cheap. Their shots are\ncheap and weak. And now for\ncomparison. Here it is with\nCCA2\nwith Christian\nPrime\nwith\nSonu\nwith\nOptimus. And here he is in an\napprehended type of situation alongside\nuh row out and chapper. The claw is on\nhim as well as armoratire shot and\nwave. And here is the deceptic clone and\nthe group shot with the first and the\nother one of one of each of the other\ntwo deceptic clones between uh the\ncrackctors the savs and par. First, here\nit is alongside Bakoto and\nCrusher\nwith\nMegs and of course the mold comparison\nwith Gabby War Street\nwise and of\ncourse for the last time you be able to\nsee it within this series. So here he is\nwith movie one barricade because it's\nprecious freaking fracken to punish and\nenslave kind\nof\nprecious. So there you go. And there you\ngo. That is Decepticone and Punl. And\nyeah, you know, decent figure. You know,\nof course it's the bargain basement\nvariant of the uh Pun Slim as opposed to\nthe first. But yeah, I mean all these\nthings are so common they should be\nthere are practically at time a dozen\nand of course you know what they did\nwhat they do they go out to be jerk\nhopish and yada yada yada yada yada\nyada yada and I noticed I gave you an\nawkward cut but I forgot to put that\nback up. So you might have just noticed\nthat a moment ago but anyway so I did\npick this one up from Target as well.\nthese these guys are popping up in your\nTargets and your Walmarts and uh Big Bad\nToy Store, Entertainment Arts and Amazon\nand all that. So, uh yeah, between that\nand uh don't forget check me out my\nsocials like you know with my blue sky\nand of course on my quick lights and\nlinks to those will be in the\ndescription down below and I think\nthat's it. So this is transformers leg\ndecepticone punchl and this is Jesus\nChrist Joni prime saying remember you\ndon't stop play because you grow you\ngrow because you stop play be geek be\nproud you're under arrest you check\nup about two and a half hours\nlater sheesh wow this is looking too\ngood yeah I agree With those\nDecepticones and cons over there between\nboth places, they're that shaped like\ngot something going on. I can only\nimagine what they're playing. But my\nintuition gives me a good, fair,\neducated\nguess. Hi Chris. Hey Selena. So what's\ngoing on right now? Well, Sonia, it\nlooks like apparently Glim Makoto and\ntheir Decepticons and Cons are uh\nlooking for a bit of a John and actually\nthat make another attempt on the J\nelectric plant. We just seen a few\nactually working that way. We despite\nCrafted the first and a team of cons and\nclones going to the volcano island just\noff the coast.\nYeah, I don't have a good feeling about\nthis, especially considering my air they\ncan get out of a volcano. I mean,\nwhatever it is they're doing with the\nparts they're looking to get from the\nger plant and all that air, John, it\ncan't be anything good. I agree, Selena.\nIt cannot be anything good. I mean,\naside from just what all that other\ndamage Motto had done years before. I\nwonder what she's up to now with all\nthese tools and error. on I think\nthey're actually dividing their teams\nbetween the two places is they think we\ncan't take the bout in one shot divide\nour team think we got quick bots not so\nquick but with craft the first actually\nbeing back in commission and actually on\nthe volcan island we're definitely to\nsend Metatron over there this was the GE\nplant unfortunately armor ads and roll\nout are actually on another mission with\nJazz and cliff jumper they're not going\nto be able to help us out either way\nwell looks like I'm going to have to go\nin combine mode and actually help out\nbattle the volcano island with the\nothers. And not only am I going to have\nto lead the team, but I'm going to have\nto be a component of the combiner mode\nas well once again. That's okay. I think\nSonu will be able to handle things at\nthe GE plant. And we'll have to ask\nOptimus Prime for a few more bots to\nhelp us out just to be safe. Well, that\nsounds like a plan, Chris. And\nfortunately, between Optimus Prime and\nLear One, we'll be able to actually have\ngreat success on all\nthis. Hi guys. So, unfortunately, I just\nsaw some Decepticons flying overhead.\nGoing really fast eastward. Going really\nfast. How fast were they going, Sparky?\nWell, I'd say they're going beyond Mach\n3. Mach 3. Thank goodness that we have\nno time. I see. Well, I'll have to\nteleport myself, Etselina, and Fireshot\nto the Volcano Island. At Sonu, you'll\nhave to go and lead the team right away\nto the General Electric\nplant. You can call on me, Chris. I'll\nget Silver and the others to help you\nout at the GE plant and I'll call\nOptimus Prime for some more troops.\nAutobots and Guardians, let's transform\nand roll out.\n[Music]\nMeanwhile,\nI already told you those crates go over\nthere. You better get right or you're\ngoing to have a bad time. All right.\nWell, Crusher, despite your mess ups and\nbuns you did while I was away, you\nmanaged to actually make a bit of a\nsuccess around here. But still, don't\never distrust me like that again. You\nYou disobey me again. And I'll give you\nthe real slammer to Psycho and Megatron.\nWell, after I stomp my frustrations out,\nit ended up being easier to let go of\nthe fact that you threw me a few miles\naway. Although, I will say that is an\nexaggerated number. But still, that\nhurt. I never crashed so hard to anyone\nin my life. Not even Turbo is as hard as\ncracked to the first is. He slams it on\nme. I feel it. But then I slam the\ncracker. Did I really feel it? But I\nguess I'll give it to you this time. A\ncoto baby. This time know if you fight\nme, I'll definitely thunder stop your\nfoot and make you feel it\nhard. You do that to me and then I'll\ndefinitely see you in the barracks.\nCrasher. Ah, but left, sir. Boss lady\ncrusher. Uh, cracker, sir. I come with\ngood news. All the other job process\nisn't making good standards and the\nDecepticones have made it to the gerric\nplant. They only encountered a few\nAutobots, but the Autobots are not\nactually winning so easily. That might\nbe good news, but you never know when\nthere's going to be more of them coming\nabout. Yeah, I think so. Unfortunately,\nMegatron's got the team over there, so\nwe stand a chance of at least getting\nwhat we need for that plant this time.\nYeah, that's a good thing.
