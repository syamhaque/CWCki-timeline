His reasons for that are quoted from him by the Trolls\non the Cwcki. They include me \"being scary to children\" and simply he\n\"was looking for a reason to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ban\" title=\"Ban\">ban</a>\" me. From past confrontations, it is\nConfirmed that he is a closed-minded, dark-hearted bastard. Between\nthat, and Mr. Lightburn's conviction of being a <a href=\"/cwcki/Pedofork\" title=\"Pedofork\">lolita sexual offender</a>,\nthere is likely a connection. I am searching for dirt on Michael. But\nit is enough that \"Cyber-Bullies meet and plot in a toy store owned by\na convicted sex offender,\" or something like that. This is also\nrelevant as the Trolls have tried throw labels of \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">gay</a>\" and \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Pedofork\" title=\"Pedofork\">pedophile</a>\"\nonto me and have attempted in framing me of such heinous deeds in the\npast.\n</p><p>On another topic, \"Raining Dykes\" is most acceptable, and I will do my\nbest to sing it good along with the other tracks. :)\n</p><p>I will contact the person about the Google Bomb soon.

I took a bag full of used cans with me also to dispose\nof them in a nearby dumpster behind <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Lion\" title=\"wikipedia:Food Lion\">Food Lion</a> (there is no recycling\nfacility or disposal area for cans around here yet).\n</p><p>I was going to take <a href=\"/cwcki/Son-Chu\" title=\"Son-Chu\">my car</a>, but it would not start. So I called and\ninformed mom about that, and that I would take the recently checked van\ninstead. She also asked me to drive by Goodwill to swap the van for\nthe Mitsu. I would have taken either the Honda or BMW, but I still\nlack manual transmission knowledge. The van started. After getting\nonto the road, I noticed the \"check engine\" being lit; <a href=\"/cwcki/Honor_roll\" title=\"Honor roll\">at the moment I\ndisregarded it</a>. But after dropping off the cans in the dumpster, I\nstarted to press on, but after moving forward slightly, it stalled on\nme. And I could not restart it. I called mom to come to me then.\n</p><p>Beforehand, she had a bought with the bitchy server/owner of Riley's,\nRiley herself. Mom had a quarter of a chicken sandwich from McD; she\nbrought it in with her. She had also got her tea at Riley's before\nthis bout. Mom pulls out the quarter sandwich; Riley is all, \"you\ncan't eat food from another place here\". There's no sign stating that\nanywhere there. So, mom ignored her and ate the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC-isms\" title=\"CWC-isms\">q-sand</a> in front of\nher. Riley asked her to leave. Mom wanted her tea too, and she had a\nbig reusable plastic cup in the Mitsu. So she takes the cup of tea out\nto the car and fills Her cup with the tea. She then returned the\nrestaurant's cup to the table dad was still sitting at. Riley bitched\nsome more at mom about taking their cheap plastic glass outside. So,\nto come back for dad later, she leaves for the nearby Goodwill. Here\nis where I came in with the last call, as well as the following where I\nrequested help stranded by the dumpster.\n</p><p>So mom comes with the Mitsu to the van; the jumper cables were in the back of my car, the escort, at home. So, she stayed at the van while I A) picked up dad at Riley's, B) stop to get lunch for me at the nearby <a href=\"/cwcki/Obesity\" title=\"Obesity\">Taco Bell/KFC</a>; M.Deal 1: chick burrito, med drink and chips, C) return dad home and pick up the jumpers and D) return to mom and the van.\n</p><p>The van was still fighting with the mucky, old gasoline; mom and dad got earlier today a bottle of gas cleaner. So after returning to her, she poured in the cleaner, attached the jumpers, and got the van started. After putting away the jumpers, I followed her in the van with me in the Mitsu up to the nearby <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sheetz\" title=\"Sheetz\">Sheetz</a>.\n</p><p>After her parking the van by pump 7, I parked the Mitsu in a nearby space. I checked in with her, then went into Sheetz to wash my hands\nto allow me to eat the chick burrito. I sat in the van after she fueled it halfway, and fueled the canister; she had to poo bad. After she returned, I had finished the burrito; she got in and tried to start the van; no turnover. So I pulled the Mitsu up to the van to try rejumping; no good. Mom called dad; he suggested punchin' the pedal while starting up; no good. I stayed by her side during thebwait and restart trials, keeping her company and talkin'; it helped her feel better. Eventually, she reluctantly called for a tow, which arrived about 10 to 20 min. later, to tow the van to Chuck's, just less than half a mile north of Sheetz. The jumpers and can of gas were placed in the Mitsu. We followed the truck and van, left a pair of van keys with Chuck. He'll have another go at it soon. Then tired, mom and I finally came back home about quarter after 7. Killed my day.\n</p><p>I was planning on getting the songwork completed, but after what happened...
