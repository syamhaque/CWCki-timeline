You've said in the past that you feel comfortable within the safety of your own four walls, with your parents living under the same roof. That's understandable, but surely now you're really just doing more damage than good for yourself?\n</p><p>You can't rely on your parents forever. Of course they'll always help you when possible, but the simple fact is, your parents may not even be here within 10 years. Your parents are both getting on in years, particularly your father, who I know has a medical history of heart problems.\n</p><p>If you're still relying on their warmth and shelter until the day they die, what happens to you then? You will have no savings for yourself, because you waste it all on unnecessary material gain, such as videogames and porn. You'll have a poor credit history from your unpaid debts, which means that not many people are going to be willing to trust you with renting a place. Buying a place would simply be out of the question for somebody in your financial situation.\n</p><p>You're very nearly 30 years old and you have never lived alone, or with a partner. Should the day come when you do move in with a woman, I think she'd probably leave you when you become unbearingly dependant and demanding of her, much as you have done with your parents.\n</p><p>Don't you think you're being unfair on them, too? At this point in their lives, they just want to spend quality time together, after sacrificing many years to raising a child, knowing that their son is a success and is making his own way in life.

Yes, I am the son of Mike Jackson.\n</p><p>I've had a tough time dealing with my father's death. My mother has had to start counseling because she found my father's cold lifeless body laying in the living room. She had to put her hands on his wrist and check to see if he still had a pulse as well as check him for breathing as she dialed 911.\n</p><p>My mother had to keep my screaming and crying siblings from coming into the living room while she waited ALONE WITH HIS BODY for the ambulance people to arrive and pronounce him dead. SHE IS HAVING NIGHTMARES ABOUT THAT NIGHT EVER SINCE. She hasn't eaten, she sleeps very little, and she cries all the time. His death has shattered her <a href=\"/cwcki/Heart_level\" title=\"Heart level\">heart levels</a> to depths that you will never even feel, you asshole.\n</p><p>This isn't even including how I've been dealing with my father's death.

Debbie has been taking care of my siblings as well as handling the responsibilities of the house and business. I am studying to take over the business in a few years.\n</p><p>I swear man... if my mother and siblings didn't need me so damn much, I'd fly down to Ruckersville Virginia and beat your fat ass into a bloody pulp. I know my mother wouldn't like that and I KNOW my father wouldn't approve of violence, so you better count your blessings. Your nasty and emotionless response to my mother sent her into a catatonic state for days. My father reached out to you for help and you didn't care enough to help him. Then my mother decides to be nice and tell you about his death and you didn't care. The fact that one person could be so cold, nasty and unfeeling about someone's death has shattered her mind.\n</p><p>You can bet for damn sure that I'll never read your comic again.
