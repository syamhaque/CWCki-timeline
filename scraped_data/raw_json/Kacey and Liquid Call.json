What is already an emotionally-damaging call for Chris gets even more awkward when <a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris\" title=\"Liquid Chris\">Liquid Chris</a> arrives. At that point, Solid loses it, and the conversation grinds to a screeching halt as Solid and Liquid have a massive fight between who is the real Chris and who is more deserving of Kacey. All in all, Solid repeatedly showed her how much he is unworthy of her love. <a href=\"/cwcki/Borb\" title=\"Borb\">Borb</a> also makes an appearance as Solid tries to hide behind their skirts.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Summary\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Summary</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Video\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Video</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href='#\"You_shot_him!\"_(00:00-09:29)'><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">\"You <i>shot</i> him!\" (00:00-09:29)</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#&quot;It's_a_very_simple_question!&quot;_(9:30-13:14)\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">\"It's a very simple question!\" (9:30-13:14)</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#&quot;That's_not_volunteer_work!&quot;_(13:15-17:14)\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">\"That's <i>not</i> volunteer work!\" (13:15-17:14)</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Father_Knows_Best_(17:15_-_19:50)\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Father Knows Best (17:15 - 19:50)</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Sonichu_di_Casanova_(19:51_-22:37)\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Sonichu di Casanova (19:51 -22:37)</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Here_Come_the_Drums_(22:38-30:17)\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Here Come the Drums (22:38-30:17)</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-9\"><a href='#\"Stop_being_crazy!\"_(30:18-35:40)'><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">\"Stop being crazy!\" (30:18-35:40)</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Grand_Finale_(35:41_and_onward)\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Grand Finale (35:41 and onward)</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#External_links\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">External links</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Summary\">Summary</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Chris asks Kacey if she got the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_Special_4\" title=\"Sonichu Special 4\">comic</a> that he sent her. Kacey expresses horror over the fact that - in said comic - Chris <i>shoots</i> Liquid. Chris defends himself by noting both that he shot Liquid only in the legs and that Liquid was coming after him with a knife. Kacey doesn't understand why Chris didn't just produce one of his usual <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris-chan_Sonichu\" title=\"Chris-chan Sonichu\">Chris-chan Sonichu</a> stories, instead of a violent revenge fantasy where Chris wounds Kacey's real-life boyfriend. Chris replies that he'd thought that this comic should be <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">closer to real life</a>, though he immediately thereafter backpedals to note that he doesn't own a gun in real life and doesn't have plans to <i>actually</i> shoot Liquid. When this account fails to appease Kacey, Chris offers to retcon the offending page out of the comic entirely. Kacey explains to Chris that redrawing the scene won't change the fact that he's demonstrably crazy enough to imply he wants to shoot her boyfriend. In a final word of defense, Chris suggests that Liquid is similarly insane.</li>\n<li>In addition to upsetting her with the comic, Chris disappointed Kacey by breaking his promises to clean his room and get into shape. When Kacey asks Chris if he's been jogging five miles a day, there's a long pause before Chris replies that he has. After further interrogation, Chris modifies his answer to say that he has been jogging one-and-a-half miles a day, but that he <i>could</i> be jogging five. When Kacey points out that Chris was just claiming that he has <i>in fact</i> been jogging five miles a day, Chris insists that he had simply misunderstood her question.</li>\n<li>Since - like Chris himself - the argument over how much Chris jogs is going nowhere, Kacey moves on to discuss further evidence of Chris's sloth. Exhibit B: Chris's <i><a href=\"/cwcki/LittleBigPlanet\" title=\"LittleBigPlanet\">LittleBigPlanet</a></i> date level was originally made for <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Julie\" title=\"Julie\">another girl</a>. Chris's peculiar defense: that doesn't matter because said other girl turned out to be <a href=\"/cwcki/BlueSpike\" title=\"BlueSpike\">a dude</a>. Kacey then accuses Chris of playing video games when he could've been working on his comic for her, at which point Chris briefly tards out. Thereafter, the hits from Kacey come fast and furious: Chris accomplishes nothing despite not going to school, not working, and not having any friends. Chris replies that although he's not working, he <i>is</i> filling out job applications. When Kacey questions the existence of Chris's work history, Chris claims that his time spent playing <i>Pokémon</i> with children counts as volunteer work.</li>\n<li>Kacey states that her father is right; Chris is insane, and that she should be with Liquid. She states that she hated the apology video, calling it fake, and that Chris' behavior was like that of a spoiled brat. Chris responds harshly, saying that he really cried. Kacey finally sees the light, saying that Chris only wants her <a href=\"/cwcki/China\" title=\"China\">for</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_sex\" title=\"Chris and sex\">one</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Crystal_Weston_Chandler_(daughter)\" title=\"Crystal Weston Chandler (daughter)\">thing</a> and that he just wanted to take her away from Liquid to spite him. She reveals that Chris told her not to talk to Liquid or see him again. Chris is either trying to be smooth or trying to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_psychology\" title=\"Chris and psychology\">guilt</a> her into giving up by saying the first thing he thinks of when he thinks of her is what a great <a href=\"/cwcki/Gal_pal\" title=\"Gal pal\">friend</a> she is.</li>\n<li>Chris begins talking quietly, in small, generic sentences about how much he cares about her. He says that if someone were to shoot Kacey, he would be sad. Chris states how she has been nothing but good to him. Kacey states she hates liars, which <a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_Chris%27s_lies\" title=\"List of Chris's lies\">doesn't bode well</a> for Solid. Apparently, the first time they met, he did nothing but stare at Kacey's chest and insult her (and that's not even getting into how their relationship even <a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey_Call_1\" title=\"Kacey Call 1\">began with a lie</a>). Chris declares he was looking at her face, and ignores the fact that he called her <a href=\"/cwcki/Obesity\" title=\"Obesity\">fat</a>. She points out that <a href=\"/cwcki/Women%27s_rights\" title=\"Women's rights\">her face isn't under her shirt</a> when Chris claims to have been looking at her face.</li>\n<li>Things take a truly interesting turn when the TRUE and HONEST Chris arrives home, and picks up the phone on Kacey's end. Upon realizing who is on the other end of the line, the conversation degenerates into a long shouting match between him and Solid. Solid ignores Kacey for a majority of the rest of the call, instead repeatedly raging when Liquid calls him \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Ian_Brandon_Anderson\" title=\"Ian Brandon Anderson\">Ian Brandon Anderson</a>\". Noting how much he lies, Kacey accuses Chris of forging his documents, like his driver's license and diploma, given he repeatedly accused Liquid of doing the same. Liquid then notes how Solid is <a href=\"/cwcki/Obesity\" title=\"Obesity\">fat</a>, which really <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tard_rage\" title=\"Tard rage\">pisses him off</a> and leads him to shout out insults (while constantly saying how hurt he is by Liquid insulting <i>him</i>). Liquid then says he is going to the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jerkops\" title=\"Jerkops\">jerkops</a> with the gun comic.</li>\n<li>Kacey doesn't think that Chris is autistic, saying he acts more bipolar than anything, and that he possibly can't have <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism_papers\" title=\"Autism papers\">autism papers</a>. Solid <a href=\"/cwcki/Death_threats\" title=\"Death threats\">invites Liquid over to his house</a>, but Kacey is worried that he will get shot (Solid <i>did</i> draw himself doing exactly that in the comic, after all). Liquid reveals he and Kacey were \"making passionate love to each other\" at <a href=\"/cwcki/14_Branchland_Court\" title=\"14 Branchland Court\">14 Branchland Court</a>, which seems to really piss off Solid. Kacey thinks that Chris doesn't care about her, and that he is far too busy being worried about his identity than paying attention to what she is saying.</li>\n<li>Kacey notes that her dad gave Liquid his blessing, not Solid (and he did exactly that during the Father Call). Liquid has a job and will turn <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a></i> into a real franchise. Solid whines about <a href=\"/cwcki/Honest_Content\" title=\"Honest Content\">truth and honesty</a>, and after Kacey yet again calls him out for lying, he has had enough. He proceeds to wake up <a href=\"/cwcki/Barbara_Chandler\" title=\"Barbara Chandler\">Barb</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler\" title=\"Bob Chandler\">Bob</a> to try and get them to tell off Liquid; Bob reveals that the call is taking place at <i>midnight</i>, and seems rather annoyed that his son woke him and his wife up for the sole purpose of warding off <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">strangers</a> on the phone. Kacey and Liquid both go silent when Bob comes on the line, and Barb - in perhaps some of the smartest advice she's ever given - tells Chris to \"just hang up on the bitch\". Flabbergasted, Kacey basically tells him to fuck off, feeling beyond offended that he didn't even try to defend her from being called a bitch by her supposed boyfriend's own mother. She then declares she will marry Liquid. Solid exits the call, but not before telling Liquid that he will out him as the liar.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Video\">Video</span></h2>\n<center><div class=\"boilerplate metadata\" id=\"honest\">\n<table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"4\" style=\"border: 4px solid #000000;\">\n<tbody><tr><td><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Chris-rage.gif\"><img alt=\"Chris-rage.gif\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"100\" src=\"/w/images/f/fd/Chris-rage.gif\" width=\"100\"/></a></td>\n<td><p align=\"center\">\n</p><p><b>WARNING!
