He claims to have been diagnosed with <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">HFA</a> (which even isn't an official diagnose yet), which would explain a lot of his socially awkward behaviour. Yet he shows such a disturbed view of the world around him that even other autistic people wonder just what the fuck is wrong with him. There just has to be more to it than autism. Narcissistic Personality Disorder or simply narcissism is an obvious choice. \n</p><p>A personality disorder is an enduring pattern of inner experience and behaviour that deviates markedly from the expectation of the individual's culture, is pervasive and inflexible, has an onset in adolescence or early adulthood, is stable over time, and leads to distress or impairment. People with narcissism show a pervasive pattern of grandiosity (in fantasy or behaviour), need for admiration, and lack of empathy. According to the DSM-IV TR the disorder begins by early adulthood and is indicated by at least five of the following:\n</p><p><br/>\n</p>\n<ul><li><b> An exaggerated sense of self-importance (e.g., exaggerates achievements and talents, expects to be recognized as superior without commensurate achievements).</b></li></ul>\n<p>First one of the list and we've already struck gold. We're talking about a manchild that thinks drawing a shitty comic every 6 months entitles him to his own <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/True_and_Loyal_fanbase\" title=\"True and Loyal fanbase\">personal army</a>. He has shown this behaviour at other times in his life, such as at his graduation from <a href=\"/cwcki/Manchester_High_School\" title=\"Manchester High School\">high school</a> where he wanted to receive an art award for his beautiful artwork and was shocked to see it go to other, more talented people. Chris also believes he can give solid advice on <a href=\"/cwcki/Dating_education\" title=\"Dating education\">dating</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_sex\" title=\"Chris and sex\">sex</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Women%27s_rights\" title=\"Women's rights\">women in general</a>. We all know how far that's gotten him.\n</p><p><br/>\n</p>\n<ul><li><b> Preoccupation with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love.</b></li></ul>\n<p><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Love_quest\" title=\"Love quest\">His sweetheart to build from the ground up as a holy quest given to him by God himself</a>. Chris believes himself to be better at designing games than <a href=\"/cwcki/Shigeru_Miyamoto\" title=\"Shigeru Miyamoto\">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> himself as Chris is the creator of Sonichu. His life is so special, it warrants its own <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler%27s_Adult_Chronicles\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler's Adult Chronicles\">game</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler...Yep,_I%27m_on_TV_:)\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler...Yep, I'm on TV :)\">movie</a>. His <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\">\"artwork\"</a> is often laced with reworkings of actual events to play out in his favor.\n</p><p><br/>\n</p>\n<ul><li><b> Believes he is \"special\" and can only be understood by, or should associate with, other special or high-status people (or institutions).</b></li></ul>\n<p>Chris believing he is \"special\"? As an autistic he refuses to associate with or at least date other autistic people. Just look at his list of requirements for a <a href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart\" title=\"Sweetheart\">sweetheart</a> and see how far he is aiming above his worth.\n</p><p><br/>\n</p>\n<ul><li><b> Requires excessive admiration.</b><div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Happybday.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"429\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/a/a0/Happybday.jpg/300px-Happybday.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/a/a0/Happybday.jpg/450px-Happybday.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/a/a0/Happybday.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Happybday.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>The infamous comment and some of the reactions that it sparked</div></div></div></li></ul>\n<p>Chris searches <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Youtube\" title=\"Youtube\">Youtube</a> to find videos about himself. He once commented on a video for some girl who named herself Chris-chan, thinking he was the only one in the world who could be the subject of a Youtube video for Chris-chan. When Christian found out he was featured on G4 <a href=\"/cwcki/For_G4s_Web_Soup\" title=\"For G4s Web Soup\">in a segment on stupid YouTube videos</a>, he posted a new video inviting all women enticed by his <a href=\"/cwcki/I_Got_A_Fish\" title=\"I Got A Fish\">idiotic spasming</a> to check him out.\n</p><p><br/>\n</p>\n<ul><li><b> Has a sense of entitlement.</b></li></ul>\n<p>Chris doesn't just try to garner praise and attention, he feels that he's entitled to it and flips out every time he doesn't receive the praise he believes to deserve. Just look at his <a href=\"/cwcki/Manchester_High_School\" title=\"Manchester High School\">graduation</a> and the infamous <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PaRappa_the_Rapper_Contest\" title=\"PaRappa the Rapper Contest\">PaRappa the Rapper Contest</a>. His behaviour towards <a href=\"/cwcki/Wes_Iseli\" title=\"Wes Iseli\">perceived rivals in love</a>, and <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">responsible</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Bagget\" title=\"Bagget\">working</a> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jerkops\" title=\"Jerkops\">adults</a> who try to put a stop to his idiocy shows he feels entitled to behave like as a superior being to whom simple rules of civil behaviour don't apply. \n</p><p><br/>\n</p>\n<ul><li><b> Selfishly takes advantage of others to achieve his own ends.</b></li></ul>\n<p>Just a short list of victims: <a href=\"/cwcki/Cole_Smithey\" title=\"Cole Smithey\">Cole Smithey</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Megan\" title=\"Megan\">Megan</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Emily\" title=\"Emily\">Emily</a>\n</p><p><br/>\n</p>\n<ul><li><b> Lacks empathy.</b></li></ul>\n<p>He may lack empathy because he's autistic. It's mentioned here again because we may never know the real cause. Just look <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_death\" title=\"Chris and death\">here</a> for examples.\n</p><p><br/>\n</p>\n<ul><li><b> Is often envious of others or believes that others are envious of him</b></li></ul>\n<p>His attitude towards other men as having taken <a href=\"/cwcki/Attraction_Sign\" title=\"Attraction Sign\">\"ALL THE PRETTY GIRLS AND LEFT NONE FOR ME!!!\"</a> shows a lot more envy than most human beings should ever show towards anything. Another proof of his envy was the personal hate that he aimed at <a href=\"/cwcki/Adam_Stackhouse\" title=\"Adam Stackhouse\">Adam Stackhouse</a>, the winner of the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PaRappa_the_Rapper_Contest\" title=\"PaRappa the Rapper Contest\">PaRappa the Rapper Contest</a>. Chris also rationalizes his jealousy of men as what he calls <a href=\"/cwcki/Noviophobia\" title=\"Noviophobia\">Noviophobia</a>, a \"fear\" that any woman he talks to might have a boyfriend.\n</p><p><br/>\n</p>\n<ul><li><b> Shows arrogant, haughty, patronizing, or contemptuous behaviours or attitudes</b></li></ul>\n<p>Again lots of examples are possible, yet for this you only need two words. <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler%27s_FUTURE_MESSAGE\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler's FUTURE MESSAGE\">\"STAY STRAIGHT\"</a>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.halcyon.com/jmashmun/npd/traits.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">NPD traits discussed</a></li></ul>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCached time: 20250518192104\nCache expiry: 86400\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: []\nCPU time usage: 0.055 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.058 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 82/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 746/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 32/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 10/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/100\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    7.418      1 -total\n100.00%    7.418      1 Template:Essay\n 44.77%    3.321      1 Template:Namespace_detect\n-->\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key cwcki-1_:pcache:idhash:3977-0!canonical and timestamp 20250518192104 and revision id 159574.
