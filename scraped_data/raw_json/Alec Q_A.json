I consider that to be a good example of his lack of respect or understanding for what a \"promise\" is - to him, a promise is just some words you say to make another person approve of you/give you something now, it doesn't matter what happens later and you can do what you want. After he hung up once, I asked him nicely to be a man and promise not to do so again, and he promised, but it never meant anything. At best, even if he does mean a promise, he thinks every promise he could ever make is contingent on him being happy and stress-free - he thinks if he's feeling bad, it gives him carte-blanche to disregard what he owes others.\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Do you think that your saga was completely responsible for the death of the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_comics\" title=\"Sonichu comics\">Sonichu comics</a>, or that a lot of factors came into play when Sonichu ended?\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #F2E6CE; border:1px dotted #BFB6A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Not completely.
