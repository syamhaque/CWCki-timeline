He was a serious <i>Pokémon</i> enthusiast by the late '90s, and by <a href=\"/cwcki/2004\" title=\"2004\">2004</a> he had enough interest in anime generally to attend the <a href=\"/cwcki/Anime_Mid-Atlantic\" title=\"Anime Mid-Atlantic\">Anime Mid-Atlantic</a> convention in Richmond, <a href=\"/cwcki/Virginia\" title=\"Virginia\">Virginia</a>. \n</p><p>While Chris is often associated with online anime culture and is often slapped with the \"weeaboo\" tag, he actually doesn't appear to be into anime as much as people think he is. He returned to Anime Mid-Atlantic in <a href=\"/cwcki/2005\" title=\"2005\">2005</a>, but wouldn't go to another convention for years, and even then the only anime-oriented convention Chris has been to ever since was <a href=\"/cwcki/OmegaCon\" title=\"OmegaCon\">OmegaCon</a>. (He considered a trip to Baltimore's Otakon convention in 2010, but primarily as a way of meeting <a href=\"/cwcki/Jackie\" title=\"Jackie\">Jackie</a> in person.)<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup> In his <a href=\"/cwcki/Adult_Swim_posts\" title=\"Adult Swim posts\">posts on the Adult Swim forums</a>, he didn't have much to say about the Japanese imports on the Adult Swim schedule, except to note that he didn't like the cartoonish <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">male nudity</a> in <i><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crayon_Shin-chan\" title=\"wikipedia:Crayon Shin-chan\">Crayon Shin-chan</a></i> (big shock there) and he wanted to see more anime featuring \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_8\" title=\"Sonichu 8\">very-close-to-nude girls</a>\" (even bigger shock).\n</p><p>Chris still ripped off characters and story concepts from anime left and right, however, and he still watched some newer anime series. His PSN account shows that he downloaded the entire \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_Girls\" title=\"Sonichu Girls\">harem</a>\" comedy-drama <i><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuffle!\" title=\"wikipedia:Shuffle!\">Shuffle!</a></i> in <a href=\"/cwcki/2009\" title=\"2009\">2009</a>; given that it stars a hapless twit who finds himself surrounded by willing women for no very good reason, Chris probably loved it (he has yet to comment on the scene where the main character got his eye cut by his psychotic <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Galpal\" title=\"Galpal\">galpal</a>). He also downloaded all of <i>Gunslinger Girl</i> in early <a href=\"/cwcki/2010\" title=\"2010\">2010</a>, doing plenty to undermine his contention that he isn't a <a href=\"/cwcki/Pedofork\" title=\"Pedofork\">pedofork</a>.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Fistofthesonichu.JPG\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"191\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/0/0a/Fistofthesonichu.JPG/300px-Fistofthesonichu.JPG\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/0/0a/Fistofthesonichu.JPG/450px-Fistofthesonichu.JPG 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/0/0a/Fistofthesonichu.JPG/600px-Fistofthesonichu.JPG 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Fistofthesonichu.JPG\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Chris summoning his stand,「Let Me Call You <a href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart\" title=\"Sweetheart\">Sweetheart</a>」.</div></div></div>\n<p>According to his <a href=\"/cwcki/Netflix\" title=\"Netflix\">Netflix</a> queue from around <a href=\"/cwcki/November_2009\" title=\"November 2009\">November 2009</a>, Chris rented a number of anime in big DVD sets. His anime sets centered around three of his likes: <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonic\" title=\"Sonic\">Sonic</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Transformers\" title=\"Transformers\">Transformers</a> and scantily-clad women. In terms of Sonic, only three disks were seen rented, all three centered on <i>Sonic X</i>. It is more than likely that before the queue was taken, he had seen the other disks that comprised the series. While he had most of the Transformers series that were made in the last ten years, some of those were part of the Transformers saga known as the Unicron Trilogy: <i>Armada</i>, <i>Energon</i> and <i>Cybertron</i>.\n</p><p>The rest of the anime, as stated earlier, revolves around women — strong women who are capable of defending themselves without simpering over a man, unlike <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu_(species)\" title=\"Rosechu (species)\">some creatures</a> we all know and love. Some of those films and series included <i>Read or Die</i>, <i>Slayers Return</i>, <i>Elfen Lied</i> and, probably the least surprising of all, <i>Kekko Kamen</i>, a comedic action series featuring a heroine who battles evil while stark naked. The last series might have had a particular impact on Chris, as the face-rape of <a href=\"/cwcki/Jason_Kendrick_Howell\" title=\"Jason Kendrick Howell\">Jason Kendrick Howell</a> in <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_8\" title=\"Sonichu 8\">Sonichu 8</a> is <a href=\"/cwcki/Things_Chris_has_ripped_off#Kekko_Kamen\" title=\"Things Chris has ripped off\">very similar</a> to Pubic Hair Jump, a move by which the title character of <i>Kekko Kamen</i> defeats her enemies. <i>Elfen Lied</i> is a rather surprising choice for Chris given its notoriously dark and gruesome imagery and themes, but given <a href=\"/cwcki/Incest\" title=\"Incest\">certain elements</a> of the series, perhaps it's not too surprising.\n</p><p>In his <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_Sex_Logs\" title=\"Chris Sex Logs\">chats about sex with PandaHalo</a>, Chris mentioned that he's watched some pornographic anime, colloquially known as \"hentai\", but he didn't go into any further detail. \n</p><p>During Chris's interview on the <a href=\"/cwcki/Internet_Dream_Lounge\" title=\"Internet Dream Lounge\">Internet Dream Lounge</a>, he would recommend the shojo series <i><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nana_(manga)\" title=\"wikipedia:Nana (manga)\">Nana</a></i> when asked what anime series he would recommend.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys</a> used images from <i><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphogear\" title=\"wikipedia:Symphogear\">Symphogear</a></i> and <i><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_Art_Online_Alternative_Gun_Gale_Online\" title=\"wikipedia:Sword Art Online Alternative Gun Gale Online\">Sword Art Online Alternative Gun Gale Online</a></i> as part of their brainwashing of Chris. Chris has watched a few episodes of <i>Symphogear</i>, and has noted how one of the characters in the series, Chris Yukine, is referred to by the lead character Hibiki as \"<a href=\"/cwcki/June_2018_social_media_posts#Symphogear_.28unintentionally.29_gives_a_shout-out_to_Chris\" title=\"June 2018 social media posts\">Chris-chan</a>\". He hasn't made any word on <i>Sword Art Online</i>, but does own <i>SAO: Lost Song</i> for the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PlayStation_4\" title=\"PlayStation 4\">PlayStation 4</a>.\n</p><p>In 2020, Chris made the somewhat dubious claim that watching <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27%27Cells_at_Work!%27%27\" title=\"wikipedia:''Cells at Work!''\"><i>Cells at Work!</i></a> would strengthen one's immune system against <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Coronavirus\" title=\"Coronavirus\">coronavirus</a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup> He also posted about <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNA:_Brand_New_Animal\" title=\"wikipedia:BNA: Brand New Animal\"><i>BNA: Brand New Animal</i></a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup>\n</p><p>While in jail in 2022, he drew <a href='/cwcki/OfficialCWCmart_Jail_Art#\"A_Coffee_Jelly_Break\",_dated_08/27/2022' title=\"OfficialCWCmart Jail Art\">art</a> inspired by <i><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Disastrous_Life_of_Saiki_K.\" title=\"wikipedia:The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.\">The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.</a></i>, indicating he saw it before he went in, or may have picked up the manga in the prison library.

UGUU~</div></div></div>\n<p>Although Chris was interested in anime before he began drawing his <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\">Sonichu</a></i> comics, he didn't start giving the characters in his comic an obviously anime-inspired look until <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_5\" title=\"Sonichu 5\"><i>Sonichu</i> #5</a>, which he completed in the spring of <a href=\"/cwcki/2006\" title=\"2006\">2006</a>. This was almost certainly the result of <a href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Schroeder\" title=\"Megan Schroeder\">Megan Schroeder</a>'s influence — she was a big fan of <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Sailor_Moon\" title=\"Sailor Moon\">Sailor Moon</a></i> and other popular Japanese cartoons, and Chris was pursuing her especially fervently at the time. Practically speaking, this shift in style involved giving his characters huge, prismatic, saucer-like eyes, which make them look more <a href=\"/cwcki/Yawning_Squirtle\" title=\"Yawning Squirtle\">stoned</a> than animu, or \"set-theoretic intersection\" (∩) eyes. He also made use of creative elements that work in anime but not in a sequential comic, as well as tedious and unnecessary clichés common to anime.\n</p><p>Needless to say, despite the radical artwork style change in his comics, Chris still was cockblocked.\n</p><p>Since his relationship with Megan deteriorated (eventually <a href=\"/cwcki/ShecameforCWC.JPG\" title=\"ShecameforCWC.JPG\">blowing up in his face</a>), anime hasn't been so obvious an influence on Chris’s artwork.

Misato/Kaji sex scene(Where you only saw feet) Reason: It made him feel that he was a big man and that he was watching no Kid's Cartoon. 2. The Rei Angels that were Kawaii Reason: Kawaii~ 3. The internal Struggles of 1 boy Reason: unknown Theory: Probably sees himself as Shinji being constantly trolled by Auska, ect. What is Chris' Summary of End of Eva: An generic tale of a boy's struggle for acceptance...a lot like him. What Chris thought he saw: Symbolisms(IN MY EVA?) What Christ didn't like about Eva 1. Everyone turns to orange tang juice Reason: Unknown, Chris fears Death? Everyone at least got to see their lover before they died(even if the love was 1 sided). But that would require chris to understand it. 2.Rei angels getting turned on by stabbing themselves. Reason: Unknown. 3. The Doom and Gloom end Reason: Cause Chris don't like the bad news. 4.Auska freaking out(I don't wanna die) Reason: Draw your own thesis. Chris has made no mention of Shinji fapping to to the comatose auska. Why? we don't know. Final Question. Did Chris even understand what he even saw? Answer: We're guessing no.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-Ivy-5\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\">↑ <sup><a href=\"#cite_ref-Ivy_5-0\">5.0</a></sup> <sup><a href=\"#cite_ref-Ivy_5-1\">5.1</a></sup></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Ivy_Q%26A\" title=\"Ivy Q&amp;A\">Ivy Q&amp;A</a></span>\n</li>\n</ol></div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCached time: 20251018105700\nCache expiry: 86400\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: []\nCPU time usage: 0.178 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.194 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 592/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 9667/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 3357/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 5/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/100\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 3871/5000000 bytes\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   55.279      1 -total\n 28.44%   15.719      2 Template:Infobox/Fanvideo\n 13.52%    7.472     16 Template:W\n 10.71%    5.922      1 Template:Main\n  9.59%    5.302      1 Template:Taxpayermoney\n  7.31%    4.043     33 Template:Pipe\n  5.96%    3.296      1 Template:Articleofthenow\n-->\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key cwcki-1_:pcache:idhash:2152-0!canonical and timestamp 20251018105700 and revision id 350283.
