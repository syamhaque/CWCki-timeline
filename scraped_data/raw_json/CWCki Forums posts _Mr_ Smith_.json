At first I thought it was a relatively cheap item to buy and own a piece of Christory. I mean, the dude has provided my friends and I with countless hours of entertainment so the least I can do is try to support his little artistic endevour. But after I saw the <a href=\"/cwcki/Un-clit\" title=\"Un-clit\">news about his taint</a> I was flat out disgusted. The thought of him playing with his ball sack all day and then crafting my medallion makes me sick. So far he's refusing to give me a refund and insisting that he's a clean person. I don't care how clean you are <a href=\"/cwcki/Affair_with_Mother\" title=\"Affair with Mother\">mother fucker</a>, I don't want anyone who sits around playing with their balls all day to make a damn craft for me.\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Refund_Motive\">Refund Motive</span></h2>\n<p>3 October 2014, as The Coward<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #CEF2CE; border:1px dotted #A3BFA3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>For the record, I never opened a case against Chris because of his hygiene. I only opened a case after the deadline had passed and it became blatantly obvious he wasn't going to send the medallion any time soon. I honestly think that I still wouldn't have received it if I wouldn't have lit a fire under his ass by opening the case against him.\n<p>As far as the actual medallion goes, it's so light and flimsy that I couldn't believe it. I don't know why but I always imagined that it was pretty heavy kind of like clay or ceramic. I'm actually happy with the medallion though because like others have said, it's unique and a product of rage. As far as selling it goes, I really don't know about that unless someone made me an offer I couldn't refuse.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"My_Experience\">My Experience</span></h2>\n<p>25 October 2014, as The Coward<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #CEF2CE; border:1px dotted #A3BFA3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>I'm making this thread at the suggestion of Null who told me that after everything finally finishes I should make a thread about it.\n<p>So I'll start at the beginning, I ordered a normal sonichu medallion from Christian sometime in September. I thought it would be something cool and funny to own and it was relatively cheap so why not? When he stated that shipping would take two weeks I took that literally, so when my two weeks were up and he was claiming that 1) he hadn't even made the medallion yet and 2) he didn't even have the money to ship it I filed a report, something that I would do to ANY Ebay seller, not just Chris.\n</p><p>As everyone knows by now, me filing a report with Ebay leads to Christian throwing an absolute hissy fit. He tried to put on a tough guy act with me via private message and yes I was the one who he eventually doxxed on Facebook. Yes, I did receive a prank phone call after this and Yes I was pretty damn pissed off at him at this point. I know Christian's fan base and I really don't want them having my personal information. I called Ebay about it that night and they seemed to think the situation was really weird and claimed that they would have a person investigate my claims and eventually contact me again, which they never did.\n</p><p>During this time I'm flat out fighting with Chris. He's sending me messages claiming that I'm a cyber bully who hates gays and autistics so at this point I've decided that I'm going to antagonize him all that I can. When my medallion finally arrived it was the infamous \"angry eyed\" sonichu medallion. I personally thought it was hilarious but since he had done pissed me off I decided that I'd keep pursing the case since he did technically send me the wrong item. Christian eventually tried to strike a deal with me, he said he would send me another medallion 100% free of charge since he admittedly vandalized the first one. I accepted this and made a counter offer; I would drop the other case about him doxxing me as well if he would do a free commission for me. At this point I didn't even give a shit about getting doxxed anymore because it had been like two weeks, and I figured I would get more enjoyment out of getting a free commission than I would having his accounts banned anyways.\n</p><p>I sent Chris two pictures of me and simply told him that I wanted to be drawn with Sonichu. I had no idea how it would turn out I just figured it'd be good for a laugh. I honestly figured it would get here really fast because artwork is so shitty that he can't put much time or effort into it, but alas it took him two weeks to draw it and ship it and I got bitchy emails from him several times over the few weeks wanting me to close the case before receiving the commission. Today I finally recieved the art and well, I'll just let it speak for itself.\n</p><p>I'll be posting the commison along with the two pictures of myself that I sent to him in this post. In later posts I'll dump everything else I have in regards to him including every medallion picture and message that I got incase people missed it.\n</p>\n<center><ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\">\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\"><div style=\"width: 155px\">\n<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><div style=\"margin:15px auto;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Chris%27s_Commission_to_Mr._Smith_(compressed).jpg\"><img alt=\"Chris's Commission to Mr. Smith (compressed).jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"120\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/1/1e/Chris%27s_Commission_to_Mr._Smith_%28compressed%29.jpg/90px-Chris%27s_Commission_to_Mr._Smith_%28compressed%29.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/1/1e/Chris%27s_Commission_to_Mr._Smith_%28compressed%29.jpg/135px-Chris%27s_Commission_to_Mr._Smith_%28compressed%29.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/1/1e/Chris%27s_Commission_to_Mr._Smith_%28compressed%29.jpg/180px-Chris%27s_Commission_to_Mr._Smith_%28compressed%29.jpg 2x\" width=\"90\"/></a></div></div>\n<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n</div>\n</div></li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\"><div style=\"width: 155px\">\n<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><div style=\"margin:15px auto;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Smith1.jpg\"><img alt=\"Smith1.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"120\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/4/44/Smith1.jpg/65px-Smith1.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/4/44/Smith1.jpg/97px-Smith1.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/4/44/Smith1.jpg/129px-Smith1.jpg 2x\" width=\"65\"/></a></div></div>\n<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n</div>\n</div></li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\"><div style=\"width: 155px\">\n<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><div style=\"margin:15px auto;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Smith2.jpg\"><img alt=\"Smith2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"120\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/b/bf/Smith2.jpg/84px-Smith2.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/b/bf/Smith2.jpg/125px-Smith2.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/b/bf/Smith2.jpg/167px-Smith2.jpg 2x\" width=\"84\"/></a></div></div>\n<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n</div>\n</div></li>\n</ul></center>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p><br/>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a class=\"external free\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140928174938/cwckiforums.com/threads/fb-09-21-14-chris-promises-all-the-medallions-will-be-shipped-by-9-27.4991/page-4#post-349366\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://web.archive.org/web/20140928174938/cwckiforums.com/threads/fb-09-21-14-chris-promises-all-the-medallions-will-be-shipped-by-9-27.4991/page-4#post-349366</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a class=\"external free\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20141005114214/http://cwckiforums.com/threads/fb-9-30-angry-eyed-sonichu-medallions.5107/page-10#post-361784\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://web.archive.org/web/20141005114214/http://cwckiforums.com/threads/fb-9-30-angry-eyed-sonichu-medallions.5107/page-10#post-361784</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-3\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-3\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a class=\"external free\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20141028013314/http://cwckiforums.com/threads/my-experience-with-christian-featuring-a-new-original-art-piece.5501/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://web.archive.org/web/20141028013314/http://cwckiforums.com/threads/my-experience-with-christian-featuring-a-new-original-art-piece.5501/</a></span>\n</li>\n</ol></div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCached time: 20250307060549\nCache expiry: 86400\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: []\nCPU time usage: 0.065 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.068 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 89/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 5475/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 4598/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 4/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/100\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 3644/5000000 bytes\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   37.270      1 -total\n 82.75%   30.840      3 Template:Quoteboxgreen\n 12.59%    4.691      1 Template:References\n-->\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key cwcki-1_:pcache:idhash:35880-0!canonical and timestamp 20250307060549 and revision id 320240.
