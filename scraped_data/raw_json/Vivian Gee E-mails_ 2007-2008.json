To make up for that, in case you haven't heard, I have got back to work on <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_7\" title=\"Sonichu 7\">Sonichu #7</a>, one page at a time. I've already promised a 2 or 3-page \"In-Comic\" interview with one Sonichu1985, AKA <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Robert_Simmons\" title=\"Robert Simmons\">Robert Simmons</a>, based on his <a href=\"/cwcki/YouTube\" title=\"YouTube\">YouTube</a> videos, but I believe that I WILL have a few more free pages after doing his interview, so with your permission, I can interview you as well, based on what I've seen on your <a href=\"/cwcki/DeviantART\" title=\"DeviantART\">deviantART</a> page. And if I come up with additional questions, I will ask you.\n</p><p>Now, on a more urgent matter, the dickheads behind the cursed <a href=\"/cwcki/Encyclopedia_Dramatica\" title=\"Encyclopedia Dramatica\">Encyclopedia Dramatica</a> webpage, are bring up the outdated rumor of you creating Sonichu before me, which as I recollect from my saved e-mails from you, you've apologized to me, and you've relinquished assumed ownership on Sonichu. I ask you, as a friend, to log onto <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/ED\" title=\"ED\">ED</a>, and set the record straight. You may wish to upload your later art to prove yourself to be who you are; my best lesbian friend, <a href=\"/cwcki/Anna_McLerran\" title=\"Anna McLerran\">Anna McLerran</a>, AKA \"Anniebanny\", created the \"ChadamRocket\" account on ED to speak in my defense, and I quote,\n</p><p>\"I wrote that blog back when I didn't know Chris personally. I got to know him soon after that, and we became real friends. He's a really nice guy, with a great sense of humor. Yes, to the outsider he is quirky, and some of his actions and the things he says can be funny, but at the same time he cares deeply about his friends, and all the other good stuff nobody looking at this page wants to hear about. I just wanted to put that out there, though, since I obviously can't permanently delete the blog inclusion.

Can't you understand that? I mean, all he's doing is imitating your mannerisms. Look at his latest video. He stuffed his shirt so he can look more like you. I can't believe you're still so <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Naive\" title=\"Naive\">naive</a>.\n</p><p>There are no <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Fanbase\" title=\"Fanbase\">fans</a> of Sonichu. Sonichu is a bastardization of properties that belong to other people. Your entire comic is pretty much a <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler_(comic_character)\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler (comic character)\">bastardization of your life</a>. Sonichu will never get anywhere. Quit your dreams of Sonichu (the game, the comic, merchandise, everything) now, and if you still feel a need to be \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_art\" title=\"Chris and art\">creative</a>\" or whatever bullshit you say, make something completely original. Don't base it off your life, don't base it off stuff that exists. Just make something completely new.\n</p><p>If you quit Sonichu and start working on your real life harder, I'm sure you'll find success. If you stay in your deluded fantasyland, I don't know what you will become.\n</p><p>You have never tried when it comes to women. Never. You can't just sit around and wait for it to happen. You have to make it happen. If you can't muster up the courage to do that, then you will never get <a href=\"/cwcki/Lovely_Weather\" title=\"Lovely Weather\">a wife</a>, letalone a <a href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart\" title=\"Sweetheart\">girlfriend</a>. There are places where single men and women go to, I'll let you find them on your own in your area.\n</p><p>Take off that <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Medallion\" title=\"Medallion\">medallion</a>. I can't stress this enough. If you do, it will signify your detachment from Sonichu, and a brighter future.\n</p><p>Forget about all those \"haters\", they don't hate you. They are <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Trolling\" title=\"Trolling\">trolling</a> you. They want to see you become this way. Don't you understand, there is no reason for you to get upset about them. That's what they want. If they see you upset, defeated, angry, you're just giving them the victory. Your latest comics as a retaliation is a result of that, and they love it. They don't view it as an attack. They view it as victory.\n</p><p>If you feel you can't do any of this, get a therapist. A real one. Ask your parents to send you to one. Do something about your life instead of bitch and draw comics about it.\n</p><p><a href=\"/cwcki/Metal_Gear\" title=\"Metal Gear\">Chris, you've got a way to fall.</a> But you can change that.\n</p><p>- Vivian Gee\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>No reply, again.
