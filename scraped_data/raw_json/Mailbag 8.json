Are the copper skin and leather of your ancestors not visually impressive enough for you?

Allow me to clarify.\n</p><p>In the article it says:\n</p><p>\"It differs from other autism spectrum disorders by its relative preservation of linguistic and cognitive development.\"\n</p><p>Note that it says preservation. Meaning that they preserve the linguistic and cognitive skills that other Autism sufferers lose to due their condition.\n</p><p>According to research, Aspergers is a milder from of Autism. It's when people have partial Autism, but not the full blunt of it.\n</p><p>Though it's rare, it's still possible for them to have some of the clumsiness associated with Autism, though not from the onset. Though it's frequently reported, it's actually not very common. Which is what we meant by clumsiness not being required for a diagnosis.\n</p><p>Nowhere does it say that it's worse than Autism. I don't understand what made you come to that conclusion. That's not even possible due to it being a milder form of Autism. \n</p><p>While they may develop some autistic characteristics as they grow older, the effects aren't as severe as actual Autism. I think that's where you probably got confused.\n</p><p>This isn't an easy subject to understand but hopefully this clears up any misunderstanding.
