Something long lasting in that or like you know obviously like I had the bead necklace with a nice necklace... necklace wire. Obviously we want one that won't rust or fall apart so easily like the experiences I had when the beads came apart sometimes and that broke I had to replace the ch- er string on that. anyway. \n</p><p>[<i>somewhat reads comment, clearly uncomfortable as it says \"The token that this came with didn't have jagged edges like in the picture, instead, it was just sort of hexagonal shaped.
