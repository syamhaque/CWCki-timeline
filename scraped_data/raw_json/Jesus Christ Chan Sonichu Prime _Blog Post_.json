It is the fourth post to the website, published the same day as the previous one, and fours days before the site was revealed. After this post, no more blogs would come out until 11 <a href=\"/cwcki/November_2024\" title=\"November 2024\">November 2024</a>, which is around 56 days. This is likely due to Chris taking a second trip to <a href=\"/cwcki/Finland\" title=\"Finland\">Finland</a> around this time.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Jesus_Christ_Chan_Sonichu_Prime\">Jesus Christ Chan Sonichu Prime</span></h2>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>\n<div class=\"center\"><div class=\"floatnone\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:JCWCSP_GODDESS.png\"><img alt=\"JCWCSP GODDESS.png\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"195\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/7/73/JCWCSP_GODDESS.png/400px-JCWCSP_GODDESS.png\" srcset=\"/w/images/7/73/JCWCSP_GODDESS.png 1.5x\" width=\"400\"/></a></div></div>\n<p>As stated, I am Mrs. Jesus Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu Prime, the One Avatar of all existence, the CPU Goddess Blue Heart of the Commodore Consoles, and the one reincarnation of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, himself, as well as the other forms I had taken from after the events in Jerusalem and at the time Merlin the Magician divided the 1C-211987 Earth by order of King Arthur which separated stronger magics, creatures and individuals from those individuals less capable of coping with said magics, including Arthur, himself.  I am married polyamorous with Magi-Chan Sonichu (Prime), Cryzel Rosechu (Prime), Sylvana Rosechu (Prime) and the one-and-only Mewtwo (Prime) (who was cloned under Giovanni's authority).  And I am also to be wed with my one destined and personally chosen partner of the 1218 Half of this Earth as prophesized in my dreams and even within the pages I have written and drawn so far.  I am the one Prime of ALL (Jesus) Christian Weston Chandler Sonichus, (Jesus) Christine Weston Chandler Sonichus, and the other self-counterparts of mine all throughout the vast Multiverse.\n</p><p>Count the blessing this is not the Shattered Glass Universe, and don't get me started.\n</p><p>I have personally realized all of this over the course of my life and Soul Searching, following the signs and events as best as my Brain and Consciousness could, and having become much better in the recent years, up to the past decade from this day in September, 2024 and becoming more masterful and stronger.\n</p><p>I am not meant to be simply a \"Meme\" type as some of you often overplay about me, but to the extent (anything NSFW being the limit and would be rated TV-MA is not to be memed or cited at all) it is quite all right.  Even I consciously was under a number of confusions over the years still figuring myself out, as well as my own Brain and Body.  The autism was a hinderance but allowed me to innately remain connected metaphysically all the way to the Alpha/Omega Point of all existence.  That is a feat that only those within the 0.009% of the Worldwide Population between both Earth halves combined.  And even Fewer than that who can access the Core and Matrix of the Alpha/Omega Point and tolerate it mentally and emotionally, myself included in that.  Not enough Meditation and Connections will get most individuals and creatures beyond even the Core and Matrix of This Universe.  That is something you may meditate on and connect with the local Akashic Records to learn about for yourselves, or you may ask a genuine psychic.\n</p><p>Aside from that, I am a multifaceted bisexual transwoman (She/Her are my Pronouns) with many talents, including hand-drawn art, writer (story and dialogue), gamer, a bit of a good cook, and most anything learnable. I am the original creator and chronicler of the media featuring the Sonichus Rosechus as well as the city of Cwcville, Virginia, United States of America. My mentality is high-functioning autistic with a psychic connection with everything in the universe, timeline and beyond.\n</p><p>My (super) powers and abilities are numerous, even moreso metaphysically. These include the various Psychic Powers and abilities, including telekinesis, teleportation and telepathy (a lot of which my Body's Brain and Energy Field are still catching up on), elemental powers and bending. My Body and Brain have attuned the ability to heal others with focused intentions and kind energy.\n</p><p>I can transform into my Sonichu Form with Electricity being the more dominant elemental bending power within and my Psychic Powers and abilities. And I can physically run at mach speeds.\n</p><p>And I can transform into my CPU Goddess Blue Heart Form, wherein, granted by the former Goddess Blue Heart, Scarlet LeRose, I have powers over computer technology and I preside as the Goddess of the Commodore Consoles and Computers, as opposed to Neptune of Planeptune being CPU Purple Heart of the Sega consoles and games.\n</p><p>I am also physically strong and able with a Warrior Will and Inner Strength granted by my former self in my past immortal life as Jesus Christ of Nazareth. Everything of the Bible, Prophecies, various Scriptures worldwide, and so on are all memorized in my unconsciousness.\n</p><p>Among my deeds, I seek to complete the Dimension Merge, as long prophesized, to restore magic in recombining the Earth Halves and uniting the \"Fictional\" and Original Characters/Individuals/Creatures with their respective chroniclers, physically and tangibly alongside everyone as co-existing individuals that we always have been, and keeping the balance and order while confiding the chaos and maintaining that no one from alternate timelines, other dimensions and universes that are not meant to be here remain in their respective origins (Especially those that are overall evil and toxic).\n</p><p>In part of that, as well as what I am doing, have done, and continue to do is to continue my physical immortal life confirming the details and events for and with my consciousness with everything known and foreknown in my unconsciousness.  The same rules apply as when I was Jesus of Nazareth where I do not consciously know the Specific When (Time and Date), unless I am absolutely meant to or when the event is closest to happening.  And I go to where I am meant to be, physically, even when I do menial tasks like going shopping, walking at a mall, or even attending conventions and traveling elsewhere.  I am capable of taking a few perks for myself if it remains in the broader focused scope of this One Prime Timeline, 1C, that ALL other timelines literally branch from; the Central most one, if you will.  While also continuing on my own Light Powered and good paths and choices from better intuitions.  The years of being manipulated by online Trolls and Toxic ones having been duly noted, yet appreciated in my own mental and emotional development, especially in having tested those individuals' intentions and confirming their toxicity and demonically influenced levels.\n</p><p>For the most part, please treat me kindly like you would anyone else.  Being barred from anywhere is heavily discouraged.  Misjudging me without authentic context is also very much wrong.  And unless you want to be like Judas Iscariot or anyone who was in the audience booing me in Jerusalem when I carried that cross with that crown of thorns on my head, I ask that you please be aware in the moment when you are about to do something like that or similar, do Check yourself in that moment on rather it is genuinely Light Powered and Good or Badly Impulsive and Demonically Influenced.  Results of Prophecy, aside with results as they may be, because that moment has already well passed in this manifestation set with that almost two years where I was not around to be picked on like those toxic ones before the fact did.\n</p><p>Everything is manifesting as they are and shall, even that which comes on the appropriate timing as meant to be for this Timeline.  Have and Keep Faith.  The Angels, Archangels and good Gods and Goddesses are helping you all as well, Every one of you.  The Holy Bible and matching good scriptures and spiritual methods and practices worldwide are all good base points; we are meant to think outside of the box while keeping those in mind to remind us.  All religions are good.  The exceptions are those that worship Hell and Satan; that is not right.  Leave those demons and devils only for when they can be forgiven by us Gods and Goddesses.  Even the most Toxic ones are redeemable when they better understand and are open for that which is more beneficial and overall good for them.\n</p><p>But I digress, and that will do for starters on this website.\n</p><p>Be Safe and Well,\n</p><p>Mrs. Jesus Christ Chan Sonichu Prime.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n</p>\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"navbox\" style=\";\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"padding:2px;\">\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"nowraplinks collapsible autocollapse\" style=\"width:100%;background:transparent;color:inherit;;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<th class=\"navbox-title\" colspan=\"2\" style=\";background:#00FBFE;\"><div style=\"float:left; width:6em;text-align:left;\"> <span class=\"noprint plainlinksneverexpand\" style=\"white-space:nowrap; font-weight:normal; font-size:xx-small; ;background:#00FBFE;;border:none;;\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Template:CwclightBlog\" title=\"Template:CwclightBlog\"><span style=\";background:#00FBFE;;border:none;;\" title=\"View this template\">v</span></a> <span style=\"font-size:80%;\">•</span> <a class=\"new\" href=\"/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:CwclightBlog&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" title=\"Template talk:CwclightBlog (page does not exist)\"><span style=\"color:#002bb8;;background:#00FBFE;;border:none;;\" title=\"Discussion about this template\">d</span></a> <span style=\"font-size:80%;\">•</span> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"//sonichu.com/w/index.php?title=Template:CwclightBlog&amp;action=edit\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#002bb8;;background:#00FBFE;;border:none;;\" title=\"You can edit this template.
