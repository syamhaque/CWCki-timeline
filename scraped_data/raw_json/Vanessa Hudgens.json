I had fretted that you may have been wrongfully kicked out of your church, and I am soo sorry about that. And in my early days of protest against the <a href=\"/cwcki/Encyclopedia_Dramatica\" title=\"Encyclopedia Dramatica\">Encyclopedia Dramatica</a> webpage I was also trying to get rid of then and now for about two years, I wanted the trolls to leave me alone, and I sold you out, Joshua; I posted a one-paragraph description about you and how famous you were, being in the movies, knowing the famous celebreties and all on that page. While the original paragraph is currently removed from the page, they still mock me with this, and I quote, <i>An old classmate of Chris did some epic trolling. We don't actually know very much about Joshua, just a few key facts. Chris knew him from his old school (Joshua and Chris both had Special Ed together), recently met up with him again and was getting along fine. Apparently, Joshua was very popular with women and had met some famous celebrities. For some reason, Chris became extremely jealous and even tried to get ED to go after him. Note that Chris only values Joshua's friendship because he's popular with women, and that by being friends with him he might end up laid. Unfortunately for Chris, even other special education kids will fuck with him. The chick that Joshua was supposed to hook him up with was just Joshua trolling him with a picture of Vanessa Hudgens. CLICK HERE for Chris-chan unwittingly fapping to Joshua.</i> I am even more sorry about that, because I sold you out like that. If you can find it in your heart to forgive me, I would deeply appreciate it. I was runnin' and hidin' from you because of A) the guilt I felt from those past actions, B) I felt afraid of what you might to do me in response to that, and C) My father advised me against talking to you, due to the past accusation. I will confess the church fiasco to him tonight. And if you still want to put me in that movie, I will discuss the details of a meeting between you, me and Vanessa over the phone later. The trolls are watching my e-mails, so I am unable to divulge any specific details, as the trolls can and will find me there and haunt me; they are truly devious and malicous; they would even probably find a way around any security measures. Peace, and TTYL,Christian.\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>After this email, Joshua would begin to imitate Vanessa Hudgens over a series of conversations, using his own screen name for all except one.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:ChriswVanessa.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"240\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/3/38/ChriswVanessa.jpg/300px-ChriswVanessa.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/3/38/ChriswVanessa.jpg/450px-ChriswVanessa.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/3/38/ChriswVanessa.jpg/600px-ChriswVanessa.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:ChriswVanessa.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>THIS IS WHAT CHRIS ACTUALLY BELIEVED.</div></div></div>\n<h2><span id=\"Ivy.27s_Retelling\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ivy's_Retelling\">Ivy's Retelling</span></h2>\n<p>A lot of the information about the Vanessa comes from Chris's other lover at the time, <a href=\"/cwcki/Ivy\" title=\"Ivy\">Ivy</a>.

I didn't ask too many questions though, because I had to agree that Chris was a born star.\n<p>Chris didn't trust Joshua Martinez, whom had introduced the two.

He wanted to exploit Chris for money and would do this by going through Vanessa.\n<p>Josh claimed to have very strong ties to the FBI and threatened to hack into Chris’s ps3. Josh wanted to monitor Chris 24/7 as punishment for not meeting up with Vanessa not giving her the \"presents” she had requested. I was upset to learn about the times Chris had gone out with Joshua to TGI Fridays. During one date, Chris didn't have enough money for food because he spent his week’s allowance on the previous time they went out. Josh just ordered a meal for himself and ate it in front of him while Chris watched. Chris just got a slushie drink and asked for refills. The waitress did not like this.\nLater on, Chris discovered that he was being mocked by Clyde again. I suggested Chris perform a string of videos to prove to Clyde, once and for all, that Chris meant business. This included baring his fangs at the camera and giving the PSeye a good smack ‘round. Sadly, nothing worked with Clyde…\n</p><p>At TGI Fridays, Josh got Chris to pay for his meals. He kept telling Chris that they would go meet Vanessa.

He claims not to remember who <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Blanca\" title=\"Blanca\">Blanca</a> was, and admits that he would take a dildo up his ass for his <a href=\"/cwcki/Ivy\" title=\"Ivy\">true love</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chat_4\">Chat 4</span></h3>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Vanessa_AIM_Chat_4\" title=\"Vanessa AIM Chat 4\">Vanessa AIM Chat 4</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>Took place on 19 April 2009.

Chris and Vanessa continue to arrange their meeting, with Vanessa offering her ideas of what Chris should wear.

Joshua finally gets around to creating a separate screen name for Vanessa. Chris accepts that he might fuck two <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">gay guys</a> with Ivy if she asked.
