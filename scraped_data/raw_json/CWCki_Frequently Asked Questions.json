Is the whole thing a hoax?</dt>\n<dd><b>No.</b> The verified documentation on Chris and his entire life is far too complete and detailed for it to be a reverse-troll setup. There are news reports from his childhood confirming his autism (see <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_in_the_media\" title=\"Chris in the media\">Chris in the media</a>). There are <a href=\"/cwcki/The_Tale_Of_The_Crazy_Pacer\" title=\"The Tale Of The Crazy Pacer\">two</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/University_of_Virginia#UVA_student_on_Chris\" title=\"University of Virginia\">different</a> blogs about Chris's behavior that were published before Chris came to a wider attention on the Internet. <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a> has existed since <a href=\"/cwcki/2000\" title=\"2000\">2000</a>. Phone calls have been made to Chris's parents and his <a href=\"/cwcki/Rocky_Shoemaker_call\" title=\"Rocky Shoemaker call\">pastoral counselor</a>. When Chris was first <a href=\"/cwcki/28_October_2011\" title=\"28 October 2011\">arrested and convicted</a> of a felony, he acted as he does online <a href=\"/cwcki/This_is_how_the_Trial_went\" title=\"This is how the Trial went\">even in court</a>, and accidentally <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Destruction_Of_Chris%27s_House\" title=\"Destruction Of Chris's House\">set fire to</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/14_Branchland_Court\" title=\"14 Branchland Court\">his house</a> in real life as well. If you don't believe us, you can look up Chris's many <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_the_law\" title=\"Chris and the law\">court records</a>, both civil and criminal.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>Chris's arrest for <a href=\"/cwcki/Affair_with_Mother\" title=\"Affair with Mother\">incest</a> in August 2021 should put any speculation of his behavior being an act permanently to rest.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>How can you get off taunting an <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Autistic\" title=\"Autistic\">autistic</a> <s>guy</s> person?</dt>\n<dd>The CWCki itself is not involved in any trolling; it merely documents Chris's life in detail. Most modern Chris-observers, having seen the <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">extreme damage</a> that some trolls could wreak, hold a dim view of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Weening\" title=\"Weening\">contemporary trolling efforts</a>. The motivations of Chris's trolls over the years has varied, but few had any interest in tormenting him simply for having a mental problem.

While Chris was <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_manipulation\" title=\"Chris and manipulation\">manipulated</a> into making many of these videos, he ultimately decided to create and publish them.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>However, before you want to inflict harm upon Chris and claim that Chris gives you <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">autistics</a> 'a bad name', please read the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/A-Logging\" title=\"A-Logging\">A-Logging</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Weening\" title=\"Weening\">Weening</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Unholy_Quintet\" title=\"Unholy Quintet\">Unholy Quintet</a> articles.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Why don't you try helping him instead?</dt>\n<dd><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Vivitheg\" title=\"Vivitheg\">Many</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Jackie\" title=\"Jackie\">people</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">better</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Alec_Benson_Leary_calls\" title=\"Alec Benson Leary calls\">than</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Sarah_May\" title=\"Sarah May\">you</a> have tried over the years and they have all accomplished <a href=\"/cwcki/Virginia_Jeanine_Sanford\" title=\"Virginia Jeanine Sanford\">nothing</a>. See the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/White_knight\" title=\"White knight\">White knight</a> article for reasons for and against <i>trying</i> to save Chris. Regardless of how hard you try, he refuses to listen. Even his <a href=\"/cwcki/Anna_McLerran\" title=\"Anna McLerran\">actual friends</a> could not help him. From 2018 onward, he managed to alienate nearly all of his IRL friends, instead preferring interactions with <a href=\"/cwcki/Imaginary_friends\" title=\"Imaginary friends\">imaginary friends</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Enablers\" title=\"Enablers\">enablers</a>, and fans at <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Conventions\" title=\"Conventions\">conventions</a>. He will only listen if you tell him what he wants to hear.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Can I give suggestions on how next to troll Chris?</dt>\n<dd><b>All efforts to troll, seek out or otherwise contact Chris are <i>very strongly discouraged</i></b>. The effects of Chris's <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler\" title=\"Bob Chandler\">father</a>'s death, his <a href=\"/cwcki/Barbara_Chandler\" title=\"Barbara Chandler\">mother</a>'s ill-health and, most recently, the <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys</a>' deliberately manipulative trolling operations against him have left Chris's grasp on <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">reality</a> — and his well-being in general — tenuous at best, with various <a href=\"/cwcki/Enablers\" title=\"Enablers\">enablers</a> making it even worse. Relating to this is how he is <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Weening#The_Chris_of_today_is_nothing_like_his_former_self\" title=\"Weening\">now a very, <i>very</i> different person</a> from who he was when the trolling was at its peak, and only sees such attempts to provoke him as indirect support for his current worldview; so it's not even worth bothering with if you're going into it expecting to get amusing reactions along the lines of the past. Times have changed; so keeping all this in mind, you'll be far better off just sticking with <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCki\" title=\"CWCki\">casual observation</a> and helping to <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCki:Improvement\" title=\"CWCki:Improvement\">document and provide information</a> on developments and occurrences in Chris's life as they come.</dd></dl>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Psychology\">Psychology</span></h2>\n<dl><dt>Is he currently seeing a psychiatrist or therapist?</dt>\n<dd><b>Maybe.</b> Chris was legally required in <a href=\"/cwcki/2018\" title=\"2018\">2018</a>, among other things, to attend psychological therapy as an alternative to <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_the_law#2018\" title=\"Chris and the law\">conviction</a> after trespassing. Since 23 April 2019, he has fulfilled this obligation and no longer has any professional help. Chris dismisses the idea of seeking professional help, preferring to <a href=\"/cwcki/A_Moment_With_Dr_Wolf_Chris_Chan_and_Greater_Struggles\" title=\"A Moment With Dr Wolf Chris Chan and Greater Struggles\">administer it to himself using Lego</a>. See <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_mental_healthcare\" title=\"Chris and mental healthcare\">Chris and mental healthcare</a>.</dd>\n<dt>Is he really autistic?</dt>\n<dd><b>Yes.</b> Based on a cursory <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism_papers#Intake_Survey\" title=\"Autism papers\">psychiatric survey</a> from <a href=\"/cwcki/2004\" title=\"2004\">2004</a>, Chris was diagnosed with <i>autistic disorder</i> (DSM-IV 299.00) as a young child, and the same report backs up his claim. See <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">Autism</a>. However, his common qualifying phrase <i>high-functioning</i> means only that he is not <a href=\"/cwcki/Slow-in-the-minds\" title=\"Slow-in-the-minds\">mentally retarded</a>. The phrase is not formally part of the diagnosis, and many autism advocates discourage its use.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Does he have <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Asperger%27s_syndrome\" title=\"Asperger's syndrome\">Asperger's syndrome</a>?</dt>\n<dd><b>It depends</b> on what counts as <i>having</i> Asperger's. He has never been formally diagnosed with it, he has never claimed to have it, and in fact, he angrily rejects the label. Among institutions that still distinguish between autism and Asperger's, of which many do not, Asperger's syndrome is distinguished from severer varieties of autism by average intelligence and adequate language ability, matching Chris. Dr Asperger's work was in German, and not known to Anglophone psychiatrists until the early <a href=\"/cwcki/1990s\" title=\"1990s\">1990s</a>; Chris probably would have received this diagnosis instead if he had been born a few years later. Furthermore, the condition was removed from the modern <i>DSM-5</i> and replaced with the catch-all <i>Autism Spectrum Disorder</i>, making the distinction completely meaningless.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Is he <a href=\"/cwcki/Slow-in-the-minds\" title=\"Slow-in-the-minds\">retarded</a> or intellectually disabled?</dt>\n<dd><b><a href=\"/cwcki/File:Honor_Roll_I_dont_think_so.jpg\" title=\"File:Honor Roll I dont think so.jpg\">Maybe</a>.</b> A more proper word for Chris is <i>inept</i>. Even if Chris was to be considered intellectually disabled, it'll certainly be a mild or borderline intellectual disability. Despite there being a possibility, he still managed to graduate from <a href=\"/cwcki/Piedmont_Virginia_Community_College\" title=\"Piedmont Virginia Community College\">community college</a> and obtain a <a href=\"/cwcki/File:License.jpg\" title=\"File:License.jpg\">driver's license</a>. He can read, write, do basic household chores, and operate electronic equipment. While his <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_English\" title=\"Chris and English\">English</a> skills aren't perfect, he has very few issues with basic sentence structure. Chris does understand the consequences of his actions to an extent. He has a consistent (albeit warped and <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">self-serving</a>) ethical system and recognizes when what he is doing is not working (though he chooses to pin the blame on <a href=\"/cwcki/Greene_County_Conspiracy\" title=\"Greene County Conspiracy\">external</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">forces</a> or go about his way anyway). His foolishness is in that he has very little common sense, which may be attributed (along with the <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">obvious</a>) to excessive parental sheltering, and that after years of Internet manipulation, his ability to distinguish <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">reality</a> from fantasy has wasted away.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>What is Chris's IQ?</dt>\n<dd><b>That's inconclusive.</b> In <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_19\" title=\"Mailbag 19\">Mailbag 19</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_21\" title=\"Mailbag 21\">Mailbag 21</a>, he claimed to have taken an IQ test at a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chesterfield_County\" title=\"Chesterfield County\">Chesterfield County</a> institute, most likely as a teenager. He received an IQ of \"150\". In <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_22\" title=\"Mailbag 22\">Mailbag 22</a>, a commenter pointed out that he may have taken the Cattell IQ test (150 on the Cattell is 130 on the standard scale), unless he was outright lying, which is most likely. An IQ of 130 is above average, but not genius material. Many autistic people also excel at pattern thinking, which is a key area of many IQ tests. Also, IQ doesn't measure <a href=\"/cwcki/Honor_roll\" title=\"Honor roll\">what you've learned</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Kindness\" title=\"Kindness\">empathy</a>, social skills, or other areas that count towards real-world success. Psychologists do not even agree on whether it's an objective measure of intelligence, with a common quip being that it \"only measures how well you do on IQ tests.\" Even if Chris did have a high IQ, it hasn't done much for him in the real world.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Is Chris schizophrenic?</dt>\n<dd><b>Probably not.</b> While autism and schizophrenia share some symptoms, their development is nothing like each other. Autism is inborn and shows in early childhood, while schizophrenia usually appears well into adulthood. Schizophrenia's symptoms often deteriorate over time, while autism is normally constant throughout life (except for a few children who relapse into non-verbosity). <abbr title=\"Inability to distinguish reality from fantasy.\">Psychosis</abbr> and confused language are common to both, but take different forms: schizophrenics may hear voices or otherwise hallucinate and think disjointedly (hence the name), while autists understand others' normal language literally, missing the subtext that something fictional is not meant to be taken seriously, and presuming their own thoughts automatically clear to others.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>Furthermore, Chris does distinguish between fantasy and reality, simply deluding himself into believing that the fantasy world is real on another <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Dimension\" title=\"Dimension\">dimension</a>. Also, Chris's visions of that dimension come from <a href=\"/cwcki/Meditation\" title=\"Meditation\">meditation</a> (read: daydreaming), not involuntary hallucinations.</dd></dl>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sex\">Sex</span></h2>\n<dl><dt>Is Chris an <abbr title=\"Involuntary celibate\">incel</abbr>? If not, what's the deal with the love quest?</dt>\n<dd>Chris never used the word for himself, but his beliefs and actions overlapped significantly with what is now the incel community. The word <i>incel</i> only entered common use about <a href=\"/cwcki/2017\" title=\"2017\">2017</a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup> Chris described himself long before this as a <a href=\"/cwcki/Virgin_with_rage\" title=\"Virgin with rage\">virgin with rage</a>, even bringing up the term in casual conversations with people he just met. He would speak of <a href=\"/cwcki/Boyfriend-free_girl\" title=\"Boyfriend-free girl\">boyfriend-free girls</a>, the <a href=\"/cwcki/Infinitely-High_Boyfriend-Factor\" title=\"Infinitely-High Boyfriend-Factor\">Infinitely-High Boyfriend-Factor</a>, and even a conspiracy that <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Virginia_is_for_virgins\" title=\"Virginia is for virgins\">true love was illegal in his home state</a>.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>He viewed his search for a suitable mate as the <a href=\"/cwcki/Love_Quest\" title=\"Love Quest\">Love Quest</a>, treating his search for a girlfriend like a video game. He wrote <a href=\"/cwcki/Saddest_Heart_in_the_World\" title=\"Saddest Heart in the World\">poems</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/I_Want_a_Girlfriend_for_Christmas\" title=\"I Want a Girlfriend for Christmas\">letters to Santa</a>, and even <a href=\"/cwcki/So_Need_a_Cute_Girl\" title=\"So Need a Cute Girl\">\"Weird Al\"-style parody songs</a> about his biggest problem: that other <a href=\"/cwcki/JERKS\" title=\"JERKS\">JERKS</a> (men) take all the pretty <a href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart\" title=\"Sweetheart\">sweethearts</a>. He has lost his virginity to a <a href=\"/cwcki/Mia_Hamm\" title=\"Mia Hamm\">prostitute</a> and his only relationship that lead to sex was <a href=\"/cwcki/Affair_with_Mother\" title=\"Affair with Mother\">with his elderly mother</a>, not something you would consider a proper love life. His Love Quest only temporarly ended when he destroyed his libido through <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_health#Hormone_treatment\" title=\"Chris and health\">self-administered estrogen</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Polyamorous_marriage\" title=\"Polyamorous marriage\"><i>married</i></a> his <a href=\"/cwcki/OC\" title=\"OC\">OCs</a> by early 2018, but it seemed to resume in early 2021, the consequences of which we can see <a href=\"/cwcki/Jail_Saga\" title=\"Jail Saga\">ever</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Post-jail_sightings_(2023)#CVS\" title=\"Post-jail sightings (2023)\">since</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Post-jail_sightings_(2023)#Isabella's_Italian_Trattoria_Restaurant\" title=\"Post-jail sightings (2023)\">then</a>. As of early 2025, he appears to be dating <a href=\"/cwcki/Flutter\" title=\"Flutter\">a mysterious Finnish woman</a>.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Why didn't he hire a prostitute earlier?</dt>\n<dd>For the majority of his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Love_quest\" title=\"Love quest\">love quest</a>, Chris refused to hire a hooker. The reasons varied: prostitutes are not <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/TRUE_and_HONEST\" title=\"TRUE and HONEST\">TRUE and HONEST</a> love, they are <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_money\" title=\"Chris and money\">expensive</a>, and Chris is afraid of STDs<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup>. His ideal sex partner would also do all the work around <a href=\"/cwcki/14_Branchland_Court\" title=\"14 Branchland Court\">the house</a>, give him her income to spend on video games, and otherwise serve as his replacement <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Barb\" title=\"Barb\">mother</a>—all of which a prostitute would be unwilling to do. When some prostitutes were sent to his house in early <a href=\"/cwcki/2009\" title=\"2009\">2009</a>, he cried.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup> However, as his thirties approached, he got more lenient about his policy towards hookers. He once tried to solicit the services of a prostitute by phone, and tried to get a discount by offering the chance of deflowering him and telling his life story; the prostitute hung up on him.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup> In <a href=\"/cwcki/April_2012\" title=\"April 2012\">April 2012</a> though, Chris claimed on <a href=\"/cwcki/Facebook\" title=\"Facebook\">Facebook</a> that he lost his virginity to <a href=\"/cwcki/Mia_Hamm\" title=\"Mia Hamm\">a hooker</a> who complimented him on the size of his penis.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup></dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>What is Chris's sexual orientation?</dt>\n<dd>This is a hotly debated point, and as of yet there is no consensus on this. For most of his adult life, Chris acted as though he was attracted to women. On the other hand, he clearly believes that previously-straight people can be turned gay, either by accident or through being tricked. In <a href=\"/cwcki/2018\" title=\"2018\">2018</a>, while under the <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys</a>' manipulative influence, Chris was <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Brainwashed\" title=\"Brainwashed\">brainwashed</a> into believing he was <a href=\"/cwcki/Bisexual\" title=\"Bisexual\">bisexual</a>, and was <a href=\"/cwcki/Polyamorous_marriage\" title=\"Polyamorous marriage\">married to several of his (mostly male) fictional characters</a>, retaining these beliefs long after the Idea Guys were ousted, yet has made no attempts to get into a relationship with a real-life man. <a href=\"/cwcki/Jacob_Sockness\" title=\"Jacob Sockness\">Jacob Sockness</a> attempted to groom Chris into a relationship but Chris ultimately distanced himself from Sockness. Some consider that Chris is too immature to have earnest sexual attraction towards others (see <i>Is Chris asexual?</i>, below.)</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Is he a <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furry_fandom\" title=\"wikipedia:Furry fandom\">furry</a>?</dt>\n<dd><b>Yes.</b> Chris had tweeted in <a href=\"/cwcki/2018\" title=\"2018\">2018</a>  that he is one. Traditionally he would state that he did not consider himself to be one,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]</a></sup> yet it was clear from an early period that he did enjoy <a href=\"/cwcki/File:Chris-chan_Traced.JPG\" title=\"File:Chris-chan Traced.JPG\">porn</a> of anthropomorphic characters, even <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Rule_34\" title=\"Rule 34\">drawing his own</a> into <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_8\" title=\"Sonichu 8\">his</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Giant_Penis_Comic\" title=\"Giant Penis Comic\">comics</a>. He also identifies with <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris-Chan_Sonichu\" title=\"Chris-Chan Sonichu\">several</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(character)\" title=\"Sonichu (character)\">anthropomorphic</a> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Robbie\" title=\"Robbie\">avatars</a>. Although he does not regularly wear fur-suits, he did once dress up as <a href=\"/cwcki/ECV_00002\" title=\"ECV 00002\">Chris-Chan Sonichu</a>, the anthropomorphic form he takes on his comic series, and has considered getting one in the recent years. He has also started following several furry artists and content creators on <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Youtube\" title=\"Youtube\">Youtube</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Twitter\" title=\"Twitter\">Twitter</a>, such as AshCoyote, and has enjoyed a lot of furry fanart he has recieved from his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/True_and_Loyal_fanbase\" title=\"True and Loyal fanbase\">True and Loyal fanbase</a>.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Is he a <a href=\"/cwcki/Pedofork\" title=\"Pedofork\">pedophile</a>?</dt>\n<dd><b>No</b>, but people imply otherwise to troll him. One of the few kind things <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Mimms\" title=\"Mimms\">Mimms</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Lucas\" title=\"Lucas\">Lucas</a> said about Chris in a <a href=\"/cwcki/Mimms_and_Lucas_Q%26A\" title=\"Mimms and Lucas Q&amp;A\">troll Q&amp;A thread</a> was that he probably wasn't a pedophile and that people are trying too hard with that. He <i>has</i> stated he would like to <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_3#In_which_Chris_advises_Hitler_to_keep_his_Promises\" title=\"Mailbag 3\">lower his state's legal age of consent to sixteen</a> and created a sexualized 14 year old Sonichu character in the form of <a href=\"/cwcki/Zapina\" title=\"Zapina\">Zapina</a>, but these actions are more likely due to a childish mindset and an inability to move past <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/High_school\" title=\"High school\">high school</a> than latent pedophilia.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Is Chris transgender?</dt>\n<dd><b>Yes.</b> As of 2015, Chris identifies as <a href=\"/cwcki/Transgender\" title=\"Transgender\">transgender</a>. He had explored his gender identity for years beforehand stemming from gender dysphoria issues, in 2011 identifying as a \"tomgirl\" (identifying as male and crossdressing as a woman); in 2014, identifying as <a href=\"/cwcki/August_2014_Facebook_Posts#Chris_comes_out...kinda\" title=\"August 2014 Facebook Posts\">Intersex of Female Soul with Male Body, and a Tranny Cross-Dresser</a> and as a lesbian; and identifying as female and transgender in 2015 when he began referring to himself as a \"trans woman\" and \"Christine\" and legally changed his name and gender in <a href=\"/cwcki/2016\" title=\"2016\">2016</a>. Well before <a href=\"/cwcki/2011\" title=\"2011\">2011</a>, when Chris first called himself a tomgirl, he had been known to wear miniskirts, <a href=\"/cwcki/Muscle_bra\" title=\"Muscle bra\">bras</a>, and panties. On multiple occasions, he had worn female clothing <a href=\"/cwcki/Forgot_the_Glitter\" title=\"Forgot the Glitter\">in public</a> and had started wearing trans flag thigh-highs and bands more frequently during the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Second_Coming\" title=\"Second Coming\">Second Coming</a>.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Is Chris asexual?</dt>\n<dd>This is another hotly contested issue to which there is no clear answer.  Some claim that Chris is not truly interested in sexual relations, but feels that sex is something which a \"grown up\" is required to do. Chris's desire to lose his <a href=\"/cwcki/Virgin_with_rage\" title=\"Virgin with rage\">virgin with rage</a> status may have simply been an urge to undergo what he saw as a traditional rite of passage into adulthood, although he has continued to seek out a sexual relationship even long after losing his virginity. It is clear that Chris's sex drive was atypical even before beginning hormone replacement therapy in <a href=\"/cwcki/2016\" title=\"2016\">2016</a>, evidenced by the fact that he did not discover <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Masturbation\" title=\"Masturbation\">masturbation</a> until he was sixteen and even as an adult only engaged in the activity twice a week. On the other hand, much of Chris's adult life has been spent in the pursuit of a sex partner and his comic characters are <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_8\" title=\"Sonichu 8\">highly sexual</a>. It is worth noting that a moderately common autistic symptom is difficulty or inability to be intimate with another person. Many asexuals also possess a libido and can enjoy masturbation or sex; the difference lies in a lack of real attraction to other people.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Did Chris really rape his mother?</dt>\n<dd><b>It's impossible to know for certain.</b>  Chris's detractors (and he has many) will vocally insist that he did, but there is no conclusive proof.  Chris was only ever charged with incest, not rape, and there has been no definite confirmation of Barb having any mental incapacity.  While there is plenty of <a href=\"/cwcki/Affair_with_Mother#Was_it_consensual?\" title=\"Affair with Mother\">compelling circumstantial evidence</a> for both sides, ultimately only Chris and Barb can say for certain.  Barb has never spoken publicly about it, and Chris is currently <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Lies\" title=\"Lies\">denying the incest itself ever took place</a>.</dd></dl>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Money_and_Work\">Money and Work</span></h2>\n<dl><dt>Why does Chris call his disability check a \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Monthly_tugboat\" title=\"Monthly tugboat\">monthly tugboat</a>\"?</dt>\n<dd>The \"tugboat\" is one of Chris's <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC-isms\" title=\"CWC-isms\">CWC-isms</a>; impenetrable mangled figures of speech that he either uses to avoid uncomfortable subjects or, in this case, because he thinks they are clever. \"Tugboat\" is derived from the phrase \"Our ship has come in\", referring to a fortuitous event. Whereas winning the lottery is like a large cruise ship coming in, for Chris, getting $1,000 a month for sitting on his ass is like a small boat—like a <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tugboat\" title=\"wikipedia:Tugboat\">tugboat</a>—coming in for him.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Has he ever had a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Job\" title=\"Job\">job</a> at all?</dt>\n<dd>He worked for <a href=\"/cwcki/Wendy%27s\" title=\"Wendy's\">Wendy's</a> a few months in 2001, but he was fired for unknown reasons. He briefly sold knives for the multi-level marketing company <a href=\"/cwcki/Cutco\" title=\"Cutco\">Cutco</a>, which was his last true job (if you could call it that). During the <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_business\" title=\"Chris and business\">Business Saga</a> he was very active on Etsy, selling many custom-made Amiibos, Sonichu comics and so on, but he often sold them either at a loss or barely broke even, which resulted in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Financhu_Crisis\" title=\"Financhu Crisis\">Financhu Crisis</a>. He has also made plenty of <a href=\"/cwcki/Commissions\" title=\"Commissions\">commissions</a> during the <a href=\"/cwcki/Everfree_Northwest\" title=\"Everfree Northwest\">Everfree Northwest</a> fundraiser and this has continued even after jail, with him making his custom medallions, selling literal rocks and making even more shitty commissions for the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/OfficialCWCMart\" title=\"OfficialCWCMart\">OfficialCWCMart</a>. Some even speculate it's akin to being a sweatshop worker, but Chris enjoys doing it anyway, probably not even knowing it might be a real job.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>How much money does Chris make from his livestreams/Etsy shop?</dt>\n<dd>From watching his recent livestreams we can see that Chris typically receives between $600 - $700 in donations per stream. <a href=\"/cwcki/Praetor\" title=\"Praetor\">Praetor</a>'s <a href=\"/cwcki/OfficialCWCmart\" title=\"OfficialCWCmart\">Etsy store</a> sales have totaled well into the thousands of dollars, with individual <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Praetor_Jail_Art\" title=\"Praetor Jail Art\">jail art</a> pieces selling for between $100 - $200 each, and some have even calculated their Etsy store to earn several thousands of bucks a month, though the exact revenue is unknown. It is generally speculated that Praetor takes a significant cut for themselves, though the exact details of their arrangement are not public knowledge. The only available info is from Chris, who claimed to get a measly $600 from a total of $4000 in sales during the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Taser_Call\" title=\"Taser Call\">Taser Call</a>.</dd></dl>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sonichu\"><i>Sonichu</i></span></h2>\n<dl><dt>What's the deal with <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonic\" title=\"Sonic\">Sonic</a>, anyway?</dt>\n<dd>Chris has always liked family-friendly games in particular, and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/1993\" title=\"1993\">many years ago,</a> was one of 100 winners of a <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_Watch_%26_Win_Sweepstakes\" title=\"Sonic the Hedgehog Watch &amp; Win Sweepstakes\">Sega contest</a> which, through its grand prize of a $1000 <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KB_Toys\" title=\"wikipedia:KB Toys\">Kay-Bee Toys</a> shopping spree, allowed him to stock up on various <i>Sonic</i> titles. For some reason, the <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i> series in general also appears to have certain qualities that attract autistic fans more than other game series.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Where can I find the uncensored images from <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_8\" title=\"Sonichu 8\"><i>Sonichu</i> #8</a>?</dt>\n<dd>For those who may be curious, they are located <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_8#The_uncensored_scenes\" title=\"Sonichu 8\">here</a>.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Will he ever draw more <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\"><i>Sonichu</i> comics</a>?</dt>\n<dd>Chris stopped drawing regular comics in <a href=\"/cwcki/February_2010\" title=\"February 2010\">February 2010</a> with <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_10\" title=\"Sonichu 10\"><i>Sonichu</i> #10</a>; since then, he has released issues #11 to #13 and partially completed issues #14 to #17; however, these later issues often only bear a slight resemblance to the traditional comics and are more about whatever trolling issues have been happening. While in jail, he produced some one-off drawings; see <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Praetor_Jail_Art\" title=\"Praetor Jail Art\">Praetor Jail Art</a>, but has since continued work on the issue #25, now renamed to <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_0_HD\" title=\"Sonichu 0 HD\"><i>Sonichu</i> #0 HD</a>. Judging from the contents of the message Chris has sent out to the winners of his <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_Art_Contest\" title=\"CWC Art Contest\">CWC Art Contest</a>, he has also attempted to outsource the art for the comics to his unlucky fans.

Many were CWCki editors themselves. This is especially true for the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Classic_Chris\" title=\"Classic Chris\">Classic Chris</a> era.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>For various good reasons, the CWCki largely covers the Classic sagas from Chris's perspective: information presented here was what Chris acknowledges to be true. Trolls are merely players on the stage that is Chris's life. It is probably best to understand the world of Chris as he understands it, much as it is best to understand a fictional world from the point of view of its characters, rather than the underlying reality of it. In other words, while Chris's reactions to events are real and the documentation of the reactions are indeed real, the situations and characters that provoke these reactions are often contrived, especially when covering events prior to Bob's death.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>For example:</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd><ul><li><a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">Clyde Cash</a> was the fictitious persona of a single anonymous troll, but the CWCki treats him as if he <i>were</i> a real person because he was to Chris. We also treat each of his personas as separate people because they were to Chris.</li></ul></dd></dl>\n<dl><dd><ul><li>We keep a single article on <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Blanca\" title=\"Blanca\">Blanca</a> and not the multiple male trolls who played her.</li></ul></dd></dl>\n<dl><dd><ul><li><a href=\"/cwcki/Emily\" title=\"Emily\">Emily</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Kim\" title=\"Kim\">Kim</a> were played by the same woman, but the CWCki treats them as separate people because they were to Chris.</li></ul></dd></dl>\n<dl><dd><ul><li>Celebrity trolls are obviously trolls impersonating celebrities – did you really think <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Billy_Mays\" title=\"Billy Mays\">Billy Mays</a> was involved in trolling?</li></ul></dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>For transparency's sake, the CWCki discloses such discrepancies from reality using Protip boxes, troll disclosures, and other notices.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>Coverage of Modern Christory takes a more matter-of-fact approach, thanks to the ease of <a href=\"/cwcki/Dox\" title=\"Dox\">doxing</a> Internet trolls. Modern CWCki editors are also gradually transitioning classic articles away from the dramatized writing of yesterday, so those who prefer clarity are in luck.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>What's the deal with <i>Chris and</i>? What is a saga?</dt>\n<dd>The CWCki has <b>a few series that tie it all together</b>. You can think of them as the skeleton, bloodstream, and nervous system of the site.\n<ul><li>The <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and\" title=\"Chris and\">Chris and</a> series. This series is purely topical – it discusses subjects as they relate to Chris, regardless of the time period. These are the things that make Chris Chris. Such topics range from Chris's relationship with <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_art\" title=\"Chris and art\">art</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Video_games\" title=\"Video games\">gaming</a>, to his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Health\" title=\"Health\">physical</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Coping\" title=\"Coping\">mental health</a>.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"/cwcki/Saga\" title=\"Saga\">Saga</a> page. It describes the major events in Chris's life from the womb to the modern world, but still takes a topical approach, looking at arcs and happenings in Chris's existence.</li>\n<li>The <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/CWChronology\" title=\"CWChronology\">CWChronology</a>: purely chronological as its name suggests. Here, you can learn Chris's entire story from start to now, even including events from before his conception.</li></ul></dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>What happened to the tagline <i>Where no shit is too minor</i>?</dt>\n<dd>The tagline was <b>retired</b> on 20 December 2019, <b>because there was a significant increase in people trying to influence Chris</b>. Many of them fall into one of the <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Unholy_Quintet\" title=\"Unholy Quintet\">Unholy Quintet</a></i>:\n<ul><li><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/White_Knights\" title=\"White Knights\">White Knights</a> – people who feel sorry for Chris, and try to help Chris, often without realising that getting Chris to halt his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_Ego\" title=\"Chris and his Ego\">self-destructive lifestyle</a> is going to take a lot more than <a href=\"/cwcki/April_2017_Facebook_posts#Chris_explains_why_he_won't_get_a_job\" title=\"April 2017 Facebook posts\">a message</a> on social media, or a <a href=\"/cwcki/Patreon\" title=\"Patreon\">Patreon</a> donation.</li>\n<li><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/A-Logging\" title=\"A-Logging\">A-logs</a> – people who express disproportionate hatred for Chris, often wishing <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Destruction_Of_Chris%27s_House\" title=\"Destruction Of Chris's House\">misery</a> or physical harm on him.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Enablers\" title=\"Enablers\">Enablers</a> – people who encourage Chris's negative habits. Some White Knights find themselves having to do this to get in touch with Chris. Some weens have also found themselves doing this to purposefully screw him up.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Weens\" title=\"Weens\">Weens</a> – people who try and fail to annoy Chris.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Carpetbaggers\" title=\"Carpetbaggers\">Carpetbaggers</a> - people who exploit Chris's infamy for personal gain.</li></ul></dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Why does the CWCki continue to refer to Chris by his old name and pronouns?</dt>\n<dd>\n<ul><li>The simplest reason for this is <b>consistency</b>. The CWCki has thousands of articles, and it would be an impossible, arduous task to change every \"he\" to \"she\" throughout Chris's entire existence, plus it's effectively <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Retcon\" title=\"Retcon\">historical revisionism</a>.</li>\n<li>Some articles require the context of Chris's maleness. References to Chris's orientation and past hatred of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Gay\" title=\"Gay\">gay</a> men won't be as obvious if we didn't address Chris by his assigned gender. Same thing with atypical/feminine behavior (such as his high voice and use of \"Gal-Pals\"), and behavior considered creepy for guys but not so much for women (such as getting <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Megan\" title=\"Megan\">touchy-feely</a>).</li>\n<li>Using \"he\" pre-transition and \"she\" post-transition may seem like a fair compromise, but the exact beginning of Chris's transition is hard to define. It can be confusing on articles that cover Chris both before and after his transition, such as the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and\" title=\"Chris and\">Chris and</a> series. Dissenting users have also suggested using \"(s)he\" or \"they\", but Chris doesn't use they/them pronouns either, and \"(s)he\" looks clunky.</li>\n<li>Community consensus. YouTube and Twitter commentators overwhelmingly call Chris male, as do some <a href=\"/cwcki/Sachumo\" title=\"Sachumo\">documentarians</a>. While Chris did receive a legal name/gender change, there's considerable debate in the community as to whether he is a genuine trans woman. CWC communities, such as <a href=\"/cwcki/Kiwi_Farms\" title=\"Kiwi Farms\">Kiwi Farms</a>, have an unfortunate tendency to \"misgender\" trans people in general. <a href=\"/cwcki/Null\" title=\"Null\">Null</a> said he refers to Chris as \"he\" because he \"carries male genetics\" and insisted that he was a straight male most of his life. Most Christorians use \"he\" for Chris, and the CWCki reflects this trend.</li>\n<li>Relating to the above, his previous first names (<b>Chris</b>topher, <b>Chris</b>tian) and his current one (<b>Chris</b>tine) can all easily be shortened to just \"Chris\", \"Chris-Chan\" or \"CWC\", which is what he's mostly referred to as anyway regardless of pronouns.</li></ul></dd></dl>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Miscellaneous\">Miscellaneous</span></h2>\n<dl><dt>What does he smell like?</dt>\n<dd>As of 19 October 2019, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Joey_Vance\" title=\"Joey Vance\">cannabis</a>.
