This trait was likely inherited from his mother <a href=\"/cwcki/Barbara_Chandler\" title=\"Barbara Chandler\">Barb</a>, whose dishonesty <a href=\"/cwcki/Cole_Smithey_E-mails\" title=\"Cole Smithey E-mails\">was described</a> by <a href=\"/cwcki/Cole_Smithey\" title=\"Cole Smithey\">Cole Smithey</a> as \"pathological\".\n</p><p>In many cases, he will lie in a meager attempt to be \"clever\" or \"outwit\" the <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">trolls</a>. However, Chris is totally incapable of lying in a way that looks remotely convincing, so his lies have the opposite effect (e.g. <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_Update_26_January_2009\" title=\"CWC Update 26 January 2009\">going to Redmond</a>). In other cases, he will lie to deny accepting personal responsibility for his <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">actions</a> (e.g. drawing <a href=\"/cwcki/ShecameforCWC.JPG\" title=\"ShecameforCWC.JPG\">Rule 34</a> of <a href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Schroeder\" title=\"Megan Schroeder\">Megan Schroeder</a>).\n</p><p>The reason why Chris is capable of telling bald-faced lies while still claiming to be <a href=\"/cwcki/Honest_Content\" title=\"Honest Content\">true and honest</a> probably derives from failing to understand the concept of a \"white lie\": a lie told out of courtesy to avoid trouble and/or offending people. Because telling this kind of lie usually is socially acceptable and won't tarnish one's reputation, Chris, in his usual blindness to social rules, probably learned through his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Autistic\" title=\"Autistic\">brain</a> that it is okay to lie in order to save face because it is possible to do so while still remaining true and honest.\n</p><p>Complicating this further is the fact that Chris does not attempt to support his claims with any shred of evidence, and will contradict his lies with even more lies. The end result is that Chris is more or less a compulsive liar.\n</p><p>This list serves to document as many of Chris's blatant falsehoods as possible. While Chris is known to speak half-truths, exaggerate, etc., the fact that he is willing to outright tell blatant lies and untruths with no grounds, in reality, is disturbing and this list serves to document the latter.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Chris.27s_lies\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris's_lies\">Chris's lies</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Chris claims in his <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris%27s_resume\" title=\"Chris's resume\">resumé</a> that he was employed at <a href=\"/cwcki/Wendy%27s\" title=\"Wendy's\">Wendy's</a> from August to October <a href=\"/cwcki/2001\" title=\"2001\">2001</a>, but he admitted to <a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey\" title=\"Kacey\">Kacey</a>'s father that he had been fired prior to 11 September.</li>\n<li>Chris claims in his <a href=\"/cwcki/Pixelated_PS3\" title=\"Pixelated PS3\">PS3 contest video</a> that the reason he made his imitation <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PS3\" title=\"PS3\">PS3</a> out of <a href=\"/cwcki/Pixelblocks\" title=\"Pixelblocks\">Pixelblocks</a> and not wood is because wood is not a hard enough material. The real reason, of course, is that Chris has no woodworking skills whatsoever.</li>\n<li>Chris claimed that mowing the lawn was a demanding physical chore for him, despite using a riding lawnmower to do it (though, in Chris's defense, it's entirely possible that mowing a lawn even with the aid of a riding lawnmower could have been genuinely physically demanding for him <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_health\" title=\"Chris and health\">given what we know about his health</a>).</li>\n<li>In a <a href=\"/cwcki/Mumble\" title=\"Mumble\">Mumble</a> chat, he lied and said that <a href=\"/cwcki/Nudes\" title=\"Nudes\">nude</a> photos of him on <a href=\"/cwcki/Encyclopedia_Dramatica\" title=\"Encyclopedia Dramatica\">Encyclopedia Dramatica</a> were photoshopped, despite consenting to the photos.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup> Chris also lied to someone he believed to be <a href=\"/cwcki/Shigeru_Miyamoto\" title=\"Shigeru Miyamoto\">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> about the ED images being photoshopped.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-ReferenceA_2-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ReferenceA-2\">[2]</a></sup></li>\n<li>For two days, Chris claimed to have a new <a href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart\" title=\"Sweetheart\">sweetheart</a> named <a href=\"/cwcki/Chloe\" title=\"Chloe\">Chloe</a> after the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Blanca\" title=\"Blanca\">Blanca</a> breakup. The first mention was to his fans, of all people.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup> Yet, if he were already seeing Chloe, why was he sad about breaking up with Blanca? Chris claimed to have met Chloe IRL at <a href=\"/cwcki/GameStop\" title=\"GameStop\">GameStop</a>, where they struck up a conversation, yet Chris has constantly said he freezes even while practicing talking to women.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup> He even said that they had a date together at Taco Bell and shared his first kiss with her. The most damning evidence is Chris never mentioned Chloe again. Furthermore, as of <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_13\" title=\"Mailbag 13\">Mailbag #13</a>, he says that he has \"no recollection of a Chloe.\"</li>\n<li>Chris <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Captain%27s_Log,_Stardate_January_26th,_2009\" title=\"Captain's Log, Stardate January 26th, 2009\">lied</a> about taking a trip to Redmond because he had no financial support and to get a \"Peaceful Weekend Getaway from the Trolls of the internet.\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-ReferenceA_2-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ReferenceA-2\">[2]</a></sup></li>\n<li>Chris claims he jogs regularly for more than 20 seconds, <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu%27s_Edge\" title=\"Sonichu's Edge\">despite proving he is incapable of doing so.</a></li>\n<li>Chris <a href=\"/cwcki/Piedmont_Virginia_Community_College#Kicked_Out_of_College\" title=\"Piedmont Virginia Community College\">claimed</a> that he was kicked out of class because he told his professor that he was autistic, when the <a href=\"/cwcki/Jackie_Chat_5\" title=\"Jackie Chat 5\">real reason</a> was him making a homophobic (and racist) comment in front of everyone.</li>\n<li>Chris <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Captain%27s_Log,_Stardate_October_9th,_2008\" title=\"Captain's Log, Stardate October 9th, 2008\">claimed</a> that <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Blanca\" title=\"Blanca\">Blanca</a> received the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Medallion\" title=\"Medallion\">medallion</a> and sent it back so Chris could modify it, yet the medallion with the \"special marks\" was destroyed on YouTube. Furthermore, in a private chat with <a href=\"/cwcki/Robert_Simmons_V\" title=\"Robert Simmons V\">Robert Simmons V</a><sup><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Citation_needed\" title=\"Citation needed\"><span title=\"\">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, Chris admits that the medallion was procured and was hastily working on a new one to throw the trolls off guard.</li>\n<li>When a nefarious IRL <a href=\"/cwcki/Jerkop\" title=\"Jerkop\">Jerkop</a> confronted Chris on his <a href=\"/cwcki/Attraction_Sign\" title=\"Attraction Sign\">Attraction Sign</a>, Chris quickly hid the sign while the Jerkop left to get the <a href=\"/cwcki/Manajerks\" title=\"Manajerks\">Manajerk</a>. Then, Chris proceeded to lie and pretend he never brought the sign, resulting in him being banned from the store.</li>\n<li>Chris claimed that he was banned from <a href=\"/cwcki/The_GAMe_PLACe\" title=\"The GAMe PLACe\">The GAMe PLACe</a> forever for going behind the counter. In fact, as revealed by <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Mimms\" title=\"Mimms\">Mimms</a> on the PVCC forum, the ban for going behind the counter was temporary, and what got him banned forever was the fact that he got into a shouting match with a child and treated the <a href=\"/cwcki/Michael_Snyder\" title=\"Michael Snyder\">store's manager</a> rudely. Possibly, Chris was mistaken, as he can be <a href=\"/cwcki/Slow-in-the-minds\" title=\"Slow-in-the-minds\">slow in the mind</a> sometimes.</li>\n<li>In an e-mail,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup> Chris claimed Megan said she loved him, when in reality she said no such thing.</li>\n<li>He has made occasional claims<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]</a></sup> that he really doesn't hate <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">homos</a>, despite several instances of him showing otherwise.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-7\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">[7]</a></sup></li>\n<li>In an <a href=\"/cwcki/IRC_(20_January_2009)\" title=\"IRC (20 January 2009)\">IRC chat</a><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-8\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">[8]</a></sup> with <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">Clyde Cash</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/BILLY_MAYS\" title=\"BILLY MAYS\">BILLY MAYS</a>, Chris told Clyde, \"People who call others homo are themselves in dire question of their own sexual preferences.\" When Clyde pointed out that Chris had called Clyde a homo just minutes earlier in the same chat, Chris lied that he didn't. When Chris was shown the exact words he typed, he said it didn't count because he was retaliating against Clyde's remark.</li>\n<li>Impersonated <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/CChanSonichuCWC\" title=\"CChanSonichuCWC\">CChanSonichuCWC</a> and called <a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey\" title=\"Kacey\">Kacey</a>, telling her about his sexual fantasies (which involves <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Recycling\" title=\"Recycling\">recycling</a>).<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-9\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">[9]</a></sup></li>\n<li>Chris's challenges to CChanSonichuCWC began with a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Captain%27s_Log,_Stardate_July_29th,_2009\" title=\"Captain's Log, Stardate July 29th, 2009\">video</a> in <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_Spanish\" title=\"Chris and Spanish\">Spanish</a>, stating that if Liquid Chris could not respond in Spanish, that would prove he is the impostor. When that backfired horribly, Chris then issued the <a href=\"/cwcki/SingStar_Challenge\" title=\"SingStar Challenge\"><i>SingStar</i> Challenge</a> to determine who is the real Chris. When Chris lost the <i>SingStar</i> Challenge, he declared that the contest meant nothing.</li>\n<li>Chris made a fake page<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-10\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">[10]</a></sup> mimicking <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PS3\" title=\"PS3\">PlayStation</a>.com that showed him as the winner of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Chop_Chop_Master_Onion%27s_Rap_Showdown\" title=\"Chop Chop Master Onion's Rap Showdown\"><i>PaRappa</i> contest</a>.</li>\n<li>Trying to sound like a tough guy, Chris claimed in a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Captain%27s_Log,_Stardate_October_15th,_2009\" title=\"Captain's Log, Stardate October 15th, 2009\">15 October 2009</a> Captain's Log entry that he \"did not give a dang\" about the reappearance of <a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris\" title=\"Liquid Chris\">Liquid Chris</a>, which is obviously not true since Solid devoted the entire first half of the Captain's Log to discrediting Liquid. Solid also stated that it would be the last time he mentioned Liquid, so of course he mentioned him again in <a href=\"/cwcki/Brutal_Legend_Plus\" title=\"Brutal Legend Plus\">a video six days later</a>. In that video, Solid even used one of <a href=\"/cwcki/SingStar_Challenge_Round_1#CChanSonichuCWC.27s_Entry\" title=\"SingStar Challenge Round 1\">Liquid's <i>SingStar</i> Challenge songs</a> to mock the <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">trolls</a> (the song's original purpose is to mock Solid), proving that Liquid does indeed still agitate him.</li>\n<li>In <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_14\" title=\"Mailbag 14\">Mailbag #14</a>, Chris offered a revisionist account of his ejection from <a href=\"/cwcki/Grace_Baptist_Church\" title=\"Grace Baptist Church\">Grace Baptist Church</a>, claiming that he was banned from the congregation because his pastor \"found images of women in bikinis on my Facebook; he was offended.\" In fact, as Chris himself revealed in an e-mail to <a href=\"/cwcki/Lordsillynipples\" title=\"Lordsillynipples\">Lordsillynipples</a> in 2008, he was kicked out after his pastor discovered the catalog of Chris's sexually deviant behavior on <a href=\"/cwcki/Encyclopedia_Dramatica\" title=\"Encyclopedia Dramatica\">Encyclopedia Dramatica</a>, as well as the deranged YouTube rant from his <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler%27s_FUTURE_MESSAGE\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler's FUTURE MESSAGE\">25th birthday</a>.</li>\n<li>In <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_25\" title=\"Mailbag 25\">Mailbag #25</a>, Chris revealed that he told <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler\" title=\"Bob Chandler\">his father</a> that he had taken the videos of the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/14_Branchland_Ct.\" title=\"14 Branchland Ct.\">Chandler house</a> off the Internet. The videos are still available on YouTube.</li>\n<li>Chris began receiving e-mails in <a href=\"/cwcki/January_2010\" title=\"January 2010\">January 2010</a> pointing out to him that his drawings of the Raichu from which Rosechu spawned in <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_0\" title=\"Sonichu 0\"><i>Sonichu</i> #0</a> had a pointed tail instead of a blunted one, meaning the Raichu was male. What makes this incident unique is that Chris could have easily resolved the entire conflict. Since Chris is a longtime fan of the series, he could have easily thought \"Wait a sec, when did male and female Pokemon start using different sprites again?\", done a few quick searches online, and found that all Raichu were drawn with pointed tails prior to 2006. Eventually, after Chris uploaded an edited page and claimed that the tail had been blunt all along, he had this realization...after someone else showed him Bulbapedia.</li>\n<li>In early <a href=\"/cwcki/February_2010\" title=\"February 2010\">February 2010</a>, Chris added a note to the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia\" title=\"CWCipedia\">CWCipedia</a> page for <a href=\"/cwcki/Simonla_Rosechu\" title=\"Simonla Rosechu\">Simonla Rosechu</a> which claimed that she is a completely original character, and not a sloppy knockoff of <a href=\"/cwcki/Evan\" title=\"Evan\">Evan</a> George's <a href=\"/cwcki/Simonla_Rosechu\" title=\"Simonla Rosechu\">Simonchu</a>. This was, of course, an obvious lie, contradicted by Chris's own e-mails and other statements about Simonla's creation. Later, in a <a href=\"/cwcki/Alec_Benson_Leary_Phone_Call_4\" title=\"Alec Benson Leary Phone Call 4\">phone conversation</a> with Alec Benson Leary, Chris acted surprised that anyone would be unwilling to accept this \"retraction\" of the truth, suggesting that he doesn't even comprehend why people might not believe his lies.</li>\n<li>On Chris's <a href=\"/cwcki/Alec_Benson_Leary_Phone_Call_5\" title=\"Alec Benson Leary Phone Call 5\">fifth phone call with Alec</a>, Chris very quickly found his own logic being used against him. To extricate himself from having to admit he was wrong, Chris instead set the phone down and very unconvincingly pretended to be his own <a href=\"/cwcki/Barbara_Chandler\" title=\"Barbara Chandler\">mother</a>, carrying on a small \"conversation\" with Chris asking him to clean up some <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chandler_cats\" title=\"Chandler cats\">cat shit</a>. Chris then came back to the phone to tell Alec his mom needed him to take care of the cat and that he had to hang up.</li>\n<li>During the <a href=\"/cwcki/Alec_Benson_Leary_Phone_Call_8\" title=\"Alec Benson Leary Phone Call 8\">eighth conversation with Alec</a>, Chris claims Nintendo sent him a letter saying Chris had free reign to use Pikachu in his comic, but when Alec asked Chris to upload the letter, Chris said he \"misplaced\" it. Also, during the call, Chris confidently stated that he \"regularly\" plays every single one of the games he owns – this being a valid reason he could not sell them for money. Chris owns <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/List_of_Chris%27s_games\" title=\"List of Chris's games\">roughly 600</a> different video games, so unless Chris has figured out <a href=\"/cwcki/Time_Void\" title=\"Time Void\">a way to stop time</a>, it would be impossible for him to play all of those games regularly.</li>\n<li>Chris went to great lengths to tell the fans that he would never show gore and violence in his comics. However, he breaks this statement by killing Evan in a very gory fashion in <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_10\" title=\"Sonichu 10\"><i>Sonichu</i> #10</a>. He later insists in <a href=\"/cwcki/Jackie_Chat_1\" title=\"Jackie Chat 1\">his first chat with Jackie</a> that it was justified because Alec \"gored it up first.\" Episode #17, which was written long before <i>Asperchu</i> even began, ended with Rosechu stripping naked, <i>clawing a man's head open</i>, <i>electrocuting him</i>, and <i>leaving him in a puddle of his own blood</i>.</li>\n<li>When the trolls started to demand more comics, Chris stated that he was never sure whether he wanted to make money with <i>Sonichu</i>; if that were true, he would never have tried to make a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_Adventure\" title=\"Sonichu Adventure\">video game</a> about <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a></i>, nor try to sell it to businesspeople.</li>\n<li>Chris has repeatedly referred to <a href=\"/cwcki/The_Wallflower\" title=\"The Wallflower\">The Wallflower</a> as his \"girlfriend\", despite making a video <a href=\"/cwcki/%22Damian_Antaria%22,_PLEASE,_Don%27t_Leave_Me_-_I_NEED_YOU!!!\" title=\"&quot;Damian Antaria&quot;, PLEASE, Don't Leave Me - I NEED YOU!!!\">pleading for her to be with him</a>, and, in fact, complaining about her essentially putting him in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Friend_zone\" title=\"Friend zone\">friend zone</a>.</li>\n<li>Chris promised to <a href=\"/cwcki/03212010_C-Ya_Later.MOV\" title=\"03212010 C-Ya Later.MOV\">\"remove [him]self from the Internet\"</a>, only to return in less than 48 hours <a href=\"/cwcki/Cleveland_Show_Voice_Rant\" title=\"Cleveland Show Voice Rant\">to rant about the Cleveland Show</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Michael_Snyder_is_ColdHearted_and_Mean\" title=\"Michael Snyder is ColdHearted and Mean\">While trying to get himself back into The GAMe PLACe</a>, Chris told Michael Snyder that he's become a better person. This is after all the things he's done since <a href=\"/cwcki/2008#April\" title=\"2008\">April 2008</a>. He ends this meeting by calling Michael a Jew, despite stating he had nothing against Jews not five minutes earlier.</li>\n<li>Chris's <a href=\"/cwcki/Damien_Antaria_(CWCipedia_page)\" title=\"Damien Antaria (CWCipedia page)\">CWCipedia article about The Wallflower</a> contains some of the biggest flights of fancy, blatant lies, exaggerations, half-truths, and flat-out delusions seen yet from Chris outside of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Father_Call\" title=\"Father Call\">Father Call</a>. Specifically, he claimed that he and The Wallflower had shared a kiss; since this would have been Chris's \"real\" first kiss (aside from \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Chloe\" title=\"Chloe\">Chloe</a>\", a lie), it was considered important by obsessive CWCki editors to see if he remembers it later (the Wallflower CWCipedia page article was written on April the 19th). Naturally, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jackie_e-mails_Part_2\" title=\"Jackie e-mails Part 2\">leaked e-mails from Jackie</a> show that by the 10th of April, <i>nine days before making this highly suspicious claim</i>, Chris had either a.) <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jackie_e-mails_Part_2#Jackie.27s_Questionaire_1\" title=\"Jackie e-mails Part 2\">momentarily forgotten that he had been kissed</a> – a monumental occasion in his life; b,) lied on his CWCipedia about being kissed; or c.) lied to Jackie about being kissed. In the end, a lie is still a lie, although it's <i>possible</i> he's basing his story on a gross exaggeration of the truth (the two sharing a drinking straw is the current troll favorite for this).</li>\n<li>In <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_49\" title=\"Mailbag 49\">Mailbag #49</a>, when asked about his opinion on a possible repeal of the \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy that would allow open homosexuals to serve in the U.S. military, Chris said that he thought the policy should only be repealed so that \"the <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">homos</a> can go die in explosions.\" When called out on this in <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_51\" title=\"Mailbag 51\">several</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_53\" title=\"Mailbag 53\">later</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_54\" title=\"Mailbag 54\">Mailbags</a>, Chris forgoes apology to either deny the claim ever took place or claimed that he had retracted it. Later, he would alter an e-mail in <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_51\" title=\"Mailbag 51\">Mailbag #51</a> which contained the quoted remark to make it appear as though Chris was being pro-gay in the original e-mail. Up until the death of the CWCipedia in May 2010, the original, homophobic reply in <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_49\" title=\"Mailbag 49\">Mailbag #49</a> remained unchanged and unretracted.</li>\n<li>In the <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_and_Tito_PS3_E-mails\" title=\"Clyde and Tito PS3 E-mails\">e-mails</a> with Clyde Cash and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Surfshack_Tito\" title=\"Surfshack Tito\">Surfshack Tito</a> about Chris's PS3, Chris swore that he would not reveal the name of his <a href=\"/cwcki/Jackie\" title=\"Jackie\">new girlfriend</a>. He broke this promise in <a href=\"/cwcki/To_Jackie,_with_Love.MOV\" title=\"To Jackie, with Love.MOV\">a video</a> not two weeks later.</li>\n<li>Also in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_and_Tito_PS3_E-mails\" title=\"Clyde and Tito PS3 E-mails\">Clyde and Tito PS3 E-mails</a>, Chris said he would not buy another PS3.

Aside from his well-known issues with <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">Homos</a>, his comic states that if he had the power, he'd constantly <a href=\"/cwcki/Magi-Chan\" title=\"Magi-Chan\">be on the lookout for homosexual activity</a>, and punish them to suit.</li>\n<li>In <a href=\"/cwcki/You%27re_Always_Pretty\" title=\"You're Always Pretty\">You're Always Pretty</a>, Chris told his mother he was taking pictures of her when he was really recording a video of her.</li>\n<li>When Chris informed his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Mother\" title=\"Mother\">mother</a> that he <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PS3#Destruction\" title=\"PS3\">destroyed his PS3</a>, he told her that the machine was already malfunctioning before he smashed it to bits. In reality, the PS3 was still operational when Chris decided to put it out of use.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-15\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">[15]</a></sup></li>\n<li>When he held the <a href=\"/cwcki/Alex%27s_Lemonade_Stand\" title=\"Alex's Lemonade Stand\">lemonade stand</a>, he claimed that his father died of cancer, when in fact, he died of complications from heart failure. However, this could just be Chris assuming <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bob\" title=\"Bob\">Bob</a> died of cancer because he had it (at least at one point), and not taking time to look into his actual cause of death.</li>\n<li>Chris told <a href=\"/cwcki/Jackie\" title=\"Jackie\">Jackie</a> in an email that he has grown tolerant of the <a href=\"/cwcki/HEXBox\" title=\"HEXBox\">Xbox 360</a> and respects those who own one, but recently in 2013, Chris went back on his word by defacing a display for the Xbox One at his local <a href=\"/cwcki/Mal-Wart\" title=\"Mal-Wart\">Walmart</a>, thus proving that his bizarre hatred for the HEX-BOX is still strong.</li>\n<li>Despite Chris' obvious morbid <a href=\"/cwcki/Obesity\" title=\"Obesity\">obesity</a>, he has always lied about his weight, being evasive and giving numbers that are more consistent with <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">his own delusional self-image than reality</a>.  As early as <a href=\"/cwcki/February_2010\" title=\"February 2010\">February 2010</a>, Chris admitted that he had at one point weighed more than 220 pounds. On Facebook on 4 January 2014, he claimed that he <a href=\"/cwcki/Obesity#Actual_weight\" title=\"Obesity\">weighed only 202 pounds</a>, despite his obvious sagging, triple chin visible in his profile picture. Users of the CWCki forums generally speculated that, based on the photographic evidence, he was probably underestimating his own weight by at least 60 pounds (~27 kilograms).</li>\n<li>When Catherine said no to a relationship with Chris, Chris told her that <a href=\"/cwcki/Catherine_E-mails#It_IS_Your_Fault.21\" title=\"Catherine E-mails\">he was entitled to a relationship</a>. In a <a href=\"/cwcki/Catherine_E-mails#Re:_Well.2C_that.27s_nypical\" title=\"Catherine E-mails\">later e-mail</a> <i>(presumably after being called on his bullshit)</i>, he claimed he said no such thing. On that note, he also publicly referred to her as his \"girlfriend\" for months, despite Catie saying to him point-blank that their outings were not dates.</li>\n<li>Chris has stated that he has D-cup breasts. Kiwi Farms users have determined that they are actually A-cups.</li>\n<li>Chris did a promotion where if someone sent him a PS4 for his birthday, they would get a $500 coupon for his custom-made Sonichu Amiibos. Obviously, nobody sent him a PS4, but that didn't stop him from saying someone did. He claims someone named Kagney Lynn bought him the PS4, but upon closer examination of his Facebook page shows that the details of the order are linked to Fingerhut, the company he bought the PS4 from. This proves he bought the system himself.</li>\n<li>In <a href=\"/cwcki/Cwcville_Shopping_is_on_Vacation\" title=\"Cwcville Shopping is on Vacation\">Cwcville Shopping is on Vacation</a>, Chris lied about his Etsy shop being on vacation when it had been forcibly closed by Etsy staff, due to repeated complaints that he was not delivering orders. He also lied about working to set up a Zazzle shop; he decided to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Beg\" title=\"Beg\">beg</a> for handouts over the next several months instead.</li>\n<li>Chris lied about seeing a doctor about the <a href=\"/cwcki/Self-inflicted_taint_wound\" title=\"Self-inflicted taint wound\">self-inflicted taint wound</a> and later about the photos of it being an elaborate troll.</li>\n<li>Chris continually lied about his \"creative groove\" being \"killed\" because <a href=\"/cwcki/Lulu\" title=\"Lulu\">Lulu</a> banned him. In reality, he had stopped work on the comic long before that happened, and he had even solved the publisher problem within a month, by sneaking back onto Lulu under an alternate name.</li>\n<li>Chris repeatedly lied about his reason for selling <a href=\"/cwcki/EBay\" title=\"EBay\">his father's stamp collection</a>, claiming he needed money for bills but immediately spending it all on toys<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-16\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">[16]</a></sup>.</li>\n<li>Chris claimed in <a href=\"/cwcki/I_Am_Sick_of_the_HATE!!!_(I_could_use_a_break)\" title=\"I Am Sick of the HATE!!! (I could use a break)\">I Am Sick of the HATE!!! (I could use a break)</a> that Bob was the one who revealed their address and phone number to the Internet despite it being Chris who did so and has done so on numerous occasions.</li>\n<li>During the Doopie saga, Chris said to Doopie that he was taking care of his parents. But his dad had already been dead for years, long before he had ever spoken to Doopie.</li>\n<li>Chris claimed you could tell that <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(character)\" title=\"Sonichu (character)\">Sonichu</a> was inhabiting his body by his change in <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">mannerisms</a>, however, he is acting exactly the same (to be fair, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_writing\" title=\"Chris and writing\">all his shitty recolors act like him</a>).</li>\n<li>Chris intentionally misled <a href=\"/cwcki/The_WCT\" title=\"The WCT\">The WCT</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Spunky\" title=\"Spunky\">Spunky</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Null\" title=\"Null\">Null</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Warhol/Chris_Chan\" title=\"Warhol/Chris Chan\">Don Lashomb</a>, and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bella\" title=\"Bella\">Bella</a> about the identity of his sexual partner in July 2021, telling them his new girlfriend was a woman over the age of 50 when in fact <a href=\"/cwcki/Affair_with_Mother\" title=\"Affair with Mother\">it was his own 79-year-old mother</a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-17\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">[17]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-18\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">[18]</a></sup> He even responded in the affirmative when asked by The WCT if his girlfriend and his mother had met (\"They have, yes, and Barbie is fully supportive\"). Chris would eventually brag about the truth (more or less) to Bella in the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Incest_call\" title=\"Incest call\">incest call</a>.</li>\n<li>After the incest incident where Chris was issued an <a href=\"/cwcki/Emergency_Protective_Order\" title=\"Emergency Protective Order\">Emergency Protective Order</a> against him, Null confronted Chris about a transfer of $750 from Barb's account to his. Chris feigned ignorance of this until Null produced a screenshot of the transaction.</li>\n<li>In <a href=\"/cwcki/Jail_Letter_-_1_June_2022\" title=\"Jail Letter - 1 June 2022\">Jail Letter - 1 June 2022</a>, Chris claimed that \"No sex was had between Barbara and I,\" - directly contradicting his own words during the <a href=\"/cwcki/Incest_Call\" title=\"Incest Call\">Incest Call</a> - and that he had \"foreknown about the Betrayal plans from <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bella\" title=\"Bella\">Bella</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Null\" title=\"Null\">Null</a>, as well as <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sockness\" title=\"Sockness\">Sockness</a> long before even <a href=\"/cwcki/June_2021\" title=\"June 2021\">June, 2021</a>.\" He had also tried to claim that Bella had confessed to \"faking\" much of what he said in the call, not providing details as to when she confessed to this, or the circumstances to which she confessed in.</li>\n<li>In <a href=\"/cwcki/Jail_Letter_-_27_June_2022\" title=\"Jail Letter - 27 June 2022\">Jail Letter - 27 June 2022</a>, Chris claims that he was not attracted to Bella and that they were \"Just Friends\". Despite this, he claimed in a chat with the Watchmen that he considered her a potential sweetheart.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-19\"><a href=\"#cite_note-19\">[19]</a></sup></li>\n<li>The <a href=\"/cwcki/October_2023\" title=\"October 2023\">October 2023</a> video titled <a href=\"/cwcki/Setting_the_Record_straight_-_there_never_was_any_sex_involving_me_in_2021\" title=\"Setting the Record straight - there never was any sex involving me in 2021\">Setting the Record straight - there never was any sex involving me in 2021</a> is ironically packed with lies. Chris falsely claims the court found him innocent of his incest charge (the charge had been dismissed following Chris's lawyer's filing for an <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism_disorder_deferred_disposition\" title=\"Autism disorder deferred disposition\">autism deferred disposition</a>). Chris also claims he did not have sex in 2021, insisting he did not have sex with Barb, contradicting DMs he had sent to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bella\" title=\"Bella\">Bella</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Null\" title=\"Null\">Null</a>, and <a href=\"/cwcki/The_WCT\" title=\"The WCT\">The WCT</a>, as well as his admissions to Null, <a href=\"/cwcki/Dillin_Thomas\" title=\"Dillin Thomas\">Dillin Thomas</a>, and The WCT immediately following the incest leak that he had sex with his mother. Chris also spreads unproven rumors about Bella in his anger towards her.</li>\n<li>In the <a href=\"/cwcki/Keffals_videos#The_Chris_Chan_Interview\" title=\"Keffals videos\">interview with Keffals on January 16th, 2024</a>, Chris once again lies about the circumstances of his crimes and his arrest, calling Bella a sexually perverted deviant who persistently approached him with ideas of 'sexual deviations' and claiming awareness of her plans, saying she 'failed the test' when she took recordings of the assorted conversations she had with Chris and spliced them together to create the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Incest_call\" title=\"Incest call\">incest call</a>. This conflicts with several private messages and admissions he has made to several parties including Bella herself, and the information presented within the incest call which shows that Chris initiated conversation on that topic. Further, he appears to double down on his claim that he did not have sex with Barb, now saying that their time together ahead of Chris' arrest involved him talking with her about her family history, 'revitalising her brain cells and everything'. He also continues to spread more unproven rumors regarding Bella's intentions.</li>\n<li>In a tweet from 22 January 2024, Chris claimed that the older girlfriend he had described to <a href=\"/cwcki/Null\" title=\"Null\">Null</a> in <a href=\"/cwcki/July_2021\" title=\"July 2021\">July 2021</a> was \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Fiona\" title=\"Fiona\">Fiona</a>, at least in wishful thinking at the time.\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-20\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">[20]</a></sup> This lie contradicts statements he had made to Null that his older girlfriend was over 50 (which was true of <a href=\"/cwcki/Barbara_Chandler\" title=\"Barbara Chandler\">Barbara Chandler</a> but not of the then-19 year old Fiona).<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-21\"><a href=\"#cite_note-21\">[21]</a></sup></li>\n<li>Among various things in <a href=\"/cwcki/BABSCon#2024\" title=\"BABSCon\">Chris's response to BABScon</a> in <a href=\"/cwcki/March_2024\" title=\"March 2024\">March 2024</a>, notifying him that he's been <a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_places_that_have_banned_Chris\" title=\"List of places that have banned Chris\">banned</a> from attending the convention permanently, he claims \"(he had) committed no crimes\" and attributes his negative reputation to false rumours spread by <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">Trolls</a>. It bears repeating that Chris had gotten a <i>third</i> major felony on his record by then, not to mention Chris was the one to <a href=\"/cwcki/Honest_Content\" title=\"Honest Content\">put out unsavory information about himself in the first place</a>.</li>\n<li>In a call with a ween on 17 May 2025, Chris lies repeatedly. Chris lies saying he did not go to <a href=\"/cwcki/Finland\" title=\"Finland\">Finland</a> or the <a href=\"/cwcki/Sightings_(2024)#Dallas_Fort_Worth\" title=\"Sightings (2024)\">Dallas Airport</a> and that it was <a href=\"/cwcki/JenkinsJinkies\" title=\"JenkinsJinkies\">someone else</a>. Chris then falsely claims he was not using <a href=\"/cwcki/Duolingo\" title=\"Duolingo\">Duolingo</a> and went on to spew a bunch of falsehoods about <a href=\"/cwcki/Flutter\" title=\"Flutter\">Flutter</a> throughout the rest of the call. Chris briefly lies about not living in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Big_Island\" title=\"Big Island\">Big Island</a>, but immediately caves and admits to living there. Towards the end of the call he again lies about his affair with his mother.
