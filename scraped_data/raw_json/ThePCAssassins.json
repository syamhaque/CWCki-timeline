One individual associated with PCAssassins (Craig) states he was an engineering student, and reportedly had phone calls up to 2 hours long with Bob discussing university, engineering and general topics. The account also hosted several prank calls.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Call_Bobby_Chandler\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Call_Bobby_Chandler\" title=\"Call Bobby Chandler\">Call Bobby Chandler</a></span></h3>\n<h3><span id=\"Bob.27s_got_Cancer\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Bob's_got_Cancer\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Bob%27s_got_Cancer\" title=\"Bob's got Cancer\">Bob's got Cancer</a></span></h3>\n<p>Bob's got Cancer is a 2-minute video of two trolls named Craig and Amfermee calling Bob. The video was recorded and originally uploaded around the <a href=\"/cwcki/March_2011\" title=\"March 2011\">24th of March 2011</a>. It's unclear why the video shows an upload date of 2013, it may have been privated or otherwise edited in some way to alter the original upload date. Comment's on the video appear to indicate that when it was originally posted, the information that Bob had cancer was not yet known. It is also worth pointing out that the comments indicate Bob was still alive when they were posted, including multiple comments between ThePCAssassin's and <a href=\"/cwcki/Thorg\" title=\"Thorg\">Thorgnzorg</a> which is unusual as the upload date listed (<a href=\"/cwcki/2013\" title=\"2013\">2013</a>) is 2 years after Bob had died. The video is viewable on the WayBack Machine.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup>\n</p><p>In the video the two <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">trolls</a> contact Bob and strike up conversation with him, one of them has called before and remarks that he is an engineering student, much like Bob was, this is the same person as in <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Call_6\" title=\"Bob Call 6\">Bob Call 6</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler%27s_call_with_The_P_Capsaicins\" title=\"Bob Chandler's call with The P Capsaicins\">Bob Call 4</a>. Bob's revelation that he has cancer is not significantly acknowledged, and Bob complains that <a href=\"/cwcki/Weens\" title=\"Weens\">trolls</a> or <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jerkops\" title=\"Jerkops\">jerkops</a> have shipped him \"400 pounds worth of magazines.\" Bob quickly ends the call, as he understandably can't be bothered humoring two trolls after receiving a cancer diagnosis.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Catch_A_Wild_Snorlax_Plus_Update_on_Bob\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Catch_A_Wild_Snorlax_Plus_Update_on_Bob\" title=\"Catch A Wild Snorlax Plus Update on Bob\">Catch A Wild Snorlax Plus Update on Bob</a></span></h3>\n<h3><span id=\"Bob_Chandler.27s_call_with_The_P_Capsaicins_.2F_Bob_Call_4\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Bob_Chandler's_call_with_The_P_Capsaicins_/_Bob_Call_4\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler%27s_call_with_The_P_Capsaicins\" title=\"Bob Chandler's call with The P Capsaicins\">Bob Chandler's call with The P Capsaicins / Bob Call 4</a></span></h3>\n<p>This is one of the videos deleted from the actual PCAssassins YouTube account, and exists now only as an archive on the YouTube account of \"Albert Clukley\". Originally posted in May 2011 under the title \"Bob Call 4\" it now exists as an archive with an incorrectly spelled title. (Amusingly, capsaicin is the scientific term for the extract used in <a href=\"/cwcki/26_December_2014\" title=\"26 December 2014\">pepper spray</a>. ) It's a 15-minute recording of another conversation between Craig and Bob Chandler.\n</p><p>This chat occurred on 30 <a href=\"/cwcki/April_2011\" title=\"April 2011\">April 2011</a>, and while it has been privated, it is still accessible on the Wayback Machine.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup> Bob amicably chats about his past jobs, and certain aspects about Chris and how he grew up, like how Chris taught himself how to read by watching television with closed-captioning turned on, and his skills in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Video_games\" title=\"Video games\">video games</a>. One notable part about this call is that Bob claims Chris never made it on the honor roll.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Get_in_touch_with_Bobby_C\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Get_in_touch_with_Bobby_C\" title=\"Get in touch with Bobby C\">Get in touch with Bobby C</a></span></h3>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Bob_Call_6\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Call_6\" title=\"Bob Call 6\">Bob Call 6</a></span></h3>\n<p>Bob Call 6 (technically \"ThePCassassins - Bob Call 6 - What'll happen to Chris???????\") is a 20-minute video of a conversation between Craig and Bob. In it, Bob discusses a lot of topics, notably claiming that Chris <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_English\" title=\"Chris and English\">learned to read and write</a> through reading the closed captioning on his <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_television\" title=\"Chris and television\">television set</a>.  He also claims that Chris is being <a href=\"/cwcki/Kick_the_Autistic\" title=\"Kick the Autistic\">discriminated against by employers</a> for being <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">autistic</a>, and calls <a href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Schroeder\" title=\"Megan Schroeder\">Megan Schroeder</a> a \"<a href=\"/cwcki/ShecameforCWC.JPG\" title=\"ShecameforCWC.JPG\">little low life in the gutter bitch</a>.\" The full call is viewable on the WayBack Machine.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Individuals_associated\">Individuals associated</span></h2>\n<p>There are 3 individuals directly associated with ThePCAssassins.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Craig\">Craig</span></h3>\n<p>Craig is the most notable member of ThePCAssassins, he leads the conversation in <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob%27s_got_Cancer\" title=\"Bob's got Cancer\">Bob's got Cancer</a> and is the one who called Bob in <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Call_6\" title=\"Bob Call 6\">Bob Call 6</a> as well as <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler%27s_call_with_The_P_Capsaicins\" title=\"Bob Chandler's call with The P Capsaicins\"> Bob Call 4</a>. He is enthusiastic when speaking to Bob and is apparently an engineering student, in Bob Call 6 he states he was \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Affair_with_Mother\" title=\"Affair with Mother\">following in Bob's footsteps</a>\" (with regards to his engineering degree).\n</p><p>Craig is most likely the person who is managing ThePCAssassins YouTube account, as a majority of the comments are written in a first-person perspective from Craig's point of view.\n</p><p>Craig called bob on at least 3 other confirmed occasions, at one point he reports having a \"2 hour\" conversation with Bob about engineering studies. This video is currently lost. Portions of <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Call_6\" title=\"Bob Call 6\">Bob Call 6</a> may be part of this extended call, as Rufus mentions in the introduction that the recording was much longer than the final cut.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Amfermee_Sanchez\">Amfermee Sanchez</span></h3>\n<p>Amfermee is the second caller in Bob's got Cancer, and is not present in Bob Call 6 or any further calls.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Rufus\">Rufus</span></h3>\n<p>Rufus is a narrator who dubbed the intro to Bob Call 6. Interestingly, Rufus is not present during the actual phone call between Bob and Craig. Rufus is also not present during the recording of Bob's got Cancer. His only role in the series (until more videos are unearthed) is to introduce Bob Call 6, and explain the contents of the video, as well as some of the content that they had to cut out.\n</p><p>Rufus actually called Bob himself on at least one occasion where he posed as a police officer and claimed that Chris was <a href=\"/cwcki/Carlos_Chantor\" title=\"Carlos Chantor\">soliciting sex</a> outside the <a href=\"/cwcki/The_GAMe_PLACe\" title=\"The GAMe PLACe\">Game and Hobby Place</a>.
