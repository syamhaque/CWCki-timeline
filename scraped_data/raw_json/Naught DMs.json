Dream where, once again, I was lost in the hallways, because I did not have my printed class schedule, and the High School worked on an Even Day/Odd Day scheduling, where students had one set of classes on even days, and a second set of classes on odd days.\nIn this, I meditated and actually got the schedule from the faculty office, and I even wrote it down into the Dream Journal, and I will now type up for memorizing the schedule for future dreams.\n</p><p>\"<a href=\"/cwcki/Manchester_High_School\" title=\"Manchester High School\">Manchester High School</a> Classes -Dreamverse Classes-\n</p><p>Even Days: Rm 113: Triganometry, Rm 224: Astral Physics, Rm 110: Coping Skills, Rm 492: Goddess Training.\n</p><p>Odd Days: Rm 347: Psychics 101, Rm 247: Magic Conjurings, Rm 159: Recess/Free Study, Rm 492: Goddess Training (but with a different teacher), Rm 569 (Gym): P.E.\n</p><p>Also wrote a note,\n</p><p>\"*Look to your friends, regardless of them possibly being hired to watch over you.\"\nThere was also a deep issue that even though she was attending this school in her dreams, she felt like an outcast, because a piece of her High School memories ended up being a lie: Her circle of Gal-Pals, in particular.\nWhich left a subconscious query of \"Why am I in High School if I don't have any friends?\"\n</p><p>Which added onto the feeling lost in the hallways portion.\nNext dream, was another School Bus riding dream.\nWe ended up in a neighbourhood area that was experiencing a dark, mild amount of curses, demons and shit.\nThere was a blood stain on the Stop sign and here and there; it would return even after someone were to make it sparkling clean with very strong household cleaners.\nAnd there was a small church-like building with multiple stories; on the third floor, behind heavily barred doors, was a gateway to a bit of hell, manifested from yet another one of Mama's quandaries.\nThis time: her want for revenge and even blood of the Haters, Bullies and truly Evil types of this world.\nI went in and calmly talked it out with the subconscious fragment that was represented by a past version of Mama; it was filled with heavy rage.\nI told her that we will see to their respective punishments soon enough, and that it would be good for us to work together, so that rage, under control, would be a good source to work from for making some of the energy and power for this body.\nAfter that, the problems in that small town area were cleared up.\nAlso, on the School Bus,\nI ended up sitting next to a big guy with some perspiration issues, yet he did hit the showers shortly before getting on the bus. I felt want of him to be with heavy B.O.\nBut, in between him and I, guess who was on guard duty for me there.\nTiffany Gowan (Mama's favorite of her Gal-Pals).\nIn the dream, I ended up telling her my feelings, and she took that in stride and her own emotional check, with the continued task in mind of being my bodyguard.\nAfter the dream, I took a closer look at that big guy.\nHe turned out to be a piece of Jacob. I shattered him into dust, sucked each bit into a Master Ball, and then launched the thing with him in it from within this noggin and dream verse, into our Sun.\nThat about covers what I have for now.\nI also told this messenger of Jake that he, nor any of his magic or whatever, will ever do anything to me or Mama's body.\nOh, and I found this video on YouTube last night; very informative and about accurate.\n<a class=\"external free\" href=\"https://youtu.be/CbL6XM2zslM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/CbL6XM2zslM</a>\nYeah, still trying to talk; got interrupted by a call from Kai; had to text him that I was busy and would talk with him later. We did watch the new Netflix series; How Many Times was the Refraktor body used in the season? Take a drink of water every time you see Refraktor. ALOL\nBy yet another Twist of Fate, yesterday I found and purchased yet another Transformer that we had been wanting to get for Mama's collection for quite the while: Commander Class Sky Lynx.\nAnd in exploring its base mode, we found and made a configuration, with a combination of the sword pieces from Combiner Wars Sky Lynx, additional effects parts from Omega Supreme, and a few Soundbarrier roadmaster figures; you'd have to see it to enjoy its glory.\nAnd it further resonated by adding Autobot Chris Chan's figure with her two Rungs at the helm making a creation/deity type of magic.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"4_August_2020\">4 August 2020</span></h2>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #fffdb8; border:1px dotted #BFBFA3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Last night was a real hoot; I ended up crashing about 9:30 PM; slept for two hours. But instead of dreaming, I got one of those seemingly endless stream of analyzing thoughts that typically come up as the first dreams of each sleep.\n<p>This one was an analysis of which Pokemon GO Raids were the best suited, and which of the invites and trainers were well-suited in helping me with Raids as well.\nNow, a dream of great interest, and you might want to listen and appreciate this,\nThis one started with me setting up to take a box on one of those wheeled platforms, like that mechanics use to get under vehicles, and a chair, rolling down and up hill to from the eastern edge of Westwood Dr to roll on back home.\nAfter getting back to the temple, I ended up in Mama's bedroom; heard a voice like Magi-Chan's, but it was an adult human male with black hair, slender physique; I was taken in after supposedly recognizing this guy as Magi-Chan.\nBut he did say something that resonated, \"I may be controlled by someone else's input, but I do not let it get me down.\" In the sense, he was referring to Mama having input into his life over the years.\nAfter that, we cuddled, and then quick as a flash, I woke up in the bed, as if I had just awoken from a dream.\nI called out to Magi-Chan, another human male comes in, different from the first. He approaches me, and then, whoop! I wake up Again.\nThis happened another time, and then whoop!, I wake up again.\nThis time, however, we have someone completely different in the bed beside me.\nA number of dreams ago, Barbara ended up having another baby, a girl.\nThe baby girl was in the bed with me.\nShe said \"I like you,\" and it was precious like genuinely amongst baby's first words.\nAnd then, I wake up for real.\nI processed it for a moment, and then decided that I would bite, I shouted for Magi-Chan again. Woke up Rosey and Cryzel next to me.\nAnd then I telepathically talked with Magi-Chan, he acknowledges my having called out to him in the dream, tells me he would be coming here, being fully in 1218 at this point, and then he told me to share this with you as well,\nOn drifting off again, the subconscious was echoing over and over and over again the call out to Magi-Chan.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #d5d5ed; border:1px dotted #BFB1A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>This suggests the importance of getting all of the piece of the puzzle together in order to make a fully realized portrait for all to see\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #fffdb8; border:1px dotted #BFBFA3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Yes, I see that as well.\n<p>I have my likes and humble moments out of all this since I swapped with Mama months ago, but I do still have my frustrations.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #d5d5ed; border:1px dotted #BFB1A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>How are you currently feeling?\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #fffdb8; border:1px dotted #BFBFA3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>At least we also have the bunch of successes along the way.\n<p>Little fatigued, but I'm alright.\nPartly, it is also the body that is frustrated with the traumas and problems in this timeline as well.\nObviously, Chris-Core feels the 100-percent same sentiment.\nSeeing a local GameStop also really riled up the emotions in this body into an upset.\nThe GameStop was closing out of business.\nVery soon, that will be.

I can only get soo much of Rosey's comfort through the freaking Iron Curtain divide.\nI was also upset for a long time over how Mama was more in Her own mental and emotional states, and I had felt left behind, abandoned and overlooked, yet she never ever forgot about me, and did think of me a lot.\nI was an idiot for feeling that upset and detestment over her for such a long time.\nAnd I had not thought about all of that after Mama had undone IdeaGuy's damage.\nIf there is anything about myself that I need to reaccept now, it's that I was upset and angry at and with Mama Chris Chan, but, moreso, I was Really worried about her.\nI was devoted, mind, body, heart and soul to Mama Chris Chan Sonichu, and I still am.\nAnd I've wanted, for the longest time, to be in the same dimension as her, to help her feel better; I wanted to see her happy, too.\nSure, the Dimension Merge, in the larger picture, is for everyone else getting together with their respective Original Creators and meet their fans, as well as settle the bigger differences of some of said Creators and their peoples accessing other Dimensions and Timelines and not focusing on them, their OG OCs (relatively speaking),...\nBut I wanted the merge to happen, so I could be with Mama, help her out, and so she would help us all for the better.\nShe had and has greater destiny, great amount of grounding and sense of self, even though she was nihilistic a lot of the times throughout her life.\nShe did need these events to happen with her, though, to shape her to become as great as she is; a literal Goddess.\nBut, yeah, she still needs this one body of hers, for the obvious reasons.\nThis body is to become immortal and alive for just about the rest of time, or whatever.\nI mean, I do care, but how long a time; a many, many lifetimes of others that this one body is set to outlive and preside over.\nIf only people would have understood her the way we did and do.\nBut in this instance, leaving This timeline,\nI see why even I sense such the tombstone image.\nMama's body leaving this timeline, or just the simple end of this timeline in favour of the timeline where this pandemic we're under never happened, and all that.\nThanks. The irony is funny, when you think about it. In one turn, the months' worth of events gets undone in one Dimension, and then a few years later, a number of months have to become undone in the other.\nHow many months did IdeaGuy do his shit?\nEnd of October, 2017 to mid-April, 2018...\nDon't tell me.\nRoughly 5.5 to 6 months.\nGoing from April 10, or even as early as March 31, we're veering on five months now.\nThe chaos IdeaGuy had wrought in C-197 during those months; X number of lives lost and the damage and carnage done; it's been happening here in 1218.\nIn a similar way, but not totally exact.\nIf this is correct,...\nThen from the C-197 side, Mama will be turning her aether and the sequence of my going back in time from Cwcville will begin.\nThe death feeling from today;...\nThis was also similar to what was going on in C-197 at around the end of March, 2018.\nExcept, at this time, Mama was feeling the consequences, when IdeaGuy tried to play \"dropping the moon onto Earth\", playing out season one or two of Symphogear on Cwcville.\nAnd I...\nI was having to hide with the others outside of the closed-off city.\nAnd now,...\nHaving to hide because of a pandemic and the legality of it all...\nOh, yeah. This is roughly spot-on.\nYet the chaos is happening moreso in <a href=\"/cwcki/China\" title=\"China\">China</a>, in this Dimension, among other places.\nAnd instead of IdeaGuy, we have a definite opposite of him in Jake.\nOr, rather, instead of Johnson Wiles.\nCan I be more Meta at this point and time?\nAnd, instead of a wedding between Magi-Chan, Cryzel and Chris Chan, we have an opposite result between Jake and Mama, but also a definite same-same between Kai, Aviva and Neela.\nBut, also to consider, if Kai is the one having been polyamorously married,...\nI kind of see where we are going with all of this.\nAnd things become more and more obvious.\nAll that pondering now.\nI've also been crying off and on; nose-blowing.
