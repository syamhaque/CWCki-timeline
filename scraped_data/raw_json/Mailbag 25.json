It was answered on the 29th.\n</p><p>Chris explained that when he calls himself \"high-functioning,\" he really just means that he's high-functioning when compared to people who are <a href=\"/cwcki/Slow-in-the-minds\" title=\"Slow-in-the-minds\">severely mentally handicapped</a>. Chris also revealed that he spends two to three hours per day just playing with toys. (So much for \"high-functioning.\") Perhaps more shocking was Chris's solution to infidelity, which involves having sex with members of your significant other's family. (Unsurprisingly, he most likely got this idea from <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_%26_Peter%27s_Bogus_Journey\" title=\"wikipedia:Bill &amp; Peter's Bogus Journey\">an episode</a> of <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Family_Guy\" title=\"Family Guy\">Family Guy</a></i>.)

My husband and I are not close with our respectful families and I have no one to ask about bringing up a child, my friends don't have children yet. So I value your opinions on the following, to supplement my research:\n</p><p>1. Should I \"spoil\" my child? Is there anything wrong with getting them the things they want? It's not easy being a kid...\n</p><p>2. What should I feed my child? My husband and I run our own business, so we aren't home often. I'll require <a href=\"/cwcki/Abusive_babysitter\" title=\"Abusive babysitter\">a baby sitter</a>, so I don't want them burning up the kitchen\n</p><p>3. How much television should I allow my child to watch?\n</p><p>4. My husband and I don't make much money, we can barely support ourselves, so how can I save money on things the baby needs?\n</p><p>And well...this doesn't pertain to the baby's upbringing but...\n</p><p>5. Can I still have sex while I'm pregnant? What are possible consequences if I do?\n</p><p>6. Should I get a c-section or have a natural birth?\n</p><p>7.
