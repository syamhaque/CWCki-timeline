After this call, Kacey severed all connections from Chris <a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey#Marriage_to_Liquid\" title=\"Kacey\">and married Liquid Chris the following day</a>, resulting in the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_is_Sad\" title=\"CWC is Sad\">video</a> in which Solid tried not to cry over losing his <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">potential</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart\" title=\"Sweetheart\">sweetheart</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Summary\">Summary</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Chris wishes to apologize to Kacey for <a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey_and_Liquid_Call\" title=\"Kacey and Liquid Call\">the previous phone call</a>, claiming that he accidentally ignored her when <s>fighting with</s> talking to Liquid Chris, and blames it on his \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">tunnel vision</a>\". Kacey chastises him for this, and says he doesn't care, as he wouldn't have called her up if <a href=\"/cwcki/Kim_Wilson\" title=\"Kim Wilson\">Kim</a> hadn't told him to (as he was \"under shock\"). She makes him admit he was playing <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Vidya\" title=\"Vidya\">vidya</a> instead of calling her. She also chastises his poor diet and how despite claiming to have not eaten fast food for over a week, he still eats unhealthy items like frozen meals, and may have even lied about being able to cook.</li>\n<li>Kacey then points out to Chris that, after he <a href=\"/cwcki/11042009_51_50\" title=\"11042009 51 50\">struggled to lift lemonade boxes as weights</a> and claimed they were fifty pounds each, they were actually around eight pounds each. After Kacey tells Chris that he constantly makes excuses, he admits that she “would not want a boyfriend like that”.</li>\n<li>Kacey voices concern at Chris shooting her and <a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris\" title=\"Liquid Chris\">Liquid Chris</a>; Chris claims that he is more honest and loyal than Liquid Chris, which Kacey refutes, and goes over how Liquid is better in basically every way than Solid. Altogether, Kacey is very disappointed that Chris is continuing to badmouth her boyfriend in spite him ostensibly calling to apologize for his behavior.</li>\n<li>Chris claims that Liquid never went to <a href=\"/cwcki/Manchester_High_School\" title=\"Manchester High School\">Manchester High School</a>, but Kacey says that simply doesn't matter to her. The topic switches to Chris's education, after Kacey makes an off-hand remark about Chris probably not knowing what a GED is; Chris, missing the point of that statement, claims he does and says it's a type of degree (it's actually an academic test taken in place of a diploma). When Kacey asks Chris about his SAT score (he struggles to recall what it was, but says it was above 1100), she wonders why he went to a community college instead of a university. Chris explains it was because his parents couldn't afford to go to a university, but Kacey points out he could've signed up for FAFSA or student loans, and he could've used his <a href=\"/cwcki/Monthly_tugboat\" title=\"Monthly tugboat\">monthly tugboat</a> to pay for college. Chris says he was unable to sign up for financial aid due to \"stress\" with his parents, but Kacey says he still should've been able to do so later as it was his own responsibility.</li>\n<li>Kacey, now becoming extremely aggressive, claims that Chris, despite using it as a defense, doesn't actually know what <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress\" title=\"Stress\">stress</a> is. Chris mumbles in agreement. Kacey claims that Chris has to live on his own before he can have a relationship, telling him that he would not be able do survive on his own, and says he is unappealing to any girl. Chris admits that, given the choice, he would pick Liquid Chris over himself as the better candidate.</li>\n<li>Among many other faults, Kacey points out that Chris made fun of <a href=\"/cwcki/Twin_Falling_Towers\" title=\"Twin Falling Towers\">9/11</a>, and compared her grandmother's death in the towers to the death of his dog. Before hanging up, Kacey goes on a long rant about how Chris will not make it past 30, has wasted his life, constantly lies, and is unable to fend for himself, and predicts that after the call, Chris will immediately forget about Kacey, and go back to playing video games and making comics like nothing ever happened (and, <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_is_Sad\" title=\"CWC is Sad\">for the most part</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Red_Letter_CWC_Certified_Day\" title=\"Red Letter CWC Certified Day\">she was right</a>). Chris can only <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress_sigh\" title=\"Stress sigh\">sigh</a> in response.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Video\">Video</span></h2>\n<table style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa; background-color: #f9f9f9; color: black; margin: .5em auto .5em auto; padding: 0.2em; font-size:89%; width:260px;-moz-border-radius:10px\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFFF00\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size:110%; color:#008080;-moz-border-radius:10px\"><b>The End For Real</b><br/>\n</td></tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<td colspan=\"2\"><div class=\"thumb embedvideo autoResize\" style=\"width: 328px;\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo autoResize\" style=\"\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideowrap youtube\" style=\"width: 320px\"><div class=\"embedvideo-consent\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo-consent__overlay\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo-consent__message\">Click to load content</div><!--\n--></div><!--\n--></div><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" data-src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZCxzpjKDp3Y\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"180\" loading=\"lazy\" modestbranding=\"1\" width=\"320\"></iframe></div><!--\n--></div><!--\n--></div>\n</td></tr>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#696969\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;-moz-border-radius:5px;color:#ffffff;\"><b>Stardate</b>\n</td>\n<td>10 November 2009<br/>16 <a href=\"/cwcki/February_2011\" title=\"February 2011\">February 2011</a> (leaked to the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCki\" title=\"CWCki\">CWCki</a>)\n</td></tr>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#696969\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;-moz-border-radius:5px;color:#ffffff;\"><b>Featuring</b>\n</td>\n<td><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Solid_Chris\" title=\"Solid Chris\">Solid Chris</a>; <a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey\" title=\"Kacey\">Kacey</a>\n</td></tr>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#696969\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;-moz-border-radius:5px;color:#ffffff;\"><b>Saga</b>\n</td>\n<td><span style=\"display:none\">Liquid</span><a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris\" title=\"Liquid\"><img alt=\"Liquid\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"32\" src=\"/w/images/8/85/Liquid_saga.png\" width=\"32\"/></a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris\" title=\"Liquid Chris\">Liquid Chris</a>\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" style=\"background-color:#FFFF00; color:#008080; color:#008080;-moz-border-radius:10px; font-size:120%; padding:0.25em; text-align:center;\">Audio Recordings\n</td></tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%;\" valign=\"top\">\n<td><b>previous</b> <br/><a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey_and_Liquid_Call\" title=\"Kacey and Liquid Call\">Kacey and Liquid Call</a>\n</td>\n<td><b>next</b> <br/>N/A\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p><br/>\n</p><p><br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hello?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>in a very \"this is it\"-type of tone</i>] Hi, Chris, it's Kacey.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Oh, hey Kacey.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b> </font>I, I got <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Kim\" title=\"Kim\">Kim</a>'s e-mail, she said to call you?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah.

You know, it's like, uh, when, like, <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">you concentrate on one thing and you're pretty much set until its done</a>.

No one had to tell me. [<i>pause</i>] I did talk to Kim about it, though.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well I know you talked to Kim, she's the one who e-mailed me.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yep. But, anyway, Kacey, I do love you. I really do. I'm very sorry I ignored you.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> But, you haven't even tried to contact me until Kim told you to! I mean, how can you say you love me or care about me, and you were just going to, like, OK, I was so hurt, and I, I mean, what would you have done, I mean, if you didn't talk to me? I mean, I could have just gone off and done whatever, you would have been out of sight, out of mind. You couldn't even send a simple e-mail. I mean, it's like you didn't even care that I was hurt or crying or anything.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> No, I di-, I did care. I just, uh, I was under st-, I was under the shock, too.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> What shock? There was no shock!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> You know, realizing what a heel I was and how hurt you were...and that made me feel hurt. You know? 'Cause...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Then, why didn't you try to contact me? You would think you want to if you hurt someone you, um, supposedly love.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, you're right, I should have, yeah, I should have contacted you sooner. I just feel I, I thought-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You were too busy playing <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Video_games\" title=\"Video games\">video games</a> again, weren't you?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> No, I just thought, I just thought that you might need your spa-, you might need some space, you know?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Yeah, 'cause I'm hurting so you're just going to let me hurt all alone, or, or, or worse, in your opinion, you were gonna let me be with Chris, I mean, what did you think was gonna happen? I mean, you were playing video games today anyway, don't lie to me, I know you were.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> OK, I played some video games. I played some video games.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> See? Those are more important than me, too! How the heck are you supposed to have a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Girlfriend\" title=\"Girlfriend\">girlfriend</a> if you can't even talk to her unless her friend tells you to do it? You're just going to sit around and play video games all day, like, I could be hurt or sick or something, and you wouldn't know because your video games are more important.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> No, Kacey, you are more important. And if I- [Chris begins to speak, but Kacey interrupts]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> But you're not acting like it at all.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, maybe I'm not acting like uh, guh, m-maybe I'm not giving that impression right now. But Kacey- [Chris is interrupted]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Or ever.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> But Kacey, please believe me. You are very important. <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_English\" title=\"Chris and English\">Because you are kind, caring</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/China\" title=\"China\">woman</a>. And you mean a lot to me. And I would really be hurt if something happened to you. And I will defend you. I really would. [mumbles incoherently]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> But you never listen to me.

Most of those are like, 300% sodium. That's just as bad, if not worse, because sodium can be just as bad as fat. Why don't you freshly prepare some food?

Or was that a lie too?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> ...I can cook.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Then why don't you?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Because I, because I don't have the individual ingredients at the time.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [incredulous] Then go buy them.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> And I will.

I am going to do it. I am going to do it. [long, awkward pause] I have been working on making myself better. I have been going out jogging.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Yeah, like, for like, what? Five minutes? I run five miles, 2.5 at the... least.

[<i>breathes angrily</i>] I mean, I saw those <a href=\"/cwcki/11042009_51_50\" title=\"11042009 51 50\">videos when you were trying to lift lemonade.</a> Those weren't fifty pounds. I mean, that's not even a workout, anyway, that's not even balanced. Get some real weights.

I have made some excuses in the past.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You make a <i>lot</i> of excuses in the past. You make any excuse, you ever do, it's always \"<a href=\"/cwcki/THAT_IS_MY_HOUSE\" title=\"THAT IS MY HOUSE\">I'm working on it</a>,\" or \"I'm thinking about it,\" like, whenever you say stuff like that I know it's not going to get done. I mean, that's really bad, when...I already <i>know</i> you're not going to do anything by the words you say. You're just gonna continue to make excuses. You left me alone for several days after you heard how upset I was! The hell? You really think I want a boyfriend like that?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, you ta-, yeah, you would not want a boyfriend like that.

I do not even own a real gun.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Doesn't mean you couldn't get one, I could get a gun and I don't own one.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I do not, I have no intention on getting a real gun in the near future.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I mean, but it's so easy to get guns, do you remember the Virginia Tech shooter? It's easy. Doesn't matter, all you need to do is get mad again, then you'll just ignore me anyway.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I promise you that I would not ignore you in the future, even when I get, even when I get...riled up, and angry and [mumbling], I would not ignore you.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I don't know, you've ignored me enough, don't you think it might be a little too late? I mean, that comic really scared me, I mean, I'm pretty sure...you shot him in the comic so he couldn't follow and take me back. I mean, that's just <i>creepy</i>. That's psychotic. That's delusional.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. I, I agree with you, that...I may have some issues to resolve with Chris. Like, you know, I definitely should...like, you know, try...to sit in front of him...\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> ...and discuss things, calmly...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You think he's gonna do that after he saw that comic?!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I mean, obviously he definitely has other skeletons in his closet-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> This isn't about him; this isn't about him. This is about you. And I'm tired of you talking bad about him.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> OK, yeah. I don-, I don't like talking bad about people, but-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> But you do all the time!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Well, only...just, only, OK, well.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Tell me again why you think you're better than him. Go ahead.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Because I'm, because I'm loyal.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You're not very loyal; you haven't called me. You're not very honest; you lie to me all the time.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Because I tell you, I tell you everything I'm, from my heart. And [when] I tell you I love you, I mean it.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> That's lying. You can't even send me a simple email to make sure I'm OK. Like, I don't think you get how hurt and angry I am, so no, I want something that you're better at him at that is real, because your lies come from your heart too.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [Stuttering incoherently for a rebuttal] OK, I have made the mistake of lying at-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> A lot.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> A lot, a lot, but a, a lot of the things that I have told you, in the past, were true. I swear, I have told you a lot of truth like you know, like when I tell you about myself on the kind of person I am, those are true. And how I feel about you, that's true, too.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> How do I know that?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> And my hit-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> How do I know you're not just ready to drop me, because it's easier, or something stupid?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Because...we started out as friends, and I in-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> That's right, friends.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Well, hang on, hang on! We started out as friends with the possibility of a relationship, and I would like a relationship.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> How would we start off as friends with the possibility of a relationship? You lied to me <a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey_Call_1\" title=\"Kacey Call 1\">the first time you talked to me</a>.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> OK, I did the things-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You pretended to be my boyfriend, my fiance.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> OK, I did pretend to be Chris. But that was in the case, to let you know, that he was who you, he was not who you thought he was. You know, he was, he <i>was</i> pretending to be me.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> He wasn't pretending to be you! This is what I don't get. Stop saying he's pretending to be you. Just 'cause you guys have the same name doesn't mean he was pretending to be you, because you two are two totally different people.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> OK, yes, we are two totally different people, and I can list the whole number of things that I am and he's no-, that he's not that he claims.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Whatever, I can list the whole things he does that you can't. He can play guitar. He doesn't lie to me. He jogs with me. He does stuff with me. He doesn't sit around and play video games. He has a job. He has a college education. He goes to school. I mean, wh-, the hell? I mean, c'mon. Do it, do it. Sho-- Tell me. Tell me what's he's not doing and I bet you I can refute everything.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [stutters, then sighs]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> So you don't have anything, do you?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Well...OK, well, I can definitely tell you that he did not go to <a href=\"/cwcki/Manchester_High_School\" title=\"Manchester High School\">Manchester High School</a>.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> That doesn't matter to me.

You need your high school diploma to move on to college...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Not really, anyone can get their GED and blaze through it. What matters even more than high school education is like your SATs and your ACTs. College is what's important to me. Because that shows a future. I mean, I bet you don't even know what a GED is.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I do know what, I have a general idea of what a GED is. It's a sort of degree.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> No...It's...in place of a diploma. I mean, did you even take the SAT?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yes, I did take the SAT in high school.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> What was your scores?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I do not remember.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oh come on, you've got to remember. Nobody forgets their SAT scores.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> It, uh, with a small detail like that, and I felt it was small...it was in one ear and out the other.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK, was it, was it above 1100? Was it above 1200? Was it above...anything like that?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, mmm...ah, yeah, I think it, I think it was...over 1100. [<i>long pause</i>] But that's to the best of my recollection. I swear.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> So you had something over 1100, but you went to a <a href=\"/cwcki/Piedmont_Virginia_Community_College\" title=\"Piedmont Virginia Community College\">community college</a>. I mean, did, did you even try to get into a university? Not that I'm saying community colleges are bad, but, come on.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I did, yeah well, yeah, my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Barb\" title=\"Barb\">mom</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bob\" title=\"Bob\">dad</a> advised me to go <i>to</i> the community college, because my family could not afford university.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> That's... my, OK, OK, first off...you're on <a href=\"/cwcki/Monthly_tugboat\" title=\"Monthly tugboat\">disability</a>. Government would have paid for your schooling, the end. That's just being lazy. Um, number two, financial aid and student loans. That would have been all on you, not on them. And the thing is, you...should at <i>least</i> have transferred to university <i>after</i> the community college cause community college is a stepping stone. Yes, it's a great way to get your classes for cheaper, but then you <i>have</i> to go to university to get, like, a bachelor's. I mean, did you even look into that?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> That had not come to mind. By the way, I ca-, by the way, just to let you know, I did check with my mom and dad, I mean, yes, they were in for, of the, of the financial aid, but they...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well then your parents should have done something about that, that just shows your parents didn't care about your future either. But it's not up to them. You should have done it, why didn't you use it? [<i>talking over Chris</i>] I wish I'd had financial aid right way.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Ah... [<i>sighs</i>] Look. I would have taken the financial aid if I, if I... could, but, my mom and dad, there was a whole lot of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress\" title=\"Stress\">stress</a> going on in just starting out at the community college...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> But you still...should have been able to do it later... [<i>Chris stutters</i>] Don't you overtalk me! Don't overtalk me. That's the thing, it's always stress, it's always stress this stress that. It...doesn't...<i>matter</i>. You should have been able to do something <i>afterwards</i>. Even if you didn't do it right away, you should have been able to go to a four-year university afterwards, and gotten something better than just a little <a href=\"/cwcki/CADD\" title=\"CADD\">CADD</a> certificate...whatever. An associate's doesn't do <i>shit.</i> I'm...I mean, like, I'm sick and tired of hearing you use the word \"stress.\" You don't know stress. We've been through this before. You <i>don't know</i> what stress is.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> OK, I will not disagree with you...but on the...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You're damn <i>straight</i> you're not gonna disagree with me because you know I'm right! You don't have a job, you don't even, you don't have job stress. You...You sit around, play video games, and get...<i>money</i>. If your life was a hundred times more stressful than it is now, you still wouldn't have as much stress as I do, you wouldn't have as much stress as...my <i>cat</i>, probably.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>long pause</i>] Yeah, y-you're probably right.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You're damn straight I'm right! I mean, you take days off where you don't do anything except color or play video games. <i>[pause]</i> I mean, I don't think you get...that all you have shown me the whole time I've known you, is that you don't want to do anything unless it's easy. You want everything to be handed <i>to</i> you. And if you haven't noticed, I'm kind of ambitious. Why would I want someone like that?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>long pause</i>] Yeah, you're right. I would not want, uh...I would, if I was to...go out with a woman, I, ah, would want one who was a go-getter. And you...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> But the thing is, don't you think go-getters want <i>other</i> go-getters? Why would I want someone who's just gonna lay at home and suck up my money? I mean, 'cause that's all it would be, instead of sucking up the government's money you'd be sucking up my money. And, uh, I'm not sure I'd like that. At all. I mean, I don't want to have to take care of someone until I have kids, and you're <i>definitely</i> not my kid.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> <i>[long pause]</i> I can definitely, be able, I can definitely take care of myself.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> No you can't! You don't have a job. Can't take care of yourself without a job. My job is hanging on a thread, and I'm still doing way better than you.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> OK, yeah, you're doing...way better than me. You know a lot more than I do.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I mean, seriously, tell me, without your parents, could you survive?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I would do my best to survive, and...I think I would get by.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Really. Your best. Because, I mean...what kind of bills do you think need to be paid off every month?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>long pause</i>] Yeah... electric, water, heating...that sort of thing.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>pause</i>] Um, how about car insurance? Um, cable?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Oh yeah, car, um...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Rent? Property? You got taxes? Um, trash pickup if you have trash? Recycling if you have recycling? Oh, and don't forget any repairs.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yes, there is all that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I mean, how much do you get a month again? Like, what, 600?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> No, I'm ge-, I'm getting...about 800 a month right now.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Still, my bills are slightly larger than that. I mean, you couldn't survive on your own. And, I mean, these are my bills with <i>roommates.</i> I don't think you could survive without your parents. You can't even move out! And even if you could move out, you wouldn't have anybody to move out <i>with</i>! That's, that's insane!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, that is insane. And I...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Then why haven't you done something about it?! I have been living out on my own since I was eighteen, nineteen. You are twenty-seven! And you haven't moved out yet!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, well one reason is, yeah, I don't have anybody to move out...with.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I moved out with <i>nothing.</i> I moved out with no job, hardly any money, without a car, and I still survived. And I got myself a job, and I got myself a car.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Well I mean...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I mean, find someone. There's people in Craigslist, the newspapers, um, universities, everywhere. You can find something. You can find someone who will just rent a room. And then you don't even need to be around that person. I mean, hell, you could probably get housing.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, [stutters] That's true, but ah...if I move out that's actually, I think I could be able to move out...with my girlfriend. I don't, I mean, I wouldn't want just some other, I don't think, I just wouldn't feel comfortable...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b> </font>[cuts in] But be realistic Chris, I mean.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> ...with some kind of stranger...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You need to know how to live on your own before you go into a relationship. Because if you go straight into, living out with a relationship, it's going to put a strain on there. I mean, you need to know how to deal with strangers, you need to know how to live on your own. I mean if you can't take care of yourself, you can't expect to be in a relationship. You'll just drag it down. Besides, I mean, you shouldn't move out with someone right away anyway, so you should probably live on your own first. I mean, besides, if you keep acting the way you're acting, you aren't likely to get a girlfriend anyway. Besides, if you had your own place to be, it'd be easier, because then there'd be a place for her to move and normally it's the girl who moves in with the guy. [obvious sounds of Kacey being tired from wailing on Chris so much] And <i>besides,</i> if you can't even take care of that, how do you expect to take care of a daughter...which you keep dreaming about. I mean, are you expecting to just marry someone rich?\n</p><p>[<i>slight pause</i>] \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> No, I do not...I-[<i>cut off by Kacey</i>]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Then how are you gonna take care of her? How are you gonna take care of a daughter?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">One day at a time.</a>\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> No, there is no one day at a time. You, you...There is no one day at a time. You do that, you're going to starve. You need <i>plans.</i> I mean, that's like Alcoholics Anonymous, that's not living.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Alcohol\" title=\"Alcohol\">Well, I mean, at least I don't go out and get drunk every night.</a> I don't do that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, you know what, at least those drunks could pay for their drinks. You couldn't even do that! I mean, are you just trying to make yourself look good?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>incoherent mumbling, sounds like he's repeating what Kacey just asked him</i>] Yeah...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, stop! It's, it's...I mean, that's, uh, that's stupid!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Well, wait, uh-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You're comparing apples to oranges!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> OK, wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the ques-, maybe I misunderstood the question. You just said, I mean, I thought you said, uh, \"[...]trying to make myself look good.\"\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Yeah, you're just trying to make yourself look good by <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">comparing yourself to someone you think is worse than you</a>. But, I mean, you're not going to be able to always do that. That's not adult.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>completely skipping over the latter half of her last statements</i>] Oooh, yeah, OK, yeah, now I understand. I just, mm...OK. Mmmm...Yeah. Mmm...Yeah, but, that is, uh, that is kind of a lame deal.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Besides, at this point, they're probably better than you.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, you're pro'lly, yeah...You're right. A lot of people are better than me. Uh...in situations of being able to take care of him or herselves...themselves.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Yeah, so obviously you're never gonna be able to take care of anyone. Why would girls want that? Girls want <a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris\" title=\"Liquid Chris\">real men.</a> They want somebody who's gonna give them comfort and security. Not saying that the girl shouldn't be making money, too, and helping out, but I mean, nobody wants somebody who's just going to, [<i>scoff</i>] to, just, lay there and do nothing!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I mean, oh-kay, look at what I'm being offered with Chris. Look at what I'm being offered with you. If you were me, what would you do?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Mm...Yeah...Probably go to one that's better. But...lemme just ask you, I mean, I know it's not about Chris, lemme ask you, have you actually <i>checked</i> his back-, his background and actually seen where he works?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> <i>Yes!</i> And that's why he, I know he's honest with me! And it doesn't matter anyway, you just said it's not about him, but then you made it about him. I mean, I've been to a company lunch with him.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Well, um, I was just askin'. I was just askin'.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> So, I mean, seriously, once again, I mean, who do you think would be the better one?\n</p><p>[<i>pause</i>]\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> OK, <a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris\" title=\"Liquid Chris\">him.</a>\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Exactly, so why, why do you think I would even give you a chance after all the lies and all the ch-, shit you put me through?

I mean, don't think I don't know that you don't lie to Kim. Don't think I don't know that you don't lie to me! I don't think you'd have luck with anyone, to tell you the truth. So you can not tell me that you want me to be with you or that you love me because you're just gonna die wasting your life playing video games and doing nothing. I mean, even though a <a href=\"/cwcki/CADD\" title=\"CADD\">CADD</a> degree isn't much, you haven't done anything with it. You've wasted your life. You've wasted your life and you think you're good enough to date anyone, including me? I mean, you're frickin' weak-willed, you're not even good enough for society. You- I don't think you're ever gonna get anything, you can't fight for what you want. You definitely didn't fight for me, so you know what? I don't need this at all. This is totally not what I need. I mean, fuck you, I don't even wanna be friends, because you are a total waste of space. I mean, you disrespect everyone. And you know what? I'm getting married tomorrow, 2PM. You know what, and it's all thanks to you, cause if it weren't for you being such an ass, I wouldn't see what a great person Chris is and how much he really does love me 'cause I had someone to compare him to, who doesn't give a shit about me, who only loves his video games and himself. So you know what? You- Just- You know what? I don't even care because I don't even have anything to say to you because you know what, won't hurt about this, <a href=\"/cwcki/Red_Letter_CWC_Certified_Day\" title=\"Red Letter CWC Certified Day\">you'll be over this by tomorrow</a>. I will never see anything that shows you're even hurt by this or you even care! So you know what, I'm going to go ahead and get married tomorrow. I'm gonna be happy and I'm gonna live my life and you know what, you're gonna be doing the same thing in five years. If you're not dead. I mean, I'd recommend talking to someone about that. Y'should probably call up, you know, an institution, therapy, something, because, I mean, you're gonna be the five- doing the same thing in five minutes. I bet you I will never be mentioned again by you. You're not gonna be upset. You're not gonna do anything. I bet you anything I'm gonna see a new video being like, \"Oh, who the hell was Kacey? I'm going after...\" I don't even care anymore. I. Don't. Care. I'm getting married tomorrow. I'm gonna be happy, so you know what? Go do whatever because you know what, just fuck you, you're just gonna go off with <a href=\"/cwcki/The_Wallflower\" title=\"The Wallflower\">someone else</a> because, I mean, you've already shown me that, you've already shown me that, sooo...have fun making a video about meeting a new girlfriend, because I'm done.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Ugh...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Peace out.\n</p><p>[<i>tape ends</i>]\n</p>\n<table style=\"width: 90%; max-width: 600px; height: 70px; margin: 1em auto 1em auto; border: 0.15em outset #000; background: #eee; vertical-align: centered; color:#000;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"width: 33%; max-width: 200px; text-align: center; color:#000;\">⇐ <a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey_and_Liquid_Call\" title=\"Kacey and Liquid Call\">Kacey and Liquid Call</a><span style=\"color: #000\"></span>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33%; max-width: 200px; text-align: center; color:#000;\"><span style=\"color: {{{textcolor}}}\"><strong><a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey_calls\" title=\"Kacey calls\">Kacey Phone Calls</a></strong></span>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33%; max-width: 200px; text-align: center; color:#000;\"><a class=\"mw-selflink selflink\">The End For Real (Kacey call)</a><span style=\"color: #000\"></span> ⇒\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p><br/>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<p><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.mediafire.com/download/1d241aekda9c2ce/111009theendforreal.mp3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Download call (MP3)</a>\n</p>\n<center><b>    Chats and calls</b></center>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n</p>\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"navbox\" style=\";\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"padding:2px;\">\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"nowraplinks collapsible mw-collapsed mw-collapsible\" style=\"width:100%;background:transparent;color:inherit;;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<th class=\"navbox-title\" colspan=\"2\" style=\";\"><div style=\"float:left; width:6em;text-align:left;\"> <span class=\"noprint plainlinksneverexpand\" style=\"white-space:nowrap; font-weight:normal; font-size:xx-small; ;;border:none;;\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"/w/index.php?title=Template:Classic_Chris_era&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" title=\"Template:Classic Chris era (page does not exist)\"><span style=\";;border:none;;\" title=\"View this template\">v</span></a> <span style=\"font-size:80%;\">•</span> <a class=\"new\" href=\"/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Classic_Chris_era&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" title=\"Template talk:Classic Chris era (page does not exist)\"><span style=\"color:#002bb8;;;border:none;;\" title=\"Discussion about this template\">d</span></a> <span style=\"font-size:80%;\">•</span> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"//sonichu.com/w/index.php?title=Template:Classic_Chris_era&amp;action=edit\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#002bb8;;;border:none;;\" title=\"You can edit this template.
