Yeah, you're\nright. Hey, what's up everybody on\nYouTube? Jesus Christ Prime here once\nagain and today we're going to be\nlooking at the next figure in\nTransformers that you can see that merge\ncombiner mode at Selena. So essentially\nbetween at least two of the Autobots\nwhether it be Selena or Chris Chan Prime\nthey both have their normal default mode\nwhich you see in the original figures or\nthey actually can alternate into their\ncombined mode when needed to help out\nMetatron or any other Autobot combiner\nteam. But that's just the uh short\nversion of that. But anyway, here we\nare. And there she is. And first and\nforemost, as always, we'll take a quick\nlook at the packaging. So, right out\nfront here, we got a lovely picture of\nher motorcycle boat. I think somebody\nforgot to put in some grays there or\nthey might not have hit when or they\nmight not be recognized. Anyway, so\nthere's a slight bit of miscoloration on\nthis uh bots are supposed to figure well\nthat's happened before if you take to\naccount uh uh certain guardians or\nrenegades or other decept toys in the\npast. Anyway, so one color the other\nprototype yada yada yada ah transformers\nlegacy. She is a let's class classic\nclass to let's say to let's class it\nclassic to loo. Ah here we are combiner\nmode at Selena transfer bus on this side\nof the box. You got the artwork of\nSelena. I knocked her\nover. Okay that happened anyway. So yeah\nnice little variation of her uh of her\nrobot mode boat as opposed to\nuh as opposed to her regular as opposed\nto regular boat. Anyway, anyway, uh\nEtselia is Cyber Trronian. And on the\nother side of the box, you got half of\nthe lovely poster\nartwork and uh there is the top, there\nis the bottom, the verses barcodes, and\nuh on the back of the box, you got\nobligatory brushes, this that the other.\nShe could become an arm, a leg for\nMedatron to take place of one that is\nabsent. And a lovely little bio if you'd\nlike to read that. shorter than the\noriginal bio, but this will also be on\nthe quick light. But that's basically it\nfor the\npackaging. Moving right along though.\nSo, here we have Selena in her combiner\nmode as opposed to original mode. And in\nher motorcycle mode, yeah, she\ndefinitely has uh got the uh move got\nthe grooves going on and everything. I\nleave that kickstand down. I was think\nthis. But anyway, let's get in closer.\nLook at the uh details. So, you got some\ntransparent uh window and viewing,\nespecially to see the uh silver on the\ninside and the top front. And there's\none side of the vehicle complete with\nthe kickstand. Lots of uh pinks, some\nsome reds, some grays, and a little bit\nto hit the orange around. And there's\nthe uh back of the bike, which is the\nsos of her feet. And uh there is the\ntop. There is the bottom. And she does\nhave visible head syndrome. Hey. How you\ndoing? I'm not just delivering pizza as\nyou\nknow. Anyway, so that side. So she does\nroll as they should. Hooray for rolling,\nfalling, biking things and all that.\nYes. And now for comparison, we'll get\nthe usuals out of the way first. So,\nhere she is with uh\nCC82 going on right\nthere\nwith Christian\nPrime. Don't you just love it when the\nbike is bigger than the\ncar\nwith\nOptimus? Or how about when the bike is\nas big as a truck?\nwith\nSonu didn't say that\nlast. And here she is alongside the rest\nof the quickfill autobio team wave\narmorat roll out chaper and fire\nshot. And here she is comparison with\nthe uh GI Makoto's Decepticon Kabire\nteam and the first which of course\nincludes the Punlabs, the SAVs and the\nCorrectors. And then now for the last\ntwo clear obvious comparisons. So we'll\nstart off with our special guest, the\nMold Mate. So here she is with Combiner\nWars\nGroove. Couple of motorcycles just\ndriving down the\nhighway. And of course\nwith\nherself I mean at least she gets a\nlittle bit bigger in her vehicle mode\ncomparison but\nanyway there you\ngo. Any So she does come with a couple\nof accessories. So, she gets the uh\nlovely little blade pieces once again\nlike she did in the original figure\nexcept uh yeah, these are just uh all\ntransar blue plastic with the uh bolding\nand that there's just no paint on them\nfor some reason. Oh well. Anyway, you\ncan connect the uh two once again to\nmake a full\ndisc and uh yes. So on the on the uh\nfigure itself, you got uh a five mil\nrear port right there, and you have uh\nports on either side of the rear tire.\nSo obviously, what is a good thing to do\nis just uh pop these in the sides right\nthere, and she could be slashing jerk\ncop tires along the\nway. Fee. Yay.\nAnd then she also has her little\ncombiner limb. Uh, which you know, same\nas the ones I give with the she gets the\none with the claw. And of course, you\nknow, we can flip that out to make the\nfingers. It's the same. You can got\nthese. I make the thumb the thumb to go\neither way. You know what? You know how\nit goes. Just\numoop. It's the right hand and then\nthe it's the left hand. Yep. So anyway,\nyou know how it you all know how it goes\nby now. But yeah, you can definitely\nstore this in the vehicle mode. You got\na couple options actually. You can slide\nthe tab the post down that way. Oh, and\nshe has this port right here. So, yep,\nyou can pop it on top. Leave it right\nthere. That's decent. That's decent. Or\nif you if you wanted to or if you use\nthe uh\nbooster type of hand, you can uh anyway,\nyou can pop it back here.\nOh, and also as the uh with the usual\nthese combin mode hands, you got the\nlittle thing right here. You can just uh\npop out move. You can store your Titan\nmaster prime prime master in there. But\nyeah, just um well, she got blades and\nshe got clog right behind her\nback, but not so much zoom because\nthat's not booster. It's more like an\nattack power up.\nOkay, so that's pretty much it for the\nvehicle mode. Let's get down to\ntransformation, shall we? Let's Yep, we\nknew that was going to happen. All\nright, so go into combine mode first.\nOnce again, the kickstand is up. All\nright, so first off, we're going to take\nthis piece right here. Turn that, lift\nit up, and then rotate it downward. Just\nleave that right there for now. Yeah,\nthese stay up here. Oh, there's like\ntabs and slots. Apparently, I did not\ndiscon I did not connect them right when\nI transformed this into vehicle mode for\nthis video. Anyway, so the arms you're\ngoing to want to take them, rotate, pull\nthem down here at this thing. There's a\ntab right here. That's got to go into\nthis slot right there. So, we're going\nto rotate that at the bicep and this\ngoes all the way down. It connects right\nthere. And same thing on the other\nside. Rotate.\nYep. And then Yeah. Yeah. Rest the way.\nAnd then of course push the head. Now\nactually helps if you pull this forward.\nGives you clearance. You push the head\nback. Get the combiner peg\nup. And there you go. Now is a leg. And\nshe definitely could kick ass like this.\nKick. Kick.\nYes. All right. Now R mode. So combiner\nlook them like that as you could\nprobably get figure. We'll lift the uh\narms up and we'll just go ahead do this.\nSo you want to rotate him this way where\nthe elbow is facing that way and\njust leave them like that for right\nnow. And then might want to lift this up\nfor this. So lift this up and\nuh pull and pull the legs down\nstretching them out. And um you want to\ngo ahead\nand well no actually you could leave the\ntires the wheel the back tires as they\nare that's yeah anyway do that. So just\nthere's a tab slot connection tab slot\nyeah get that in there and make sure I\ngot this right. This goes all the way\ndown\nhere.\nYeah because sworn there was like a\nthere's an attempt. Oh well. Anyway, so\nthen you rotate and there you go. Now\nshe is an arm. Unlike armarats, you got\nto hand it to her. There you go. And of\ncourse, you can have it this way. You\nknow, either way, become a right arm or\na left arm. And you got your optional\nfull range of move it here or of course\njust the 90 degree bend. But pretty much\nit. So, let's go down to robot mode.\nFeet forward. and pop this out so we can\nget the head out. Combiner peg down.\nClose that back up. Split the legs. Get\nthe arms down. Rotate them\nforward.\nAnd yeah, there you go. There you have\ncombiner mode. That's Selena in her\nrobot mode. And I'd say compared to her\noriginal to her actual form, it's\nactually decent a fair representation in\ncomparison. Look at that. That we do a\nsideby-side\ncomparison. Oh, I forgot to do this. You\ngot to flip these tires in in robot\nmode. So, they are in that way in robot\nmode. So, yeah, there you go. That's the\nforfeit robot mode. But let's get a\ncloser look at the uh details. So, kind\nof a rather simplistic version of her\nhead bow, but at least it's like she got\nher mouth plate, her mouth guard up, and\nshe could put her visor on. So, she's\njust ready to uh scan the Decepticons\nand clones. All about symbol front and\ncenter on the yellow triangle and the\nand the blues, pinks, reds, grays, and\nuh hints of orange all around going down\nthe body and the more detail as well.\nand uh going up the back. Big old front,\nbig old backpack. That's the front of\nthe motorcycle, but it\nworks. But yeah, now articulation wise,\nwhat we got? I'm going to tell you. So,\nthis ball is all jointed. All joined.\nYou got your wiggly wiggly waggly wiggly\nwaggly. Um can't look down. Now, let's\nuse that\ntrint. She could do a to squirrel like\nthat if you wanted to. Um, she could\nlook down some. Okay, there you go. She\nlooked down and be like, \"What the heck\nis that?\" And then head can rotate, do a\nfull 360. Arms can rotate, do a full\n360, and they can move in and out. And\nwell, getting really down if you use\nthat transformation joint. You got bicep\nrotation and um 90 degrees of bend at\nthe elbow. Uh, nothing at the wrist or\nhand. You have waist rotation.\nlegs can move forward that far\nand back all that far and then outward.\nShe could do the full splits. You have\nthigh\nrotation slightly under 90° or bend at\nthe knee or maybe it is. And uh just\nnothing at the\nfeet. Now we'll run through the\naccessories uh once again. Now, with\nthese with these, of\ncourse, pop mainly would pop in her\nhands. Um, you could probably utilize\nthis, but mainly if you were to combine\nthese into one one thing, and they could\njust slip right there. But this you got\nto have this upward for that. So, that's\na bit of a stretch. But yeah, you uh you\ncan definitely uh do it do these blades\noverhand or underhand. Definitely the\ncase with that one. But if you try to do\nit underhand on this one, this that\nkickstand gets in the way. So probably a\nbit of an angle there, but at least you\ncan get that. And you can definitely do\nit on top\nhere. So on that,\nyes, she can be all run fast and uh hack\nhack slash all the way and just hack\nslash some Decepticon booty and bots.\nBut yeah, of course, uh these uh\nDukeabby make the uh one disc, so she\ncould hold that and kind of make like an\nimpromptu shield. But then of course,\nyou also have this which uh can be used\nas a blade type of weapon or a mock gun.\nSo yeah, there you go. You can kind of\nget\nthe slash bash bash slash bash bash\nmaybe a pew pew if you want to and all\nthat good stuff right there.\nYeah, let's just show it off real quick.\nYeah, that up. Pop this back\nhere. There you go. That's\ndecent deja\nvu. And now for\ncomparison. Here she is with\nCC82\nwith Christian\nPrime\nwith\nSonu\nwith\nOptimus. Definitely a height difference.\nAnd here she is at a dynamic group shop\nwith the quick field combiner team. Look\nlike they're ready to take out some\nDecepticones and\ncons. And here she is alongside the\ncomparison with the Decepticones and the\nfirst Punish Labs SAVs and\nCracktors. And of course, here she is\nwith Mr.\nGroove. And last but not leastly, here\nshe is\nwith\nherself. And there's definitely a bit of\na height difference, but still, you know\nwhat? It doesn't matter if she's tall or\nsmall, she's still awesome as she is,\nbut she definitely has more flexibility\nin her original mode as opposed to her\ncombiner mode. So, there you\ngo. And here we show off on Medatron how\nSelena looks in our mode. And then also\nin leg mode which once again get all the\nfun things you can do in scrabble\nseating this type of\ncombiner. All right. So yeah this is\ncombiner mode at Selena and yeah\nactually quite the uh decent little\nfigure you know for work like you know\nnot as uh detailed or you know in\ncomparison to original original mode but\nat least you know gets the job done.\nShe's a combiner, so she'll for she'll\nwork with the med she'll work alongside\nthe others when combining Medatron when\nnobody else is there or they're just\nabsent. And at least, you know, she's\nable to work in cooperation as opposed\nto alone out night and wonder and just\nslashing or just punching. She's got\nreally good strength and ninja skills\nall about her either way. But of course,\nyou know, as it is with the combiner\nbots and everything, they still got\npretty good play value, especially when\nyou can scramble city and everything.\nBut yeah, anyway, so I picked up confirm\nmode from Target. These are popping up\nin your Walmarts, your Targets, your Big\nBad Toy Store, Entertainment Earth,\nAmazon, all over the place. So, yep.\nJust so you can find for yourself and\nanything and just some links to Big Bad\nToy Store and so forth. I'll put a link\nin the description down below as well as\nto my socials between my Boo Sky and uh\nQuicklight down below in description.\nAnd I think that's pretty much it. So\nyeah, don't just don't forget to like\nand subscribe to this video to my\nchannel and everything. See whatever uh\nthing I come up with on divine and good\ntiming. It's just it's uh as good as it\ngets.\nAnyway, but here you go. This is uh\nTransformers Legacy Diverge Combiner\nMode. That's Selena. And this is Jesus\nChrist saying remember you don't stop\nplaying because you grow it. You grow it\nbecause you stop playing. Be geek be\nproud.\n15 minutes later after the after\nChristian blime on you contacted Optimus\nand Okay, good. Looks like a bit in the\nclear. There are no Decepticons right\nhere, but I have searched where they are\nnearby. But I anticipate all around this\nvolcano outside for the cave.\nEssentially, we're surrounded by\nDecepticons and Decepticones. So, we got\nto watch our back. It's going to take a\nlittle while for everybody to uh get\nhere. I mean, Le One should be on its\nway here, as well as the Aerial Bots and\nWave. All right, so guys, here's the\nplan. All right, fire\nshot. Yes, Chris. All right, so here's\nthe plan. We're going to just\nessentially lay low. We're going to\nscout and we're going to make sure that\neverything is clear. We report, we're\ngoing to report to the others along the\nway. And uh so far shot, you'll get the\ndistraction. You'll you'll fire off one\nof your missiles. Make sure it shoots\noff in a distance. Explodes without with\na silencer on your cannon.\nAnd meanwhile, Etsilia and I will go\nzoom around the mountain in the caves\nand uh we'll set a few covert explosions\nto give us some cavis on the inside\ndisrupt their anaton b mining and right\ndown here about get here. We should be\ngood to go and make and for the backup\nwe'll we'll form metatron metatron when\npcractor v comes around. Here Chris,\nthis is chopper. Go ahead chopper. We're\nhere right here listening. Wave the\nAerobots tonight and I were making our\nway to the volcano island. Considering\nour very fast box beef, we should be\nthere in a few minutes. Probably about\n10 or so. Yeah, don't worry. We'll be\nthere shortly. And then we'll be able to\ntake out all those decepticones. And if\nBer Bay is good, we'll give them a beat\ndown. Yeah. No\nproblem. We'll be there faster than you\ncan sink a seeker into the ocean and\nmake him cry. Uncle.   \n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Transcript\">Transcript</span></h3>\n<center>\n<table cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"background-color:transparent; border:3px outset #bb2222\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:CWCism-IllBreakYouDead.png\"><img alt=\"CWCism-IllBreakYouDead.png\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"113\" src=\"/w/images/0/05/CWCism-IllBreakYouDead.png\" width=\"150\"/></a>\n</td>\n<td><i> This media needs a <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCki:Transcription_Style\" title=\"CWCki:Transcription Style\">transcript</a>.
