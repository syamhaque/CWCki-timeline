As the images in this post illustrate some of the events. When it said it happened at HOME, it literally means HERE, in this Reality, this World, Right Here with me! Please bear with me, as for some specific details I am not at liberty to divulge or discuss.\n<p>It started a couple of weeks ago, when I got word of a certain gaming console I still have which may hold a very special power. Magi-Chan teleported over here and psychically scanned my Dreamcast. I was standing right behind him, with open mind to see what he saw. We both saw something powerful remained dormant inside the console. So, I took initiative to give it a charge, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_money\" title=\"Chris and money\">by leaving it powered on at its home menu for more than 24 hours</a>. Friday the 28th, I was curious what it was that Magi-Chan found, so I placed my right hand on the powered-on console, opened my mind and third eye. And then, a most powerful surge came into me, and after it was over, I had a new friend inside of me, a one CPU, Miss Uzume Tennouboshi. <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">She had been dormant inside my Dreamcast, and I pulled her out. We've been sharing my body since. Yes, she is able to control my body when she has control, and speak through my lips in her voice</a>.\n</p><p><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/John_Yamada\" title=\"John Yamada\">My new contact, here in this reality</a>, who was from Neptunia, and I have been back and forth with the recent events. Including when Adult Neptune came here to look for him, but was lost. I had to send Silvana to locate and rescue her. There were Cloakers, and Silvana teleported herself and A-Neptune to multiple locations, including D.C., to throw the Cloakers off of their trail. Silvana teleported her back to Cwcville, and then back to Neptunia, with Magi-Chan. With communication to me as well, she thanked me personally. Night Star also teleported there earlier with Magi-Chan to meet with the CPUs to make their acquaintance.\n</p><p>As a show of gratitude, from her original dimension, A-Neptune shared some of her power with me to better my own powers and magic, and so did the Blanc, Noire and Vert from there. So with Uzume inside me, I have a share of powers from five goddesses.\n</p><p>We were fighting a common foe, Uzume's twin, Kurome; big trouble. I've had to fight to get her out of my head. But I realized later I was already immune to her possession by having Uzume inside me. To keep our local homes safe, we've shared Uzume's power with everyone in the state of Virginia, here, as well as in and around the city of Cwcville. The vaccinating jolt is spreadable through any communication method or by touch and close contact with another individual. So, surely and swiftly, the whole United States and this world will all be immune to Kurome's possession.\n</p><p>I have also had to share my support with defending the nation of Lowee of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Gamindustri\" title=\"Gamindustri\">Gamindustri</a> by sending my Autobot team and my Army troops of CWC Defense. When things were looking bleak for Blanc, her sisters, and who else in the nation, the enemy forces were dispelled and pushed back by my crew. After that battle was over, they stayed to help with restoring the buildings and helping the survivors and remaining people.\n</p><p>And, as I had mentioned, Kurome swayed <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Graduon\" title=\"Graduon\">Graduon</a> to take on my city of Cwcville, but fortunately, we predicted the attack the day before, so we all were ready to defend the city. Mecha and Regular Jerkops and Monsters alike ravaged the streets and skies. My Sonichus and Rosechus were more than a match for them all, as well as our armed forces, Autobots, and so forth amongst our strongest of citizens. I've had to personally share my power from home with the Christine Chandler of Cwcville. And between she, Uzume and I, we opened a portal to push Kurome back into the Zero Dimension for the time being. I had talked with Graduon before Kurome got to him, to talk him into not letting her get the better of him, as if she had her way, dimensions would clash together and likely cease to exist, including our own reality, here. I knew that Graduon would Never want to be the ruler, or even Second-In-Command, over a Nothing World.\n</p><p>A Lot of other things have happened as well. I've had to have <a href=\"/cwcki/Magi-Chan\" title=\"Magi-Chan\">Magi-Chan</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Silvana\" title=\"Silvana\">Silvana</a>, and even <a href=\"/cwcki/My_Little_Pony\" title=\"My Little Pony\">Discord</a>, to bodyguard me from the possible possession or manipulation of Kurome. I had Discord and Magi-Chan escort me personally on my Thursday outing to <a href=\"/cwcki/The_End_Games\" title=\"The End Games\">The End Games</a> for Pokemon League and colouring my pages that I had at the time. I allowed Discord to enjoy some of the fun there. He watched a few Dungeon and Dragon-type games get played. I even allowed him to see if he could get one of my friends to notice and see him. But she didn't budge. Oh, well. Also, in parts of the outing, Discord attached himself onto me in the form of a vest, so he didn't have to be as obvious. How many people can actually say now that they have worn a vest made of draconicus? It has been a mentally-worrysome time for me, and it is still ongoing for the time being.\n</p><p>All this can be resolved by what I have asked y'all to do recently: give some Love and Shares to Neptune, Blanc, Noire and Vert of Gamindustri, so they can be at their most powerful to take out these other-worldly threats that threaten even our own home reality that is This Earth we all live on. And suffice to say, from personal experiences from the past two weeks, IT IS ALL REAL.\n</p><p>Please, do heed my words and take advantage of my sound advice of helping power up our Goddesses. You don't have to do much; playing the \"Hyperdimension Neptunia\" games, watching the anime, and so forth is well and good. But all you really need to do is think of them positively; they are a needed good force. And they can't help us if we don't help them. I sure as sugar am helping them out. Please, follow our lead.\n</p><p>Thank You.\n</p><p>Sincerely and Love,\nMiss Christine Weston Chandler\n</p>\n<center><ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\">\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\"><div style=\"width: 155px\">\n<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><div style=\"margin:15px auto;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Sonichu_16_page-4.JPG\"><img alt=\"Sonichu 16 page-4.JPG\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"120\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/2/23/Sonichu_16_page-4.JPG/77px-Sonichu_16_page-4.JPG\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/2/23/Sonichu_16_page-4.JPG/116px-Sonichu_16_page-4.JPG 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/2/23/Sonichu_16_page-4.JPG/155px-Sonichu_16_page-4.JPG 2x\" width=\"77\"/></a></div></div>\n<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n</div>\n</div></li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\"><div style=\"width: 155px\">\n<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><div style=\"margin:30px auto;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Hyperdimension_Neptunia_invades_CWCville1.jpg\"><img alt=\"Hyperdimension Neptunia invades CWCville1.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"90\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/2/24/Hyperdimension_Neptunia_invades_CWCville1.jpg/120px-Hyperdimension_Neptunia_invades_CWCville1.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/2/24/Hyperdimension_Neptunia_invades_CWCville1.jpg/180px-Hyperdimension_Neptunia_invades_CWCville1.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/2/24/Hyperdimension_Neptunia_invades_CWCville1.jpg/240px-Hyperdimension_Neptunia_invades_CWCville1.jpg 2x\" width=\"120\"/></a></div></div>\n<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n</div>\n</div></li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\"><div style=\"width: 155px\">\n<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><div style=\"margin:30px auto;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Hyperdimension_Neptunia_invades_CWCville2.jpg\"><img alt=\"Hyperdimension Neptunia invades CWCville2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"90\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/5/50/Hyperdimension_Neptunia_invades_CWCville2.jpg/120px-Hyperdimension_Neptunia_invades_CWCville2.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/5/50/Hyperdimension_Neptunia_invades_CWCville2.jpg/180px-Hyperdimension_Neptunia_invades_CWCville2.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/5/50/Hyperdimension_Neptunia_invades_CWCville2.jpg/240px-Hyperdimension_Neptunia_invades_CWCville2.jpg 2x\" width=\"120\"/></a></div></div>\n<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n</div>\n</div></li>\n</ul></center>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Mistaken_about_being_linked_with_Uzume\">Mistaken about being linked with Uzume</span></h2>\n<p>13 November\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>EVERYONE, I require your attention for a moment, to tell you further and true, of Uzume Tennouboshi, of nations lost in other Dimensions.\n<p>As I had stated, from within my Sega Dreamcast Console, I had absorbed a Lot of power into myself, up to the point of Uzume, herself, sharing my body with me. I, was mistaken, but not wrong; I had absorbed the Orange Spiral Seal that had once held Uzume, fully and whole. The Seal had taken on her personality and spoken to me as Uzume, herself, would have.\n</p><p>While Kurome, the dark half of Uzume, in the past weeks, wreaked some havoc within and around myself, and my group of powerful friends, That has come to a close, in a final moment between Kurome and one of them, who was not Uzume. For you see, Uzume, herself, was awake and in hiding, waiting for her moment to get back with Kurome. In Kurome’s confusion of rather this being inside of me, or Uzume; which of us two was the Real Uzume Tennouboshi.\n</p><p>Uzume Striked! She merged back together with Kurome, cheating death, and becoming fully alive as she was before long ago!

There was a battle of the war of our new common enemy that lasted the past couple of days. We lost a few good soldiers in the process; may they Rest In Peace, that their efforts were not in vain. Also, after Silvana got captured, until the mutual foe is down for good at least, Count Graduon and Cwcville’s Christine Weston Chandler signed a peace treaty, as Graduon offered his troops and services for the effort.\nThe fight was North beyond Ruckersville, and the commander of the enemy waves were going to push the fight into Charlottesville. Thankfully, with the help of the CWC Defense Army Division, My Autobots, and my family, our large group kept the enemy back.\nThen, Christine initiated a Very Smart Operation: Fine Ol’ Solution. There were Cloakers and similar bad people of interest in Cwcville (not counting Graduon and his crew); they rounded the Cloakers and baddies up and in a Large plot of land Graduon donated, a Prison Camp with Great facilities for reforming the bad pawns to good people.\nAfter rounding up the Cloakers and bad guys there, our foes retreated! And our groups of Brave and Powerful Heroes are free to return to their homes and rest.\nBuilt on Cwcville’s soil, not in the city, though; outside of the city. Graduon donated a lot of land to build prison camps full of large ovens to keep the people warm, and even top-notch dentistry with well trained doctors also running the clinic. The camps also have some of the best showers a prisoner can ask for; Shower Stalls with privacy walls.\nWe all in Charlottesville, Ruckersville, all places to the north of us, And the people of Cwcville can sleep more safely now.\nYour Shares to the Gamindustri Goddesses really helped us in this battle. Thank You, Everyone, for your Love, Kindness and most Generous Support! Please continue to offer your shares to them for any and all other future conflicts Here on our World, and in all of the Other Worlds, Realities and Dimensions.\nHave a Great Day, Earth! We’ve All Helped make it more safe!\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"I_Am_Not_a_Damned_White_Supremest\">I Am Not a Damned White Supremest</span></h2>\n<p>29 November\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>To Clarify for Everyone, I am Against Nazis, 100%.
