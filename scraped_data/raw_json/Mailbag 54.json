I am not a troll, I just think Kimmi could be an interesting adition and I put a lot of thought into her story too as a matter of fact. She's Asian, so that's a little more diversity for CWCville and she's got a tragic past. Kimmi's been born into the sex trade industry and has spent her life being passed around many men and used for pleasure, none of which love her. None of them even use her correct name. Kimmi is just used and she's not even allowed to wear clothes to keep some dignity. She's lonely too, and has finally made an attempt to escape her harsh existance <i>[sic]</i> of being repeatedly violated every day in order to have a fresh start and fulfil her dreams of opening up her own Sushi restaurant. Sadly though the police of <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a> didn't believe her story and thought she was insane (well she was blowing down the street naked) and put her in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Fuzzy-Wuzzies_%26_Prickly-Wicklies\" title=\"Fuzzy-Wuzzies &amp; Prickly-Wicklies\">Prickley Wickley</a> asylum. Creepichu upon realising that plastic does not taste so good as hedgehog flesh has taken poor Kimmi in as a good gal-pal and they work together.\n</p><p>Seeing as you put your dog in CWCville, and Meg Griffen made an appearance, also that your comic does include sexual content...that you would perhaps see Kimmi the Love Doll as a rather amusing and fun adition.

My name is Michael Steele, Chairman and Leader of the Republican Party. I've been following your career as a professional Comic-book artist and Rolemodel for some years now, and am convinced that a young individual of your outstanding talent, charisma and moral fibre are just what this country needs to lead her people as we forge a new path forward in the 21st century. Our party respects a man who's not afraid to speak out against the depravity in society presented by the <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">homosexual</a> menace, the horrors of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Smoking\" title=\"Smoking\">smoking</a> and drug abuse, and the devastation wrecked across the nation by the terror of internet <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Troll\" title=\"Troll\">trolling</a>. We were particularly impressed by your obvious expertise in anti-homosexual policy debate. Before you, we thought we could only ask the homos not to get married. Never before did we even suspect that we could solve the entire problem by strapping them to chairs and forcing female prostitutes on them!\n</p><p>The way I see it, I don't see how you could lose. You are a sensation amongst the youth demographic; your ingenious Sonichu comics have inspired a generation of young people to drop their cynical aspirations and instead do their duty for <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/America\" title=\"America\">America</a> and write comic books for Uncle Sam. Your mayoral career of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Cwcville\" title=\"Cwcville\">Cwcville</a>, portrayed in your Sonichu comics, shows what a wise and courageous leader you can be. You never lost a SINGLE election there! Even your rotund figure belies a man that's dressed for success; one who's not afraid to eat substantially to display his success in life. Plus, with the recent electoral success of Sarah Palin (famous for her straight talkin, common sense folkyism and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Slow-in-the-mind\" title=\"Slow-in-the-mind\">Downs Syndrome</a> son), we feel there is a strong sympathy vote for retards such as yourself who has suffered the tortures of life with <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">Autism</a> and succeeded due to his own genius and determination, never taking the easy way out of life.\n</p><p>I know you are a fan of <a href=\"/cwcki/Barack_Obama\" title=\"Barack Obama\">Barack Obama</a>, but we feel you'll be more at home in our party, the \"Moral Majority\", who are willing to step out from the crowd who would demean and slander us just for our bigotry.\n</p><p>We can start small perhaps; you could run for councilman at <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ruckersville\" title=\"Ruckersville\">Ruckersville</a>, or mayor, but who knows what might happen in the future? Governor? <a href=\"/cwcki/A_Public_Announcement_for_Congress\" title=\"A Public Announcement for Congress\">Congressman?</a> Senator? President? I don't see why you can't be each of those things and more. With your legions of followers in your loyal fanbase, there's some rich campaign funds to draw on, and a big cheer squad!\n</p><p>So at long last Chris, I want to offer you a political career in the Republican party. Please let me know if you're interested on the cwcipedia. I will contact you again to work out the details.\n</p><p>Yours sincerely,\nMichael Steele\nChairman of the Republican Party.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>I prefer the simple life at the moment.\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Fatty\">Fatty</span></h3>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #B48246; padding:5px; background-color:#FCC\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>From: lalanne@food4u.com\n<p>Why did you lie about losing weight?
