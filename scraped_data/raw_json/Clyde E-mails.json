It PAINED me worse for like over a month since I read that article. Clyde underestimates me, and he exaggerates on how quickly I moved on. At this time, I don't expect you to believe me on that. It pained me more, because I had two items I was going to give to you. The PSN account, and a Musical Birthday Card with Eric and \"Jennifer Lopez\" singing \"<a href=\"/cwcki/South_Park\" title=\"South Park\">Don't be fooled by all my money, I still like to eat tacos, honey. So crispy on the outside, so super good and yummy.</a>\" I still have that card. And I think fondly of you and our time together every time I hear or think of that Taco Song. I'd say \"Taco, Taco\"; you'd say \"Burrito, Burrito\".
