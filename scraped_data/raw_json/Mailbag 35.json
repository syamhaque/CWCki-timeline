The final one was a response to the <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_34#Wild_weekend\" title=\"Mailbag 34\">wild weekend</a> letter from the prior mailbag, calling Chris out on how gay he acts. It is unclear if he was permanently deleting these letters out of rage, or out of fear that his fans might see them.\n</p><p>Two of Chris's answers stand out as outright disturbing, one in which he openly advised a man to buy his son a prostitute, and one in which he <i>almost</i> disagreed with Nazi concentration camps. Other notable responses included Chris raging against tattoos, advising we go through nine seasons of <a href=\"/cwcki/South_Park\" title=\"South Park\">South Park</a> in order to fully appreciate a

I suppose I should have told you the ages of my children. I have three kids, two of which are boys and one of which is a girl. Mike Junior is the eldest at 16 years, with my daughter Katherine being the middle child at 15. My youngest (Jeremy) is 8. Mike Jr reads it seperately from the rest of us.\n</p><p>My oldest son has some trouble with the ladies, but he REALLY wants to have sex. He's of legal age in our state. I was thinking of taking him to an escort service and letting him have his first time with one of them. One of my coworkers suggested doing this to help my son gain some self confidence with the ladies, as his father did this for him when he was that age and my coworker has tons of girlfriends. Don't worry, I wouldn't let him go off with any lady that looked diseased or ugly!\n</p><p>I briefly mentioned this to my son during a bonding session while we were watching some porn. (At your suggestion I stopped showing it to the two youngest children.) He really seemed to like the idea, although his mother is adverse to it. I don't want to make my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Heartsweet\" title=\"Heartsweet\">heartsweet</a> angry, so I figured that I'd ask you.\n</p><p>Is it ok for me to buy my son sex? He's at the age of consent where we live and he's been asking me lately if I was actually serious about it. He thinks that it would be a great way to get his hormones in check as well as practice speaking to women.\n</p><p>Thanks for the advice!!\n</p><p>Mike\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>I would agree to this step for your son. It would definitely be a self-confidence booster. I highly recommend making sure the woman was tested and checked to be S.T.D.-Free beforehand.

Madam, I understand how you feel about this as a considerate and caring mother, but you have to open your mind and heart; your children have to grow up sometime, and the first sexual intercourse is a Big Step in that.

I have proposed to my government body on many occasions the marking of homosexuals, (making them wear rainbow emblems on themselves at all times), and the gathering of homosexuals onto trains and planes to take them to camps where we can better study them and hopefully find a final solution to the homosexual problem. Some people -- mainly the homosexuals -- get really offended when I suggest this… Then again they’re gay and don’t know any better.\n</p><p>Am I wrong in my idea that we should mark homosexuals with a friendly pin so people know they are gay? I think it would be most helpful if we could gather them all up and study them in one location! After all if we are able to implement the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Solution\" title=\"wikipedia:Final Solution\">final solution</a> and rid homosexuality forever wouldn’t it be a good thing? I think homosexuals need to see that this is for the betterment and good of mankind and cooperate more.\n</p><p>Sincerely,\n</p><p>Dr. Josef Mengele\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Your ideas are good, but I do see flaws on them; the wearing of pins would be considered Manditory, yet this a Free Country with Civil Rights; the individuals may choose NOT to wear them even though they have them. And of course they would resist even volunteering to go to a Camp; just the word, Camp, gives the impression of the days when the Jews were oppressed by Hitler (Anne Frank comes to mind), and that is not a good image. If you want their cooperation, you have to give the impression that they are not going to feel Forced. With such, I would recommend the term \"Camp\" not be used, but use a term that gives a more positive impression on the Study and the Ideas. And lessen the required number for the study; maybe select 5 or 10 homosexual individuals to help, and offer compensation. --<a href=\"/cwcki/User:ChrisChanSonichu\" title=\"User:ChrisChanSonichu\">ChrisChanSonichu</a> 05:58, 9 January 2010 (CET)\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Rejected_Mailbag\">Rejected Mailbag</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Ain.27t_no_sex_like_jail_sex\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ain't_no_sex_like_jail_sex\">Ain't no sex like jail sex</span></h3>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #B48246; padding:5px; background-color:#FCC\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>From: Madison B.
