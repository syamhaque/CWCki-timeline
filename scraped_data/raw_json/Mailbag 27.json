The effort he put into his response went way beyond that shown in any of his responses to his True and Honest <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Fans\" title=\"Fans\">fans</a>, leaving many <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">trolls</a> to speculate if Chris was actually attracted to her.\n</p><p>The rest of the responses were mostly just Chris being the nutcase we've come to expect. He gave some awful advice on things he has no experience with, such as <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Love\" title=\"Love\">love</a>, parenting, and moving out. He also took a few moments to babble ignorant nonsense about genetics and <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">gay people</a>. In one letter, he claimed that <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">Clyde Cash</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Jack_Thaddeus\" title=\"Jack Thaddeus\">Jack Thaddeus</a> were gay, but it was unclear whether he actually believed this or if it was just an attempt to \"slander\" them. Chris seemed to lose his grasp on the <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_English\" title=\"Chris and English\">English language</a>, as many of the responses made no sense whatsoever. Chris also got a message from Jack Harkness from <i>Torchwood</i> and <i>Doctor Who</i>.\n</p><p>This mailbag is also one of the few where Chris did not <a href=\"/cwcki/Rejected_Mailbag\" title=\"Rejected Mailbag\">reject</a> any letters.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Answered\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Answered</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Love_and_loss\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Love and loss</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#We're_lucky_Chris_will_never_have_children_because_he_would_be_a_terrible_father\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">We're lucky Chris will never have children because he would be a terrible father</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#A_family_history_of_failure\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">A family history of failure</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Chris_is_a_breast_man\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris is a breast man</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Chris_dispenses_more_advice_he'll_never_follow\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris dispenses more advice he'll never follow</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#More_fun_with_theology\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">More fun with theology</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#The_report_card_saga_continues\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The report card saga continues</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#Vaccines_don't_work_that_way\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Vaccines don't work that way</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#A_repeat\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.9</span> <span class=\"toctext\">A repeat</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#Lesbians_are_okay,_but_NEVER_gays\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.10</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Lesbians are okay, but NEVER gays</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#Balljizm\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.11</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Balljizm</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-13\"><a href=\"#Chris_finally_understands_asexuality,_but_not_genetics\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.12</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris finally understands asexuality, but not genetics</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-14\"><a href=\"#Reunion_anxiety\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.13</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Reunion anxiety</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-15\"><a href=\"#Basic_writing_skills\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.14</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Basic writing skills</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-16\"><a href=\"#Is_Chris_hitting_on_Bailey_Jay?\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.15</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Is Chris hitting on Bailey Jay?</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Answered\">Answered</span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Love_and_loss\">Love and loss</span></h3>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #B48246; padding:5px; background-color:#FCC\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>From: <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kennedy\" title=\"wikipedia:Ted Kennedy\">Edward Kennedy</a> &lt;itsamekennedy@aol.com&gt;\n<p>Chris,\n</p><p>I was dating this really sweet girl named <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Jo_Kopechne\" title=\"wikipedia:Mary Jo Kopechne\">Mary Jo</a> for about a month and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/God\" title=\"God\">God</a> appeared to me in a dream on several non-consecutive occasions and told me that we were destined to be together and that we were soul mates.

I've been reading your Sonichu comic, and I must ask, how come there is no interpersonal conflict between the protagonists? They all get together and date one another with any issues. There never seem to be any arguments amongst the couples, depsite the fact that arguing is a major part of having a relationship. Why did Sonichu and Rosechu decide to date so quickly? She never bothered to ask Sonichu about his personality or attributes nor did he ask her, they hooked up simply because they were the same species.Why can't the relationships in Sonichu be more realistic? Perhaps an argument, a romantic affair, a breakup, or even a divorce to make the comic more applicable to real life. Please take my ideas into perspective.\n</p><p>Sincerely,\nCharlene Devereaux\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>They have had their arguments, but they always come to an agreement, or they remember what attracted them to each other in the first place, so It Is All Good in each Relationship.\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3><span id=\"Is_Chris_hitting_on_Bailey_Jay.3F\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Is_Chris_hitting_on_Bailey_Jay?\">Is Chris hitting on Bailey Jay?</span></h3>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #B48246; padding:5px; background-color:#FCC\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>From \"<a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey_Jay\" title=\"wikipedia:Bailey Jay\">Bailey Jay</a>\" &lt;baileyjay@gmail.com&gt;\n<p>Hey Chris.... :(\n</p><p>You really hurt my feelings with your <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_25#It's_a_trap,_again!\" title=\"Mailbag 25\">reply</a>. I know, it's kind of shocking at first, but you have to understand where I'm coming from. All my life I've felt like I should have been a girl, and that I've been trapped inside a boy's body; I don't want any part of myself to be masculine in any way. In a sense, I have always been a woman mentally and emotionally my entire life, and I have had the courage to show this in my outward appearance as well. There are a lot of transgendered people out there who have died or have been caused great emotional or physical harm just because of how they feel inside...\n</p><p>I'm not gay; I'm straight, as I am a woman who has feelings for other straight men. I hope that doesn't make you think that I am disgusting or vile, because it's just who I am. \n</p><p>Anyways, I shared those pictures with you because I like you, Chris, and I think you're a very handsome and kind person. I thought maybe you wouldn't be intimidated like all the other boys who are afraid to approach me, because you know what it's like to be e-famous.\n</p><p>If you want, here's a couple more pictures that I took on recent photoshoots.

Sometimes, I wonder what my life would be like if I was born female instead, because of some of my emotional, caring, self-conscious thoughts I had in my lifetime. Then I would later remember that God must have made me all straight male for good reasons.\n<p>As for being e-famous, it IS stressful to me; updating the content daily or near-daily without going out-of-date, trying to tell the Honest Truth when there are people who will continue to Mislabel, ridicule, slander or worse, just to make your good fans turn against you in their views. I am Straight; I just wish they would get it through their god-damned thick skulls and quit Mislabeling me. But all in all, I deal it one day at a time and one moment at a time, with time away from it all and deep breaths.\n</p><p>And to answer your other question in your last message, It is likely, but I do not know, because if that is true, they are certainly NOT telling me for my information. I mean, I am a good and kind person naturally (granted that I can be cruel when angry or when feeling down); I wish that women WOULD approach me if they KNOW me from online and see me in public.\n</p><p>If I may ask, and you may answer in a reply directly to my e-mail address at ChrisChanSonichu@aol.com, is modeling the only thing you are famous for online, or are there other things you have done and published?
