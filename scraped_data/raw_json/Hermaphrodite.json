This included transgender women that hadn't received bottom surgery, as well as intersex people that he perceived as being female. In essence, Chris used the term the same way some people would refer to such people as \"shemales\", \"dickgirls\", or \"futa\". Like with a lot of other things, Chris's understanding of trans and intersex people came from the <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_television\" title=\"Chris and television\">media</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_video_games\" title=\"Chris and video games\">he's</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_pornography\" title=\"Chris and pornography\">consumed</a>. His initial understanding of such concepts mirrored those of many other people during the late 2000s and early 2010s. Chris had seemingly conflated transgenderism with intersexuality, believing that both terms referred to the same thing.\n</p><p>Chris more often than not used the term \"hermaphrodite\" as a pejorative towards trans women, under the fear that they too can make him gay, due to their supposed ability to subvert his straightness. During the Classic Era, Chris was also noted for being peeved by his female characters being portrayed as \"hermaphrodites\", being portrayed with penises or as trans women. For these reasons, the way Chris used the term can be thought of as the transgender equivalent of \"homos\". Chris has also used the term \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Homo\" title=\"Homo\">homo</a>\", as well as \"<b>transvestite</b>\" and \"<b>lady-man</b>\", as demeaning terms towards trans women that he he didn't deem authentic, and refused to respect the identities of.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-jackie_4-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-jackie-4\">[4]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-ladyman_5-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ladyman-5\">[5]</a></sup> These past attitudes of Chris's however, are far overshadowed amongst the CWCsphere by his recent, more vocal support for trans people on social media.\n</p><p>Chris similarly used the term \"<b>intersex</b>\" to refer to the same thing, but in a less derogatory manner, using the term on himself when he began transitioning,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]</a></sup> as well as for the characters <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu\" title=\"Rosechu\">Rosechu</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Sylvana\" title=\"Sylvana\">Sylvana</a>, both of whom had penises at one point or another. \n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Past_Transphobia\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Past Transphobia</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Defenses_against_his_Effeminancy\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Defenses against his Effeminancy</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Trans_Men\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Trans Men</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Shifting_Stance_on_Trans_People\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Shifting Stance on Trans People</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#See_Also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See Also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1\"><a href=\"#Notes\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Notes</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Past_Transphobia\">Past Transphobia</span></h2>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto;

Chris said that Silvana was his least favorite character to work with for this reason,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-common_20-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-common-20\">[20]</a></sup> and also stated that fans can draw her naked, just so long as she's drawn with a vagina.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-21\"><a href=\"#cite_note-21\">[21]</a></sup> The infamous drawing of Silvana masturbating was also created as a commission from <a href=\"/cwcki/Sarah_May\" title=\"Sarah May\">Sarah May</a>, bribing Chris to do it to get his website back.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-skype_14-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-skype-14\">[14]</a></sup>\n</p><p>One of the most infamous examples of Chris's former transphobia was his encounter with the troll sweetheart <a href=\"/cwcki/Bailey_Jay\" title=\"Bailey Jay\">Bailey Jay</a> in the CWCipedia's Mailbag.

This was likely a result of the aforementioned fact that he believed that one straying away too much from their assigned gender made them gay, which meant that Chris believed that he's proving to the trolls that he's gay by showcasing his femineity, and so took every possible opportunity while recording himself to subvert it by feigning masculinity.\n</p><p>When Chris was forced to admit that he was gay by a group of trolls, he held up an action figure of <a href=\"/cwcki/Optimus_Prime\" title=\"Optimus Prime\">Optimus Prime</a>, who he deemed as a symbol of masculinity, throughout the entire video.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-33\"><a href=\"#cite_note-33\">[32]</a></sup> Chris had also greatly exaggerated his physical prowess, usually to appear more powerful than his trolls or to impress his gal-pals.

The earliest known instance of this recorded is with the \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Muscle_bra\" title=\"Muscle bra\">muscle bra</a>\". Chris has stated that all men should wear \"muscle bras\" to cover their chests by law, being uncomfortable with seeing the chest of a man. At the time, Chris appeared to refer to such coverings as a \"muscle bra\", due to the masculine connotation that came with it, not wanting to making it appear he's promoting men to wear women's clothes. Chris then bought himself one of these bras to control the bouncing of his moobs, and came to enjoy it. On 28 April 2011, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Surfshack_Tito\" title=\"Surfshack Tito\">Surfshack Tito</a> also leaked a <a href=\"/cwcki/Tomgirl_Pictures\" title=\"Tomgirl Pictures\">set of photos</a>, which highlighted Chris's eventual gender transition. Even while the facade was on its last legs, Chris still tried to assure people that he was a heterosexual man who was just \"in touch with his feminine side\".\n</p><p>Chris, after transitioning, has ironically become one of the things he once winced at the thought of. However, from doing this, his <a href=\"/cwcki/Gender_dysphoria\" title=\"Gender dysphoria\">gender dysphoria</a> became much more apparant, and he had an inverse perspective on his presentation, now wanting to eliminate all masculine traits of himself, including his penis. Chris only appears to view those who have a vagina as \"fully female\", regardless of their chromosomes. This also seemed to be a driving force of his that led to him taking such <a href=\"/cwcki/Un-clit\" title=\"Un-clit\">drastic</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Self-inflicted_taint_wound\" title=\"Self-inflicted taint wound\">measures</a> on himself, and expressing self-loathing on himself for being born male.

Before Nowacking's transition, Chris replied to many of his tweets, especially when he started posting about dating on his Twitter. When talking with him, Chris went on long tangents about his online life, and his experiences with trolls and weens. Weens led by <a href=\"/cwcki/Michael_Hirtes\" title=\"Michael Hirtes\">Michael Hirtes</a> then tried to convince Nowacking to block Chris, which caused Chris to believe they were responsible for Nowacking blocking him. Chris continued to try contacting him through multiple sockpuppet accounts.

He's shown such sentiments since at least 2015, a year after he openly transitioned. On social media, Chris was noted for often times agreeing with prominent transgender figures.\n</p><p>Before officially transitioning, when Chris had declared himself a tomgirl, his stance towards his characters being transgender also shifted more positively. The most prominent example of this being <a href=\"/cwcki/Robee_Sonichu\" title=\"Robee Sonichu\">Robee</a> (formerly Robbie, now Roberta), who was initially written as being the youngest son of <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu\" title=\"Rosechu\">Rosechu</a>. Chris decided to write an about Robee's transition in <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_12\" title=\"Sonichu 12\">Sonichu 12</a>, making it the main focus of the story \"To Be or Naught a Tomgirl\", which showed his decision to do so during his childhood, his evolution, and eventual transition. He similarly made <a href=\"/cwcki/Cera_Rosechu\" title=\"Cera Rosechu\">Cera Rosechu</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Christine_Rosechu\" title=\"Christine Rosechu\">Christine Rosechu</a> into tomboys.
