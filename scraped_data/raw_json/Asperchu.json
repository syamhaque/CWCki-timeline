The knowledge that someone had created a series about an <a href=\"/cwcki/Electric_Hedgehog_Pok%C3%A9mon\" title=\"Electric Hedgehog Pokémon\">Electric Hedgehog Pokémon</a> who suffered from the affliction did not sit well with him. He became even angrier when the creator of the series himself started sending him e-mails.\n</p><p>The first recorded communication we have between Alec and Chris implies that Alec had been in contact with him multiple times outside of the public view and that Chris had responded to these communications negatively.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup> Chris didn't respond any better on his public mailbag, claiming that Alec was jealous of him and inexplicably alleging that the included fan art of Asperchu and Sonichu implied <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">homosexuality</a>.  \n</p><p>Upset that Chris would jump to such conclusions, Alec sent him another letter, depicting Sonichu and Asperchu having good, masculine, straight fun.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup> This letter was even more poorly received.\n</p><p>Undaunted, Alec continued to send letters to Chris's mailbag, thinking that perhaps the man he respected so much really just misunderstood him. A few of these letters were <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_19#A_very_Asperchu_Christmas\" title=\"Mailbag 19\">ignored</a>, some were <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_28#Hey_kids,_it's_Asperchu!\" title=\"Mailbag 28\">coldly dismissed</a>, but Chris's most <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_31#Asperchu_is_the_shit\" title=\"Mailbag 31\">notable</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_32#Parodies\" title=\"Mailbag 32\">responses</a> were explosive outbursts of <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_anger\" title=\"Chris and anger\">anger</a> and hatred. Eventually, Chris began <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_35#No_comment\" title=\"Mailbag 35\">refusing to respond</a> to Alec's correspondence, or <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_34#Asperpedia!\" title=\"Mailbag 34\">deleting his messages outright</a>.\n</p><p>In <i>Asperchu</i> Issue C, Chris made an appearance asking for help from the characters to save Asperchu. Later, he and <a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris\" title=\"Liquid Chris\">CChanSonichuCWC</a> met up with each other, leading to a standoff where Chris tried to shoot him. Chris <a href=\"/cwcki/Asperchu_is_a_Horrendous_Joke\" title=\"Asperchu is a Horrendous Joke\">responded</a> to the comic, mentioning that he was set on fire in the comic. He didn't seem to notice that he was also called by the name <a href=\"/cwcki/Ian_Brandon_Anderson\" title=\"Ian Brandon Anderson\">Ian Brandon Anderson</a>, nor did he notice the appearance of Liquid Chris.\n</p><p>When the <i>Asperchu</i> saga started taking off, Chris's schedule for <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\">his own comic</a> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress\" title=\"Stress\">dropped drastically</a>.\n</p><p>Beyond this, Chris made clear that he also hates the comic because of its \"uncensored pictures\" and \"low resolution and blocky art\". Here, we see Chris's <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_hypocrisy\" title=\"Chris and hypocrisy\">hypocrisy</a> in action. The \"uncensored pictures\" he's all up in arms over are just minor posters hung up mostly in Asperchu's room and even so, they are mostly hidden away by the character's heads. Chris's \"uncensored pictures\" are done by the main characters in full view, despite the fact that <i>Sonichu</i> is supposed to be a \"kids' comic\". Chris probably took the terms \"blocky\" and \"low-resolution\" from the <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Family_Guy\" title=\"Family Guy\">Family Guy</a></i> episode <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_to_the_Multiverse\" title=\"wikipedia:Road to the Multiverse\">Road to the Multiverse</a>. Of course, compared to Chris's <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_art\" title=\"Chris and art\">art</a>, it's practically the fucking <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistine_Chapel_ceiling\" rel=\"nofollow\">ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.</a> It helps that Alec is humble and doesn't try to act like his artwork is amazing and worthy of being hung in a museum.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Asperpedia\">Asperpedia</span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Haitihelp.JPG\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"223\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/8/8e/Haitihelp.JPG/300px-Haitihelp.JPG\" srcset=\"/w/images/8/8e/Haitihelp.JPG 1.5x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Haitihelp.JPG\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Clearly, Asperchu is pure evil.</div></div></div>\n<p>After finishing the first three issues of his comic, Alec Benson Leary set up his own Mediawiki website where one could read all existing comics, as well as a number of articles about the world of <i>Asperchu</i>, and read fan mail answered by Mr. Leary. Soon afterward, portals were added to the site for other notable comics, such as <a href=\"/cwcki/Evan\" title=\"Evan\">Evan</a>'s <a href=\"/cwcki/Evan#Simonchu\" title=\"Evan\"><i>Simonchu</i></a>, <span id=\"Sean\"></span> and <i>Sonichu is Dead</i> creator Sean August Watley's latest project, <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Moon-Pals\" title=\"Moon-Pals\">Moon-Pals</a></i>. In <a href=\"/cwcki/February_2010\" title=\"February 2010\">February 2010</a>, more comics were added, including Alec's <i>Sonichu Revolution</i>, Sean's <i>Sonichu is Dead</i> and <i>Sonichu is Gay</i>, and Isabel Monday's <i>Capering Berries</i>.\n</p><p><a href=\"/cwcki/Jack_Thaddeus\" title=\"Jack Thaddeus\">Jack Thaddeus</a>, recognizing the incredible profit potential of <i>Asperchu</i>, immediately began advertising the new website on the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia\" title=\"CWCipedia\">CWCipedia</a>. Chris responded to these new ads, and his newfound knowledge of Alec's website with a series of increasingly disturbing videos<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup> where he made his opinions on the matter quite clear.\n</p><p>Alec, being a gentle soul, has not directly responded to any of Chris's offensive videos. When <a href=\"/cwcki/Down_with_Asperchu#Alec's_response_to_the_video\" title=\"Down with Asperchu\">asked by a concerned fan</a>, he outlined his planned course of action as one of peace, citing his personal hero, <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohandas_Karamchand_Gandhi\" title=\"wikipedia:Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi\">Mahatma Gandhi</a>. His webmaster, Mao \"Bamboo\" Ling has opted for a more direct approach, speaking to Chris directly in two short <a href=\"/cwcki/YouTube\" title=\"YouTube\">YouTube</a> videos.\n</p><p>The large banner ad for Asperpedia was replaced by a link to information on the U.S. Government's efforts to help the victims of <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Haiti_earthquake\" title=\"wikipedia:2010 Haiti earthquake\">the earthquake in Haiti</a>, because Alec cares about the plight of his fellow men.\n</p><p>Due to the growing popularity of <i>Asperchu</i> over <i>Sonichu</i>, the site later set up a fan portal where aspiring writers can make their own <i>Sonichu</i> fanfictions. Various pre-existing titles, including <i>Sonichu: The Animated Series</i>, are also hosted in the fan section. There is even a parody version of <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia\" title=\"CWCipedia\">CWCipedia</a> set up by Mao, where totally fictitious articles on <i>Sonichu</i>-related things are made, including photoshopped images of the original comic.\n</p><p>Eventually, on May 27, 2010, Mao took complete control of CWCipedia, after which Alec and <a href=\"/cwcki/Vivian_Gee\" title=\"Vivian Gee\">Vivian Gee</a> started uploading <i>Sonichu</i> Season 2. The CWCipedia was then permanently deleted for Mao to gain the upper hand after noting to the Comic Fury staff that, without <i>Sonichu</i> and Chris to bargain for a lower price, they must be forced to sign with him. The rights to the Asperpedia was then sold for $150,000.\n</p><p>The Asperpedia was eventually shut down, however, according to Alec Benson Leary, \"It was run by a spazlord who took it down randomly in a fidgety fit one day. I didn't care to fight for it.\"\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_19_January_Demands\">The 19 January Demands</span></h3>\n<p>On 19 January 2010, Chris uploaded twelve new pages of <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_10\" title=\"Sonichu 10\"><i>Sonichu</i> #10</a>, which are centered mostly around Asperchu and the Asperpedia. <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_Ego\" title=\"Chris and his Ego\">Ever the heroic savior</a>, Chris pictures himself, along with <a href=\"/cwcki/Ultra_Sonichu\" title=\"Ultra Sonichu\">Ultra Sonichu</a>, destroying the slanderous Asperpedia and saving Alec's characters from their <a href=\"/cwcki/Asperger_syndrome\" title=\"Asperger syndrome\">terrible affliction</a>, with Asperchu himself getting an \"EXTREME ELECTRIC MAKEOVER\" and becoming \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Mitch_Sonichu\" title=\"Mitch Sonichu\">Mitch Sonichu</a>\".\n</p><p>Not content with this, Chris then issued an ultimatum to Alec through a blog post:\n</p>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">Although within Alec's Hands, Asperchu IS a horrific joke, not only because of the uncensored nudity, wrongful character usage and all that, but also because the whole thing is drawn in a c***py Blocky and Low Resolution way.\n<p>I still have NO association with Alec Benson Leary OR HIS Asperchu character Whatsoever, but I will forgive Alec for his error if he FOLLOWS from my new plot and Extreme Electric Makeover as a template.

He also apologized for spreading lies about Alec, such as suggesting that he <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_50\" title=\"Mailbag 50\">only responded to fan mail that puts him in a positive light</a>, and for the constant <a href=\"/cwcki/Death_threats\" title=\"Death threats\">death threats</a> against him.

They are portrayed as stupid, murderous characters, who are tried by <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a>'s court for the murder of <a href=\"/cwcki/Simonla_Rosechu\" title=\"Simonla Rosechu\">Simonla Rosechu</a>, as well as the theft and mockery of several citizens of CWCville. After a kangaroo court trial (in CWCville's favor, of course), Alec and co. are sentenced to death, Alec specifically in a \"ten-button Electric chair\". He is electrocuted to death by various characters that were \"misrepresented\" in <i>Asperchu</i>, including Sonichu, who states that he is <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">\"not gay\"</a> as he jointly ends Alec's life. Chris himself joins in on the fun, and ironically, and also hypocritically, states that Alec is a \"d*** lunatic,\" after which he helps fry him to a crisp, before proceeding to violently contort Mao's limbs backward until they snap using telekinesis, followed shortly after by crushing his heart. Evan is horribly mutilated by <a href=\"/cwcki/Sandy_Rosechu\" title=\"Sandy Rosechu\">Sandy Rosechu</a> whilst chained to a wall, and Sean is executed by a firing squad from <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bill_the_Scientist\" title=\"Bill the Scientist\">Bill the Scientist</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Kel\" title=\"Kel\">Kel</a>, and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Allison\" title=\"Allison\">Allison</a>.\n</p><p>Amidst this brutality, Chris sees fit to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Alec_Benson_Leary_Phone_Calls\" title=\"Alec Benson Leary Phone Calls\">apologize</a> for some of his own wrongdoings towards the Asperchu Four, as well as his fans.\n</p><p>In recent updates to <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_11\" title=\"Sonichu 11\"><i>Sonichu</i> #11</a>, Chris made good on his promise to \"revive\" Simonla. However, the pages reveal that <a href=\"/cwcki/File:Son11p22.jpg\" title=\"File:Son11p22.jpg\">she never died in the first place</a>. This means that Chris set up the trial on a whim just so he would have a convenient excuse to kill Alec, Mao, Sean, and Evan.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sonichu_Revolution\"><i>Sonichu Revolution</i></span></h2>\n<p>When the CWCipedia was taken down during the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Simonchu\" title=\"Simonchu\">Simonchu</a> dispute, it appeared Chris was not going to budge and would <a href=\"/cwcki/9_February_2010\" title=\"9 February 2010\">possibly set up shop elsewhere</a>. Considering Chris's laziness, how long that might take was anyone's guess. The possibility that no new comics would appear for days, weeks, or even months was likely, and this didn't take into account how often Chris's new digs would get hacked. Fortunately, Alec, being the nice guy that he is, decided <i>Sonichu</i> fans should not be deprived of the promised reboot. He took it upon himself to not only deliver fans new pages through Chris's site but to also take care of the looming copyright issues that Chris had been unwilling to tackle. All while still uploading new <i>Asperchu</i> comics.  \n</p><p>Chris, of course, took this in entirely the wrong way. In the <a href=\"/cwcki/Alec_Benson_Leary_Phone_Call_8\" title=\"Alec Benson Leary Phone Call 8\">eighth phone call</a>, he accused Alec of stealing his work and attempting to impersonate him. While he expressed offense at the violence of some of the <i>Sonichu Revolution</i> strips, he showed no signs of grasping the way Alec's comic mocks the unoriginality, moral hypocrisy, sexual degeneracy, and generally warped outlook of Chris's original <i>Sonichu</i> stories.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sonichu_Revolution_Gallery\"><i>Sonichu Revolution</i>
