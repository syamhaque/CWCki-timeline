Can see you online... bruh.\n<p>[<i>Chris picks up the call</i>]\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Hello?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hey.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Hey, how are you doin'?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Doin' alright, how about you?\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Umm, I'm good.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>sigh</i>] So, I feel- I feel like I have energy, and uh- uh, and I can do this tonight, so...\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> That's great.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> So we'll do the meditate session and- like we did last time, essept hopefully I'll find out some more answers about the powers and abilities that I can do from this thing that can be manifested on this side of the iron curtain, in this universe.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Mhm. [<i>pause</i>] Sooo, let's start again like last time; let's dim the lights.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, the li- yep, I turned the lamp off.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Great. [<i>pause</i>] Okay, so let's start with some deep breathing... in through the nose, out through the mouth. [<i>pause</i>] Now, what is it, exactly, that we're trying to see here?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Well... obviously these hands are able to do- a whole number of things, they can ashully hea- help heal others.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> How so?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I can put my hand- I can put my hand on somebody- the shoulder of somebody who's feeling pain, and I can ta- I can make- I can take the pain. But they're not feeling it, but them I feel- but this body feels a mild amount of that pain. I can also manifest objects with these hands, at least on the C-197 side of the Iron Curtain. Including including like but not limited to like, you know, just your typical fruits and apples and whatever else we need. Also, I can manifest universe and dimensional portals.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Mhm. I believe you said something about that last time.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, that was just uh scratching the surface of what I said last time. But it's like I want to dig a little deeper and further.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Of course. So, we're trying to get in touch with the other dimensions, is that what I'm hearing?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Among which and definitely see about how I can get things to manifest here in this universe. So then obviously then I could bridge the dimension rift so I can get this so I can get this body to CWCville.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Oh, so you want to get your physical body into a different dimension\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, different dimension or universe within that dimension, yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Mhm so, I think this call is for a very sacred ritual.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Do tell.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Um, let me pull out a book here that a teacher gave to me. [<i>pause</i>] So, with this ritual, you will be able to start manifesting physical beings or physical things in the other dimension.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. In other dimensions, yeah, that's- that's already possible, but I'm talking about in this dimension.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> So, you want to be able to conjure physical beings in this dimension.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, at least to bring them from the other dimension as well. As part of things are already shifting between- between the between dimensions as I have been sensing a whole bunch of lately.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> I see. I see. This is all making sense to me, of course. Um, So obviously we are not face-to-face, but let me, let me astral project over to where your physical being is so we can be spiritually in the same place.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Right, Rosie's here with me but uh Chris is not she's with Magi-Chan and Cryzel and Sylvana at the time. They've been spending Valentine's Day together.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> That's nice, now let me focus for a second and I will let you know when I'm in your presence or you can tell me when you think I'm in your presence.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> You're phasing in.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Already?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Hm, [<i>pause</i>] okay I'm sitting exactly where I sat last time at the foot of the bed.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yo. I see you.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Okay. Now, I'm reaching out towards you. [<i>pause</i>] Do you accept?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. I just grabbed your hand.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Great, now this may not work on the first try, but I am trying to transfer some of my metaphysical energy into you to help you grow stronger because I can always manifest a little bit more. So, let me try and send over some positive energy and help you conjure physical beings from another dimension in this dimension.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I feel it.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> You do?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I mean, just pretty much you're saying it as you said it, you started you started pulsating that energy into here.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> You can feel the energy flowing through your body.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> You feel more powerful.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> That's good. That's exactly what we want.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I'm rather focused. I- I got my left hand open, hoping to manifest an apple from C-197 to here.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Well, why don't we try something a little smaller than an apple at first?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Oh. [<i>pause</i>] What? Like a ping pong ball or a candy bar?\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Sure.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> All right, I'm going to go for a ping pong ball.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Let me know if you can conjure it.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> On the C-197 side, I can definitely see it in the hand. Though, I think I might be accidentally manifesting a golf ball instead of a ping pong ball because it feels heavier and I feel the dimples.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> But you can feel it in your hand?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Can you see it?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I can see it. It's like I said though, it's on the C-197 side, but yeah, got to be tangible here in this universe. So obviously I can only partly see it.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Mhm. [<i>pause</i>] Now, pay attention to me when I try and conjure something from I don't know. Let's just a random dimension. I don't even need to say what it is. Uh something small like a- a coin. See, I'm pulling it out of one hand and into the other. Can you see it in my hand now?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> It's as easy as that. You just got to really feel it. [<i>pause</i>] And it's okay if you don't get it on the first try. I didn't either.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Frustration is just been it's been trial and error here. But yeah, I'm holding out the left hand I'm holding out the left hand. You're- are you seeing the golf ball in it?\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Um, I'm starting to see the outline. Can you see the outline?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> And you can feel it?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yes. [<i>pause</i>] I'm concentrating hard what are you seeing?\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> I'm seeing- I see the golf ball in its full presence. Try and close your hand around it [<i>pause</i>] did it work? \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Still, only only mainly tangible on the C-197 side. Not here in this universe\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Mm, well maybe because it is still Christine's physical body. All of the powers haven't transferred over from the C-197 side.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> The thing is though, this body is literally like three quarters into C-197, but still one quarter here, because considering it's its species is literally half human and half Sonichu.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Mhm [<i>pause</i>] if you want to try this for a little bit on your own, I think that that could be beneficial, but I have some news otherwise.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> All right, I'll just try that. I'll just try that again on free time. So, what news do you have?\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> So, I've been speaking to uh a community of psychics that I'm close with and we are trying to find a time that would work where we could all help you.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Oh, yes.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Um so a friend of mine named <a href=\"/cwcki/Lily\" title=\"Lily\">Lily</a>. [<i>pause</i>] And a few others, um, have agreed that we would like to help you with your cause because it's such a unique case.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> And plus y'all sense it too.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Um, we feel that a large group meditation where we all try and channel our spiritual power, um, can be very, very, very beneficial.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I hear that.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> And I don't know when this would be because construction is starting in my house. I would probably have to Um it would probably have to be after, but.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Obviously.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Yes, cuz once all the power tools and all the sawdust and stuff starts, it's going to be hard for me to concentrate, but yes, we um, we are very, very willing to help you all- all of us.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yes, I'm very grateful. [<i>pause</i>] Well, you know, in the meantime, while your house is under construction, I can talk with your friends as well.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Um, yeah. Why don't, um I can make a discord group chat with all those who- who uh want to help.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Cool.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Give me a one second. So, and of course, uh we would be very, very grateful if you wouldn't publish any of our like real names or personal information.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Right. This is all strictly confidential. Nothing goes public.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Right, of course. So, I'm waiting to hear back from a few more people and once I find out exactly how many of us uh will be participating. I will create the group chat.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Awesome. For now though, the also the body's been flashing its aura quite a bit and trying to get its power out and manifest manifesting or dimensionally shifting. Have you been feeling that?\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Yes. [<i>pause</i>] I have been feeling it.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> What is your impression of that?\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> I think that you are very clearly showing off your power and sometimes it's best to uh take a more restrained approach.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Tend to agree, but that was like a body, the body was impulsively or instinctively doing that.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Mhm.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Alot things this body does involuntary, like, you know, 24/7, 365 plus 1, I'm it's constantly in meditate.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Yes.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Me so for me to actually meditate is just to go to an directly into a deeper meditative state.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Mhm, So I'm also sensing tension right now.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yes.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> I sense the spirit of another in the room.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Oh, Rosie's in here with me.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> No, someone who has passed on. Someone close to you. He's uh, he has gray hair. Um, it it might be your father.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Well, Mr. C is not here right now. You might be talking about Merlin the magician because uh he and Chris had a thing going on back in the medieval days and we literally have his soul in this body with the 568.6 million other souls and entities that are stored within the conduit portion of this body.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Mhm.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> If you're sensing another soul, a cat just entered.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Oh, yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> But yeah, Merlin's been Merlin's Merlin came on, he's uh very helpful and more participating lately.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> What was that uh sound just now?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> The what?\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Uh there was a there was a sound like something rubbed up against the phone or the microphone of the computer.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Oh, the cat. The cat just rubbed itself against the iPad.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Mmm.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Sylvia, Funny cat.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Now, I also I did a little bit of uh research, um, about you because I wanted to get be more acquainted with like personal details. And I stumbled across um a a quite lengthy documentary on YouTube.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uh, probably Geno Samuel's documentary. So he just made episode 51.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Have you watched all of it?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I'm caught Yeah. Chris and I are caught up with the series.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Do- do you like it?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uh, for the most part. Just not kind of the uh NSFW parts and the totally personal part, but then again of course, uh that Christine was the only one, is the only one to blame for actually putting all that out there by herself.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Mm, yes.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> That that's a whole different kettle of fish from a long time ago in the universe right right here. I made a little joke.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Mhm. Now, I also he mentioned a website called the CWCki.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Um are you at all involved with that site or is it just like as you called them trolls or- or I guess as Christine called them trolls.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, but trolls is more of a neutral term at this point because there are good trolls as well as bad trolls. So, but it's mostly it's mostly run by good trolls who also call themselves Christorians because they're doing the best to chronical as much about her as possible.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Yes. So what- what do you call what constitutes a good troll?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Um, I'd say well, essentially good or neutral intentions towards uh the benefits of others. And of course, what constitutes a bad or hater troll is those that are constantly bullying others for the sake of bullying or the hating on others for the sake of hatred. Freaking Fetishist.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> So, I- I would so you would call someone like Blue Spike or Clyde Cash uh a hateful troll.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yes, very much.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> And what about uh someone like, I don't know. Uh, I haven't really gotten that far into the series. I'm only like 20 episodes in, but someone like Megan from the Game Place days.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, Megan Schroeder. She uh, she was she was neutral. And still pretty much neutral.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Have you talked to her at all recently?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uh, ne, none of us have been able to talk to her recently personally. Not yet. Not since uh Chris was kicked out the Game and Hobby place in April 2008.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Mhm, now, from what I understand, Christine's birthday is coming up as well.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, it's on the 24th.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Um, and like we said last time, you think that Christine might reinhabit um the her physical body and Sonichu you might go back to her other body on that day.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uh on or around that day, but at least by hopefully, prayerfully by then, we'll have the faded events will have me in this body in C-197 and in CWCville. So then yeah, the reverse body swap.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> I see.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Because obviously, the obvious events need to happen before the reverse swap happens.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Now, do you think Christine will want to tell her story of living in C-197 uh maybe in the form of new comic pages?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Um Yes, and yes, and she will talk about it as well in videos. Unfortunately, uh since she's been in my body, she's been able to actually draw a whole bunch of new books and books and what and tell more stories that have actually happened in C-197 that were in- in fill in the plot holes and then and then some. And so she's been really, really, she had become really, really busy and doing it at speed of light with my body. So, that's good. Unfortunately, those books right now are only are pretty much only available in C-197, but hopefully, obviously, once the merge happens, they'll be available to get to everybody all around and in this universe as well because the two universes would have been remerged.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Mhm, so uh Christine when she comes back um will have a lot more comic pages to publish.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Pretty much, yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> That's exciting.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. I mean, I would have done a bunch of drawing and writing on her behalf during the months I wasn't here, but I wasn't sure about uh so many factors including like, you know, she she writes and draws something and it tends and it tends to go into fact happening in one, the other or both of our universes.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Mhm.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> So there was kind of like caution within that. And then secondarily because you know, it's me, Sonichu Prime, not her, and this is her work and everything. I would just feel like I would be further going into a bit of imposter syndrome.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Yes. Well, I also took a- a second to browse the CWCki and they think uh you Christine are uh or I guess you Sonichu are really just Christine suffering from imposter syndrome.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> No, we literally did swap bodies and this happened on March 31st. I mean, the only way you could have really verified this for yourselves is if you had been there and you could just I mean, literally happened. My soul left my body and her soul left her body and we were right next to each other in the bed and we just entered entered the other body. Literally.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> But I thought Sonichu was in the C-197 dimension?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I was before uh the body swap last March.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Well, then how would you be in in the bed next to each other?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> It's like being near yet so far. I mean, So, same exact location, the house's counterpart, so to speak. And I can lay down next to her on the bed. But obviously, I was I was still in C-197 and she was still here at 1218. It's the same thing as me and Rosie right now.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Mhm.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Cuz you know, she's right here on the bed with me.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Yes.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> And then we also have Merlin nearby. Just thinking and plotting and everything to for other ideas that we can figure out magically because I mean, the long story short of what happened long ago, uh King Arthur and a bunch of kings were like they want to banish the dragons and everybody and it except essentially exiling the majority of magic. So, uh between Merlin and two other magicians, they uh cast a ritual that separated that separated the one universe into the two universes, which makes which are 1218 and C197 with the dimension rift in between them. And that happened like uh in the in the around the early 1400s, late 1300s. And they obviously the eventuality of that would be the two universes would be merged back together.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Which where we're at right now.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Okay, is there anything you would like to tell me before we finish up?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uh, I like the uh ritual you were going out from your book. Maybe if you could send me details about that ritual about going from one going from one universe to the other, I- I could I could read up on that myself.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Well, actually, I can't I I made a promise to the teach to my teacher that I would never disclose the information uh I I'm sorry.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> The inc- uh disclose the information in the book?\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Yeah, I can't like-\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> All right, but there's more than one copy of that book, right?\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Actually, no.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Wait. All right, well maybe you could find something that's related, that's equivalent to that online and then you could share that information with me.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Uh, I'll do my best.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Okay, all right. \n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Anything else?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Um, I look forward to uh talking with everybody else in the in the psychic group and hopefully we'll get some get something going on soon enough in the in the group chat.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Okay.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> All right. You can send me you can send me the uh invite to the new Discord server through Instagram or here on Discord.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Okay, sure. I- I would probably just make like a direct message group chat.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Cool.\n</p><p><font color=\"green\"><b>KwaiiSandbag:</b></font> Okay.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Right, well, I guess I'll let you go then.
