I was slightly intimidated, but mostly annoyed and ready to strike back on them. They asked me to leave, and never return. I did not want to leave. I would have left peacefully, in fact, I was ready to go, but I had a prepared speech to say to them stupid Jerkops. And, during the middle of my speech, they chased me, pulled my pants, and pinned me to the floor. Five Jerkops dog-piled on me as I struggled to get free. A thousand pounds of <a href=\"/cwcki/Pickle\" title=\"Pickle\">sausages</a> on my <a href=\"/cwcki/Obesity\" title=\"Obesity\">180 pound body</a> was seriously a cut-off for my Breathing Flow. They handcuffed my wrists and legs, and they hog-tied me! Not only did I felt humiliated from being the victim, but I was angry at them!

But now I have to go to court on July 29 at 9:00 AM at the Albemarle County Courthouse, close to the Downtown Mall. \n</p><p>So now, I feel very miserable, sad, lonely and rejected. And, while I had the handcuffs on me, both my hands, mostly my right, were seriously cut off from blood flow, and they both felt numb. It was terrible. But <a href=\"/cwcki/Barbara_Chandler\" title=\"Barbara Chandler\">my mother</a> and I are going to get back at them in court, in fact, I learned that the Jerkop who arrested me was called <a href=\"/cwcki/Bagget\" title=\"Bagget\">Bagget</a> (that was the only thing about the situation that was hilarious; replace the “B” with an “F,” and you can see how <a href=\"/cwcki/Random-access_humor\" title=\"Random-access humor\">funny</a> it was).\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>Chris then retold the story in his <a href=\"/cwcki/2007\" title=\"2007\">2007</a> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/DVD\" title=\"DVD\">DVD</a> slideshow:<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>And lastly, I had a One-Day stand at the newly built Target....The <a href=\"/cwcki/Manajerks\" title=\"Manajerks\">Manajerks</a> there instituted the \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Virginia_is_for_Virgins\" title=\"Virginia is for Virgins\">Virginia is for Virgins</a>\" law against me. But I blew them off. Then in my quake, the Jerkop Soldier, Bagget caught wind and intercepted me. The battle was great, and the chips blew in his favor. And eventually... he grabbed me by my pants' rear beltline, pinned me on the floor, hog-tied me and scraped the forhead above the left side of my left eye against the rough carpet, and I was wounded with frictional burn, tears and blood. They dragged me to their vehicle, and drove me to their hideout by the <a href=\"/cwcki/Private_Villa_of_Corrupted_Citizens\" title=\"Private Villa of Corrupted Citizens\">Private Villa of Corrupted Citizens</a>. I was stewing above a hot pot of boiling shame and lonliness, when my family came in to rescue me. <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_coping\" title=\"Chris and coping\">Later, I was issued a rematch against Bagget, and with strong words of Voluntarity and Valour, and some Psychic Punches to his gut and jaw, I won that battle against that Jerkop of all Jerkops</a>.\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>The correspondence with <a href=\"/cwcki/Jackie\" title=\"Jackie\">Jackie</a> revealed that in the ensuing court case, Chris thought that his work with the <a href=\"/cwcki/The_GAMe_PLACe#Chris_the_Card_Gamer\" title=\"The GAMe PLACe\">Pokémon TCG League</a> let him off the hook.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup> In reality, the charges were likely dropped due to insufficient evidence, and/or the state just not considering the case to be worth pursuing, due to the comparatively minor nature of the charges and Chris being a first-time offender who could fall back on the <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">autism</a> card. Chris probably mentioned the volunteer work because he believed a person's merits, no matter how unrelated, would automatically make one innocent of all charges. It is also telling that he recounted the charge as \"Soliciting\", whereas the actual charges were \"Disorderly Conduct\" and \"Trespassing\"; he feels that he was only persecuted because of his <a href=\"/cwcki/Love_Quest\" title=\"Love Quest\">Love Quest</a> efforts, and not because he was tard raging.\n</p><p><a href=\"/cwcki/LoveYouLongTime\" title=\"LoveYouLongTime\">LoveYouLongTime</a> offered another perspective of the incident:\n</p>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">I'm sure you all remember the Target incident.

First, he was kicked out within a few days to a week of Target opening. That's just sad. When he was approached by management to leave, he ignored them.

Strangely, the management wasn't really thrilled with this arrangement, and as the comic shows, Chris clearly can't understand why loitering on private property is bad.  \n</p><p>Instead of focusing on the Manajerks'/Jerkops' motivations, Chris simply infers that they despise him for being a <a href=\"/cwcki/Virgin_with_rage\" title=\"Virgin with rage\">virgin with rage</a>, and places the most attention on the indignity he suffered from his arrest. Hence, the comic shows Chris being tackled (albeit by a giant robot), \"hog-timed\" (complete with apple, as if he were about to be rotisseried), and hauled off for trial (by <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Mary Lee Walsh</a>, in a scene ripped off from <i><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Transformers:_The_Movie\" title=\"wikipedia:The Transformers: The Movie\">The Transformers: The Movie</a></i>).  \n</p><p>In another example of how selfish Chris really is, he writes <a href=\"/cwcki/Barbara_Chandler\" title=\"Barbara Chandler\">his own mother</a> out of the story, and has Crystal rescue him instead.

Following that, Chris failed to get a hold of his interviewer and allegedly received another rejection e-mail,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-8\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">[8]</a></sup> eventually conceding that he wasn't hired. This would be the final time that Chris ever attempted applying for a job. It's unknown if this was the result of the management not wanting to hire him based off the previous incidents (if this was the same location), a particularly poor showing at the interview, or knowing Chris, some combination of the two.\n</p><p>Chris visited Target on 16 <a href=\"/cwcki/November_2014\" title=\"November 2014\">November 2014</a>, as part of his <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_Boom_Protests\" title=\"Sonic Boom Protests\">Sonic Boom Protests</a>, where he apparently planned to vandalize any <i>Sonic Boom</i>-related stock that they had.
