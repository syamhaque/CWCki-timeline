It was created using the web-builder feature on Go.com, a largely unsuccessful web portal made by Disney. <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris\" title=\"Chris\">Chris</a> made a poorly-translated Spanish version, which shows that his Spanish name is <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Spanish\" title=\"Spanish\">Ricardo</a> W.

Given the quality of the sites, it is largely assumed that \"notepad scratch\" is a euphemism for \"pulled out of his ass\". Like everything else of a visual nature that Chris has produced, the sites were nothing short of eye rape. The website was spawned out of his obsession with <i>Pokémon</i> and originally featured <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(character)\" title=\"Sonichu (character)\">Sonichu</a> as the mascot.\n</p><p>The site's logo, shown below, was designed by <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Miranda_Joyce_Mitchell\" title=\"Miranda Joyce Mitchell\">Miranda Joyce Mitchell</a>, one of Chris's high-school <a href=\"/cwcki/Gal_pal\" title=\"Gal pal\">gal-pals</a>, as a school assignment. This is why it looks good.\n</p><p>In addition to the godawful aesthetics, the site also has a number of HTML errors.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup> For example, the title image is aligned to the left of the screen, because Chris wrote <code>align=CENTER</code> when he meant <code>align=\"middle\"</code>. This would have been obvious to Chris unless he'd been testing the site on a 640x480 monitor (already obsolete in 2001<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup>), and it would tend to make his work look even less professional to a software engineer who was considering him for a Web-development job.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Current_status\">Current status</span></h2>\n<p>Since the website has been at various times hosted on <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC%27s_Sonichu_Site!\" title=\"CWC's Sonichu Site!\">Chris's other fail webspaces</a>, its current status is the same as theirs, which is to say, inactive and archived. He doubtlessly has a copy hanging around somewhere though, since Chris seems to feel that everything he produces is pure gold.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Content\">Content</span></h2>\n<p>While the site's nominal purpose was to sperg about Pokémon, the content of the site suggests that Chris's ulterior purpose for the site was to sell himself as a cool person and make friends, just as his later <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu%27s_News_Dash\" title=\"Sonichu's News Dash\">Sonichu's News Dash</a> was <i>really</i> about attracting a boyfriend-free girl. Chris hoped that there would be extensive community feedback--the art section was for \"drawings from you and me,\" for example. There was also a \"Cool Letters\" section, which remained vacant. He practically begged people to sign his guestbook, and, of course, there was the prominent \"About the Author\" section, where Chris's already-enormous <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_Ego\" title=\"Chris and his Ego\">ego</a> was apparent. \n</p><p>This archived edition was last updated on 15 January 2009.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Front_page\">Front page</span></h3>\n<div class=\"center\"><div class=\"floatnone\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Cwcpktwo.GIF\"><img alt=\"Cwcpktwo.GIF\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"450\" src=\"/w/images/6/65/Cwcpktwo.GIF\" width=\"630\"/></a></div></div>\n<p>New logo was designed by <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Miranda_Joyce_Mitchell\" title=\"Miranda Joyce Mitchell\">Maranda Mitchell</a> and Me. :)\n</p><p>Launched on July 22, 1999\n</p><p>Updated: 1/15/2009\n</p><p>Welcome...\n</p><p>To CWC's PokéSite 2!\n</p><p>To add frames to see my other cool sites, click here! 8)\n</p><p>Enjoy your visit! :)\n</p><p>Please visit again for many Updates, be sure to Bookmark us, and be sure to tell your friends about us, too.

It included a series of brief updates from the world of Pokémon. Very little of it is original; Chris just relayed information he had read in other publications and sites. There are a few insights into Chris's life during this period. Sometimes homework prevents him from making more frequent updates. He also takes a break during the move from <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Richmond\" title=\"Richmond\">Midlothian</a> to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ruckersville\" title=\"Ruckersville\">Ruckersville</a>, which he says caused him <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress\" title=\"Stress\">stress</a> and a dip in inspiration, excuses which would soon become very familiar to his fans. We see that Chris was apparently very upbeat through 2000 and essentially pre-sexual, his mind focused almost exclusively on his Pokémon hobby. Only in a later update to the site, when he was 22, do we first see references to the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Lovequest\" title=\"Lovequest\">Lovequest</a>. He also assumes that his readers hang on his every word.\n</p><p>\"<b>The Archive Section!</b>\" included his earliest stuff, labeled \"October, 1999-December, 1999.\" He introduced it with, \"Finally, I am going to start on my own PokéNews section for my PokéSite.
