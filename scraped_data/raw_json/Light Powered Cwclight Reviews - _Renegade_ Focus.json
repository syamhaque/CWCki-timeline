They know how to fight for millennia in the east.\nCybertron. [Music] Hey everybody. Jesus Christi Prime here\nonce again after a little bit of a break. But yeah, today we're going to be reviewing the first of the Renegades\nthis line. Gobots Universe Renegade Focus.\nSo, here we are. And there he is. And first and foremost, as always, let's take a quick look at the packaging. So,\nbut front here we got a lovely little art of focus in both his uh spaceship\nmode and uh basic camera mode boat can hardly see the little uh thing the\nlittle lens right there but it's there. There you guys. Anyway, Transformers\nSerge is a delus class classic\ntransformers. Gobots universe renegade focus in focus on the renegade symbol.\nOn this side of the box, you got the simplistic. I knocked them over. I knocked the camera over. So now he's\ntaking a picture of the ceiling. That's funny. Anyway, so here is Focus. And uh there's his name in cyber writing right\nthere. just uh put a lot of black red just uh\nyour the warrior. And on the side of the box, you got half the lovely poster art.\nOn the bottom, you got where things barcodes and on the back of the box you have your obligatory brushes, this this\nthat the other. And you have your lovely little bio if you want to read that. And\nI just can't tell you this, that's and the other. It really gets it focused. But that's basically it for the\npackaging. And kind of just to go off topic just for a moment because I kind feel like I\nwant to talk about this just for a little bit. Just for a little bit. So I\nI I do read sometimes the complaints between the Reddit. I hardly ever go on\nthe quickie anymore, but I am I'm very aware that a lot of you Scooby-Doo\ndetectives are on there, so just stop it. But anyway, just based on just aside from that, the commentary. Oh, well the\nTransformers videos, reviews videos, you know, they're so boring. You're so bad talking about Chris Shadows playing with\nthe Transformers. Well, you know what? How many other people are on the YouTube doing the same\nthing inclus\nreviewing them and we're having a good fun time. I'm having a good time as well. It's like I've been a fan of the\nTransformer Homers, the Cybertrons, and even the Govatronians for a long time. So therefore, I wanted to do this. This\nis my thing. It's a love passion project. And in case it wasn't apparent that this was a parody, I might just\nmake that public again in a re-upload. But let's have a peek at the first intro\nwhen I did the first of these videos years ago. Roll that little clip.\nNo. So, to answer that frequently asked\nquestion, yes, parody of MGO. But you know what? I like MGO. I like these people because you know what? We're\ngeeks. We're nerds and we're proud. We do what we do. It's all good and daddy. If you don't like it, well,\nI feel sorry for you guys because it's a saying you're hating upon yourselves just being a nerd. I feel\nlike so that's aside from being just a closet\nOkaou or something. But I mean, shoot, I was there before once upon a time myself. So yeah, do not judge. It's not\ngood to judge others for things that you are yourself. Okay.\nAll right, and with that little rant out of the way, here is this lovely little focus Robo in the basic micro camera\nmode. He's just a little cute and basic in there. So, let's get a close look at the details. You got all these lovely\nlittle sticker details that just pretty much replicate the original Focus Ro. Pretty damn good. Oh, look at that.\nSpeaking of focus, well, we had there for a second, but anyway, there you go. Yeah, just look at the details on the\ndetails. There's the top of the camera. There's the bottom. There's one side.\nThere's the other. And oh yeah, there's the back. Yep. You know what? I'm just\ngoing to do this for just a moment anyway because normally you're supposed to have that head rotated, but hey, back\nof that back of the box. Back of the camera. There you go. Visible upside down head.\nHey, how you doing? There you go. Anyway, just a fun little thing. Just a fun little thing. All right.\nBut yep, basic low camera mode. And here is focus with the other with\nsome of the other camera bots and their mini camera modes between the scrap face, the refractor, and spy glass.\nNow, this little guy does come with a couple of accessories that we'll get into in just a moment. But first, let's get down to the transformation, shall\nwe? What? even get a little bit of a continued spin in the micro camera mode,\nwhich that's pretty fun. Okay, so this little toe is up. So, we'll just go ahead pull that down because we're going\nto need to do that. And we just put these down here. We got to pull them\nforward down like that. Same thing on the other side. Just doing this. This is not just a fan. This is the in the\ninstructions anyway. So, we want to make sure the waist is rotated 180 here. And these are\nstraightened out. You have these little tabs right there. They're going to go into these slots right there. So, you\njust want to rotate this and rotate that 180. And so, this will go in and plug\ninto that. Same thing on the other side. Boop.\nLittle thooping point for the little arms there.\nAnd we'll get to this bit in a little while because I'm sure you've seen some of you have seen this mold before and\nit's a very good mold. Anyway, so take these little landing gears. Then fold\nthem up and we rotate these so that the insides of legs are facing each other.\nWe'll clip those together. We'll take this little length piece and take part.\nWhat? Parts for parts for me. It's all right. It's all right. It goes right there. Goes right\nthere. However you want to rotate that. Now, we're going to bring in the accessories. So, we got these two lovely\nlittle parts right here. And we got to pull we got to pull this\nout to tie them back on this copy. And then we rotate this out. And these little\nthese two little tabs right there got to go these two little slots right there. So, there's that.\nAnd we're going to take this little pop gun here and that goes into this hole\nright here as opposed to that hole. So that Oh, wait. It's the other way. It\ngoes this way. So I follow the instructions on this. The instructions in the picture. A little squeaky of\nsecurity. Put that together. Oh, normally when I did that, I have to like wiggle it in.\nBut look at that. We got that. And then this a little bit right here. This that\nlittle piece of peg goes in that 5 port, 5 mm port. And\nnow make sure you got everything nice and secure in connections. And there you go. You have Mr. Focus in\nhis in his spaceship mode.\nspin. You can give or take whatever. But anyway, there he is in his little spaceship boat. And well,\nthat's a little spaceship. All right, but let's get in closer. Look at those details. So, you got the details on this\nlittle gun part right here. Random hair not included.\nDetails right there going on. All dipped out in silver. Got your sticker detail\ngoing on there. And on top,\nyou rarely see this in a review video, but there's a renegade symbol here.\nAnd then you got your little type edged in details on this, which is going to be\nuh another feature we'll talk about later. Just that little back piece. And then down the side\nright there. Oh, that was a very clear image of the Renegade Simple. And then yeah, there's just the back of it. Yeah,\nthere is the top. There is the bottom. And well, it does\nslide and roll. It has sliding rolling spaceships like two.\nYes. And now for comparison. Here is this little focus with\nson right there. And we'll do this as well. Just bring\nthem open. Here it is with a pair of primes\nChristian and Optabus.\nSave a little time and money in your car and shirts with\nMega and Mot Megatron and Makota\nand with Cracktor the first and Decepticone Crafter cuz they all fly\nwith Crasher.\nis bug bite.\nAnd now here's focus with some of his other fellow camera bots in their ship mode between a scrap face refractor and\nspectro. And here he is with a rarely seen\nyellow tank that goes by the name Emerlet Zon.\nAll right. So, let's get down to transformation once again, shall we? Let's encore spin. That was a bit\nbetter. All right. So, need to take this off.\nIt's a bit tight to There we go. All right. Take this off just for a moment.\nAnd yeah, I bet we can have a bit time just\nThere we go. easier. Okay. So, from this zippers, we will go ahead and fold the\ntoes out. We'll disconnect this and the legs. Flip this in. And rotate that up.\nWe'll split the legs. Rotate them this way. And we'll flip these banded gears\nin. Now we'll come back here and we'll cuff the arms off the butt like so. And we\ntake the rotate the back towards the front. We take this and rotate it so the\nelbow is facing in and then pull the hand out. Same thing on the other side.\nMy dear fingernail sometimes, but there you go. That's that thing. And then we rotate at the waist 180 to keep that\ngoing. And yep, we'll pull the head up. Make a face forward and complete the\npicture with the little lens that's on the belly. We'll get these out of the way. We'll\ncome back to those in a little bit. But yeah, there you go. There is Mr. Focus\nRobo in his robot mode. And like other certain camera bots that\nuh are along the lines, this thing is is quite the good little figure and it's\njust very very good looking. So let's get close here. And uh look at the details. Eyes up there, eyes up there.\nDecent little head, lovely little head sculpt. It's a bit of a dome head, but it works. And the rip the eyes got\nlovely little detail there. That's just basically like focus robo renegade symbol front and center front and center\nand yep going down the line. See the legs and lovely little texture right\nthere on the on the shins. The red and yellow stickers\nlove sticker detail that go on the back. Simple as it gets, but it's still very\nvery good. Yep. Now, what have we got for articulation?\nWell, I'm going to tell you. So, his head can rotate, do full 160. It's on a\nlittle bit of a ball joint. You got your wiggly waggly. Um, can down a little, a\nvery little bit, but with that transformation joint, you get to squirrel squirrel dead.\nAnd, uh, arms on that shoulder can they can move in and out. That transformation joint. And yeah, shoulder joint go\nthere. You have bicep rotation and with the uh arm you have full range ar elbow\nmovement right there and no wrist rotation but the uh hands can move\nup and down if you need them to. And you have waist rotation.\nI do this but yeah legs move forward that far and back that far outward. Yep.\ncan do the full splits. No problem. You have thigh rotation and well, you get 90\ndegrees of knee movement. And uh feet cannot move up, but the toes can move down. And you have all kinds of tiltage.\nOkay. So, let's run through that lovely little pair of accessories now. So, got\nthe little got this gun here. You see the on the ship boat, all the detail and everything. And you got this right here.\nIt's essentially a shield. A little bit of a silver right there. Lots of more\ndetail. There's the uh backside for you. And of course uh he\ncan wield the shield and he can wield his gun cuz he's just a\nuh soldier. And yeah, he can P bag\nshield bash and all that good stuff right there. But then yes, that love this lovely little gun is Bruce\ncomparable. Yes, that is connectet. That is absolutely 100% connectet. So, yep,\nwe're going to take that head as good as we can with the elbow joint here. There we go. And now we're going to have a\nlovely focus renegaden brush.\nToo much bush add a good fair amount of focus.\nAnd yes, he has ports in the bottom of his on the bottoms of his feet and on his shoulders, those forearms. So you\ncan take your weaponizers and loos it up to your heart's content.\nAnd now for parallel. We'll get these two out of the way. So here is focus\nrobot with sonu bit more.\nThere you go. with\nChristian Prime and with another Prime who is an Optimus. His\nname was Optimus.\nAnd here is this Focus rubber with Gwen Makoto and\nthe bigs. The bags. Come on, Master. Where's the psycho?\nWhere is the psycho and the cop door?\nAnd here he is with Cracktor first\nand Decepticone Cracktor. [Music]\nAnd here he is with his fellow Renegades Crasher and Bug Bite. And yeah, but I\ndefinitely need the weaponizer kicks to actually stand up to even deluxe class height. He got really the short end of\nthe stick with that one.\nAnd here is Focus leading the refractor, the scrap face, spectral viewfinder, and\nspy glass into a battle as like a bunch of pawns would go into battle.\nHere he is with book legend Ember Zaron\nright there. If you don't know who he is, bey has got you covered on the basics.\nAnd this one will do as well, but we'll kind of like just splice this in. So, but here he is with the original Focus\nRobo because it's precious. So precious and I don't own a copy of\nthis oldfashioned figure. brushes. So, there you go.\nBut wait, there is more. Because if it was not obvious in the back of the box,\nI mean, yep, you got one little standalone micro camera here. But how about if you want the bigger full-on\ncamera? That's where they make you buy multiples. As it wasn't clear in the music video, yep, we have more than one\nright here. We have more than one bit of focus. And the top part, yeah, needle\nlens, the lens, the mini lens, you can just put that in this little port right here on the button. It's all good. But,\nuh, but yeah, at least you got that storage towel. Oh, storage. I forgot to\nmention storage. So, yeah, you can put your weapons here on the ports on the arms or shoulders. You got that going\non. And of course, you have mil ports on the feet. So, yeah. But yeah, you get\nthree of these. You can make the big old camera. So, let's get down to showing that off.\nSip these two right here. I'll transform this one for you. So, we lay this up\nfront. Now, we're going to rotate the head 180. And they're going to rotate\nthat back. And we flip the hands in. Flip both\nhands in. And then we rotate this. We rotate the\narm a little bit outward. and just kind of get them uh here like so. And same\nthing on the other side. Just rotate that port in the back. Flip that up. And then flip it up like so. So they're\nabout like that. We're going to rotate the waist 180.\nAnd we're going to rotate the legs. So they're facing like this. Clip them\ntogether. And pull these out. And then we get both of these up here. Make sure\nboth these go to these these forearms. Go into the gaps right here nice and\nsecure. You may need to just do a little work, but it's definitely doable. It can\nbe done. And there you go. You essentially have a box. It's a box. So,\ngoing to go off screen transform these other two. So, we'll be right back. Follow this short little bit. Nothing.\nAnd we're back. Got both transformed the little boxes. Yep. So, you know, you take I took the little thing from this\none. I put it up top here and this one because we're going to take the other one and we're putting it on the other\nside of this one cuz this one's going in the center. And well, what we're doing\nis we're putting these three boxes together. They rotate this way. So, you got this little\nplug right here. It's going to go into the slot right there. And port plug slot\nplug slot. And they just all combine and connect together nice and firmly. And same thing on the\nflip side. Get that going on.\nAnd you have put these feet up to make it flash. And you basically have this\ncamera. But there's four to be done because we got to use all these all these. Three of each. You\ntake one, you cut these out. Each one got a tab and there's a slot and connect\nthem together. Take these three.\nAnd these will this slot these little tabs will go into each of these three\nslots right here on the on the piece.\nAnd there you have the tripod. And then we're going to form the lens\nwith these. So I have I use repo labels. And then we\ngot decals. Got these lovely little accurate decals to help make it a bit easier.\nAnd then obviously we just clip these together. We have uh this tab right here\nthat goes over that other tab right there. This tab that go slot there. Doing that with this last one as you can\nsee. Pop that in. And you have these two slots right there. I'm going to bring it\ncloser. And you got all these tabs. And just however you want to rotate this\ncamera to set the dial. Put that in. Oh, and also I like putting\nthese up. So you got the center of the camera. But yeah, there you go. Smile. You're on focus camera. Every single one\nof you. Yep. There he is. Focus Robo or trio of them in their full on big camera\nmode. And doesn't that look just fantastic just as pretty much as you can tell. So,\nlet's get closer. Look at the details. Smile. You're on camera again.\nYep. You got a little flash right there. There's upgrade kits available if you want to give it a bear flash and the thing in the middle and like a little\neven this little optional thing goes in the front like one of the the reflectors\nviewfinder spy glass. That's the trio of individuals as opposed to a trio or reflector or trio of scrap faces. Yeah.\nYep. There's all this fluffy little camera goodness going on right here all around. Let's get that out of here.\nLet's do this. All this detail going on. And well,\nthere you go. Now you can see the through this viewfinder here. I say that with air quotes. Yep. Camera. There is\nthe top. And there is the bottom without the tripod. It slides like cameras tend\nto slide. All right. We're sliding. Gliding tripoding\npicture. We'll be taking cameras\nand of course what else are we gonna compare focus in the full big camera\nmode with but then with all the other camera and I can hear the photographer\nand the audience amongst you say well you can never have too many cameras now\nthat's really in focus and here's a little spliced up compar\ncomparison between the camera modes between this Focus Robo and the OG Focus\nRobo because it's precious. Also classic but precious.\nSo there you go. And just for as a fun little bonus, how about a whole long\nconga line of them put together? Huh? Look at that.\nSo much fun. Hey, MGO and other reviewers, do you\nactually have enough of these to make a long line of spitting goodness?\nWell, there you go. My man's spin and I win. So, yeah, there you have it. This\nis a good old renegade focus. And uh yeah, quite the fun figure or figures if\nyou get bored of one to uh make up the uh full camera, but just funosability.\nIt just uh I'm a fan of this mold and it works. Just works all around. And hey,\nit's one obscure gobot that end up making it into the mainline Transformers\nHall of Fame. And there's more to come when they bring in later Ron Psycho and the rest of the group. I still like\nScooter. Hey, I believe Mirage be proud of him and his hologram techniques. Anyway, so\naside for that, just yeah, fun figure.\nBut yeah, there you go. Now, I got this from Big Bad Toy Store. I'll put like their website in the description down\nbelow. And of course, if you missed any of the reviews for this line, I'll put the link in the description down below.\nAnd uh yeah, I think that's uh pretty much it as we uh take a look from behind\nthe camera and uh move on up a little bit. But yeah, that is the Transformers\nLegacy Diverge Renegade Focus.\nAnd this is Jesus Christ Prime saying remember you don't stop playing because you grow old. You grow up because you\nstop playing. Pick be proud. F.\nAll right. Well, I'm glad we could get these details about Makoto's portal and space bridge. Yeah, especially since we\nneed to take that down as soon as possible so that Makoto cannot do any damage to our timeline. Right, you are\nSonu. Okay, everybody. So, essentially, we need to go in and destroy that space\nbridge. I've scanned the entirety of Makoto's base. And I do believe that the\nbest entrances would be to the south and the west because they're closest to mountain ranges and forest. So we could\nsneak in. Are you sure about that, Chris? Considering the amount of decepts\nall around the building, whether we go north, south, east, west, or above, maybe even underground. Su is right. And\neven from my scans of the facility and of the safe bridge there in progress, it's still quite a fortitude. Even if\nit's just Nevada car factory and I have seen worse car factories facilities within the fifth layer below goatron\nperhaps so Torque but between you and the secret raiders I'm certain we are able to achieve success in making sure\nthat Makoto does not mess with our timeline at all whatsoever and based on what we experience and see we know very\nwell than to let anything leak through those more subtle cracks when it comes to GB Makakota\nI am very privy to all your spying tricks, Makoto. And of course, that goes the same to you, Focus Robo. I have not\nbroken so many fourth walls just to end up being ignorant of the cameras that\ncome around me and everybody else, even above the other Christians and Christ shout out the multiverse. And this is\ndefinitely a statement to every single shutter bug that goes in these Bigfoot huts that should no longer be happening\nwhatsoever because enough is enough.\nEvery focus robot retreat back to base. There's so happened since you see what\nshe did to scrap face. Probably hard. Don't let those gadgets get away. Come back here. You Torque. No, don't go\nafter them. But why Prime? There's no telling what information those bunch of focus robos got from us. Rather our damn\nbase or for what they recorded just now. Yes, of course, Torque. But at least they don't know the extent of how we are\ngoing to invade their base. All they managed to get out of us is just our attention on infiltrating their base,\ndestroying the space bridge. And there was just no doubt in my mind whatsoever that Dakota would be inspecting us. So\nat this point, we just But all they got was a false lead. They think we're going to enter from the south and the west.\nWell, we're entering from the north and the east. They're not going to see us coming for the other directions. Go\nChristian Pride. Always knowing what the enemy is expecting of us and we expected\nthem. It's like you're definitely psychic, right? Aren't you? At least we know my intuition is definitely good and\non point, so it's always good to go by. Now, with those sharp bugs out of the way, here is our plan. And I'm glad I\ndid not say anything beforehand and typing on torren 1.\nThis information you brought me is worse than Russian energy. Tell me something I don't already know.\nOf course, Prime is going to come over here with her Autobots and take down our space bridge. That's been made more\nobvious since they took away the intel away from our Decepticons.\nHey, what you brought back here is essentially well somewhat worked out,\nbut apparently the details of Christian Prime's matrix\nwas intellin.\nWe don't know what's going on in there. All we know is just essentially the physical details of the mechanics of the\nmatrix. But looks like we might actually be able to make do with this. We'll have to keep\nall our defenses heavy from all sides at this point. But we'll put some focus on\nthe south and the west just to be safe. Isn't that right? Focus.\nRight. Yes, ma'am. Though a lot of the intel that we managed to download from their total tren one is just nothing new\nand nothing that we could actually use to take that take Christian Prime down. We managed to make progress in\nconfirming what they now know from us. And with a limited amount of time beforehand before they tend to show up,\nwe can actually use this to our advantage. Maybe actually rewrite our\nown files within the computers and maybe do something with the space bridge\nfor once. Lonely camera bots, you make a\ngood point. If only there was a way that we actually could manifest something\nthat was a copy of our space bridge within mere seconds, within mere\nminutes. But we can't. What we have now, the space bridge cannot can only get us\nto one side of the earth to the other at this point. And it's not going to give us much. And it's not like Megatron or\nPsycho have any space bridges to spare. We'll just have to put our extra card up\nas quick as we can. Crasher, get left, SAP, and Cracktor to lead the team this\ntime. Put some of them all around. Put some of them on the rooftops. Put some of them on the ice side to put them in\non the south side. We're going to get every single wing box that comes in before they can even make a step in\n[Music]\ntransformers. Transformers\nmeets the eye. Go transformers.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Transcript\">Transcript</span></h3>\n<center>\n<table cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"background-color:transparent; border:3px outset #bb2222\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:CWCism-IllBreakYouDead.png\"><img alt=\"CWCism-IllBreakYouDead.png\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"113\" src=\"/w/images/0/05/CWCism-IllBreakYouDead.png\" width=\"150\"/></a>\n</td>\n<td><i> This media needs a <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCki:Transcription_Style\" title=\"CWCki:Transcription Style\">transcript</a>.
