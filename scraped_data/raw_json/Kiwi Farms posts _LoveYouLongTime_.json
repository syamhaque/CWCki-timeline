Lo and behold, the neighbor goes looking for their dog and winds up at the Chandler's. From what I remember, they put up a fight to keep the dog and blamed the neighbor for being irresponsible. Basically, finders keepers. Neighbor still got their dog back. But Chris couldn't comprehend why it was wrong for them to try and keep the dog.

As it's safe to tell this part of the story since I no longer have the vehicle and license plate tag, back then when he first discovered alcohol we were at the Mexican restaurant. The parking lot was really small. As we were leaving he just happened to be parked next to me. Later that night I did a call and he repeated my license plate back to me and asked me what it meant. Panicking, we got the guy playing as my boyfriend to get on the line to scare the shit out of Chris into forgetting my license plate.\n<p>Lesson learned, I always made the effort to park farther away even if it meant in another lot and just walked.\n</p><p>I'm curious what restaurant he chose, anyone know?\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Boyfriend_Character\">Boyfriend Character</span></h2>\n<p>23 July 2020<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-boyfriend_18-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-boyfriend-18\">[18]</a></sup>\n</p><p>In response to a user's comment, \"I notice his hyperfocus is pretty selective with women.

It worked most of the time and when he would overstep his boundaries we had said boyfriend get on the line to spook him. He would metaphorically go into hedgehog defense mode. It also worked to our advantage if we wanted him to do something and he was more inclined to do it if I fed him a story about how me and the boyfriend were fighting.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Introducing_Chris_to_Friend\">Introducing Chris to Friend</span></h2>\n<p>23 July 2020<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-boyfriend_18-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-boyfriend-18\">[18]</a></sup>\n</p><p>A user asked LoveYouLongTime to describe the friend visit.\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #edf2ce; border:1px dotted #4b5320; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>A friend was coming to visit from out of town and he had been such a huge fan of Sonichu for a long time(kek). I never planned to hang out with Chris ever again but I figured it would be a last good hoorah and as a treat to my friend. So I set up it up and we met at The Tea Bazaar. Another friend came along as well. Chris showed up looking like he got dressed in a Goodwill with his eyes closed with his damn Sonichu medallions and tacky ass arm bands and braclets.\n<p>Introductions included introducing us to Magichan and I think Mewtwo who were supposed to be sitting in some empty seating. Afterwards, almost fucking immediately he pulled out this fairly large pouch from under his shirt which was around his neck. He dumped the contents out on the table which were a bunch of crystals and rocks. For the next agonizing half hour+ he picked up every single one to tell us what it was and what \"properties\" it had. No matter how hard we tried to change the subject he immediately went back to powering through his rock collection. Nothing would deter him. Eventually the rock lecture ended and we were free to steer the conversation elsewhere.\n</p><p>He gifted me a copy of one of his comics and an amethyst stone which I later gave my friend because I didn't need those cursed items in my house. Most of the conversation was him talking about the other dimension and his powers. He bragged about how he was able to produce electricity with his hand, in which he held out his hand in a claw like manor, the concentration on his face akin to that of an infant trying to pass a hard poop. Then he asked if we could see it which we didn't indulge him and told him no. His response was along the lines of \"Mmm, okay.\"\n</p><p>He told me he was able to produced sparks with his magical highschool ring when he struck it against some stone on his bracelet. I told him the stone in his ring was chipped from doing that. My friend humored him a little bit asking him questions about toon world. Friend kept using words like Armageddon and the apolocalypse which Chris didn't like. Friend also compared him to Robotnik which he got mad at.\n</p><p>Honestly, I zoned out a lot of the time because really, Chris is fucking boring. He's an entertaining novelty for about 30 minutes. Longer than that, you start to wonder why you put yourself in that situation.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<div
