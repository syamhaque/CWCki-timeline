I am looking to expand, officially, and in person/face-to-face; not long-distant over the internet. (Too many phonies and fakers)\n<p>I still reside with my mother and our dogs and cats, and we have a slew of financial problems, alongside a number of being the victim of internet trolls, blackmail and deception, and so forth, that have long emotionally and mentally scarred me greatly. My creativity has been affected, and the only resolve, I feel, is less worries hanging over my head.  And the home finances are a start that I'd like very much to resolve, including the mortgage and debts. And that is why I am here on Patreon, to hopefully free our household of all that financial stress and find better peace of mind for myself to better be able to create again.\n</p>\n<ul><li><ul><li>The $250,000.00 Goal is the full amount goal; I had not intended to that to be a Montly Amount, but the altogether Goal, in general.

Pledge an incredible amount of money and you will be allowed to make <b>1 video request</b>, and it must adhere to Chris's strict guidelines. Even someone donating a small fortune every month isn't allowed the freedom to request a video on what they want.\n</p><p>It is also worth noting that donators giving $50 or more every month will be allowed to add Chris on Skype. This will give <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Weening\" title=\"Weening\">weens</a> who enjoy burning money to have \"direct\" contact with Chris, however it is unknown just how frequently he uses Skype, if at all. More likely, his inbox will just be filled up with hundreds of JUUULLLAYYYs and other nonsense that will just be ignored when he signs into Skype.\n</p><p>Prior to revamping his rewards, he had been receiving $28 per month from 4 patrons<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup>, with two of them subscribing to the $10 tier.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]</a></sup>\n</p><p>The Rewards:\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>\n<p><b>$10 or more per month</b>\n</p>\n<ul><li>My most grateful thanks for this minimum support; can't offer much else on this level.
