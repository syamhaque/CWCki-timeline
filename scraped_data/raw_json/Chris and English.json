Additionally, he uses obscure constructs that may be grammatically correct, but are also unnecessarily wordy, confusing, semantically vague, or atypical. Other habits, such as his use of \"y'all,\" \"ain't,\" dropped G's (running pronounced runnin'), and double negatives, are clear markers of his <a href=\"/cwcki/Virginia\" title=\"Virginia\">Southeastern</a> regional accent. Still others are just plain nonsensical, at least without prior knowledge of his <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/idiolect\" title=\"wikipedia:idiolect\">idiolect</a>. \n</p><p>Chris spent years of his childhood mute, and took speech therapy classes at <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/James_Madison_University\" title=\"James Madison University\">James Madison University</a>. Strangely, his grasp of English actually appears to have grown weaker as he's become older, presumably due to his increased isolation, which has affected his English in general, as well as his broader grasp on <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_language\" title=\"Chris and language\">linguistic communication</a>. \n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#CWC-isms\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">CWC-isms</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Written_language\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Written language</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Spelling\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Spelling</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Typos\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Typos</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Definitions_and_vocabulary\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Definitions and vocabulary</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Repetition\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Repetition</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Piecemeal_language_use\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.4.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Piecemeal language use</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Semantics\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Semantics</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#Muddled-up_proverbs\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Muddled-up proverbs</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Literal_interpretations\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Literal interpretations</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#Rhetorical_comparisons_and_sarcasm\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Rhetorical comparisons and sarcasm</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#Questions_and_suggestions\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.2.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Questions and suggestions</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-13\"><a href=\"#Television_jargon\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Television jargon</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-14\"><a href=\"#Backwards_spelling\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Backwards spelling</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-15\"><a href=\"#Other_strange_points\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Other strange points</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-16\"><a href=\"#The_spoken_word\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The spoken word</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-17\"><a href=\"#Idiosyncrasies\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Idiosyncrasies</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-18\"><a href=\"#Profanity\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Profanity</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-19\"><a href=\"#Virginia_is_for_Virgin_Ears\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Virginia is for Virgin Ears</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-20\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-21\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"CWC-isms\">CWC-isms</span></h2>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC-isms\" title=\"CWC-isms\">CWC-isms</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>Chris has a tendency to make up his own words for things, then use them with reckless abandon while assuming whoever is reading or listening will be able to understand exactly what he means. As such, we get terms like \"B-dog\" and \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Noviophobia\" title=\"Noviophobia\">noviophobia</a>.\" He also tends to re-appropriate existing words and phrases, giving them new meanings based entirely on his own skewed logic. This is why, in Chris-speak, <a href=\"/cwcki/Semen\" title=\"Semen\">comeuppance</a> isn't a fitting outcome for someone's deeds, and <a href=\"/cwcki/China\" title=\"China\">china</a> isn't an <a href=\"/cwcki/Punchy_Sonichu\" title=\"Punchy Sonichu\">Asian</a> nation.\n</p><p>In the case of words like the definite article \"da,\" Chris might be trying to make a pass at using slang to sound casual and relaxed, but instead, he ends up sounding like a marketing executive desperately grasping for credibility. Other famous CWC-isms like \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tobacky\" title=\"Tobacky\">tobacky</a>,\" \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Niggos\" title=\"Niggos\">niggos</a>,\" and \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Gaybian\" title=\"Gaybian\">gaybian</a>\" are the result of a different problem altogether: Chris is a manchild who can't even say out loud the names of objects or concepts which he finds <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">repulsive</a>, so he is forced to come up with euphemisms for these terms, which range from <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Navy\" title=\"Navy\">confusing puns</a> to changing a single letter in a word, barely altering it's pronunciation (i.e. niggos). The use of these terms is a prime example of his immaturity.\n</p><p>These CWC-isms combine with his <a href=\"/cwcki/Speech_impediment\" title=\"Speech impediment\">speech impediment</a> and his accent to form an unholy trifecta that defines his speech. With the constant stream of half-words and repetition, it is sometimes difficult to understand what exactly he is talking about. Any resemblance to actual English is tenuous at best; the words he uses are English, but the structure is far from proper. The fact that his vocabulary is a bit lacking only compounds the situation.\n</p>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">if I could have it my way, I'd make it <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">illegal and forbidden to have homo Men; women are safe</a>.

Also of note is that Chris wants to make it illegal to use a word a certain way, which is staggeringly <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_hypocrisy\" title=\"Chris and hypocrisy\">hypocritical</a> given that, as aforementioned, he often ascribes his own, nonsensical meanings to existing words and phrases.\n</p><p>His own lexicon, like many other aspects of his personality, demonstrates exactly <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_Ego\" title=\"Chris and his Ego\">how self-centered he is</a>. While the whole purpose of language is to communicate thoughts and ideas to other people, he has managed to turn his vocabulary into a brick wall, by crafting a mashed-together lexicon that makes sense only to him.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Written_language\">Written language</span></h2>\n<p>Chris's writing is a complete mess from top to bottom, to put it lightly.\n</p><p>For starters, he doesn't understand basic syntax and semantics: he uses words in the wrong context, or as incorrect parts of speech. His grammar is also, predictably, abhorrent. For example, he refers to <a href=\"/cwcki/ShecameforCWC.JPG\" title=\"ShecameforCWC.JPG\">fingering</a> as \"<a href=\"/cwcki/CWC-isms#O\" title=\"CWC-isms\">outtercourse</a>,\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup> which incorrectly replaces the supposed prefix <i>in-</i>—which leaves <i>tercourse</i>, which is not a word at all—while the correct prefix is <i>inter-</i>, meaning \"between.\" (Incidentally, \"outercourse\" is an actual colloquialism meaning <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-penetrative_sex\" title=\"wikipedia:Non-penetrative sex\">dry-humping</a>, not fingering.) Similarly, <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_52\" title=\"Mailbag 52\">the infamous stock reply used to address Mailbag entries</a> includes \"inputed\" as the past participle of <i>input</i>; the correct word is either <i>input</i> or <i>inputted</i>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Chris often misuses punctuation in many ways, with comedic results. In particular, he tends not to use hyphens when they're needed, but for some reason also add hyphens where they <i>aren't</i> needed, such as in his stock phrase \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart_from_the_Ground-Up\" title=\"Sweetheart from the Ground-Up\">Sweetheart from the Ground-Up</a>.\" Clearly he means that he wants to create a relationship from the \"ground up.\" A literal interpretation, though, means he wants to create a girlfriend from something that's been ground up—coffee, cinnamon, pepper, etc. Another prominent example is him writing \"rest assured\" as \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Twitter#17_July_2010\" title=\"Twitter\">rest-assured</a>\" as if it were a hyphenated phrase and not an imperative statement. \n</p><p>Because Chris feels the need to type things precisely as he would say them, and worries that he will be misunderstood in print, he makes heavy usage of repetition and a distinctive <a href=\"/cwcki/BILLY_MAYS\" title=\"BILLY MAYS\">ALL CAPS</a> style, comparable to the style used in comic books and graphic novels, which have no doubt influenced him. He also tends to Capitalize Words At Random (a common literary trait among Autistics), especially Nouns and those which hold Importance to the sentence, or the ones that address Important Abstract Concepts that Chris tries to systematically understand on account of finding them too Complex and Mystifying, similar to the Old Grammatical Laws of the Middle <a href=\"/cwcki/Pre-1980#Pre-1900\" title=\"Pre-1980\">1800s</a>. Also owing to his highly recitative manner of writing, he often adds letters to words to emphasize them. While this on its own is not something unique to Chris, most other people would write \"sooo\" instead of \"so,\" for example. Chris, however, would only add one \"o\" to make \"soo,\" which is rather amusing when read phonetically as it makes him sound like a stereotypical <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tomgirl\" title=\"Tomgirl\">effeminate</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">homosexual</a>.\n</p>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">And the ONLY REASON <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Virgin\" title=\"Virgin\">I have not had sex yet</a> in my lifetime WITH A WOMAN yet, is because the WHOLE TIME, I have been SHY; kept down with the Personal Fear of nearly EVERY Woman I see being Already Paired-Up with a Boyfriend.\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:11px; padding:0 0 0 16px; vertical-align:bottom; width:20px\">”\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\" style=\"font-size:smaller; padding:8px 36px; text-align:right;\"><cite>Chris proving that he never proofreads.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup></cite>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>Beyond these basic issues of grammar and capitalization, Chris's writings often lack focus. Much like a child, he has trouble concentrating on a single topic for extended periods of time, and he'll often veer off topic in order to babble about <a href=\"/cwcki/Random-access_humor\" title=\"Random-access humor\">whatever is on his mind</a>. This practice of writing stream-of-consciousness style, combined with his obvious disinterest in proofreading, or otherwise checking over what he's written, inevitably results in a large number of confusing run-on sentences, and a copious amount of text in general (especially in the comics). A single sentence might cover multiple topics, often ones that don't have anything to do with the original subject matter. It doesn't help that Chris feels it's his obligation to be \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Honest\" title=\"Honest\">honest</a>,\" which means that he feels the need to mention irrelevant little details, as anything less would mean he's not telling the whole truth. It gives his writing a rambling, disjointed feeling, and makes it very difficult to understand exactly what his point is.\n</p><p>Chris has demonstrated particular ineptitude in his usage of semicolons. Semicolons are usually used to connect two independent clauses together without a conjunction, and whatever succeeds a semicolon should be pertinent to whatever immediately preceded it. Chris, however, uses them to crudely string together two (or more) tangentially-related thoughts into a sentence that is consequently incoherent to anyone and which causes confusion as to what Chris even means in the first place. Chris also frequently misuses the semicolon in character dialogue, using it where he should use a full stop (period) or something else entirely.\n</p>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">...while the Movie Women are \"Just Characters,\" <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu\" title=\"Rosechu\">Rosechu</a> is playing as her own \"Character\" as well.

Despite a myriad of other problems with Chris's writing, his poor spelling somehow manages to stand out. He has many rigid, totally consistent habits which he never corrects, such as substituting \"ein\" for \"eni,\" as in \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Seinor_prom\" title=\"Seinor prom\">seinor</a>\" (senior) and \"geinus\" (<a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_1\" title=\"Sonichu 1\">genius</a>).

This largely goes to show that Chris's ability to spell correctly is so noticeably poor that when he <i>deliberately</i> misspells something, it goes unnoticed for <i>years</i>.\n</p><p>In 2014, when he started dating the British-affiliated <a href=\"/cwcki/Catherine\" title=\"Catherine\">Catherine</a>, Chris arbitrarily began to use British spellings, especially of the word \"colour,\" since this was particularly relevant to his <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_Boom_Protests\" title=\"Sonic Boom Protests\">protest du jour</a>. By March 2015, he was still using these spellings, using the dumb excuse that he was of <a href=\"/cwcki/Anne_Boleyn\" title=\"Anne Boleyn\">British</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Daniel_Weston\" title=\"Daniel Weston\">ancestry</a>. He has been observed to (inconsistently) use U.K. English spellings as recently as <a href=\"/cwcki/May_2022\" title=\"May 2022\">May 2022</a> in <a href=\"/cwcki/Jail_Letter_-_11_May_2022\" title=\"Jail Letter - 11 May 2022\">his letter</a> to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Kengle\" title=\"Kengle\">Kengle</a> following his return to <a href=\"/cwcki/Central_Virginia_Regional_Jail\" title=\"Central Virginia Regional Jail\">Central Virginia Regional Jail</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Typos\">Typos</span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Sonichu_Typos.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"137\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/b/bb/Sonichu_Typos.jpg/300px-Sonichu_Typos.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/b/bb/Sonichu_Typos.jpg/450px-Sonichu_Typos.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/b/bb/Sonichu_Typos.jpg/600px-Sonichu_Typos.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Sonichu_Typos.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>More perfect spelling from <s>Mr.</s> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tomgirl\" title=\"Tomgirl\">Miss</a> Chandler.</div></div></div>\n<p>The above spelling problem is only compounded by Chris's constant typos. The very first sentence on the first page of the comic contains the word \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_0\" title=\"Sonichu 0\">mies</a>\" in place of \"miles.\" And even when he edits pages that contain these mistakes and has a chance to fix them, he invariably misses them a second time, like \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_7\" title=\"Sonichu 7\">dood</a>\" instead of \"good\" in issue seven.\n</p><p>The fact that these typos exist only goes to prove that Chris does not bother to proofread his works even a single time after completion and prior to uploading them to the Internet. And assuming that he has read his own comic at some point or another, and that someone <b>must</b> have drawn his attention to these mistakes at some point, the only logical conclusion is that Chris can not be bothered to go back and fix these typos even when he is aware of them.\n</p><p>Chris acknowledged these spelling mistakes in a <a href=\"/cwcki/July_2017_tweets#Improvement\" title=\"July 2017 tweets\">tweet</a> on <a href=\"/cwcki/July_2017\" title=\"July 2017\">July 2017</a>, claiming that the typos are \"etched in history forever.\"\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Definitions_and_vocabulary\">Definitions and vocabulary</span></h3>\n<p>Chris has a very bad habit of not knowing what he's talking about, and this is readily observable in his <b>vocabulary</b> – beyond the above <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC-isms\" title=\"CWC-isms\">CWC-isms</a>. Chris still believes the word \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Na%C3%AFve\" title=\"Naïve\">naïve</a>\" means stupid, and thus hates being called it. Naïve, in simple terms, means \"ignorance or gullibility because of a lack of experience.\" Therefore, this word accurately describes Chris because he doesn't do anything, and because of that he's gullible and ignorant. Another word Chris throws around with wild abandon is \"slander.\" Chris constantly calls his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/ED\" title=\"ED\">ED</a> page and the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCki\" title=\"CWCki\">CWCki</a> slanderous. Slander is defamation. Defamation is the destruction of reputation or character through manipulation of video, photographic, and audio evidence. Libel is like slander, but is defamation through writing. \n</p><p>There's two things wrong with Chris's use of slander. His ED page and the CWCki consist of more written material than videos, photographs and audio, so if it was anything it would be libel. The other is that the ED page and CWCki are neither slander nor libel, because nothing on them is manipulated and everything on them is <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/True_and_Honest\" title=\"True and Honest\">true</a>, and backed up with evidence <a href=\"/cwcki/Honest_Content\" title=\"Honest Content\">provided by none other than Chris himself</a>.\n</p><p>Related to his choice of vocabulary, Chris has an issue with using terms that, while technically meaning similar things, have different tones. This is perhaps most evident in <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_10\" title=\"Sonichu 10\">Sonichu 10</a>, where Chris uses the term \"bearing false witness\" multiple times. In the context Chris uses the term, he's simply using it as an alternate way of saying \"lying\" or \"misrepresenting,\" as the Biblical term is often simplified when explaining the Ten Commandments to children. Chris fails to realize that the term is more or less exclusively associated with the Bible and using it when discussing himself makes the characters sound like they're referring to Chris as their god, although <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_Religion#Delusions_of_Godhood?\" title=\"Chris and Religion\">this may have</a> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ego\" title=\"Ego\">been intentional</a>. Likewise, the Asperchu characters claim to have been forced to \"make a false idol of the brown-shirted one\" even though in Asperchu, the protagonists merely respect their creator, rather than worship him. Again, the use of Biblical terminology makes the whole thing seem even more narcissistic.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Repetition\">Repetition</span></h3>\n<p>Chris frequently repeats himself verbatim, which does little except to gradually annoy whoever he's addressing. This is most apparent in his <a href=\"/cwcki/Attraction_Sign\" title=\"Attraction Sign\">Attraction Sign</a> but has cropped up in numerous other places. He frequently describes his ideal girl as a \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Boyfriend-free_girl\" title=\"Boyfriend-free girl\">boyfriend-free girl</a> to make into a Sweetheart from the Ground-Up.\" This clunky phrasing is reiterated in almost every iteration of the sign, both online and off. He makes copious usage of his \"joke\" that \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Dating_Education\" title=\"Dating Education\">Date ed</a>\" sounds \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_9\" title=\"Sonichu 9\">dated</a>\" and has repeatedly blamed the <a href=\"/cwcki/Infinitely-High_Boyfriend-Factor\" title=\"Infinitely-High Boyfriend-Factor\">Infinitely-High Boyfriend-Factor</a> for his woes. This repetition is not limited to his written communication; for example, he has often described his <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler\" title=\"Bob Chandler\">father</a> as having \"starting more arguments than flies in a garbage dump,\" notably in his <a href=\"/cwcki/Father_Call\" title=\"Father Call\">phone conversation with Kacey's father</a>. During the <a href=\"/cwcki/2008\" title=\"2008\">2008</a> election, Bob joked to Chris that Obama would paint the White House black if he was elected. Chris <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">seemed to take this literally</a>, incorporated the joke into <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_8\" title=\"Sonichu 8\">Sonichu 8</a>, and even got his father to sign the page, and years later, he still occasionally talked about the former President repainting the White House.\n</p><p>Clearly, something about these exact phrases causes Chris to reuse them over and over, verbatim, when describing the same problem in different conversations and contexts. It is tempting to just blame his autism for this repetition, which is likely a factor; however, much like his life in general, not all of his failures at communication can be the product of his autism —  other possibilities include that:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Chris struggles to form sentences, and when he does so \"successfully,\" he tends to reuse what he knows is (or believes to be) a working formula.</li>\n<li>Chris mistakenly thinks his peculiar constructions are funny and uses them to get a laugh, much like his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Christian%27s_sex_joke\" title=\"Christian's sex joke\">one original joke</a>.</li>\n<li>Chris is so lazy that he literally copy/pastes text (or simply copies in the case of non-digital media) from his earlier screeds and manifestos into his new ones.</li>\n<li>Chris is simply so <a href=\"/cwcki/Things_Chris_has_ripped_off\" title=\"Things Chris has ripped off\">terminally unimaginative</a> that he cannot think of more than one way to express a given idea.</li></ul>\n<p>Given what we know about Chris, any or all of the above are possibilities. A large number of the phrases that are collectively known as \"<a href=\"/cwcki/CWC-isms\" title=\"CWC-isms\">CWC-isms</a>\" follow the above pattern.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Piecemeal_language_use\">Piecemeal language use</span></h4>\n<p>Chris's phrase usage is a deep-seated issue, to the point that it's almost possible to imagine that he copies all of his phrases from <i>somewhere</i>, even when he has not used the phrase previously. People usually learn idioms from other people when they hear them in an appropriate context, but though Chris may experience such a context, it will often fly straight over his head, and accordingly he has problems fully understanding the meaning of the phrase. Like most of us, he has obviously learned some phrases from the world around him, and he <i>sort of</i> understands what they mean and <i>sort of</i> uses them in the correct context. Despite this, it is as if he just learned the phrases, and, like some foreign English student, is making the first awkward steps towards using them properly. Unlike those curious foreigners, however, Chris is not worried about getting punched in the face by the natives for abusing beloved idioms.\n</p><p>To an outside observer, many of Chris's phrases almost always appear out of place and tacked on. This can manifest itself in even very small examples, such as in the video title \"<a href=\"/cwcki/New_Address\" title=\"New Address\">New Address</a>\"; the video isn't about any sort of an address change, as the phrase was intended to imply, but rather is an <i>address</i> to a specific individual, one that is <i>newly released</i>. It is akin to a foreigner opening a phrasebook, finding the entry \"New Address,\" and saying \"OK, that is probably close enough--it has 'new' and 'address' in it.\"\n</p><p>For more blatant examples, in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_and_Tito_PS3_E-mails\" title=\"Clyde and Tito PS3 E-mails\">Clyde and Tito PS3 E-mails</a>, Chris continually demands \"Legal, Unmark[ed], Non-consecutive\" bills to be mailed to him. He probably thinks it's the sort of thing people <i>generally</i> say when they want cash mailed to them, without realizing that he has picked this expression up from crime fiction where that kind of phrase is said as part of a ransom demand. Also, when listing his definitely ancient television on <a href=\"/cwcki/Craigslist\" title=\"Craigslist\">Craigslist</a>, he demands \"CASH ONLY, And Up-Front. $250 or better offer; NO HAGGLE.\" which doesn't apply at all to something like an old TV, and directly contradicts his very own offer. Regarding \"No haggle\" or a \"better offer,\" it is clear he has no clue what \"haggle\" even means. He most likely picked up the jargon from other entries on the site.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Semantics\">Semantics</span></h2>\n<p>As demonstrated in CWC-isms above, Chris has severe problems understanding the meanings of words and just about anything even marginally abstract or metaphorical. A Facebook status reveals that, through unknown means, he has come to believe that \"empirical\" means \"rejecting scientific methods of knowing,\" which is more or less the opposite of the word's actual meaning. Since his source for this is listed as Jeremy Hilary Boob, Ph.D., a character in <i><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Submarine_(film)\" title=\"wikipedia:Yellow Submarine (film)\">Yellow Submarine</a></i>, perhaps this odd idea came from content in the <a href=\"/cwcki/100_2269\" title=\"100 2269\">Beatles Edition of <i>Rock Band</i></a><i>.</i>\n</p><p>He described the word \"benevolent\" as sounding \"derogatory\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]</a></sup> — he might have mixed it up with \"belligerent,\" which means \"war-like,\" or \"malevolent,\" an antonym of \"benevolent.\"\n</p><p>Years later, in 2016, Chris further demonstrated his lack of political understanding in a post on 4 December, in which he said that Trump should \"advocate the position, and take Pence with him, and let Hillary be President, as it should Very Well Be.\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-7\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">[7]</a></sup> Chris likely has the word <i>advocate</i> confused with <i>abdicate</i>, which is a term he might have heard in <a href=\"/cwcki/Anne_Boleyn\" title=\"Anne Boleyn\">British TV shows</a> - it is a term typically used in reference to a monarchy.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Muddled-up_proverbs\">Muddled-up proverbs</span></h3>\n<p>A good demonstration of Chris's lack of understanding of semantics is the fact that he does not really understand proverbs and adages; he frequently recites them incorrectly, clearly misses the point, or <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">takes them literally</a>. When he comes up with his own, he does not exactly try to veil any wisdom in carefully crafted phrases.\n</p><p>Examples of Chrisverbial Wisdom:\n</p>\n<ul><li>\"Those who are unable to, teach.\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-8\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">[8]</a></sup></li>\n<li>\"<a href=\"/cwcki/Duck\" title=\"Duck\">The shaped OBJECT</a> is the BODY of the Item, but the STICKER is the Item's SOUL.\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-9\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">[9]</a></sup></li>\n<li>\"A sound thought is a good thought, unless it is a bad idea.\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-CWCipedia_past_featured_quotes_10-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-CWCipedia_past_featured_quotes-10\">[10]</a></sup></li>\n<li>\"To perform a Repeated Act is fucktarded.\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-11\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">[11]</a></sup></li>\n<li>\"The pen is mightier than the sword, yet it is more permanent than a pencil.\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-CWCipedia_past_featured_quotes_10-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-CWCipedia_past_featured_quotes-10\">[10]</a></sup></li></ul>\n<p>The last example illustrates several problems: \n</p>\n<ul><li>\"The pen is mightier than the sword\" (a phrase originally coined by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, the man who also coined the phrase \"It was a dark and stormy night\") is, of course, generally regarded as a statement that words can have bigger consequences than violence. Chris does not understand this, and tries to somehow interpret this concretely: \"pen is more permanent than a pencil.\" He doesn't understand that \"pen\" could easily be replaced with \"pencil\" or \"keyboard\" in the original saying – it's a <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metonym\" title=\"wikipedia:metonym\">metonym</a> for the written word.</li>\n<li>It is also problematic because normally, \"A, yet B\" is usually a statement by <i>contrasts</i>: \"A may be true, but a contrary example B is true as well.\" One would think that a pen being permanent makes it more mighty.</li>\n<li>Still, Chris fails at explaining why it is so important that pens are more permanent than pencils, and what that has to do with the original phrase — the meaning of Chris's proverb remains unclear to all, probably including Chris himself. Perhaps it's simply another form of <a href=\"/cwcki/Random-access_humor\" title=\"Random-access humor\">random-access humor</a>.</li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Literal_interpretations\">Literal interpretations</span></h3>\n<p>Chris is unable to interpret the language other people use at any level other than its literal, surface meaning. He misses the deeper meanings of what others are trying to say to him, and cannot interpret abstract thought or sarcasm. This is known as concrete thought, which can be seen as a symptom of autism.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Rhetorical_comparisons_and_sarcasm\">Rhetorical comparisons and sarcasm</span></h4>\n<p>Chris cannot interpret rhetorical comparisons or hyperbole in general. He ignores the point the speaker is trying to make and focuses on the \"exact\" meaning of the phrases they use. Examples:<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-12\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">[12]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<dl><dd><b>Kacey's Father:</b> You know, I think the last book Kacey read was last week. And she reads books like you probably stuff candy down your throat.</dd>\n<dd><b>Chris:</b> Stuff... candy... don't... I stuff vegetables down my throat! I stuff green beans! I stuff broccoli! I stuff corn! I stuff carrots!</dd>\n<dd>…</dd>\n<dd><b>Kacey's Father:</b> I don't know shit about computers and I can do that. I barely even know what a Windows is.</dd>\n<dd><b>Chris:</b> You barely know what a Windows is?</dd>\n<dd><b>Kacey's Father:</b> Don't… Don't patronize me.</dd>\n<dd><b>Chris:</b> I'm just trying to, I'm just trying to understand what you just said, you say you don't understand Windows?</dd>\n<dd><b>Kacey's Father:</b> What I'm trying to say is, I don't know shit about computers and I could figure out how to do that.</dd></dl>\n<p>In the first example, Chris clearly only hears \"You[…] stuff candy down your throat\" and interprets the negative tone as an accusation that this is a bad thing, then tries to prove that he does not, in fact, stuff <i>candy</i> down his throat — just healthy foods like vegetables (a blatant lie, but that is beside the point). Because he feels threatened, he forgets that this is used as a <i>rhetorical comparison</i>, and thus the original point that Kacey's dad was trying to make gets lost in the sands of time. This is also one of the reasons why conversations with Chris reach complete dead ends.\n</p><p>As the quote read in the <a href=\"/cwcki/04232010_-_Autism_Awareness_%26_Men_Should_NEVER_be_Topless\" title=\"04232010 - Autism Awareness &amp; Men Should NEVER be Topless\">Autism Awareness</a> video says, autistic people are frequently unable to interpret sarcasm. Chris is no exception, and he is often unable to pick up sarcastic comments, as seen in the Guru Larry interview.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-13\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">[13]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Questions_and_suggestions\">Questions and suggestions</span></h4>\n<p>Chris's literal interpretation also affects how he answers questions and follows orders or suggestions. His answers to questions are always laconic with no elaboration, and cannot distinguish the implied meanings within the commands and suggestions given to him from their literal meanings. For example:<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-14\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">[14]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<dl><dd><b>Q:</b> Do you listen to any music while you draw the comics?</dd>\n<dd><b>A:</b> Yes.</dd></dl>\n<p>To a normal person, the question that was posed would be interpreted along the lines of \"What kind of music — what bands, what musical genres? If you listen to the music, why does this particular music help you draw things? If not, do you find music distracting, and why?\" but instead, Chris interpreted \"Do you listen to any music?\" literally as a question that can be answered \"yes\" or \"no.\" Simply put, he is unable to see <i>why</i> people are asking specific questions that can be answered yes or no, and unable to elaborate or give rationales for his opinions unless those things are <i>specifically</i> asked from him. Again, this characteristic is due to his autism, not, as is often perceived, his stupidity.\n</p><p>Another example:<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-15\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">[15]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<dl><dd><b>Alec:</b> Please stop running away from me.</dd>\n<dd><b>Chris:</b> I'm not running away from you, I'm right here.</dd></dl>\n<p>This was in response to Chris trying to end the call after an inconvenient discussion.\n</p><p>This also is likely to blame for Chris's second encounter with <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/B-Manajerk\" title=\"B-Manajerk\">B-Manajerk</a>. The previous day, the manager of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Mal-Wart\" title=\"Mal-Wart\">Wal-Mart</a> had banned him from the store. Problem is, they were inside a <a href=\"/cwcki/McDonald%27s\" title=\"McDonald's\">McDonald's</a> at the time, and he likely said something along the lines of \"Never come to this store again.\" Chris probably took this to mean \"You are banned from this specific store, the one you and I are standing in right now,\" and due to this misunderstanding he wound up being chased out of the Wal-Mart.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Television_jargon\">Television jargon</span></h3>\n<p>In the <i>Sonichu</i> comic, Chris also almost consistently uses television terminology instead of comics terminology. This seems to seep into his other language use, too — he urges people to \"stay tuned\" to see new developments in his <a href=\"/cwcki/YouTube\" title=\"YouTube\">YouTube</a> channel, for example. This on its own is innocuous, as normal people might use \"stay tuned\" in non-TV situations (and for cable/satellite TV stations, which do not have a transmission frequency), but in Chris's case, this may be an indication of a bigger issue. Chris refers to himself as \"Great Director Chandler\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-16\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">[16]</a></sup> (itself a ripoff of <a href=\"/cwcki/Excel_Saga\" title=\"Excel Saga\">Great Director Watanabe</a>) and calls alternate versions of his comics \"director's cuts.\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-17\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">[17]</a></sup> <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_10\" title=\"Sonichu 10\"><i>Sonichu</i> #10</a> begins with the \"Previously...\" type of recap of the end of the previous comic more usually seen in a TV series. When talking about the comic, he consistently refers to \"episodes\" rather than chapters. He has used \"TV-MA/TV-14/TV-Y7\" ratings for certain scenes<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-18\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">[18]</a></sup> and, when this self-imposed rating system later failed to work, he blamed the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission\" title=\"wikipedia:Federal Communications Commission\">Federal Communications Commission</a> for the messed-up ratings,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-19\"><a href=\"#cite_note-19\">[19]</a></sup> even though the FCC has no authority over online or printed media. He promised a second \"season\" of the comic — apparently a \"reboot\" will commence with a \"clip show episode\" in <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_11\" title=\"Sonichu 11\"><i>Sonichu</i> 11</a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-20\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">[20]</a></sup> It is as if he is familiar with only one set of jargon that he then applies to all similar situations, ignoring the fact that most people speak of \"writers\" instead of \"directors,\" \"chapters\" instead of \"episodes,\" \"volumes\" instead of \"seasons,\" rate their comics with some rating system that is probably similar to, but not an <i>exact duplicate</i> of the one used in television — and so on.\n</p><p>It is speculated that the use of jargon stems not from a limited vocabulary, but from Chris's belief that he is <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">actually directing a TV show.</a><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-21\"><a href=\"#cite_note-21\">[21]</a></sup> More damningly, he once referred to the comics as an \"anime,\" with himself as director.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-22\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">[22]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Backwards_spelling\">Backwards spelling</span></h3>\n<p>Chris also has a habit of <a href=\"/cwcki/October_2016_Facebook_posts#Sdrawcab\" title=\"October 2016 Facebook posts\">spelling certain words, phrases, or names of people backwards</a> in order to emphasize them in a sentence.  In Chris's mind, words wield a great deal of power, and spelling a name or word backwards can serve to degrade its subject or indicate that Chris views it negatively.\n</p><p>Notable examples include:\n</p>\n<ul><li>\"<a href=\"/cwcki/Reldnahc_Notsew_Naitsirhc\" title=\"Reldnahc Notsew Naitsirhc\">Reldnahc Notsew Naitsirhc</a>\" - Chris's doppelgänger in the comics who is his exact opposite, being completely evil and extremely gay.</li>\n<li>\"Hslaw Eel Yram\" - Chris's reversal of <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Mary Lee Walsh</a>'s name, in one of his custom <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Yu-Gi-Oh!\" title=\"Yu-Gi-Oh!\">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></i> cards.</li>\n<li>\"Pmurt\" - Trump backwards, rhymes with \"Hurt.\"  Sometimes the \"P\" is silent.  \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Eid,_Pmurt,_Eid\" title=\"Eid, Pmurt, Eid\">EID PMURT, EID!!!</a>\"</li>\n<li>\"Namgge\" - Used by Chris to refer to <a href=\"/cwcki/Doctor_Robotnik\" title=\"Doctor Robotnik\">Eggman</a> from Sonic.  (Pronounced like \"<a href=\"/cwcki/TooManyGames#Bowser_vs_Robotnik_panel\" title=\"TooManyGames\">Nah, I'm gay</a>\" with the words <a href=\"/cwcki/Speech_impediment\" title=\"Speech impediment\">slurred together</a> a bit.)</li>\n<li>\"<a href=\"/cwcki/U8C43P2A37A8_y_U8C1N023V0L\" title=\"U8C43P2A37A8 y U8C1N023V0L\">U8C43P2A37A8 y U8C1N023V0L</a>\" (\"Love Sonichu and Hate Asperchu\" backwards, in leet-speak with a bit of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Spanish\" title=\"Spanish\">Spanish</a>.)</li>\n<li>\"Wem\" - <a href=\"/cwcki/A_Wild_Chris-Chan_Attempts_Human_Interaction#Transcript\" title=\"A Wild Chris-Chan Attempts Human Interaction\">Used by Chris to refer to the Pokemon Mew.</a></li>\n<li>\"Dratsab Gniyarteb\" - Calling <a href=\"/cwcki/Null\" title=\"Null\">Null</a> a \"betraying bastard\" in his <a href=\"/cwcki/Jail_Letter_-_6_December_2021\" title=\"Jail Letter - 6 December 2021\">jail correspondence</a>.</li>\n<li>\"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Reeb\" title=\"Reeb\">Reeb</a>\"</li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Other_strange_points\">Other strange points</span></h3>\n<p>Chris seems to <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_brand_loyalty\" title=\"Chris and brand loyalty\">cling to trademarks</a>. In <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_10\" title=\"Mailbag 10\">Mailbag #10</a>, for example, he specifically says a couple of times that he has saved material on his Memory Stick and Memory Stick Duo. Not \"saved on memory card\" or just \"saved\"; people generally don't care <i>what</i> you save your fanart on, as long as it's saved. Chris, however, wants to be specific: the fan material was saved on a Memory Stick Duo. In the exact same vein, in <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_and_Tito_PS3_E-mails\" title=\"Clyde and Tito PS3 E-mails\">Clyde and Tito PS3 E-mails</a>, he even swears with \"hand on My Holy New International Version Bible right now,\" rather than just on <i>any</i> old Bible he might have had lying around. This can be explained, again, by Chris's autism, where he is literally describing the specific device that he is using to save, not a generalization.\n</p><p>He also tends to mix up similar words, for example, the time he confused <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu%27s_Edge\" title=\"Sonichu's Edge\">free-running</a> with <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkay\" title=\"wikipedia:Parkay\">a brand of butter</a>.\n</p><p>Chris seems to prefer referring to people using their full names; before he assumed he was female, he almost always referred to himself as \"Christian Weston Chandler\" or, God forbid, \"'Christopher' Christian 'Ricardo' Weston Chandler\"— if he was feeling overly formal. This applies to other people, too; for example, in <a href=\"/cwcki/Gal-Pals_and_Past_Sweethearts_(CWCipedia_page)\" title=\"Gal-Pals and Past Sweethearts (CWCipedia page)\">Gal-Pals and Past Sweethearts</a>, he refers to most of the women by their full names. This is yet another autism-related trait.\n</p><p>Chris also has a habit of inventing new words by muddling the tense of existing ones. This often goes along with his previously-mentioned preference for somewhat odd word choices as he tries to force words into sentences they don't belong in. A good example would be be Chris's love of the word \"crestfallen\" that came about during the <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_Boom_Protests\" title=\"Sonic Boom Protests\">Sonic Boom Protests</a>. While the word usually exists as a adjective, Chris uses it in a baffling progressive tense \"to my dismay and crestfall.\"\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_spoken_word\">The spoken word</span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Choicevideos.PNG\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"165\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/2/23/Choicevideos.PNG/300px-Choicevideos.PNG\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/2/23/Choicevideos.PNG/450px-Choicevideos.PNG 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/2/23/Choicevideos.PNG/600px-Choicevideos.PNG 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Choicevideos.PNG\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Chris's spoken vocabulary.

Consider his earliest videos; his speech was courtly and disjointed, and delivered almost exclusively in short, monotonous bursts:\n</p>\n<center><div class=\"thumb embedvideo autoResize\" style=\"width: 328px;\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo autoResize\" style=\"\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideowrap youtube\" style=\"width: 320px\"><div class=\"embedvideo-consent\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo-consent__overlay\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo-consent__message\">Click to load content</div><!--\n--></div><!--\n--></div><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" data-src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DyTRNU1ym-k\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"180\" loading=\"lazy\" modestbranding=\"1\" width=\"320\"></iframe></div><!--\n--></div><!--\n--></div></center>\n<p>There are exceptions to this, but these generally consisted of <a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_phrases_Chris_copied_from_media\" title=\"List of phrases Chris copied from media\">short phrases apparently culled from TV</a> (note the change in pitch in the above video when Chris describes himself as \"ever so lonesome\"). All in all, Chris displayed all the attributes one would expect from an autistic, as well as from someone who is completely unused to talking to people.\n</p><p>Comparisons with the present day show a marked change in Chris's manner of speech:\n</p>\n<center><div class=\"thumb embedvideo autoResize\" style=\"width: 328px;\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo autoResize\" style=\"\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideowrap youtube\" style=\"width: 320px\"><div class=\"embedvideo-consent\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo-consent__overlay\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo-consent__message\">Click to load content</div><!--\n--></div><!--\n--></div><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" data-src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pCrLyR69cPM\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"180\" loading=\"lazy\" modestbranding=\"1\" width=\"320\"></iframe></div><!--\n--></div><!--\n--></div></center>\n<p>Chris may not sound any more naturalistic, but he does show more of a semantic range than he did two years ago. Clues as to why this has occurred can be found in the subject matter of the videos — Chris seems to have realized to some extent that he must engage with people on their terms in order to be taken seriously. While this may not be a massive change, it is still heartening to see that the trolling is stirring the emaciated husk of his dignity into some sort of creaking action. Who knows? In another two years he may have acquired the vocal skills of a child of kindergarten age.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Idiosyncrasies\">Idiosyncrasies</span></h3>\n<p>Chris also has a number of idiosyncrasies which appear frequently in his speech. First, the aforementioned disjointed speech patterns, which are broken up by a number of ideological phrases, which crop up with varying regularity but which sound very similar every time he uses them. Listen closely to the way he introduces himself; he is \"Chrishinwessonchanler. From Ruckersville Vir-<i>gin</i>-ya.\" Whenever Chris introduces himself, he basically repeats this exact phonetic pattern, including pauses, the rushed and garbled name, and the staccato rhythm of \"Virginia.\" This is of course explainable by his autism, but it is also related to his <a href=\"/cwcki/Random-access_humor\" title=\"Random-access humor\">sense of humor</a>, his <a href=\"/cwcki/Parody\" title=\"Parody\">plagiarism</a>, and his desire for control over those whom he sees as oppressors.\n</p><p>It may also be related to the less often seen idiosyncrasy which causes him to express disgust with a word physically. For example, in the famous <a href=\"/cwcki/SingStar_Challenge_Round_5\" title=\"SingStar Challenge Round 5\">\"Smell Yo Duck\"</a> music video, Chris first avoided saying the word \"dick\" altogether, and when forced to repeat the video, showed signs of distress bordering on illness. While this is obviously nothing more than a comical exaggeration on his part, it is notable that he should feel any particular sensation about simple words whatsoever. This reaction raises the possibility that, so long as he is not faking it altogether, Chris may be a <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia\" title=\"wikipedia:Synesthesia\">synaesthete</a>. There's also the possibility that he has a strong association with a certain word and associates guilt with it, like a child hearing a curse word. Alternatively, it is not stating the <i>word</i> that is disgusting to Chris, but rather the <i>substance</i> of the phrase, as it implies that <i>he himself</i> is <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">\"smelling someone's dick\"</a>, as he has no problem hurling curse words (including \"dick\") at his enemies when in a <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_anger\" title=\"Chris and anger\">fit of rage</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Profanity\">Profanity</span></h2>\n<dl><dd><i>See also: <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_censorship\" title=\"Chris and censorship\">Chris and censorship</a></i></dd></dl>\n<p>At some point in the 2000s, Chris became an enthusiastic user of profanity and vulgar language. According to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Mimms\" title=\"Mimms\">Mimms</a>, in his early days at <a href=\"/cwcki/The_GAMe_PLACe\" title=\"The GAMe PLACe\">The GAMe PLACe</a> Chris avoided cursing, at least in public, but in more recent years he's lost almost all compunctions in this regard. His videos, blogs, and public pronouncements are full of foul language and obscene references. This is possibly part of an effort by Chris to seem more \"adult.\"\n</p><p>He still holds back in some ways, though. In much of his writing, especially in his comics and on the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia\" title=\"CWCipedia\">CWCipedia</a>, Chris shows a strange inclination to sporadically censor himself. He regularly uses profanity in his blog entries and Mailbag responses, but the offending words are typically blotted out with asterisks: \"D*** that Son Of A B****, Clyde Cash,\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-23\"><a href=\"#cite_note-23\">[23]</a></sup> for instance, or \"<a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_Sonichu_characters#Bugs_Bunny\" title=\"List of Sonichu characters\">BUGS BUNNY</a> WAS NAKED; YOGI BEAR WAS NAKED; WHAT THE F*** IS WRONG WITH YOU?\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-24\"><a href=\"#cite_note-24\">[24]</a></sup> (On occasions he varies up his censorship style. <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC%27s_Diary\" title=\"CWC's Diary\">CWC's Diary</a> repeatedly refers to <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Mary Lee Walsh</a> as an \"<a href=\"/cwcki/CWC-isms#X\" title=\"CWC-isms\">XXXXX</a>\"; the X's are clearly meant to stand in for \"bitch\".) Even relatively mild words such as \"damn\" and \"crap\" get the same treatment, which was exploited to hilarious effect in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Audiobooks\" title=\"Audiobooks\">audiobooks</a>.\n</p><p>It could be that Chris believes that most of the CWCipedia's audience is comparatively young, and therefore censors his outbursts to protect his imagined fanbase. Another, more complex theory proposes that it's a sign of Chris's stunted maturity — he wants to use profanity to signify that he's an adult, but he retains a child's guilt and uncertainty about swearing. (The same theory abounds regarding <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://encyclopediadramatica.online/Daveykins\" rel=\"nofollow\">David Gonterman</a>, another angry Internet cartoonist with an incongruous tendency to censor himself.)\n</p><p><br/>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Virginia_is_for_Virgin_Ears\">Virginia is for Virgin Ears</span></h3>\n<p>The usage of profanity, even in private, was illegal in Virginia until 2020. However, this law was seldom enforced. Nowadays, even swearing in public is legal in Virginia.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-25\"><a href=\"#cite_note-25\">[25]</a></sup>\n</p><p>However, Virginia law still prohibits the use of profanity over the telephone, airwaves, or other electronic methods, which would include YouTube videos. Much of Chris' output is technically illegal. \n</p><p>Chris hasn't been prosecuted for this, though, and such a prosecution would be flimsy under the First Amendment if it were ever tried in a state or federal high court – state courts have neutered similar laws still on the books in other states (including California, which only enforces its \"offensive language\" disturbing-the-peace laws when immediate physical violence or physical provocation ensues, even if the profanity occurred in public).\n</p><p>Still, private businesses in any state are free to enforce bans on vulgar language.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/cwcki/Speech_impediment\" title=\"Speech impediment\">Speech impediment</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Chris%27s_resume\" title=\"Chris's resume\">Chris's resume</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/The_High_School_Story\" title=\"The High School Story\">The High School Story</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_writing\" title=\"Chris and writing\">Chris and writing</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Spanish\" title=\"Spanish\">Spanish</a></li>\n<li>Anything written on <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://archive.sonichu.com/cwcipedia/index.php?title=Main_Page\" rel=\"nofollow\">CWCipedia</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Manchester_High_Leaks#English\" title=\"Manchester High Leaks\">Chris's high school English homework</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap mw-references-columns\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://archive.md/VFIwC\" rel=\"nofollow\">:: Diagnostic Criteria for Autistic Disorder through the years</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Emails,_2008#Chris_thinks_she_was_scarred_because_she_doesn't_know_much_about_sex\" title=\"Megan Emails, 2008\">Megan Emails, 2008#Chris thinks she was scarred because she doesn't know much about sex</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-3\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-3\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/input\" title=\"wiktionary:input\">wiktionary:input</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-4\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-4\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://archive.sonichu.com/cwcipedia/index.php?title=Homosexuality\" rel=\"nofollow\">Homosexuality</a> on CWCipedia</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-5\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-5\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">See, for example, the note in <i>The Big Lebowski</i>: \"WE HAVE BUNNY.
