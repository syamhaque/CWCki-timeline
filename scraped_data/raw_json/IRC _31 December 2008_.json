Chris offers a tortuous explanation for the ages of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Chaotic_Combo\" title=\"Chaotic Combo\">Chaotic Combo</a> - they are 19 years old, and never mind the evidence of the actual comics or basic mathematics - and explains, sort of, the \"My wooden badge was delicious!\" joke from the cover of <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_4\" title=\"Sonichu 4\">Sonichu 4</a>. It still doesn't make any sense, nor is it funny.\n</p><p>Chris claims that his greatest accomplishment in life was his involvement in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Pok%C3%A9mon\" title=\"Pokémon\">Pokémon</a> trading-card league at <a href=\"/cwcki/The_GAMe_PLACe\" title=\"The GAMe PLACe\">The GAMe PLACe</a>. By this point his memory has inflated his actual role there to the level of \"co-hosting\" the league. (In fact, he only rarely helped run league events, and his ineptitude helped get him kicked out of the store.)\n</p><p>When asked a long and complex question about ongoing political disputes in Palestine and Israel, Chris demands that the questioner \"STOP\" halfway through. \"I don't particually care for bad news\" is all he has to say on that subject.\n</p><p>At this point, Chris remains absolutely tickled over the <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_Girls\" title=\"Sonichu Girls\">Sonichu Girls</a> forum, which wouldn't be revealed as a front for trolls until late February. He showers his supposed female fanbase with compliments, and declares, \"<a href=\"/cwcki/JERKS\" title=\"JERKS\">BOYS</a>, KEEP OUT; God forbid you messing up their pure, honest, sweet input.\"\n</p><p>When Panda takes over the chat, she asks Chris about sources of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress\" title=\"Stress\">stress</a> in his life. He points to his father <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler\" title=\"Bob Chandler\">Bob Chandler</a> and reiterates his usual complaints - he's argumentative, he doesn't wash his hands enough. Naturally, Chris is oblivious to the hypocrisy of someone like himself criticizing another person's attitude or standards of hygiene. (Hand-washing appears to be the one way that Chris cares about keeping clean. He reportedly used up hand sanitizer like crazy at The GAMe PLACe.)\n</p><p>Panda also tries to bait him by mentioning <a href=\"/cwcki/Robert_Simmons_V\" title=\"Robert Simmons V\">Robert Simmons V</a>, but he's too distracted to get jealous this time. In fact, he's fairly cool towards Panda in this chat, and mentions that he plans to resume searching for a sweetheart in his local area. It's possible that this was a cover for Chris's plans to dump Panda in favor of <a href=\"/cwcki/BlueSpike\" title=\"BlueSpike\">Julie</a>.\n</p><p>Towards the end of the chat, a counter-troll messages Chris to try and link him to transcripts of his \"private\" chats with Panda (which, naturally, had been collected and shared by the trolls). However, Chris easily falls for Panda's explanation that the link will merely lead to a virus or some other ill omen.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Transcript\">Transcript</span></h2>\n<p><font color=\"#BDBDBD\">21:22 -!- Guest [~Guest@Rizon-1CC9B2F5.hsd1.va.comcast.net] has joined #sonichu\n<br/>21:22 -!- Guest is now known as Guest1\n<br/>21:22 -!- Guest1 is now known as <b>ChrisChanSonichu</b></font>\n<br/>21:22 &lt; <b>Nightboomfer</b>&gt; or he could get a fucking job\n<br/>21:22 &lt; <b>RachmaninovDESHU</b>&gt; you cant buy ps games from 100 a month\n<br/><font color=\"#BDBDBD\">21:22 -!- mode/#sonichu [+m] by <b>PandaHalo</b></font>\n<br/>21:22 &lt;@<font color=\"#0174DF\"><b>PandaHalo</b></font>&gt; Hey.\n<br/>21:22 &lt;@<font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>BlueSpike</b></font>&gt; you finally came we were doupt you would show up\n<br/>21:23 &lt;@<font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>BlueSpike</b></font>&gt; hello?\n<br/>21:23 &lt;@<font color=\"#0174DF\"><b>PandaHalo</b></font>&gt; Oh!\n<br/>21:23 &lt;@<font color=\"#0174DF\"><b>PandaHalo</b></font>&gt; I almost forgot!\n<br/><font color=\"#BDBDBD\">21:23 -!- mode/#sonichu [+o <b>ChrisChanSonichu</b>] by <b>BlueSpike</b></font>\n<br/>21:23 &lt;@<font color=\"#0174DF\"><b>PandaHalo</b></font>&gt; Thanks, Blue.\n<br/>21:24 &lt;@<font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>BlueSpike</b></font>&gt; sorry forgot about the ops\n<br/>21:24 &lt;@<font color=\"#0174DF\"><b>PandaHalo</b></font>&gt; Sorry for not notcing that, Chris.\n<br/><font color=\"#BDBDBD\">21:24 -!- <b>XanatosVanBadas</b> [~JDAN2@Rizon-9D5AD45.res-cmts.sm.ptd.net] has joined #sonichu</font>\n<br/>21:24 &lt;@<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>ChrisChanSonichu</b></font>&gt; Well, I have been busy with coloring the pages of the comic, and I've been asleep from late afternoon to EARLY morning lately.\n<br/>21:24 &lt;@<font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>BlueSpike</b></font>&gt; if you don't mind we're going to start with a little Q&amp;A\n<br/>21:25 &lt;@<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>ChrisChanSonichu</b></font>&gt; even right now, my eyes are feeling a bit of pain, as I should probably go to sleep soon.
