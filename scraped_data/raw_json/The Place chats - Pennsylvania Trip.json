He made the trip for two reasons: to drop off a box of autographed goods for Luke, a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Carpetbagger\" title=\"Carpetbagger\">carpetbagger</a> intending to resell the items for profit, and to attempt to make an unsolicited visit to <a href=\"/cwcki/Emgo316\" title=\"Emgo316\">Emgo316</a>, a local <a href=\"/cwcki/YouTube\" title=\"YouTube\">YouTuber</a> who reviews <a href=\"/cwcki/Transformers\" title=\"Transformers\">Transformers</a> figures.\n</p><p>Chris drove to Luke's house first, dropping off the autographed items and playing video games with him. Luke's package contained \"at least 50 items\", including a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Trump\" title=\"Trump\">Trump</a> 2020 campaign flag which Chris defaced before signing. Chris was paid $190 for his labor, although a good chunk of the earnings must have gone into paying for gas and tolls for the trip. Luke later listed the items for sale on Mercari, falsely claiming the items once belonged to Chris.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup>\n</p><p>He then attempted to visit Emgo316 by looking up his <a href=\"/cwcki/Dox\" title=\"Dox\">dox</a> online, but he failed to meet him as Emgo no longer lived at the addresses he checked.\n</p><p>Although Chris claims at one point in the chat that Emgo's home was in \"<a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh\" title=\"wikipedia:Pittsburgh\">Pittsburg</a>\", the geographical details Chris provides (such as street names) make it clear that his trip was in fact to <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia\" title=\"wikipedia:Philadelphia\">Philadelphia</a>, a journey of about 240 miles (385 km) each way.

After getting back home, this body was ready to crash for the night, and it needed more sleep to the point of sleeping in. It's almost 3:00 pm right now.\n</p><p>Now, I had a set of four <a href=\"/cwcki/Dreams\" title=\"Dreams\">dreams</a>, plus one short one today; they ended up fitting a theme, and in the last dream, I happened on a very important relic or artifact that could very well be a link on helping me get this body from here into <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/C-197\" title=\"C-197\">C-197</a>.\n</p><p>This item is a large gold stone disc that was divided into pieces: the center, and the outter pieces that attach to the center and side by side with each other to all the way around the disc. Not counting the center (which has a spiral on it), there are 14 or 20 pieces.\n</p><p>each of these spanning pieces has writing and symbols on them; one of them had a star on the outter end, another a filled in circle, and twelve of the others the images for the astrological birth signs, and on each of these pieces also showed the symbol for each of the animals that we have Years for each, such as Horse, Dog, Rat, and so on as all of you are aware and can look up for reference. Also in looking at the new message I just found from <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bismuth\" title=\"Bismuth\">Bismuth</a>, the previous one above it with the Bushido symbols, those symbols were spread out amongst those pieces as well.\n</p><p>I've manifested a copy of the disc that was in the dream on the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/C-197\" title=\"C-197\">C-197</a> side and gave it to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Cryzel\" title=\"Cryzel\">Cryzel</a>; all of the other ally psychics have got image of this disc from this brain's memory!\n</p><p>I felt it well to tell you all about that discovery.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Lead-up_to_road_trip\">Lead-up to road trip</span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:No_Drump_flag.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"141\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/5/5a/No_Drump_flag.png/300px-No_Drump_flag.png\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/5/5a/No_Drump_flag.png/450px-No_Drump_flag.png 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/5/5a/No_Drump_flag.png/600px-No_Drump_flag.png 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:No_Drump_flag.png\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>The Trump flag.</div></div></div>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Now, about yesterday's road trip:\n<p>Preface of that: a fan of mine who lives in Pennsylvania offered to pay me for signing a bunch of items he wanted me to sign. He paid me $90 through PayPal, as well as enclosing a legit $100 bill on the letter in the box.\n</p><p>The box was Bulky: 19X23X21, thereabouts; it was written in pen on one side of the box; I had a tough time getting the darn thing through door frames, it was almost as wide as such. There were about at least 50 items in it that he wanted me to sign: a PS2 <a href=\"/cwcki/Guitar_Hero\" title=\"Guitar Hero\">Guitar Hero</a> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Gitar\" title=\"Gitar\">Guitar</a>, a plastic ukulele that really needs restoration, a <a href=\"/cwcki/Nintendo\" title=\"Nintendo\">Game Boy Advance, a DSI XL, various controllers, a Gamecube box, a Switch lite Box</a>, a few books, movie and video game discs and inserts, and so on. Even a small <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Trump\" title=\"Trump\">Trump</a> 2020 flag, which before signing it, defaced by turning the \"T\" into a \"D\", writing \"NO\" in silver above it, blacking out the \"2020\" and the \"Great\" in \"Keep America Great!\", thus turning it into a \"No Drump. Keep America!\" Flag\n</p><p>He also paid $45 to ship that box.\n</p><p>My fellow psychics and I ended up looking ahead a bit and decided that I'd make a road trip and personally deliver the box to him\n</p><p>That was the Main Objective of the trip; secondarily, but also major bonus…\n</p><p>Second preface amongst Emgo316's videos where he reviewed his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Transformer\" title=\"Transformer\">Transformer</a> figures, there was no box, but a large envelope with his address on it he had marked out part of it, and the \"Pittsburg, Pennsylvania\" part was still visible; we made a mental note upon seeing that and said that next time we're in Pennsylvania, maybe we'd pay him a visit. And then this fated box happened, so we all agreed this was opportune.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_trip\">The trip</span></h2>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>So. I checked online for confirming his present address (not going to reveal it, to be safe), and we made the plan Wednesday night\n<p>So, yeah, it was a four and a half hour drive to our fan, Luke's, house,\n</p><p>We had also brought the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Nintendo_Switch\" title=\"Nintendo Switch\">Nintendo Switch</a> to offer a little bit of gaming time on <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._Ultimate\" title=\"wikipedia:Super Smash Bros. Ultimate\">Smash Ultimate</a> with him.\n</p><p>I also met his grandmother who was working in her garden.\n</p><p>We had a lovely time together, Luke and I, talking and hanging out.\n</p><p>And then he had to go back to work; he works at the local YMCA there.\n</p><p>After that, we looked up Emgo's address: apparently of his last known address, he had moved out about a year ago; sold it to a kind <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Spanish\" title=\"Spanish\">Spanish</a>-speaking woman. She lived next door to a mom and daughter, who I believed spoke Korean (the daughter spoke English).\n</p><p>We started the trip early yesterday about 7:00 am; we safely returned home about 11:30 pm; I stayed awake with the help of a couple of Game Fuel drinks, and a limited time Draccuchino at <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sheetz\" title=\"Sheetz\">Sheetz</a> on the way back home; had the energy left for putting the clothes into the wash, plugging in the Poke Balls, and taking a shower. This body has an overpowered amount of endurance and fortitude. It was ready to crash by the time we had got home, but it pushed through its temporary paralysis to take that shower before laying down in the bed.\n</p><p><a href=\"/cwcki/Imaginary_friends\" title=\"Imaginary friends\">Rosey, Cryzel, Sonola and Val</a> were with me on the trip, and Mewtwo was playing guardian and scouted and flew around while doing other errands for the day. Also, <a href=\"/cwcki/Son-Chu\" title=\"Son-Chu\">Son-Chu</a> followed us in escort.\n</p><p>Mama and I, we enjoy a Road Trip, and we really like going on Adventures; yesterday was a really good adventure.\n</p><p>Also, the van really shines in gas mileage on the freeway we clocked in over 200 miles on half the full tank of gas.\n</p><p>And the majority of what we experienced and learned was really a blessing.\n</p><p>I forgot to mention, the three ladies there knew Emgo, so that was also a very good blessing to count.\n</p><p>I have no regrets, as we made a lot of positivity for a bunch of people yesterday\n</p><p>The only minute regret was the pain and fatigue at the end. Yet the silver lining on that pain is that we've experienced the overpowered amount of endurance and fortitude this body and brain are capable of withstanding,\n</p><p>That's the story.

The pleasant and supportive conversation. Also wanting to meet his friend, Lori; as shown in her videos, she has her own share of psychic senses, meeting and talking with her would have also been most helpful to our cause. And, yeah, would have shared a bit of this body's and brain's powers and abilities with them to get their responses and input. But, it was not meant to be yet. Maybe in the next timeline.\n<p>Anyway, I share these details strictly confidential with you all; no one else outside of this server is to know the (extensive) details of the trip. I heard a rumor that Luke may have shared online that he and I met and hung out yesterday; that is okay. But I don't want it going public that I tried to meet Emgo. It can be misinterpreted as stalker, obviously, which was not the case, as I have made very clear here.\n</p><p>But enough about the extensive preface.\n</p><p>The Golden Stone Disc.\n</p><p>Going back to that.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>The chat on the Golden Stone disc continues in <a href=\"/cwcki/The_Place_chats_-_Lore_Mashup\" title=\"The Place chats - Lore Mashup\">The Place chats - Lore Mashup</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"More_details\">More details</span></h2>\n<p>Later, Chris divulged more details on the trip.\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Yep\n<p>I will strictly confidentially share one more tidbit in regard to checking Emgo's address.\n</p><p>In the online search, I found two addresses related to him. One on Cedar Street, and the other on <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crescentville,_Philadelphia#Rising_Sun_Avenue\" title=\"wikipedia:Crescentville, Philadelphia\">Rising Sun Avenue</a>. We ended up visiting both locations. Cedar's Condo first: did not need to get out of the van to sense psychically that the place was left unkempt and there was hardly a presence of Emgo's love there. Then on Rising Sun, we sensed Emgo's presence, in this case past-tense, as well as a whole lot of positivity, love and care in the place.\n</p><p>There were colourful window curtains, and a \"Welcome\" sign above said window on the outside as well.\n</p><p>The psychic senses are vastly improving.\n</p><p>Also, fun facts: apparently Emgo was born in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/1979\" title=\"1979\">1979</a>; he's three years older than Mama.\n</p><p>And Emgo is short for his full name, which I will not divulge at this time.\n</p><p>I sense that he was not fond of his first name that much, but he found better solace in shortening it to Emgo, which does work better, I feel.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\"

<a href=\"/cwcki/Ohio_trip\" title=\"Ohio trip\">visited Cleveland, Ohio in 2009</a>.\n</p><p>And Emgo still continued on in very good soul and emotional strength and endurance despite that local mess
