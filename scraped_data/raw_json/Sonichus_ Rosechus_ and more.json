Sonichu was able to get her to calm down and change back.  Her clothes were ripped to shreds the first time then.  She got her outfit replaced with more durability, but she learned it wise to undress when she could before when she was about to really rage out.  It takes quite a lot to make her upset, and she has learned to keep focus and emotionally control herself.\n</p><p>They moved into their new house after returning to Cwcville, VA, USA in February, 2004.  And they end up finding Sonichu Adventure for Nintendo GameCube, as well as Sonichu and Rosechu plushes at a GameStop.  They play through the game and find in the first few levels their life so far, including when Rosey first raged out in Mount Moon, and some of their future adventures that later were actually experienced by them.  Talk a bit about spoiler territory.\n</p><p>Sonichu and Rosey both learned how to become better leaders and fighters with the help of Christian/Christine-Chan (my C-197 self-counterpart), Magi-Chan Sonichu (Prime), and from other inspirational Heroes, including Link and Princess Zelda of Hyrule, themselves.  Zelda gifted the really big book of Prophecies and Histories from Hyrule's perspective, since it also had prophecies about the Sonichus and Rosechus and the Ultimate Emerald, Master Emeralds, Chaos Emeralds, Chaos Crystal (S-Chu) Balls, and so on in it.\n</p><p>In 2014, Cera Rosechu, Roberta Sonichu and Christine Rosechu (Sonichu Prime and Rosey Rosechu Prime's daughters) went out on their own Pokemon Adventure all throughout the USA; 24 Badges, Three Elite Teams, and the three of them became able to Mega Evolve after finding their respective destined Sonichite and Rosechite (Mega Stones).  Cera becomes Electric/Fighting, Christine becomes Electric/Fairy, and Roberta becomes Electric/Psychic.  Robbie knew a lot more than you all may think and knew.  And they find the unique Legendary Pokemon of the States; all seven of them to summon the eighth Legendary Pokemon.\n</p><p>Punchy Sonichu was hatched in Japan and learned, wrote and spoke in Japanese, except he was named Pun-Chai Sonichu, trained hard under the various self-defenses, including karate and samurai arts.  He fought in many a Fighting Championship, including with those you know of in Street Fighter series, including Ryu, Chun-Li and Akuma, and come out on top and top ranks.  IF he was in the realm of Mortal Kombat, he would survive and win as well.  He can easily match the mach punches of the fastest Machamp as well.  He had been summoned to Cwcville by an Alakazam in Cwcville's Psychic Squadron under Magi-Chan's request before Sonichu and Rosey arrived in Cwcville in 2003.  Punchy is quite a metaphysical, spiritual and strong warrior and individual.\n</p><p>Magi-Chan Sonichu Prime (the Prime of all Magi-Chan Sonichus throughout the Multiverse) had seen a lot of adventures and development in his psychic developments.  He had gone to the past, died and resurrected in a couple of days by his own will and power, and came back to the present day he came from.  And that was the First time that happened to him; it doesn't happen many times, but he always heals his body and comes right back within faster times.  And that is aside from the Respawn ability with the generators within the Poke Balls linked with each and every Special Sonichu, Rosechu, Metonic, Vamprosa, Sonee and Rosey.  Just as good as Dr. Wolf's Respawn Generator on the TF2 field.  Magi-Chan had organized the Psychic Squadron over a matter of years with the help of the city that would become Cwcville.\n</p><p>Robert Franklin Chandler, Jr. became Mayor of Cwcville by Godly Divine Decree and Order around when Chris started going to Providence Middle School.  That same order brought Chris to become Mayor after he graduated from Manchester High School in 2000, yet he still attended Piedmont Virginia Community College in Charlottesville, eventually relocating his education to PVCC in Cwcville.\n</p><p>Mary Lee Walsh and Count Graduon overtook the Charlottesville campus in August, 2003.\n</p><p>Blake Sonichu is further expanded, as well as the development of the relationship between him and Bubbles Rosechu.  She gifted him a very special message-engraved bracelet that helped him to realize the Team Rocket he was with was not the team to be on long-term.\n</p><p>Liquid Chris Sonichu was a member of Team Rocket as well; he had been there a year or two before he was out on the field spying on Sonichu and Rosey back in February, 2003.\n</p><p>Naitsirhc was a son of a rich family, but he left them at the age of 7 and was picked up by Team Rocket, and adopted by Giovanni, himself, when he showed his moxie and bad ass ways.  Silver, Giovanni's son was jealous.  Yet Naitsirhc managed to do a lot more than Silver could do.\n</p><p>And lastly, for now: The Ultimate Emerald is a God Powered Emerald, more powerful than the eight Master Emeralds.  It was the central power gem with each of the eight Master Emeralds surrounding it like points on a compass.  In around 450 B.C., the Ultimate Emerald had shattered, and it left the Eight Chaos Emeralds.  Eight, Not Seven; the Eighth one is Orange, and is more elusive compared to the other seven.  When the Ultimate Emerald shattered and the Chaos Emeralds dispersed, so did the eight Ultimate Emeralds, with the Green one ending up on what would become Angel Island with the Echidna Tribe.  And the Core Energy of the Ultimate Emerald ended up within the Core of the One Avatar of all existence, and the Ultimate Emerald has been restored within the past couple of years from September, 2024 and resonates between both the C-197 and 1218 halves of this very Earth.  The Chaos Emeralds and Chaos Crystal Balls continue to be about and do as they will and need to keep and restore order when chaos and discord is afoot.  Knuckles' Master Emerald, aside, the Master Sunston on Flame the Sunbird's island is one of the other Master Emeralds, albeit reshaped to be like the evolution sun stone.  That Master Emerald promotes growth, prosperity and development.  The Cyan Master Emerald is housed in Cwcville on a dedicated alter and under protection within the expansive Cwcville Park just north-east of the Cwcville Basillicomm.  The remaining five are around the world on their respective alters under guard by a Special Sonichu or Rosechu, as well as the Psychic Squadron division located in those respective countries.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n</p>\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"navbox\" style=\";\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"padding:2px;\">\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"nowraplinks collapsible autocollapse\" style=\"width:100%;background:transparent;color:inherit;;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<th class=\"navbox-title\" colspan=\"2\" style=\";background:#00FBFE;\"><div style=\"float:left; width:6em;text-align:left;\"> <span class=\"noprint plainlinksneverexpand\" style=\"white-space:nowrap; font-weight:normal; font-size:xx-small; ;background:#00FBFE;;border:none;;\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Template:CwclightBlog\" title=\"Template:CwclightBlog\"><span style=\";background:#00FBFE;;border:none;;\" title=\"View this template\">v</span></a> <span style=\"font-size:80%;\">•</span> <a class=\"new\" href=\"/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:CwclightBlog&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" title=\"Template talk:CwclightBlog (page does not exist)\"><span style=\"color:#002bb8;;background:#00FBFE;;border:none;;\" title=\"Discussion about this template\">d</span></a> <span style=\"font-size:80%;\">•</span> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"//sonichu.com/w/index.php?title=Template:CwclightBlog&amp;action=edit\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#002bb8;;background:#00FBFE;;border:none;;\" title=\"You can edit this template.
