Chris did these, as well as using some maladaptive coping mechanisms such as escapism and nostalgia. These tools, in moderation, can relieve stress, but Chris takes them to unhealthy levels. Coping is used to only temporarily relieve stress so a person can gather themselves and go finish the stressful task. Instead, Chris uses coping mechanisms for months on end and gets nothing done.\n</p><p>For someone who effectively does nothing, Chris leads a very <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_stress\" title=\"Chris and stress\">stressful life</a>, and takes escapism very seriously. The most notable example of escapism includes <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a>, a fictional city that Chris believes to be real, along with his <a href=\"/cwcki/Imaginary_friends\" title=\"Imaginary friends\">imaginary friends</a>... and no, that is not roleplaying; Chris truly believes that CWCville and <a href=\"/cwcki/Electric_Hedgehog_Pok%C3%A9mon\" title=\"Electric Hedgehog Pokémon\">his characters</a> are real (in both <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/C-197\" title=\"C-197\">C-197</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Dancing_with_Magi-Chan\" title=\"Dancing with Magi-Chan\">1218</a>).\n</p><p>Chris also shows signs of avoidance behaviors (the act of avoiding stressful situations or feelings), he claims his fictional concept of <a href=\"/cwcki/Dimensional_Merge\" title=\"Dimensional Merge\">Dimensional Merge</a> will fix all his problems and pay all his loans once it is complete.\n</p><p>Chris has also pushed <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Nostalgia\" title=\"Nostalgia\">nostalgia</a> as far as possible: decades after leaving high school, his mind is still fixated on the positive events that occurred at the time. Recently, Chris bought a school desk, probably to help relive the gal-pal filled days.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Chris_.27dusting_himself_off.27\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris_'dusting_himself_off'\">Chris 'dusting himself off'</span></h2>\n<p>In the years and months prior to <a href=\"/cwcki/September_2011\" title=\"September 2011\">September 2011</a>, Chris displayed some degree of being able to move on and away from <a href=\"/cwcki/Julie_Reveals_Herself\" title=\"Julie Reveals Herself\">traumatic events</a> in his life; he'd simply try to throw the events in question to one side before becoming engrossed in whichever new <a href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart\" title=\"Sweetheart\">Sweetheart</a> or <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Troll\" title=\"Troll\">Troll</a> crossed his field of vision. Following the death of <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler\" title=\"Bob Chandler\">his father</a> however, Chris has lost this coping mechanism. After a protracted period of grieving, Chris instead began using maladaptive coping methods (excluding Flouncing and Death threats) that gradually evolved into their current state over the ensuing 8-9 years, among which are <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/escapism\" title=\"wikipedia:escapism\">escapism</a> (<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Astral_projection\" title=\"Astral projection\">Astral projection</a>, the <a href=\"/cwcki/Dimensional_Merge\" title=\"Dimensional Merge\">Dimensional Merge</a>), <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalization_(psychology)\" title=\"wikipedia:Rationalization (psychology)\">rationalization</a> (\"I can't go to BABScon because of <a href=\"/cwcki/COVID-19\" title=\"COVID-19\">COVID-19</a>, so it must be a part of the merge!\"), <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dissociation\" title=\"wikipedia:dissociation\">dissociation</a> and <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_behaviors_(anxiety)\" title=\"wikipedia:Safety behaviors (anxiety)\">safety behaviors</a> (<a href=\"/cwcki/Spirit_possession\" title=\"Spirit possession\">Spirit possession</a>), and <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sensitization\" title=\"wikipedia:sensitization\">sensitization</a> (i.e. flipping out over blocks on <a href=\"/cwcki/Twitter\" title=\"Twitter\">Twitter</a>, resulting in the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Soft_Exile\" title=\"Soft Exile\">Soft Exile</a>).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Nostalgia\">Nostalgia</span></h2>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_nostalgia\" title=\"Chris and nostalgia\">Chris and nostalgia</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>Like many people, Chris has a strong sense of nostalgia for past events. <i>Unlike</i> many people, Chris has used nostalgia as a crutch, and prefers to retreat into his rose-tinted view of the past instead of confronting issues facing him in the present day.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Death_threats\">Death threats</span></h2>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Death_threats\" title=\"Death threats\">Death threats</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>One of Chris's most vociferous coping mechanisms, and one that, alongside Flouncing, predates the newer examples.

In these cases, Chris only intended to make the internet <i>think</i> he had quit, and hoped that by lying low, the Trolls would disappear. However, trolls would quickly <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Manipulate\" title=\"Manipulate\">manipulate</a> Chris back online by using an undercover troll posing as his real life friends to convince him that another <a href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart\" title=\"Sweetheart\">sweetheart</a> had been confirmed to be legitimate, and the sweetheart would in turn convince Chris to make more videos. In the case of the <a href=\"/cwcki/YouTube_Finale\" title=\"YouTube Finale\">first instance of Chris flouncing</a>, he returned after a mere <i>36 hours</i> to <a href=\"/cwcki/Cleveland_Show_Voice_Rant\" title=\"Cleveland Show Voice Rant\">ramble about a <i>Family Guy</i> spinoff</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Escapism\">Escapism</span></h2>\n<p>Chris has long used escapism as a maladaptive coping mechanism against <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Reality\" title=\"Reality\">reality</a>.\n</p><p>Even in his younger adult years, Chris took escapism to unhealthy levels, such as believing to have <a href=\"/cwcki/Imaginary_friends\" title=\"Imaginary friends\">imaginary friends</a> and magic powers, especially in moments of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress\" title=\"Stress\">stress</a>, like during <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Mary Lee Walsh</a>'s confrontation over his <a href=\"/cwcki/Attraction_Sign\" title=\"Attraction Sign\">Attraction Signs</a>. Chris's habit of escapism greatly ramped up in the years following his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Father\" title=\"Father\">father</a>'s 2011 death. By 2017, he was invested further in trying to learn psychic powers and believed that imaginary friend <a href=\"/cwcki/Magi-Chan\" title=\"Magi-Chan\">Magi-Chan</a> was tangible and dancing with him at the 2017 <a href=\"/cwcki/BronyCon\" title=\"BronyCon\">BronyCon</a>.\n</p><p>In late 2017, the <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys</a> exploited Chris's habit of escapism to <a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_beliefs_brainwashed_into_Chris\" title=\"List of beliefs brainwashed into Chris\">brainwash</a> their beliefs over his fantasy world, followed by a parade of copycats. As a result of their manipulation - and even with the attempts by the <a href=\"/cwcki/Guard_Dogs\" title=\"Guard Dogs\">Guard Dogs</a> to repair some of the damage the Idea Guys had dealt to Chris's psyche - Chris opted to retreat further into the wreckage of his imagination and the fantasies associated with it, now believing in concepts such as <a href=\"/cwcki/Polyamorous_marriage\" title=\"Polyamorous marriage\">polyamorous marriage</a>, the <a href=\"/cwcki/Dimensional_Merge\" title=\"Dimensional Merge\">Dimensional Merge</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/CPU\" title=\"CPU\">CPU</a> goddesses.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Roleplaying\">Roleplaying</span></h3>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Spirit_possession\" title=\"Spirit possession\">Spirit possession</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Possessed_Chris.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"287\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/c/c5/Possessed_Chris.jpg/300px-Possessed_Chris.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/c/c5/Possessed_Chris.jpg/450px-Possessed_Chris.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/c/c5/Possessed_Chris.jpg/600px-Possessed_Chris.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Possessed_Chris.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div><s>Roleplaying as</s> Possessed by Magi-chan</div></div></div>\n<p>Chris has a history of roleplaying.

In a <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_Cums_for_a_Cat\" title=\"CWC Cums for a Cat\">phonesex conversation</a>, Chris roleplayed as Sonichu for sexual pleasure. In the 2010s and beyond, he roleplayed to escape reality.

He also uses his sock puppet account, MagiChan111448, for roleplaying as Magi-chan; how Magi-chan types without a body is something only Emmanuelle would know. He started to role play Sonichu from 15 April 2020 (he claimed to be possessed since 31 March 2020) as a coping mechanism for the cancellation of BABScon.

A popular example of this kind of behavior is when an author makes themselves a major component of their story, and gives themselves unlimited power over an unfavorable situation they'd encounter. Such characters, which are examples of self-inserts, are often referred to as \"Mary Sues\", \"Marty Stus\", or \"Gary Stus\" among fan circles. While most people have indulged in power fantasies in their life, Chris's maladaptive daydreaming has taken his adherence of such fantasies to a truly unhealthy level.\n</p><p>One of the best examples of this is Chris coping with stressful situations through escapism by replicating them in his <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">comics</a>. Chris’s comics have served as an outlet to form a narrative centered around a stressful event, instead making everything work out as he would have wanted. Oftentimes, the people who gave him a hard time would be depicted as villains, while Chris or his lackeys would prove to be powerful enough to defeat them with ease.\n</p><p>Chris originally centered these comics around his lovechild, Sonichu, where he would showcase his many adventures and overcome various bad guys. However, even this wouldn’t stop Chris from making the comics go full power fantasy at as early as the <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_0\" title=\"Sonichu 0\">very first issue</a>. From <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Issue_2\" title=\"Issue 2\">Issue 2</a> and onwards, Chris would then turn his comics into a power fantasy series, where he would be in direct control over all of the people who wronged him, and get all of the things he wants.\n</p><p>This type of behavior from Chris isn’t strictly limited to his comics.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"New_Age_methods\">New Age methods</span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:322px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Magi-chan_twitter_update.Sep_28,_2019.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"470\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/6/6e/Magi-chan_twitter_update.Sep_28%2C_2019.jpg/320px-Magi-chan_twitter_update.Sep_28%2C_2019.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/6/6e/Magi-chan_twitter_update.Sep_28%2C_2019.jpg/480px-Magi-chan_twitter_update.Sep_28%2C_2019.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/6/6e/Magi-chan_twitter_update.Sep_28%2C_2019.jpg 2x\" width=\"320\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Magi-chan_twitter_update.Sep_28,_2019.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>under</div></div></div>\n<p>Chris has also been utilizing several New Age concepts and beliefs in order to avoid reality and the stress caused by it, including (but not limited to) listening to <a href=\"/cwcki/Subliminal_Frequency_Hypnosis\" title=\"Subliminal Frequency Hypnosis\">Subliminal Frequency Hypnosis</a> videos, <a href=\"/cwcki/Spirit_possession\" title=\"Spirit possession\">larping as his</a> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/OCs\" title=\"OCs\">OCs</a>, and <a href=\"/cwcki/Meditation\" title=\"Meditation\">meditation</a>. Upon recently he has been using ways of <a href=\"/cwcki/Spirit_possession\" title=\"Spirit possession\">body-swapping</a> with a number of his OC's, including Magi-chan, Mewtwo, and most famously Sonichu. This is a tactic Chris uses in order to escape or get away from the stresses of life and the internet in which he creates, but how he does this is quite confusing yet idiotic. Apparently he takes on the OC's role and inadvertently swaps minds and bodies with the said OC in the sister dimension of C-197 which gives him a break in order to reevaluate his current situation. To him he thinks it works, but it is not subtle in the slightest and when he has been active on social media platforms like Twitter or Facebook, there have been times where Christorians noticed minor hints to his normal mannerisms such as his way of speech or downright forgetting that he's in Sonichu's body. It happens in times where Chris is feeling overwhelmed where he almost metaphorically retracts into his delusional shell from the world, and there have been times where he has done this for long periods of time, the longest being nearly a year.
