I want to let you know about something, I was sent to TMG to learn more about the possible return of Tari and Rei Ryghts being up to something with the Atari VCU. The CPUs' suspicions were correct from what we were able to get from what I learned during my time there. Amy Rose stayed the remainder of the convention to attend the remaining events and listen on the talk and gossip. We need to make the presence of the Nation of Comma, and the CPU of the Commodore Consoles, Scarlet, spread far and wide everywhere. Her Memories HAVE been bestowed to someone in this world of ours;\n</p><p>Scarlet is Kind and Compassionate; she is the counter to Rei Ryghts, should and when Rei attempt something to resurrect her lost Nation.\n</p><p>Scarlet Will help us against Rei Ryghts. Remember to share some prayers with the CPUs. Also, tell everyone to give their Full Support to Commodore on their Next Console, which will be named the Commodore CW. Let Commodore know that the console SHOULD have a Serial Port for the Floppy Driveand Printer, a port for the Cassette Drive, a Cartridge Port for their old Cartridges, as well as a Blu-Ray Drive for all media discs. As well as an HDMI Output AND Input, and a Component Output. Their old Cartridges, as well as a Blu-Ray Drive for all media discs. As well as an HDMI Output AND Input, and a Component Output. Their controller should be reminiscent of the Commodore Logo in shape, with pattern of the typical controller, I like the Xbox controller scheme the “C” half facing outward from the player, following the controller for it, and it should be wireless with the USB cable port. And a USB input and output ports for media input and backup, and even hooking up to a PC or Laptop for using either as a monitor. The console should take the shape and form of the Classic Keyboard Console, Complete with the Keyboard. Online functions, downloadable games, and plenty Independent game Titles for the CCW. And the media of their new games should be Physical And Downloadable; I really like using the Cartridges for their games. And the price should be less than $400 on the finished console product. And they should take their time in fully developing, designing, assembling, testing and getting all the bugs out before making it available for sale.\n</p><p>Versus the Atari VCU, the Commodore CW Should be a Greater Success!
