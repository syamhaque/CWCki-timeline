Hey my name is Mao and I'm interviewing the great creator of Asperchu, Alec.\n</p><p><font color=\"#8B8000\"><b>Alec</b>:</font> Good evening <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Mao\" title=\"Mao\">Mao</a>, how are you doing?\n</p><p><font color=\"#04B45F\"><b>Mao</b>:</font> I'm doing fantastic, anyways.. \n</p><p><font color=\"#8B8000\"><b>Alec</b>:</font> That- that's great\n</p><p><b>awkward pause...</b>\n</p><p><font color=\"#04B45F\"><b>Mao</b>:</font> Yeah this is not gonna work *they both laugh* anyway *Alec says they need to be prepared* so I got some questions for you, just some quick questions that fans always bother me with.\n</p><p><font color=\"#8B8000\"><b>Alec</b>:</font> Well well you know I'm always happy to answer questions from my fans without them I wouldn't be where I am today.\n</p><p><font color=\"#04B45F\"><b>Mao</b>:</font> Wha- why do you think you’re so popular?\n</p><p><font color=\"#8B8000\"><b>Alec</b>:</font> Well I think umm there’s several reasons why I am popular. Uhh first and foremost of course because I’m umm a very talented artist, and umm I’m very good at story telling. Umm but almost on par with that I am certain is that I care about my fans and I try to include my fans in the creative process, and uhh I am very responsive and respectful of my fans and uhh that’s actually probably the favorite part I have of the entire <a href=\"/cwcki/Asperchu\" title=\"Asperchu\">Asperchu</a> experience is responding to my fans or critiques and compliments. More compliments than anything else really. \n</p><p><font color=\"#04B45F\"><b>Mao</b>:</font> That’s great it’s always nice to have someone who like actually cares about their fans instead of ignore them outright or just stop doing their work. \n</p><p><font color=\"#8B8000\"><b>Alec</b>:</font> Yeah, you know I’m just here to.. I have a gift and umm if you don’t share your gift with the world then it goes to waste, and that’s just a terrible thing so I want to share that with as many people as I can. \n</p><p><font color=\"#04B45F\"><b>Mao</b>:</font> S’great. Another really popular question is who is your favorite character?\n</p><p><font color=\"#8B8000\"><b>Alec</b>:</font> Oh why you know umm I get asked this almost everyday and it’s a very difficult question. Of course Jivin jumps to you know the top list pretty quickly, he is definitely one of the fan favorites I probably get more letters about him than anyone else. Umm.. also umm I I like Jarman Gand who is uhh who is the dog that appears in my comic umm I recently Uhh I had I had <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler\">Christian Weston Chandler</a> claim that was his dog Patti. I’d like to issue a uh a clarification, that is not actually Jarman gand is named after uh a norse God of terror and destruction. Whereas <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Patti\" title=\"Patti\">Patti</a> is based off of Mr. Chandler’s deceased dog they’re totally not the same dog at all. \n</p><p><font color=\"#04B45F\"><b>Mao</b>:</font> Well speaking of Christian Weston Chandler, he’s been a vocal critic of Asperchu uh do you have a message for him or anything? \n</p><p><font color=\"#8B8000\"><b>Alec</b>:</font> Well I’d just like to say that um you you know a lot artists have to face criticism and detractors. Um uh honestly because of envy I think is it you know Chris was actually he was a big inspiration for me in the beginning and I wrote to him numerous times to tell him how uh inspired I was and how thankful I was that he and <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a> were around to inspire me to greatness. The vast majority of those letters went completely ignored. In one or two instances he did respond mostly to either threaten my life or tell me he was sending the FBI to imprison me because I was attempting to be a good artist. Um I havent responded with my own videos mostly because I don’t really have the time. I spend my time working on my comic uh I’m not sure how Chris finds the time to upload so many videos threatening my life and other such acts of violence and anger, but you know, to each his own to each his own. If that’s what he feels he needs to do to make Sonichu the best that he can then um you know I certainly won't criticize that tactic. I prefer to draw my comic, I prefer to draw my comic and to listen to and respond to my fans. That's how I make Asperchu better, but you know again to each his own and every artist has his own process.\n</p><p><font color=\"#04B45F\"><b>Mao</b>:</font> Well I would like to thank you again for uh you know giving up some of your time to do this interview. \n</p><p><font color=\"#8B8000\"><b>Alec</b>:</font> Well you’re welcome like I said like I said um my fans come first and I know a lot of my fans want to know more about me and I’m happy to help them out. \n</p><p><font color=\"#04B45F\"><b>Mao</b>:</font> And finally uh do you have a message to all your fans?\n</p><p><font color=\"#8B8000\"><b>Alec</b>:</font> I I certainly do, I would just like to say that without my fans, I would not be where I am today, and I am thankful for each and every <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/True_and_honest\" title=\"True and honest\">true and honest</a> fan out there that has stuck with me from the beginning and I hope you will all continue to stick with me because Asperchu is..

I am Punchy Sonichu reporting for the great and gl- groroius Chinese peoples news paper about the Asperchu. \n</p><p><font color=\"#8B8000\"><b>Alec</b>:</font> Good evening Punchy, it’s a joy to speak with you this evening and I’m glad that uh Asperchu’s reach is uh going beyond America and is reaching um wider audiences across the world. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Punchy</b>:</font> Oh yes you know we rike to call it uh, asperchu couldn’t translate which is uh Chinese for grorious regend of asperchu one and only hedgehog <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Pokemon\" title=\"Pokemon\">pokemon</a> with aspergers. \n</p><p><font color=\"#8B8000\"><b>Alec</b>:</font> Well you know that’s, that’s a very um nice title and I always.. languages are a passion of mine and it always is uh very uh amazing. Just just how the emotion and the passion gets translated when things like titles um you know get turned into other languages. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Punchy</b>:</font> Ah so so so, we are very happy you know we notice you have a excerrent job of capture Chinese culture with this.. Punchy character. I am a so honored that you’re able to get so much rearity of Chinese in there. It was rike rooking in a mirror when I was leading the comic. \n</p><p><font color=\"#8B8000\"><b>Alec</b>:</font> Well thank you, uh like I said uh languages are a passion of mine, but it goes beyond that I very much enjoy learning other people and cultures in the world. Uh and I try to bring a bit of that into asperchu because um I like to entertain my audiences but it’s also important I think to help my audiences learn and to educate them. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Punchy</b>:</font> Ah good good. So what do you think of uh communism?\n</p><p><font color=\"#8B8000\"><b>Alec</b>:</font> Well um it’s a form of government that um is I’ll.. I’ll admit it’s not my favorite. I prefer to have you know a uh liberal democracy where everyone uh has their- has the right to vote and uh has full freedom um you know regardless of race, creat, or color. Um uh Christian Weson Chandler I know has.. Has a communist dictatorship that he uh uses as the main form of government in his city of <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a> and um actually that was part of the inspiration for why I wanted to make my city Albville into a democracy because I felt it was a good way to contrast the two forms of government. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Punchy</b>:</font> Oh ho ho ho ho so tricky but very good. Okay for a second question, this one most important to China and Asia as a whole, what is your favorite type of lice? \n</p><p><font color=\"#8B8000\"><b>Alec</b>:</font> I like good old fashioned white rice. I think it’s the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Health\" title=\"Health\">healthiest</a> for you, and uh I like to put soy sauce on it or or possibly um Lian Chin’s duck sauce. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Punchy</b>:</font> Oh hoooo rian chin duck sauce, very tasty now- *he gets cut off by Alec*\n</p><p><font color=\"#8B8000\"><b>Alec</b>:</font> Yes like I said, like I said I’m very uh affluent with um uh with foreign cultures and foods. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Punchy</b>:</font> Ho good, now for my rast question *inaudible of what he says* great or greatest mode of transportation ever invented? \n</p><p><font color=\"#8B8000\"><b>Alec</b>:</font> Definitely the greatest form of transportation ever invented. Your question um is actually it’s almost eerie how prophetic that question is because uh in the next issue, issue number two of asperchu I am going to be introducing a public transportation system composed of uh Sonichus pulling people in rickshaws. *punchy does another “oh ho”* It’s just uh it’s an improvement for Albville um that I wanted to bring in. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0000\"><b>Punchy</b>:</font> That so good well tank you very much for talking.\n</p><p><font color=\"#8B8000\"><b>Alec</b>:</font> You’re welcome I I enjoy spending as much time as I can uh talking with my fans both uh you know home side and in other countries.\n</p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCached time: 20250712014942\nCache expiry: 86400\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: []\nCPU time usage: 0.076 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.081 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 271/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 5803/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 1160/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 9/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/100\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 1296/5000000 bytes\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   19.068      1 -total\n 84.21%   16.057      2 Template:Infobox/video\n 24.38%    4.649      2 Template:Asperchu\n 14.12%    2.693      1 Template:AbsentChris\n 13.34%    2.543     24 Template:Pipe\n 12.77%    2.436      1 Template:Icon\n-->\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key cwcki-1_:pcache:idhash:40463-0!canonical and timestamp 20250712014942 and revision id 347094.
