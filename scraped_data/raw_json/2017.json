Chris's views on <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">homos</a> continued to evolve, as evidence by an <a href=\"/cwcki/January_2017_Facebook_Posts#Open_letter_to_Barron_Trump\" title=\"January 2017 Facebook Posts\">open letter to President Trump's son</a>, in which Chris commented about losing his homophobia while urging Barron not to become a \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_hypocrisy\" title=\"Chris and hypocrisy\">Super Stereotypical, Spiteful and Egotistical Male</a>\" like the elder Trump.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"February\">February</span></h2>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/February_2017\" title=\"February 2017\">February 2017</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Love_is_love_2017_1.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"200\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/9/93/Love_is_love_2017_1.jpg/300px-Love_is_love_2017_1.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/9/93/Love_is_love_2017_1.jpg/450px-Love_is_love_2017_1.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/9/93/Love_is_love_2017_1.jpg/600px-Love_is_love_2017_1.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Love_is_love_2017_1.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Chris, in February.

He also revealed that several changes had occurred in his imaginary town since the last update. Namely, he had stepped down as mayor and <a href=\"/cwcki/Allison_Amber\" title=\"Allison Amber\">Allison Amber</a> had taken his place. \n</p><p>There were also bizarre new insights into his personal life. He theorized that he had a fetish for <a href=\"/cwcki/Sailor_Moon\" title=\"Sailor Moon\">Sailor Moon</a> music, posted that he was used to skunk odor (and compared it to perfume and cologne) and liked a <a href=\"/cwcki/Subliminal_Frequency_Hypnosis\" title=\"Subliminal Frequency Hypnosis\">Subliminal Frequency Hypnosis</a> video purporting to transfer fat from his belly to his butt as part of a D.I.Y. gender transition treatment.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"March\">March</span></h2>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/March_2017\" title=\"March 2017\">March 2017</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Fight_like_a_girl_meme.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"300\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/0/04/Fight_like_a_girl_meme.jpg/300px-Fight_like_a_girl_meme.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/0/04/Fight_like_a_girl_meme.jpg/450px-Fight_like_a_girl_meme.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/0/04/Fight_like_a_girl_meme.jpg/600px-Fight_like_a_girl_meme.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Fight_like_a_girl_meme.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Chris can <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_Fighter\" title=\"CWC Fighter\">fight like a girl</a></div></div></div>\n<p>Chris began March by listing <a href=\"/cwcki/Stamps\" title=\"Stamps\">stamps</a> from his late father's collection on eBay. He repeatedly lied throughout the month that the money would go to <a href=\"/cwcki/Financhu_Crisis\" title=\"Financhu Crisis\">bills and debtor payments</a> - he had actually wasted the profit on toys and video games. Within a week, he had obliterated his profit and was in the red, leading him to beg on Facebook for more sales. White knights quickly bailed him out, raising $41.50 in a single day for him.\n</p><p>He briefly mentioned the world of <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a> again, as part of a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Business\" title=\"Business\">business</a> plan to advertise his stamp sales. On St. Patrick's Day, he posted a drawing of <a href=\"/cwcki/Son-Chu\" title=\"Son-Chu\">Son-Chu</a>, leading to speculation about his reasons. A few days later, he set the record straight on his artistic inspiration for Son-Chu after reading the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCki\" title=\"CWCki\">CWCki</a>'s article on it, posting a screenshot from the article onto his Facebook, in addition to two prototype designs of Son-Chu. A week later, on 27 March, he revealed a silhouette photo of a Son-Chu figure, as well as a picture of his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Skylanders_avatar\" title=\"Skylanders avatar\">Skylanders avatar</a> and declared that those would be featured as prizes for a raffle to be held until <a href=\"/cwcki/Honor_roll\" title=\"Honor roll\">31 April</a>. It led to another boost in sales, earning him $69.50 in revenue over the next five days.\n</p><p>Chris rediscovered Twitter, clocking in at 68 tweets throughout the month. His messages were generally directed to voice actresses from <a href=\"/cwcki/My_Little_Pony\" title=\"My Little Pony\">My Little Pony</a> and DoopieDoOver (an animator and voice actress for the Planet Dolan YouTube series), and he also responded to a couple of trolls who had questioned his lesbian soul and asked his audience for opinions on a good 3D-scanning app for his phone..

Fittingly, he and Barb hit new levels of fiscal incompetence.\n</p><p>Barb failed to budget for payments to Seterus, Inc. (a company specializing in high-risk loans, acting as a middleman between her and the mortgage company, Sunstone). As a result, her bank account was left in the red by over $800. After Chris became aware of it, he noticed that his friends on Facebook (including a real-life, non-troll friend) were suggesting that he get a job, and he went on a tirade in response.\n</p><p>Hoping to raise money, Chris listed the infamous <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_Totem\" title=\"Sonic Totem\">Sonic Totem</a> relic on eBay, asking for $1,500. eBay member <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://feedback.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewFeedback2&amp;userid=ashuraglitch&amp;ftab=FeedbackAsBuyer&amp;searchInterval=30\" rel=\"nofollow\">ashuraglitch</a> purchased it less than four hours later. However, Chris immediately wasted $1,150 from the sale on a <a href=\"/cwcki/$400_gold_necklace\" title=\"$400 gold necklace\">$400 gold necklace</a> for Barb and $750 worth of Skylanders products for a raffle contest he was holding. Over the next few days, he spent even more money on his own bills and could not afford to ship the Totem to ashuraglitch.\n</p><p>Halfway through the month, Barb begged on camera for the fourth time during the Financhu Crisis, claiming to need money for an overdue electrical bill, while wearing the newly-bought <a href=\"/cwcki/$400_gold_necklace\" title=\"$400 gold necklace\">$400 gold necklace</a>.\n</p><p>Eventually, Barb solved their problems by digging into their life insurance, after Chris's fans refused to bail him out of the financial hole and ashurasglitch opened an eBay dispute against him for failing to ship the Totem. Naïve to the how close they came to financial ruin, Chris continued frivolously spending money, ordering a Unicorn Frappuccino from Starbucks using the new supply of cash.\n</p><p>Looking for more stuff to sell, Chris found <a href=\"/cwcki/The_Classic\" title=\"The Classic\">The Classic</a> shirt, thought to have been lost in the <a href=\"/cwcki/2014_house_fire\" title=\"2014 house fire\">2014 house fire</a>, casually mentioning in his sales pitch that it had been found in a hoard of ruined clothing, which was still wet from firefighters' efforts to combat the house fire. Chris, naïve to the concept of mold, had gone digging anyway, and complained later of a sore throat from the \"dirt\" and \"wall lining\". He listed the shirt for $12,000 minimum, and trolls bid it to $25,100. April concluded with Chris making efforts to restore the damaged shirt.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"May\">May</span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:202px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:CWCTheClassic1.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"267\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/8/85/CWCTheClassic1.jpg/200px-CWCTheClassic1.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/8/85/CWCTheClassic1.jpg/300px-CWCTheClassic1.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/8/85/CWCTheClassic1.jpg/400px-CWCTheClassic1.jpg 2x\" width=\"200\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:CWCTheClassic1.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Chris in May 2017, wearing $25,101 of clothes</div></div></div>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/May_2017\" title=\"May 2017\">May 2017</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>Chris repaired <a href=\"/cwcki/The_Classic\" title=\"The Classic\">The Classic</a> and hoped to sell it for thousands of dollars.
