So to just to the chase here I'd just say go for it.

Yeah, but anyway I was, anyway I was, still feeling like insecure about the trip, especially since like uh, you know even though I am an adult, I should respect my mother's and my father's wishes. And uh, still a little bit on the, you know, still gonna need a few-few dollars to get me to uh, Cleveland.<br/>\n<b>1Fan</b>: Chris, I'm gonna say this.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> Yes. I'm listening.<br/>\n<b>1Fan</b>: If you truly love someone. Truly in your heart love someone, no force in the world, be it distance, be it a physical obstacle, anything, can stop you from being with that person. And protecting that person that you care about that much. This is one of life's little tests, Chris. And you need to take it head on.<br/>\n<b>Fan</b>: Yeah.

I mean love is priceless, but you know, I have to do all the work to uh, get there.<br/>\n<b>Fan</b>: Chris? Chris, what kind of mileage does your car get?<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> 35 highway. 25 city.<br/>\n<b>High-pitched fan</b>: That's pretty good!<br/>\n<b>Fan</b>: I wouldn't worry about it.

I mean I know, I mean I understand she's in a situation like, \"cut the umbilical cord\" you would say, I'm sure. But still, I have to respect my mother, very much.<br/>\n<b>1Fan</b>: Well, Chris, you, you pay them for your room and board, right?<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> Yeah.<br/>\n<b>1Fan</b>: Is there anything they do to support you that you don't pay for?

And I'm gonna go on a rant here. Chris, I'm going to tell you a little story. Um, I've had the same problem back when I was younger, but, it was back when I was 18...<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> <i>[Interrupts]</i> Alright but uh, alright...<br/>\n<b>1Fan</b>: When I turned 18. Let me tell you this, because it's very relevant to the situation.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> Let me just say, uh, a thing though. It's like, I don't want to leave home without saying goodbye, though. That's not the kind of person I am. It's like I want to give my mom at least a notice-amount of time that, like, y'know, I'm going over to Cleveland, and I wanna uh, make sure I have uh, her uh, consent, like you know, she's saying \"it's alright, have a safe trip, come back soon.\" It's not like uh, I mean at this point she's like uh, she doesn't want me to go. But I'm just sayin'. Hey, unmute the rascal, please.<br/>\n<b>1Fan</b>: <i>[Laughs once]</i><br/>\n<b>Muffled Fan</b>: It was just echo.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> Oh uh, I'm sorry.

[pause]<br/>\n<b>Muffled Fan</b>: You know, a little bit of planning if it's only gonna be so many days, you're only gonna spend this much money [inaudible] it's-it's really not hard to plan a trip, I've taken tons.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> Yeah, but also, you know she does worry about me and I could be set up to be hurt, or turned into the police and arrested when I get there.<br/>\n<b>Fan</b>: What would you have to do to be taken by the police?<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> Yeah, but also, uh, same thing happened before when I was about to go to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Blanca\" title=\"Blanca\">Blanca</a>. My mom didn't want me to go because it could have been a setup, like she would have been setting me up, like she would have been <a href=\"/cwcki/Pedofork\" title=\"Pedofork\">underaged</a>, and then right there I'd be turned into the police.<br/>\n<b>Fan</b>: That's entrapment, Chris.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> Yeah, but y'know, I can tell in my heart that Julie is 19. I mean, I'm sure that Max can vouch for her age. Because you know, even though she did send me her ID, her scanned ID as an image, her birthdate is blurred out. So it's hard to tell the year.<br/>\n<b>Fan</b>: Besides Chris, have you ever seen <i><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Catch_a_Predator\" title=\"wikipedia:To Catch a Predator\">To Catch a Predator</a>?</i> Whenever they do their sting operations, they always have their fake underage boy or girl, whatever, always tells the person multiple times that they are not of legal age, it's like \"Oh yeah, you know I'm 13 right?\" And the person doesn't care. Which is why they get caught with child pornography or whatever charges they get caught on.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> Alright, well, she repeatedly told me, she repeatedly informed me she was 19.<br/>\n<b>Fan</b>: So if it was in fact a sting operation of some kind, you would be charged with nothing. Because you were not told she was underage. Besides, all of us already know she actually is 19.<br/>\n<b>Fan</b>: Mmm hm.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> Alright. Yeah. Yeah. Wait a moment, I'll be right back, okay? I'll be right back.<br/>\n<b>High-pitched troll</b>: Anyone know how to do quadratic equations?<br/>\n<b>Fan</b>: I haven't done those since I was in high school. I don't remember.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> <i>[Sound of Chris clumsily sitting back down at his computer and letting out a small sigh]</i> I just went downstairs to see if I could bring my mom up here so she could talk to y'all but she's asleep right now.<br/>\n<font color=\"#D44942\"><b>Max</b>:</font> <i>[Diabolical laughter]</i><br/>\n<b>Fan</b>: What the?<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> Wait a minute, just a moment ago did I just hear Max, who quotes himself as being named Julie's brother, did he just give an evil laugh?<br/>\n<b>Fan</b>: I think so.<br/>\n<b>Fan</b>: Looks like it.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> Yeah, so that just brings up some suspicion right there. I mean I'm just doing... you did not have to mute him to hear what he had to say! Oh, he just told me on Skype he's watching <a href=\"/cwcki/Family_Guy\" title=\"Family Guy\">Family Guy</a>.<br/>\n<b>Fan</b>: Which episode?<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> He says \"Mine... thing is on voice activated\" Oh, it's the one... oh, I love that episode! It's the one where Meg sings. Becomes a pop star.

I know your mom's asleep, but...<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> I cannot do it now, I have to go to my aunt Corina's funeral this afternoon.<br/>\n<b>1Fan</b>: True. It's just kind of part of life.

I mean even Max will back me up on that.<br/>\n<b>1Fan</b>: Chris, what if she says no?<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> Really. Hmm. Really. Hmm. So what you're saying here is all the times I've received calls from trolls, telling me to F-off, or I'm a S-head, they've just been basically wanting me to prove myself and not out to hurt me or anything.<br/>\n<b>Fan</b>: Did you receive any calls today or something?<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> Yeah. It's just that I received a call earlier, and that's where I learned Max found <a href=\"/cwcki/For_Julie%27s_Eyes_Only\" title=\"For Julie's Eyes Only\">the video I sent to Julie of her own consent</a>, she asked me to send her a video, and then you see, he said it got uploaded to YouTube, so I assume that uh, I mean at first I was shocked but then realized that since her brother, uh, Max was a troll at himself at one point or another that he probably found it and uploaded it.<br/>\n<b>Fan</b>: Um, Chris.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> And also, on that note, the girl who called me to tell me about that, uh, accused Julie of being a troll herself on that note.<br/>\n<b>Fan</b>: Was she? She can't be a troll.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> Yeah, I know. I believed- I mean, I believe in Julie and I still believe in her that she is not a troll, and that she is a wonderful, sweet caring 19-year-old, who wrote me, who hand-wrote me a very nice letter, and sent it to me in the mail, and sent me her printed pictures that her friend took of her.<br/>\n<b>Fan</b>: Yeah. Yeah. She wouldn't be interested in trolling. She's been trolled all her life by the Georgian government. Based on what she told me.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> I'm sorry could you repeat that?<br/>\n<b>Fan</b>: She doesn't have time to be a troll, she's been trolled all her life by the Georgian government.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> The Georg- OH, the country of Georgia. Yeah, I did research on that when I was trying to find Molvanîa on a map.<br/>\n<b>Screwhead</b>: It's weird, my books, my old books have Molvanîa on the maps.<br/>\n<b>Fan</b>: You couldn't find it?<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> So wait a minute Screwhead, you're saying that you have a book, that has Molvanîa?<br/>\n<b>Fan</b>: That's funny, I was told it was unrecognized.<br/>\n<b>Screwhead</b>: I have old books, but maybe the Mexican government is to recognize a country. You know, different from the American government.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> Say, Screwhead, can you uh, can you uh, darn the echo, but anyway, could you find on the internet, a map of Molvanîa and its neighboring countries? I mean because I can tell right now that it's been neighboring Georgia. From what I understand, from what Julie told me, and her other friend told me as well.<br/>\n<b>Screwhead</b>: Chris, you know that Mexico's not a very developed country. It didn't have internet until a couple years ago. So I'm pretty sure that...<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> <i>[Loudly interrupts]</i> Yeah, I understand that, I understand, I also understand that Molvanîa's 50 miles radius.<br/>\n<b>Fan</b>: So I don't think I can find it.

What did they tell you?<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> Clyde was a [client?] among that group. Whole buncha stuff. They got to me emotionally. So it's hard for me to remember the details.<br/>\n<b>Fan</b>: Oh. I see. I'm sorry, Chris. You should enforce security on this channel.<br/>\n<b>1Fan</b>: Did you get any calls from the trolls today?<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> Yeah but ayway.

I'm just not in the mood to laugh right now.<br/>\n<b>1Fan</b>: Well, I mean, we don't blame you. It's kinda a serious situation you're in right now.<br/>\n<b>Fan</b>: I think I found the website. Hold on a second.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> Uh, don't worry about looking it.

I meant to tell you this earlier, but I mean I got kinda cut off.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> I understand, so, uh, what's the story?<br/>\n<b>1Fan</b>: I was in a similar situation as you. Um, not as serious as this but still in the whole case of um, y'know, having conflicting interests between parents and my own personal interests. Um, basically what it ended up with was, I left my house. Um, I had just turned eighteen and I didn't feel that a rule that was set by my parents was too logical, in a sense. It's like you can't enforce home rule- like, parental rules on a child if he's not a child anymore. So I was told \"don't come home.\" So I didn't. I stayed out of the house for almost a week. I survived off of twenty dollars, and stayed at a friend's house. Kept going to school and everything. Um, and one day my mom called me crying, apologizing for putting me through that. And since then she's had nothing but respect for me. Because she knows that if she were to do that again I could easily survive. And now you're in the same situation right now. Your mom is holding you back, she's holding you from getting what you want, getting what you need. And you really need to... you really need to break that. You need to cut that cord. And its gonna hurt at first, yeah. It's gonna hurt both of you. But once it's over with...<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> <i>[sighs heavily]</i><br/>\n<b>1Fan</b>: ...things will be much better, and you will both be so much happier, and you will have Julie.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> I see. Yeah. Alright. Yeah I just put up, I just co-I just put up a link to the route myself, it's the miscreant page I just found.<br/>\n<i>[pause]</i><br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> <i>[sigh]</i><br/>\n<b>Fan</b>: Found something? <i>[pause]</i> Oh...oh.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> Oh<br/>\n<b>F1</b>: Their leader is a cat<br/>\n<b>F2</b>: hahaha<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> A cat?<br/>\n<b>F2</b>: Yeah<br/>\n<b>F1</b>: I (something) these guys seriously because their leader is a cat<br/>\n<b>F2</b>: Yeah, their leader is a kitty. A fluffy kitty with a person (something)<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> [<i>sigh</i>] Well this... You Know that's funny because uh...

Clyde, you have...you just basically just want to test me for being a true person, and that's why you're holding Julie captive in your \"headquarters\".<br/>\n<font color=\"#009900\"><b>Clyde</b>:</font> She's not really captive, she's having the time of her life! We've given her every god damn loving you couldn't provide (<i>Evil laughter</i>)<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> Well, anyway uh...you basically want me to test my uh, love for-love for Julie's.
