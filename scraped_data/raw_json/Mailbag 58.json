It is hand-drawn and hand-colored so I think you would definitely approve of that. I drew it at school and did not have all my markers and pencils with me so it is only in two colors.

I want to draw your attention to a pretty serious matter though.\n</p><p>You claim to be a descendent to Anne Boleyn, but Anne Boleyn only had one child - Elizabeth Tudor, also known as Queen Elizabeth I of England. Her Majesty quite famously remained a virgin her entire life, something that we British people are very proud of. In fact we are so proud of her virginity that we named a part of America after it in honour of it: Virginia.\n</p><p>The state in which you live in is proof enough that you cannot be related to Queen Elizabeth I or Anne Boleyn. If you continue to say that you are, you will be tarnishing the good name of our most popular historic ruler. You are upsetting a lot of English people and causing them a great deal of stress and offence, and so I advise you to drop this foolish claim that any English person knows cannot be true.\n</p><p>I do not wish to cause you stress or offence Mr Chandler, but you need to be warned that you are causing the millions of British people worldwide undue amounts of mental trauma and disrespect.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #B48246; padding:5px; background-color:#FCC\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>From: Super Greg &lt;super_greg_ownsya_mom@hotmail.com&gt;\n<p>Hey Chris-Chan.

It's kind of silly that you assume I'm some kind of huge drug addict just because of my comic strip's subject matter. It would be like me assuming that you're actually a mayor of a city full of Pokemon and Transformers because that's what you write about in your comic.\n</p><p>Now that I think about it, do YOU smoke pot? It would explain the laziness, your weight, why you sit around playing video games all day, and your idea about cartoons being real in another dimension. Not that I have anything against pot, I just think people shouldn't blow their welfare money on drugs (video games, too).\n</p><p>Also, I'm finishing the Sonichu Christmas story. Mine is a lot more \"true and original\" than anything you've written. In mine, Sonichu and Rosechu live in a cheap motel and sell their bodies for crystal meth. I'm doing it now because real artists complete seasonal things months in advance, instead of waiting until mid-December to start working on Christmas stuff. Oh, and in your Christmas story nothing interesting or important happens, so there's no reason to read it. Your fans will enjoy my version much, much more. The opening pages are available on the Asperpedia, along with other comics that don't suck.\n</p><p>Sean\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #B48246; padding:5px; background-color:#FCC\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>From: <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiser_Wilhelm\" title=\"wikipedia:Kaiser Wilhelm\">Kaiser Wilhelm</a> &lt;worldwarfun@gmail.com&gt;\n<p>Why did you say Moon-Pals isn't any good because it's a parody?

I'm only asking because recently, one of them was not only fainted, but killed by an attack from a Voltorb. Voltorbs have a very low physical attack power, about equal to Luvdisc, a very feeble pokemon. Even a powerful move like Explosion wouldn't be very powerful against your average fully evolved Pokemon. Using <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Raichu\" title=\"Raichu\">Raichu</a> as an example, the average explosion from a Voltorb of equal level to a Raichu would leave a Raichu alive with energy to spare, and certainly not faint it, much less kill it.\n</p><p>My only conclusion from this is that <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichus</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu\" title=\"Rosechu\">Rosechus</a> are incredibly weak <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Pokemon\" title=\"Pokemon\">Pokemon</a>, and that it's probably a good thing that they are very fast, because if an attack ever struck them, they would probably die as easily as Simonla did.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>SONICHU AND ROSECHU ARE NOT WEAK.
