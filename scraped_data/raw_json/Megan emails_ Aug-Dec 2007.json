As her attempts to nicely tell Chris to stop touching and making advances on her constantly fell on deaf ears, she finally put on a more forceful tone here, and bluntly told Chris she dislikes his behavior – including his rage towards <a href=\"/cwcki/Adam_Stackhouse\" title=\"Adam Stackhouse\">Adam Stackhouse</a> during the <a href=\"/cwcki/Chop_Chop_Master_Onion%27s_Rap_Showdown\" title=\"Chop Chop Master Onion's Rap Showdown\">Master Onion contest</a> – and that he needs to stop. Chris (barely) seemed to get the message; yet, of course he'd manage to <a href=\"/cwcki/ShecameforCWC.JPG\" title=\"ShecameforCWC.JPG\">fuck things up again</a> not too long after.\n</p>\n<div

I looked at you in our photo ever since you left for Kentucky, and I get a happy feeling... from the feeling of having you to fall on when I feel low. You are such a delightful listener, and you are truly intelligent when you talk about what interests you and such.

First I'll start off with saying that I'm glad you didn't win the <a href=\"/cwcki/Chop_Chop_Master_Onion%27s_Rap_Showdown\" title=\"Chop Chop Master Onion's Rap Showdown\">contest</a> because I have no interest in going on a trip alone with someone who can't keep his hands off me. I'm not your girlfriend and I never will be. When I say \"don't touch me\" that means DON'T TOUCH ME! What may seem friendly to you is <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Fuck_Quest\" title=\"Fuck Quest\">sexual harrassment</a> to me. You whine that you're just being friendly but you obviously have no consideration for my feelings. The way you went off on Nina because she patted me on the head was very rude and uncalled for. Just because someone else has made physical contact with me doesn't give you the authority to do so. Remember, I have the right to decide who can come near me.\n</p><p>Also I can't say I like how you used my photo in your video and on the cover of your comic book. I want them removed from the internet immediately. Since I'm not a myspace member I can't view what you post. If there are any photos of me on your blog I want them removed.\n</p><p>And I don't like your <a href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Shrine\" title=\"Megan Shrine\">\"Megan Obsession\"</a> I don't like being <a href=\"/cwcki/Sailor_Megtune\" title=\"Sailor Megtune\">a character</a> in your <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\">comics</a>. I don't like how you made me a character in <a href=\"/cwcki/Soul_Calibur\" title=\"Soul Calibur\">Soulcalibur</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Animal_Crossing\" title=\"Animal Crossing\">Animal Crossing</a>. That kind of behavior really freaks me out.\n</p><p>With all that said, we're down to two options:<br/>\nA: We remain friends and ONLY friends period. As in no more touching me, following me, asking me personal questions, and giving me things. We can still battle and trade cards and talk.<br/>\n-or-<br/>\nB: Never see me again\n</p><p>I'm sorry it's come down to this but I've told you repeatedly in a nice way to stop, but you've never listened.\n</p><p>I hope you will finally take what I just said into serious consideration, and know now that if try your advances again I won't be very nice about it.\n</p><p>Please listen to me next time<br/>\n~Megan\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3><span id=\"Shit_hits_the_fan.2C_Chris_confesses_his_love\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Shit_hits_the_fan,_Chris_confesses_his_love\">Shit hits the fan, Chris confesses his love</span></h3>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>\n<p>−−−−−Original Message−−−−−<br/>\nFrom: CWCSonichu@aol.com<br/>\nTo: fourdogs4@sitestar.net<br/>\nSent: Tue, 7 Aug 2007 2:51:47 PM Eastern Daylight Time<br/>\nSubject: OUCH....My Heart...\n</p><p>Megan, sweetie, <a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_Chris%27s_lies\" title=\"List of Chris's lies\">I NEVER said anything about you being my \"girlfriend\"</a>; in the video, I said, \"The only song I know is 'Master Onion' which I got from a demo I borrowed from my friend, Megan.

Not knowing your current feelings, not knowing what else is going on in your world, not knowing if you and I are still the closest friends to have been for almost two whole years... is all a great weight on my still-recovering heart and my tearful soul... It's hard for me to enjoy things as I did while I knew you and I were sweet friends, and as I felt there could have been a strong foundation for my one bright future in this <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">cursed Autistic life</a>. But since I read that message last week and not having heard anything new from you, my faith for that future felt sooo lost; my faith in our friendship wained thin.\n</p><p><a href=\"/cwcki/Virgin_with_rage\" title=\"Virgin with rage\">I CAN'T LOSE YOU, Megan Schroeder</a>, you are the foundation of my happiness after the depression from my LONG, ENDURING <a href=\"/cwcki/Love_Quest\" title=\"Love Quest\">Love Quest</a>, you are the inspiration for me to carry on as I was able to for the past greater than a year and so on, you were the reason that I was able to shed fewest tears for that time.\n</p><p>Please, please, please, forgive me, let me know that you and I are still the closest friends, and don't deprive you and me of our fun by boycotting the Friday trips to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/The_Game_Place\" title=\"The Game Place\">the Game Place</a>.\n</p><p>Truly, I just would fall into an infinite sink-hole of depression if I lost you from my life, and it would be an unbearable tragedy... *sigh*\n</p><p>Please reply as soon as possible.\n</p><p>&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3.....&lt;3........&lt;.....3................\n</p><p>Christian Weston Chandler.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris_talks_about_another_contest_and_his_ENDURING_LOVE_QUEST\">Chris talks about another contest and his ENDURING LOVE QUEST</span></h3>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>\n<p>From: CWCSonichu@aol.com<br/>\nTo: fourdogs4@sitestar.net<br/>\nSubject: Hey, Megan<br/>\nDate: Fri, 31 Aug 2007 10:09 pm<br/>\nAttachments: Patti-Chan_Folklore_plus_details.jpg (238K), Patti-Chan_Folklore.jpg (111K)\n</p><p>I didn't get a chance to tell you, but it was truly good to see that you all got back safe from Kentucky...I truly did miss you.

That night, I realized it upon a Random Remembering, and I cried for a while, so did my mother after I had informed her. But we did realize that we talked about adopting a new dog on the date of the first anniversary.

It became kind of a ghost-town at the Game Place last Friday; most of the children left. It's too bad you didn't make it. Anyway, I wanted to let you know that I got a Piplup and Turtwig through SUCCESSFUL Trades through the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Trade_Station\" title=\"wikipedia:Global Trade Station\">GTS (Wi-Fi)</a>. Also, have you or John gone underground with the Explorers' Kit? I found 4 Skull Fossils, so I have 3 extra Craniados; if I don't get one through the GTS by the Friday after Thanksgiving (NO LEAGUE this coming Friday), I need the other fossil Pokemon of the Diamond/Pearl Generation (the one that evolves into Bastiedon). I will trade you or John a Craniados for that Fossil Pokemon. One more thing, please Show me a Palkia in my Diamond game, so I can try to get one through the GTS.\n</p><p>That's about it for now.
