Further subjects included a commentary on a credit increase discussed on <a href=\"/cwcki/Kiwi_Farms\" title=\"Kiwi Farms\">Kiwi Farms</a>; Chris spent of this increase on Transformers, and the other half on Barbara's declining health. Naturally, he reiterated a request for donations, as he had in his videos. Towards the end of the month, he posted a photograph of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bob\" title=\"Bob\">Bob</a> on Father's Day, which contrasted strangely with his earlier post suggesting he believed Bob was his uncle.

And it is not a waste. I have been in a meditative state, self reflecting and pondering. Among which, I have realized among my problems is lack of better self-motivation. In my subconscious are all of my fears and stresses. My creations, reputation, and life in general, are all still being met with mixed results; the bad half lingers. And at home, something that leaves me with a shock is inevitable, which drains me more quickly if the severity is high. And I find myself also stuck in a rut where I could be doing more work here, but something else comes up, or my ADD throws me a mental curveball towards a different focal point.\n</p><p>So, the question that I am still pondering: how do I better self-motivate, keep my waking energy focused on the required tasks that have yet to be completed at hand from creation, and how do I keep my set on blocking out stressed reactions to random inputs that would cause such?\n</p><p>Your answer may be \"Just Do It\", but with a creative mind with fickle energies and moods/emotions that are prone to easy distraction and drain, that Is the weakness set. And therefore the most difficult to pinpoint, identify and reprogram the mind to heal and counter all of that.\n</p><p>To put it in a way I believe you may relate with: your daily work in front of a computer with tasks simple to you with prior educations... Charts and Graphs that you have created with details of the company you work for. It all went smoothly for you. But, suddenly, you are met with a shock! Your lover has left you for another and will never return? The rent is Past Due with Final Notice? There is illness or maybe a death in the family? Or maybe your own mind has fallen into a dark void of being lost, blank and confused beyond your own belief and understanding for hardly a noticeable reason. The following day at your job, you sit there; looking at your monitor, but you are barely able to function, even while your own mind is conscious, stuck in a constant observation-only function. You feel like you can hardly move or think.\n</p><p>I do understand Everyone has their own set of stresses. And among the creative types who feel this way as well, I have been stuck, waiting for that recovery and inspiration to finally return, so we can Feel and Have the energy we each Require to Create in our own way!\n</p><p>I do wish it was \"Bob's your uncle\" quick and easy for the mental and emotional recovery for me. But it's not. And the remains of the Autism aren't helping much either.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>Replies:\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #CEF2CE; border:1px dotted #A3BFA3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Jessica Quinn, 7 June 2016 at 18:10\n<p>Y'know what I find helps keep focus?

And the only way to reach a stable point at home is to develop a daily routine to keep your home tidy.

Bruticus. Plus, lovely female Autobots: Arcee, Chromium and Wingblade.

You want to play Transformers with your family, and Really want to include mom (and you Never got to even hear of the \"Search for Alpha Trion\" episode, much less the Orion Pax episode). What role can mom play; knowingly, you only can think of Arcee. While dad is the \"Optimist\" (pun intended), and you're Bumblebee. And the game is to spy on and take out the Decepticons in their current Energon-stealing scheme.\n</p><p>Well, more than three decades later: the transforming figure of Arcee is finally released, and with a deluxe Optimus Prime and Bumble figure, and Starscream, Megatron and Soundwave, the family game of yesteryears can Finally be played for real.
