I can’t believe that I did that, because you know what, even if he tricked me, I at least was trying to stay true to him. Look what you did to me.

Did you just say yes?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> No, no, no, no, no, no. No. No! I, I, I, I’m not even gonna, ah, I, I, okay, yeah, he was flaunting the address along with a lot of fake documents and a fake driver's license. If he had successfully fooled anyone into actually going to the home address they would’ve found the real me anyway then realized that he was a troll...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [interrupting] It doesn’t matter, you’ve already put that info on the internet, obviously! Because I’ve went to your pages. And I went to the ED thing. I went to everything. And I mean, you put yourself out there, so you were asking for it. But does that mean that I had to be caught up in the middle? You could’ve told me. You. Could. Have. Told. Me. I mean, you could’ve saved me. But you know what? You were just as bad as him. You’re just a big fat fucking liar.\n</p><p>[pause]\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I dinna, I did not have the good, as well as information from the ah, from Dan. I, ah, ah, his name tag, I think his name was Dan. I didn’t have that much information from Dan yet…\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> His name is Chris. His name IS Chris.

You didn’t have to give me those fucking e-mails. Cuz that just made him look bad too. And I don’t think he’s really doing that shit behind my back.

What?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b> </font>I’m not, I’m not, I’m not putting him down for, uh, I’m not saying that he, ah, that he’s guilty of those things or anything like…\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [interrupting] Then why would you show them to me? Why would you show me those first before you decided to tell me? You were trying to make him look bad and you know it! So, where does that put you? Where does that put you in this?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I, Ike, I understand, this puts me in a bad position.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Why would you even do that? Like if you did, if you did want a chance with me, and let’s say I would come around, what… I, I can’t even speak to you! I can’t even SPEAK to you I am so angry. [sobbing]\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I, I understand, I understand.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You don’t even sound like you are upset that I am crying.

Look what you did!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I know, I know. I, I’m very very sorry…\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [interrupting] You’re just disappointed that I…\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [interrupting] And I would be willing to do anything in the world to make it up to you!\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well then why did you invite me over first? You’re just disappointed now because I’m definitely not coming. You, I mean, just, you had ulterior motives or else you would’ve told me something first. You fucking told me, \"Hey, call me. Hey, send me pictures. Hey come visit me.\" The first thing you said, the first thing was \"Hey, come see me.\" What? What the hell?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b> </font>Well, I, I assumed he was going to tell you that anyway. I, I had, I mean…\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> No! No! But you know what? Do you know… what? Rrrrgh! I mean, do you not get that even, let’s say that he is doing all these evil things to you, do you not get that trying to steal a girlfriend is wrong? Did you not get that maybe, maybe I love him? And I mean, ah, I mean you were trying to say you weren’t going to rape me but you’re like, \"we can go to my room and go straight to love making.\" I mean when were you going to tell me? When were you going to tell me? When I came in the door? You think that I wasn’t going to freak out or something? You think I wasn’t going to notice that you’re not him?!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [sigh]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b> </font>That would be embarrassing for your parents. What - did you not even think of them?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b> </font>I thought of a lot of things but I can’t think of everything at once. I have a mental problem, I’m actually <a href=\"/cwcki/Slow-in-the-minds\" title=\"Slow-in-the-minds\">slow in the mind</a> sometimes. I- I can't think of everything...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [interrupting] You know what, that’s not a good enough excuse [Chris starts to interrupt] Hey! No! You let me talk! You let me talk!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b> </font>Okay.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> No, that is not a good excuse. That is never a good excuse. You just do not freaking do that. You do not blame shit like that, you, you knew what you were doing and I know you knew what you were doing. You were being a selfish little prick.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Ah… I thought, I’m sorry I came off that impression.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well what did you think you were going to do?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I'm sorry. I was, I was going… I just wanted to show you the face of truth. I just wanted, I mean, ah, I mean sure I could...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [interrupting again] I mean I don’t think it’s much of an impression. I think you ARE like that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> No. I, I’m serious!\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You’re sad because he’s cuter.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b> </font>I would not, I would not...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> He’s more talented...\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I would not, I seriously would not...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Would you stop?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I would not ask you do that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Excuse me, excuse me.

Especially not after what you’ve done. Especially not. After. What. You’ve. Done!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b> </font>I understand. I understand you got all the nervous tension from the stress and all this shock and everything.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> No! No, I have nervous tension because you decided to play me. And it has, it has nothing to do with what he did now. It has with what you did. You tried to play me and you let me talk to you like that on the phone knowing that you were, I, I should’ve known. I should’ve known. You, you’re terrible! You are so terrible! What, what did you think was going to happen? That I was going to say \"Thank you?\" \"You’re awesome?\" \"I love you?\" You said you loved me and you not… oh my god! You’re a horrible horrible human being, if you’re even a human being.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [interrupting] I, I’m sorry, I know that I cannot say that I love you. I know, I never, I mean, I never even wanted to say I love you but <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_remorse\" title=\"Chris and remorse\">you forced me to say I love you.</a> A few times.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b> </font>I didn’t force you to do anything! I didn’t force you to do anything. Remember that I thought you were MY Chris. I thought you were my Chris. So why wouldn’t he tell me that he loved me?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, yeah, you thought I was Jeff. His name is Jeff.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> No, his name is Chris.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b> </font>…egh… take another look at his driver’s license, but, ah seriously though, I had, I mean, I was, I had to uh, let you know I was trying, I mean, I was, I mean I thought I’d give you a chance to get to know me per, on my own personal level.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [interrupting] Woah, woah, woah, woah. You think I’m still going to get to know you? You, you what?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b> </font>No, no I mean…\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> What?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Listen, if I told you right off you woulda thought then like, “Oh my God, a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Troll\" title=\"Troll\">troll</a> got into his account,\" and that he was the real Chris.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well then don’t you think you should’ve done that first?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I’ve been trying to get back my own identity that he stole from me.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b> </font>Oh, he stole your identity huh? Well maybe if you didn’t post it all over the fucking internet he wouldn’t have been able to have it. You ever think of that?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b> </font>I mean, all he had, sure. All he needed was Christian Weston Chandler, the Christopher and Ricardo was not optional.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [interrupting] None of those, none of those, none of those are very, uh, exotic names. You don’t think that he couldn’t have the same name by, you know, coincidence? I mean a lot of people are named Chris!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah I can understand that but still he’s not the, I mean but I can tell you that he is not the Christian Weston Chandler if that is his real name...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Okay, he's not you, but you're showing me who Christian Weston Chandler is and he's just a fat fuck who doesn't care about me, who doesn't care about anyone's feelings, I mean... just, and, and what! You were getting me to spy on your own friend! You were getting me to spy on your own friend <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Kim\" title=\"Kim\">Kim</a>! And what the hell? And you were saying how she might like you or whatever. What about that? What happened to, you know what, I'm talking to Kim, what happens if I tell Kim? [pause] Would you [stops short]\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [heavy sigh]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I don't think she's going to like that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> 'Cause I know I don't.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I can imagine, yeah, I can just imagine, yeah, she wouldn't like that at all. Even I don't like it.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I mean, ah, she has a boyfriend too, right? What happens if her boyfriend finds out? 'Cause he's going to. He is going to.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [sigh]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You're just a big chunky fuck!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I have, I have had, I've had, I've had a lot of emotional traumas in my lifetime, in the past with women.

I don't care if he's not the Sonichu creator. I don't care who he is, I love him. And he's been there for me and you will never ever be him. He can at least play guitar, he can at least sing to me, he's been the one with me, you haven't. The fff, the only time I've had with you is you trying to trick me and get me in bed. What the fuck?

I sometimes have a bad choice, sometimes I go melt when choose my own words. I am, I mean, it's a part of my, part of the real life autism is sometimes.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b> </font>Is this why no girl [realizes that Chris is blaming his autism] Don't you blame that, don't you blame that! Are you serious? Are you serious? Do you not know how many autistic children I've worked with? And you know, they don't do that. They don't fucking do that. You know what, I don't even think you have autism. I think you have something else. I think you have something that just makes you so... narcissistic that's just so, you're so full of yourself. I mean, that's not autism. What the hell is wrong with you?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Actually yeah, that is a piece of autism.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> No. No its not.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Being socially inept.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> And I guarantell, I can guarantee you that I know more about this shit than you.

Ah, after he's awake I can ask him if I can see it and then if I...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [interrupting] Please, you're 27, you're 27, you can't do it?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> if I can... and then, and then, and then if I, and then after I get it [Kacey stifles a laugh] I'll, I'll uh, I'll take it, I'll scan it or take a picture of it, I'm not sure I'll be able to scan it because my scanner/copier/printer is out of order.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You better find a way.

The best part is, you're not going to learn from this are you? You're just going to keep doing this shit to people like poor Kim, or poor <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Megan\" title=\"Megan\">Megan</a> or any of this crap.\n</p><p>[pause]\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [sigh] Actually, for your information, Kim already has a boyfriend and I respect her space very much.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b> </font>So, so, so that makes it better that you want me to spy on her to see if she likes you and all that stuff?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b> </font>She, n-no, she can tell you the same, she can tell you the actual kind of person she, uh, learned from me from multiple conversations.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b> </font>Oh no, I think, I think she's going to know something different. I think she's going to know something different, 'cause you're fucking disgusting me and I know you're going to disgust her.

She's actually pretty much figured this out on her own and we discussed this.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b> </font>Hey, would you, would you stop insulting me? No, no, seriously, I think that you need to prove it to both of us, because you know what, I'm sick of this. I mean you want, you know you're going to lean on your autism so much and everything, you need to prove it. You need to fucking prove it to me, and I think you owe me after what you put me through the last couple days. I think you fucking owe me.\n</p><p>[pause]\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I'll do, I'll, I'll do anything. I'll, uh, get the paper...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [interrupting] You better do it, you better do it.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I'll get the paper, I'll take, I'll, uh, get, I'll make it into a picture file and I'll e-mail it to you personally.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b> </font>You better. 'Cause I swear to God, you, you better not be lying to me. 'Cause remember, I'm not too far away. And I would be very, very happy to tell the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jerkops\" title=\"Jerkops\">authorities</a> about what you did. 'Cause remember, you were still doing identity theft too, of him, and you were leading me on. And I mean, I, just, erg, thank God I wasn't there.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b> </font>No! He was the one that did identity theft against... Oh, okay, yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Fine! Fine, whatever, I was ju-\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Ok, for the... I'm sorry, I take that back...granted, for the past few days I've been pretending to be him, but I never said- I never called myself Jeff. That's his real name though.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> His name is not Jeff, but you know what, the thing is... all you are doing is following the autism part, and I can tell you’ve done it before. That does not excuse any of this shit. You prove it to me tomorrow.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> You’re right… all right, I’ll prove it to you.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Good, because I mean, this is just ridiculous. I mean... You we- you were hacking and hacking is frowned upon. You are no better than trolls you think troll you.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [deep sigh] Yeah, hmmm... Uh, Y-You know... all- I\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b> </font>No, you don’t even have an excuse do you, you don’t have an excuse at all.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I'm not asking for an excuse. I was going to ask you-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> No, you are giving me excuses.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I was going to ask you for a fav- for a...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> For a favor?! You want me to give you a favor? After all this?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> STOP! Stop. It-It’s not THAT kind, it’s not that kind of favor! Please listen.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [interrupting] I didn’t say it was that kind of favor-\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I just want you to talk to this, to this… Christian Weston Chandler in brown stripes... Or Jeff, whatever his name is. I just want you to encourage him...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [interrupting] GOD, Just shut the fuck up!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> ...to fess up. He’s not the real original creator...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [talking over Chris] It doesn’t matter! It doesn’t matter about him. Shut the fuck up!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> ...to give me back my own identity...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Shut up! Seriously, it has nothing to do with him right now. This is between you and me.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yes, this is between you and me. But I’m just asking you to encourage him to, uh, to reveal himself.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> W-Who would want your identity now? Oh my God, When I tell him about this, do you think he’s going to care? Let’s say you are right, do you think he’s going to care anymore? You have sullied the name of Christian Weston Chandler and Sonichu. I mean, think about what you did… forever. For-ev-er.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [stuttering noises]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Is this the way you want people to remember you?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> No it's not.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b> </font>Then why did you do it?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b> </font>I'm trying to improve myself. I've learned-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well you know what? You can start by showing me those documents. That’s how you can start.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b> </font>Okay. I’ll get the documents and I’ll show them to you.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You better.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I will. [pause] Again, I’m sorry, to have put you through all that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [takes a deep breath]\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b> </font>Take some deep breaths, stay safe…\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You know what?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Try to keep a happy thought.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Happy thought?! [chuckle] Fuck you. You’re talking to me about happy thoughts. I mean, you don’t even sound like… GOD, I just can’t do it. I can’t do it. Just, do it tomorrow. Just- UGH!!\n</p><p>[pause]\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I understand. [sigh, then talks in a whisper] I’m sorry. [pause, sigh] I’ll talk to you later.
