It is likely inspired from <a href=\"/cwcki/Saberspark\" title=\"Saberspark\">Saberspark</a>'s video titled \"Response\", as Chris has not only watched that video<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup> and also praised it for the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Honest\" title=\"Honest\">honesty</a> within,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup> but Saberspark is also briefly mentioned in the video itself. \n</p><p>The video best reflects how despite his insistence of being <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_introspection\" title=\"Chris and introspection\">introspective</a>, he's nothing of the sort. Instead of addressing something serious, like allegations of <a href=\"/cwcki/Affair_with_Mother\" title=\"Affair with Mother\">sexual misconduct</a> as Saberspark had done, Chris chooses to complain about receiving too much hate and sarcastic comments during his livestreams, making him consider quitting streaming unless he starts receiving TRUE and HONEST appreciation and praise. Chris also mentions betrayal and mistrust, but it's unclear whether he's strictly referring to his <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">theoretical exes</a>, or possibly the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Walt\" title=\"Walt\">person who had secretly recorded their phone call</a> just two days prior to the video's upload.

Jesus Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu Prime here once again... and I am being very serious. For the sake of transparency, I have disabled this green screen filter and I have some notes. Which essentially—to be <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Honest\" title=\"Honest\">honest</a>—is pretty much my dialogue. Mm- But, I'm still gonna take my time, so I may be a bit <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Slow-in-the-mind\" title=\"Slow-in-the-mind\">slow</a>, so there you go... [<i>dramatic sigh</i>]\n</p><p>Since I start on my- my online presence, and <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_socialization\" title=\"Chris and socialization\">attempted at being more social and individual</a> after having moved back to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ruckersville\" title=\"Ruckersville\">Ruckersville</a>, [<i>dramatic sigh</i>] I felt like I had been met by a real mixed bag of individuals. [<i>dramatic breath</i>] Over the years, I have been mentally and emotionally abused, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_manipulation\" title=\"Chris and manipulation\">manipulated</a>, deceived, pressured, and just simply... <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stressed\" title=\"Stressed\">stressed</a>. [<i>dramatic sigh</i>]\n</p><p>For the long time—still am—I have had an amount of optimism in the goodness of others on this Earth. I was <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Naive\" title=\"Naive\">naive</a> for a long time, but over the decades I have learned over and over <i>hard</i> about such individuals and... [<i>dramatic sigh</i>] These details I should've been more aware of for the longer time. But, I have found myself, and I count the blessings I have now, and the good times I actually had in the past, that actually helped to develop me for the better, [<i>dramatic sigh</i>] on top <i>of</i> the bad. But... the mixture of the toxic individuals, just in general, made me feel upset and distraught.\n</p><p>I continued on with as optimistic an attitude and faith in others as possible, as well as the faith in the better outcomes I have <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Foreseen\" title=\"Foreseen\">foreseen</a> between numerous <a href=\"/cwcki/Dreams\" title=\"Dreams\">dreams</a> and visions. It became tough to hold on to that faith at times, I have been tested time, time, time, and again. [<i>dramatic sigh</i>] And of course, that includes <i>all</i> of the theoretical exes. That includes the relation- the... <i>friendship</i> that I had with <a href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Schroeder\" title=\"Megan Schroeder\">Megan Schroeder</a>. And... just... the acquaintances... and friendships... that I at one point <a href=\"/cwcki/Love_Quest\" title=\"Love Quest\">wanted to be romantic</a>, but obviously that was not going to ever be the case. [<i>dramatic breath</i>] Just... yep.\n</p><p>The indirect comments, the bad arts, I should never ever take it personally. Had I never flipped at a- had I never taken any of them personally, had I never <a href=\"/cwcki/Google\" title=\"Google\">Googled</a> my name after getting that <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Nintendo_Wii\" title=\"Nintendo Wii\">Nintendo Wii</a>... Had... such things been different as early as <a href=\"/cwcki/2006\" title=\"2006\">2006</a>. Things would be a lot different today... [<i>dramatic sigh</i>]\n</p><p>With each time of abuse, and deception, and betrayal, I felt disappointment and I felt hatred towards those individuals who had done these things upon me, <a href=\"/cwcki/Borb\" title=\"Borb\">my family</a>, as well as those around me, and other people in general over the years. Suffice to say, this is very bad and very wrong.\n</p><p>I still know and appreciate that forgiveness is indeed the better way, [<i>dramatic sigh</i>] because I would just be letting the villains win if I just let the hatred consume me, if I just let the <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_anger\" title=\"Chris and anger\">screams and shouts</a> go out all over the place. But that is not me at all. At is- It has been more clear from time to time... \"Oh look, we're finally going to get <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler#Classic_Era\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler\">Classic Chris-Chan</a> back!\", ha ha. Yes, no. We are never, ever, ever, ever doing that again. [<i>dramatic breath</i>]\n</p><p>I have been slowly but surely mentally, and emotionally, and spiritually- [<i>flips over the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_medallion\" title=\"Sonichu medallion\">Sonichu medallion</a></i>] been maturing. [<i>dramatic sigh</i>] That was, as you can tell, from as early as <a href=\"/cwcki/2011\" title=\"2011\">2011</a> or <a href=\"/cwcki/2012\" title=\"2012\">'12</a>. And eventually, I finally stopped <i>sharing</i> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Honest_Content\" title=\"Honest Content\">oversharing personal and life details and events</a>. Why? <i>Because that should have never been done in the first place</i>. But under emotional dis- pressure, and my being naive, I had lacked that common sense. [<i>dramatic exhale, then sigh</i>]\n</p><p>I feel like there is just so much hatred and discomfort inside me towards those online. With that needless hatred-sh- and <a href=\"/cwcki/DIRTY,_CRAPPED_BRIEFS\" title=\"DIRTY, CRAPPED BRIEFS\">shit</a> from <i>over</i> the pla- decades, that I just do not feel at ease doing the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Livestreams\" title=\"Livestreams\">livestreams</a>. [<i>dramatic sigh</i>] I feel like my development and maturity is just not appreciated. I feel the fact that I had found myself is not appreciated. And I feel like I continue to be perceived <i>based</i> on past versions of myself that I am no longer whatsoever. And I simply cannot feel good about it or laugh it off, and that is regardless of my prior lack of awareness of how I am perceived. [<i>dramatic sigh</i>]\n</p><p>I mean, how would you feel, if you were constantly negged on and perceived as something childish when you know you are of a better emotional maturity or age? And that is just regardless of the physical age, as a lot of you can be aware. You can be 30 years old and have the mentality of let's say a 15-year-old. Because you're probably like, you know, an inner <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">closeted individual</a> who just essentially clinging to... <a href=\"/cwcki/Monthly_tugboat\" title=\"Monthly tugboat\">creature comforts</a> and whatnot. But still, yes, it does remain important to hold on to being- having an inner child and a goodness so that you can have optimism and positivity for others. But that is such a thing, a <a href=\"/cwcki/My_Little_Pony\" title=\"My Little Pony\">rarity</a>, to be able to maintain on top of having to endure all these <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_is_Sad\" title=\"CWC is Sad\">depressions</a>, all these stresses, and the hatred that could be felt of other individuals [<i>dramatic sigh</i>]\n</p><p>But yeah, just... if you all really want me to continue to do livestreams, then THIS really needs to change. I would genuinely appreciate authentic positivity, as well as authentic appreciation and support in my mental and emotional maturity as an individual, and what I am going to do and meant to do in my continued lifetime and everything, and all that is good and righteous. I have felt pain and despair over, and over, and over again. And every photo or recording of me, and uploading or public sharing of that without my personal consent or better direct consultation, is felt like an act of great betrayal and mistrust. And you're not going to get any more deeper of a betrayal than... <a href=\"/cwcki/Honor_roll\" title=\"Honor roll\">Uh, hang on. My brai- the name is escaping me, give me a moment... Mm. Dang it. Sh- Anyway, I'll come- it'll come back to me in a mo-bit</a>.\n</p><p>Anyway, just- I'm very well aware of the toxic haters that only make up the minority of all of you. And as I have much optimism as possible for the majority of all of you who are neutral and/or good, I can only tell so much of an individual through the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Internet\" title=\"Internet\">Internet</a> on <i>intuition alone</i>, and pressure on me is just simply not helpful at all. [<i>dramatic breath</i>] I should not have to feel this high level of hatred upon anyone! But I do of those few, and indirectly it just ends up spreading out to the majority, because I don't know who they were offline, those people of whom I s-really hated. And especially the immature <a href=\"/cwcki/Weens\" title=\"Weens\">weens</a> that want to just tag on to those that did me wrong with things like \"Oh, it's the cool trending thing to just mock and continue to torture Christ- <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Kick_the_autistic\" title=\"Kick the autistic\">torture Christ Chan</a> all over the place.\" [<i>Chris shakes his head disapprovingly, then takes a dramatic breath</i>]\n</p><p>And with all the risks I am very well aware of, all I could do is just continue to feel this- discomfort and emotional distance from ALL of you! Even positive comments, while very much appreciated, I'm just aware that <i>some</i> of them, a few of them, could be- had to be psychia- sarcastic or ironic. \"Oh Christ Chan, I love watching your livestreams!\" [<i>Chris shakes his head and hits his desk, shaking his camera.</i>] I have not done that many livestreams. And the freaking algorithm places videos that were on my channels and even videos from other channels that talk about me, they get placed amongst-side <a href=\"/cwcki/TooManyGames#Bowser_vs_Robotnik_panel\" title=\"TooManyGames\">cringe videos</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/It%27s_not_that_cold\" title=\"It's not that cold\">creepypastas</a>! [<i>Chris briefly puts his hand on his head.</i>] Such as- I cannot help feel that there may be a lie in that statement! Or if there is something mentally right or wrong with those individuals who say that to me, even in person. You know what? It. Just. Frankly. Sucks. [<i>dramatic sigh</i>]\n</p><p>But, yeah, just- [<i>Chris lightly shakes his head.</i>] There's a reason why this <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Merge\" title=\"Merge\">merge</a> is happening and why there i-are going to be those that are going to be left behind: the toxic ones... Or at least the toxicity from with them is gonna be left behind if they end up physically surviving at that point, but that's a whole- to be confirmed, respectively, individually <i>out</i> of those <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">millions to billions of my followers</a>. Within that <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">spectrum</a>. Around the Earth, around the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/1218\" title=\"1218\">1218</a> half of this Earth. And just- the toxic individuals in general from the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/C-197\" title=\"C-197\">C-197</a> half, but that's a whole different kettle of fish right there.\n</p><p>Anyway, so... I could do very much a whole lot of pain if I just <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_is_Angry\" title=\"CWC is Angry\">let the hatred out</a>, but I know those haters, they would just love it if I did that. So I shall not, and I will not. I am a strong, mature individual. I am ades- identified and knowing that I am the <a href=\"/cwcki/Avatar\" title=\"Avatar\">one avatar of all existence</a>. And everything of which I have talked about before, because I have found myself in <i>all</i> the <a href=\"/cwcki/Meditation\" title=\"Meditation\">self-meditations</a>, all self-realizations, and even I am understood and acknowledged by those who are actually authentically psychic and can sense the auras, and energies, and everything. But that still is a small number in comparison to the majority, who don't have as much s-psychic openness or spiritual openness from wi-themselves, or the connections that, most of them that do have them, are able to reach. And I have reached far beyond them. I have connected with the Alpha Omega point of all existence, literally. And that's beyond the timeline corner matrix, and that's <i>beyond</i> this universe's core matrix.\n</p><p>And... I do... just... feel. I still feel. I still get pressured from time to time. It takes a lot to break me, it takes a lot to make me <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bent_duck\" title=\"Bent duck\">bend</a> or <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/I%27LL_BREAK_YOU_DEAD\" title=\"I'LL BREAK YOU DEAD\">break</a>. It's like all I could do is continue to have faith, and as you can tell, I have become more emotionally grounded and stable. As opposed to how I was, what, back in <a href=\"/cwcki/2007\" title=\"2007\">2007</a> or <a href=\"/cwcki/2008\" title=\"2008\">'8</a>? But hey- Oh, hey, \"2007 called! They want their Chris-Chan memes baaack!\" Because that's a fad, that's just long done and over with. And no matter how much you're going to do that, how much you're gonna want, no matter much of that you're gonna want, <i>it's not coming back ever</i>. I could put on <i>similar</i> to the <a href=\"/cwcki/The_Classic\" title=\"The Classic\">classic iconic shirt</a> that I had, but you're never going to get me screaming or complaining like I did that became so memeworthy or anything personal of me, whether it be on the social media posts—<i>mainly</i> on my <a href=\"/cwcki/Bluesky\" title=\"Bluesky\">Bluesky</a> these days, if and when I post anything—and eventually, I'll be putting more onto the <a href=\"/cwcki/Cwclight\" title=\"Cwclight\">Cwclight</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_Blog_(Cwclight)\" title=\"CWC Blog (Cwclight)\">blogs</a> as well. So there. So, it's a combination and everything continues to progress. And I have lots of good ideas in my mind, and lots of blessings that are manifesting and going to be, and that I have right here and now. And just- I pray that all of you watching this will actually just appreciate and give me authentic kindness and support and just no longer judge me by past things that I were before.\n</p><p>And just one name-drop in particular right now, <a href=\"/cwcki/Saberspark\" title=\"Saberspark\">Saberspark</a> knows and appreciates that people can change. I have changed for the better, and y'all should realize and understand that. I have a lot of love in my heart and in my soul. [<i>dramatic sigh</i>] I should not have to feel any of the hatred that I have of those amongst all of you. And I pray that when they are left behind, there is a forgiveness within them of their sins, of their regrets, of their doubts... and everything in general, so.\n</p><p>Just- [<i>Chris shakes his head slowly, then does a dramatic sigh.</i>] Yeah. I never want to experience any more betrayal from anyone. And I don't want anybody to be hurt. <a href=\"/cwcki/Self-inflicted_taint_wound\" title=\"Self-inflicted taint wound\">I no longer want to be hurt</a>. So let's all please do good, authentically and so. [<i>dramatic sigh</i>] And just- just- [<i>Chris closes his eyes, then squints sadly, and then shakes his head.</i>] I feel so disappointed. I have my upsets. I can only keep my grasp on myself- emotionally grounded so much. And I'm- doing best I can to hold on right now. So, take from that what you will. And, have faith in me actually doing good- better, and also just please, no invasion of privacy. No invasion of... just for content about me. Because... all that oversharing should never been done- never, ever been done in the first place... <i>by me</i>. A lot of things, on that regard, is indeed my fault. Nobody else but me. And I fell for each of those theoretical exes and I let myself be swayed by them. I am no longer ever gonna be like that. Never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever again, in my very long <i>lifetime</i>. So there. [<i>Long pause, then a dramatic sigh.</i>]\n</p><p>S- I feel like that's about all I can say from deep within, without getting too <a href=\"/cwcki/CHRIS!!!_CHANDLER!!!\" title=\"CHRIS!!! CHANDLER!!!\">emotionally overboard</a>. So once again, if you really want to see more livestreams from me again, there has to be a lot less hatred and a lot less hatred based on immaturity. There has to be a lot less hate-inspired memes. There has to be better judgment and appreciation of support of a better version of me that I am now and that I am becoming. The more positive one. The one that is meant to be, and take part in the better of this world, this universe, this very timeline. And if y'all are still hating me after I said that, well, frankly I just feel very sorry for you. Okay? [<i>clears throat</i>] That is all.
