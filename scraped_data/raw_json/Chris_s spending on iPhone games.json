I never thought he'd accept my request but he did, and every time I log in to my town Sonichu has visited it.\n<p>If you look at Chris's town, he has everything. All the buildings, all the characters, both the stuff that you have to sit there and tap all day for weeks to get during stupid events, and all the stuff you have to pay real money for (I'd have to guess at least a thousand dollars worth, but I haven't done the math). Chris has has spent the maximum amount of money you can on the game.\n</p><p>And that's just the game where I'm on his friends list. There are millions of shitty little money pit games on that platform, and I have no reason to believe that Simpsons Tapped Out is his only iPhone vice. It makes me wonder how much money he's spending on these things. At least when you buy a videogame you're getting the ability to play a game; all you get when you buy Rich Texan is a little drawing of Rich Texan walking around your screen.\n</p><p>If Chris can work into his budget hundreds of dollars to buy imaginary buildings for double imaginary Springfield, then I have to assume he'll be able to scrape together the funds to buy the PS-Q.\n</p><p>P.S.: I always assumed nobody cared, but if there's interest I can post a picture of Chris's Springfield.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #CEF2CE; border:1px dotted #A3BFA3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Okay Chris's Springfield is big and the stupid game is a crashy piece of shit.

It also depends on how he bought his donuts; I looked it up and if he bought everything at once (which I know he didn't) it would have cost him $300 if he bought the donuts in bulk. But he probably bought them in smaller denominations, meaning he's looking at $720 or $1200. That also makes the pretty big assumption that he only used donuts to buy premium items, and not to speed up construction or buy extra money.\n<p>Edit: Oh, also, this assumes that he only bought one of each premium item and, as we can see from my screenshots, he has multiples of some.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_money\" title=\"Chris and money\">Chris and money</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/The_Simpsons\" title=\"The Simpsons\">The Simpsons</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a class=\"external free\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140726003604/cwckiforums.com/threads/chriss-spending-on-iphone-games.2035/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://web.archive.org/web/20140726003604/cwckiforums.com/threads/chriss-spending-on-iphone-games.2035/</a></span>\n</li>\n</ol></div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCached time: 20250307075122\nCache expiry: 86400\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: []\nCPU time usage: 0.071 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.076 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 68/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 4151/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 3274/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 4/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/100\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 542/5000000 bytes\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    9.559      1 -total\n 48.73%    4.658      3 Template:Quoteboxgreen\n 46.71%    4.465      1 Template:References\n-->\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key cwcki-1_:pcache:idhash:35858-0!canonical and timestamp 20250307075122 and revision id 299386.
