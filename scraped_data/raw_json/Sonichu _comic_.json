href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(Archie_Comics)\" title=\"wikipedia:Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie Comics)\">THE WORLD'S MOST WAY PAST COOL COMIC!</a></div></div></div>\n<p>Chris first drew <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(character)\" title=\"Sonichu (character)\">Sonichu</a> in March 2000 after being told that he could not use <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_copyright\" title=\"Chris and copyright\">a copyrighted character</a> on a class project, so he instead came up with a <a href=\"/cwcki/Things_Chris_has_ripped_off\" title=\"Things Chris has ripped off\">TRUE</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/OC\" title=\"OC\">ORIGINAL</a> character plagiarizing from two of his favorite video games: <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog\" title=\"Sonic the Hedgehog\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></i> and <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Pok%C3%A9mon\" title=\"Pokémon\">Pokémon</a></i>. Later, Chris would put his web programming skills to task and come up with <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC%27s_Sonichu_Site!\" title=\"CWC's Sonichu Site!\">CWC's Sonichu Site!</a>, which showcased his various illustrations of his pride and joy. Over time, Chris would draw new characters in his own little universe that were more blatant rip-offs of the source material that he was inspired by, such as <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu\" title=\"Rosechu\">Rosechu</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Blake\" title=\"Blake\">Blake</a>, and so Chris began to put together a couple of simple, single-page or two-page narratives for his growing cast of characters.\n</p><p>For a while, many of these comics were actually focused on the adventures of these characters, with no real references to the outside world, but over time, he would start to put himself into these comic strips. Dissatisfaction with his own life led to Chris using the comic as a <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_coping\" title=\"Chris and coping\">coping mechanism</a> to achieve a sense of <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">wish fulfillment</a>. Since he was coming up with his story (and nothing less), he could team up with his \"original\" creations and make things right in <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">his idealized fantasy world</a>.\n</p><p>The inadvertent shattering of his heart from <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sarah_Hammer\" title=\"Sarah Hammer\">Sarah Hammer</a>, along with the expulsion from English class and the confrontation with <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Mary Lee Walsh</a>, provided the impetus for Chris to kick-start the comic series in full force, turning real-life figures that he encountered into citizens and villains for him and his OCs to interact with. The series initially served as a complement to his <a href=\"/cwcki/Love_Quest\" title=\"Love Quest\">Love Quest</a> as a feeble attempt to link an accomplishment, or boost his own self-worth to unsuspecting prey; after all, Sonichu <i>is</i> \"Zappin' to the Extreme!\" He is Christian Weston Chandler's <i>only</i> son, and the first <i>way past cooler</i> <a href=\"/cwcki/Electric_Hedgehog_Pok%C3%A9mon\" title=\"Electric Hedgehog Pokémon\">Electric Hedgehog Pokémon</a>!\n</p><p>The comic series was originally hosted on the various incarnations of Chris's <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_site\" title=\"Sonichu site\">homepage</a> (as seen in the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia\" title=\"CWCipedia\">CWCipedia</a> archive). In 2013 he began to upload the comics as albums on his <a href=\"/cwcki/Facebook\" title=\"Facebook\">Facebook</a> page, and he affirmed in 2015, when he picked up the comic again, that this would be the place to find new pages. In <a href=\"/cwcki/September_2015\" title=\"September 2015\">September 2015</a> he finally began to sell printed and autographed issues on <a href=\"/cwcki/Etsy\" title=\"Etsy\">Etsy</a> and Lulu.com. The comic was originally promoted from now-defunct <i>Sonichu</i> business cards, and he has since graduated to flyers. Each new addition to the series proudly sports a \"To be continued...\" disclaimer page. In fact, the comics are not updated with any regular frequency: in the twenty years since the character's creation, Chris has only completed fifteen issues, even though he has zero responsibilities and unlimited free time. Chris has claimed that in total, he plans to complete 50 to 100 issues in his lifetime,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup> meaning that he's 15-30% of the way there.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Reader.27s_Guide_to_Sonichu\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Reader's_Guide_to_Sonichu\">Reader's Guide to <i>Sonichu</i></span></h2>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_art\" title=\"Chris and art\">My art</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">speaks for me.</a>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:11px; padding:0 0 0 16px; vertical-align:bottom; width:20px\">”\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\" style=\"font-size:smaller; padding:8px 36px; text-align:right;\"><cite>Chris<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup></cite>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"How-to_and_Overview\">How-to and Overview</span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:182px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Sonichu_-_Jargon_Page.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"246\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/e/ee/Sonichu_-_Jargon_Page.jpg/180px-Sonichu_-_Jargon_Page.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/e/ee/Sonichu_-_Jargon_Page.jpg/270px-Sonichu_-_Jargon_Page.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/e/ee/Sonichu_-_Jargon_Page.jpg/360px-Sonichu_-_Jargon_Page.jpg 2x\" width=\"180\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Sonichu_-_Jargon_Page.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>The ever infamous JARGON page.</div></div></div>\n<p>To start off, the comics don't appear to have a consistent numbering system in place, making it tricky to organize them. For example, the <i>Sonichu</i> series began with issue #0 instead of #1. Chris also decided to assign one of the books as \"Issue #12-9\" to avoid associating his Pony OC <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Nightstar\" title=\"Nightstar\">Nightstar</a> with the number 13. The book itself was originally going to be \"Issue #13\", with <a href=\"/cwcki/Planet_Dolan\" title=\"Planet Dolan\">Planet Dolan</a> as the subject matter instead. Despite that, there was an actual \"Issue #13\", only for it to be a bunch of vaguely connected ideas brainwashed into Chris by the <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys</a> with no actual narrative in sight. The following entry \"Issue #14\" was never completed, and was also the second half of Sonichu #13. Sonichu #15 was eventually renamed to Sonichu #0 HD, implying that it's a remaster of Sonichu #0, despite it having a different plot that mostly rips off the fan comic \"Rosechu's Story.\" All of the following issues that have been announced to date were never completed and they share the confusing number scheme, being Issues #16, #17 and #82. Compounding the confusion further are the \"Specials\", which were numbered separately from the main comics.\n</p><p>Adding onto this baffling numbering system, Chris uses a bunch of television lingo when referring to his stories. Each issue up to Issue #12-9 contained multiple separately-numbered \"Episodes\" and \"Sub-Episodes\". Due to the incoherent narrative structure of the stories along with their inconsistent numbering system, readers often lost track of which story happened in which issue. For example, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Black_Sonichu\" title=\"Black Sonichu\">Black Sonichu</a> (now known as Blake) was introduced in Episode #4, which was the fifth story in the overall series and the first story in <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_1\" title=\"Sonichu 1\"><i>Sonichu</i> #1</a>, which was in turn the second comic. Further confounding matters were the <a href=\"/cwcki/Sub-Episodes\" title=\"Sub-Episodes\">Sub-Episodes</a> about Chris's <a href=\"/cwcki/Love_Quest\" title=\"Love Quest\">Love Quest</a>, which appeared in issues #0-4, and again were numbered separately from the main stories.\n</p><p>After the Idea Guys saga, bar Sonichu #0 HD, Chris has also dropped the traditional format of Sonichu. Other than the <a href=\"/cwcki/Twilight_Sparkle%27s_Secret_Shipfic_Folder\" title=\"Twilight Sparkle's Secret Shipfic Folder\">Twilight Sparkle's Secret Shipfic Folder</a> cards, sometimes adding new \"lore\" to the series, the only other work of art he has worked on related to the franchise since then were long, low quality stories which one could mistake for the ramblings of a schizophrenic person, most notably <a href=\"/cwcki/Angelica_Rosechu%27s_Christmas_Play\" title=\"Angelica Rosechu's Christmas Play\">Angelica Rosechu's Christmas Play</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chaos_Crystal_Control_Act_4\" title=\"Chaos Crystal Control Act 4\">Chaos Crystal Control</a>, which he oddly started writing in reverse, making Act 4 prior to acts 0 and 1.\n</p><p>Issues #0 and #1 featured <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(character)\" title=\"Sonichu (character)\">Sonichu</a> as the unchallenged star of the series, with <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler_(character)\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler (character)\">Chris</a> as a supporting character also appearing in the backup strips. By issue #2, the comic had abruptly transitioned to Chris encountering people from his real life in shitty <a href=\"/cwcki/Anime\" title=\"Anime\">anime</a> battles. Token attempts to tell Sonichu stories and introduce Sonichu spin-off characters were made in #3, but all pretense was dropped in #4-#7 as the series becomes a vehicle for Chris, as the leader of a heroic <a href=\"/cwcki/Chaotic_Combo\" title=\"Chaotic Combo\">band of recolors</a>, to battle against <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">a college dean</a>, a group of ineffectual <a href=\"/cwcki/Jerkop\" title=\"Jerkop\">security guards</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Manajerks\" title=\"Manajerks\">store managers</a>, and later on, <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">Internet trolls</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Alec_Benson_Leary\" title=\"Alec Benson Leary\">other people who made fun of the comic</a>. Originally it was mostly innocent and harmless, being the by-product of a simple man with a childish imagination, until it became an outlet to call out trolls, explore his depraved <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_8\" title=\"Sonichu 8\">sexual desires</a> and live out his <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_10\" title=\"Sonichu 10\">violent revenge fantasies</a>.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:182px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:ComicTBCont.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"246\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/1/1d/ComicTBCont.jpg/180px-ComicTBCont.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/1/1d/ComicTBCont.jpg/270px-ComicTBCont.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/1/1d/ComicTBCont.jpg/360px-ComicTBCont.jpg 2x\" width=\"180\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:ComicTBCont.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>TO BE CONTINUED (c.) 2001-????</div></div></div>\n<p>The comic series was presented as if it were a cartoon or <a href=\"/cwcki/Anime\" title=\"Anime\">anime</a> (which might explain why the comics mimic visual effects that work in an audiovisual context but fail on paper), and was encapsulated into <i>seasons</i> with various episodes (or \"series\", for our European friends). <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_10\" title=\"Sonichu 10\"><i>Sonichu</i> #10</a> was intended to wrap up the \"first season\" of <i>Sonichu</i>. This opened a can of worms as to the current vision of the comics: was <i>Sonichu</i> intended to be the hit action/adventure soap-opera TV show that is broadcast in <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a>, or was it the historical documentation of Chris's and Sonichu's life and times? Perhaps it was destined to be the Gospel from the Stay-at-Home Autistic Virgin Male, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_religion#Delusions_of_Godhood.3F\" title=\"Chris and religion\"><i>hallowed be His name</i></a>. Either way, it remained unanswered whether Chris continues on with the series because he has a vain, misguided belief that some TRUE and HONEST soul would consider these as \"storyboards\" for proper licensing and production.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Art_imitating_life\">Art imitating life</span></h3>\n<p>Sensing some criticism for the self-centeredness of his work, Chris wrote himself out of the series toward the end of <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_7\" title=\"Sonichu 7\"><i>Sonichu</i> #7</a>, trapping the Chris character in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Time_Void\" title=\"Time Void\">Time Void</a> so that the storyline could focus on other characters. Despite this, Sonichu still served as a strong Mary Sue character, as seen in Sonichu fighting <a href=\"/cwcki/4-cent_garbage.com\" title=\"4-cent garbage.com\">4-cent garbage.com</a> in <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_8\" title=\"Sonichu 8\"><i>Sonichu</i> #8</a>, as well as the clear Sue tendencies of <a href=\"/cwcki/Reginald_Sneasel\" title=\"Reginald Sneasel\">Reginald Sneasel</a>.\n</p><p>He returned from the Time Void at the end of <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_9\" title=\"Sonichu 9\"><i>Sonichu</i> #9</a>, giving all non-Chris characters approximately one issue to have the spotlight to themselves, during which they mostly talked about how much they loved Chris and hoped he would return safely. On the final page of the issue, Chris claimed that he would write himself out of the series permanently, giving his characters the opportunity to shine on their own. He went back on this promise almost the moment he made it — Issue #10 is one of the most Chris-centric of the entire series.\n</p><p>Following the theft of his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Medallions_of_Fail\" title=\"Medallions of Fail\">Medallions of Fail</a> by <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Blanca\" title=\"Blanca\">Blanca</a>, Chris immediately released a new comic adapting the theft into his canon and explaining that the TRUE source of his power lay in his <a href=\"/cwcki/Amnyfest_Ring\" title=\"Amnyfest Ring\">Amnyfest Ring</a>. Since this story was necessarily set after Chris escapes the Time Void, it was deemed a special preview of <i>Sonichu</i> #10, despite the fact that Chris had at that point not finished <i>Sonichu</i> #8 nor begun <i>Sonichu</i> #9.\n</p><p>Chris started <i>Sonichu</i> #11 in <a href=\"/cwcki/December_2009\" title=\"December 2009\">December 2009</a> and completed <i>Sonichu</i> #10 in <a href=\"/cwcki/February_2010\" title=\"February 2010\">February 2010</a>. He produced a revised ending to issue #10 in <a href=\"/cwcki/October_2010\" title=\"October 2010\">October 2010</a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup> After a long inspirationless lull, he began churning out new pages of Sonichu #11 in <a href=\"/cwcki/September_2015\" title=\"September 2015\">September 2015</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Hiatuses\">Hiatuses</span></h2>\n<p>Chris has regularly lost motivation to draw comics throughout the run of the series.

He said that new pages would be added \"maybe every other week\". 27 pages were uploaded in 2015, but these updates were not to last; no pages were uploaded in 2016. Chris claimed that ADD<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]</a></sup> and dementia<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-7\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">[7]</a></sup> were responsible for his inactivity.\n</p><p>In <a href=\"/cwcki/June_2017\" title=\"June 2017\">June 2017</a>, Chris began making regular updates to the comic again, completing <i>Sonichu</i> #11 that month and <i>Sonichu</i> #12 in October. Chris initially announced that <i>Sonichu</i> #13 would be an <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_copyright\" title=\"Chris and copyright\">unofficial</a> crossover with <a href=\"/cwcki/Planet_Dolan\" title=\"Planet Dolan\">Planet Dolan</a>, but was scrapped after he had a falling out with <a href=\"/cwcki/DoopieDoOver\" title=\"DoopieDoOver\">DoopieDoOver</a>. In its place, Chris announced <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_12-9\" title=\"Sonichu 12-9\"><i>Sonichu</i> #12-9</a>. 12-9 would be based around <a href=\"/cwcki/My_Little_Pony\" title=\"My Little Pony\">My Little Pony</a> and feature a <a href=\"/cwcki/Night_Star\" title=\"Night Star\">new self-insert of his</a>, revolving almost entirely around ponies.\n</p><p>Partway through the development of #12-9, Chris's work on the comic broke down. Before #12-9 had been complete, Chris began working on <i>Sonichu</i> #14, which was to return to the normal <i>Sonichu</i> setting. He soon spilled paint on the first few unfinished pages and <a href=\"/cwcki/Financhu_Crisis\" title=\"Financhu Crisis\">sold them</a> on <a href=\"/cwcki/EBay\" title=\"EBay\">eBay</a> for a quick buck, presumably scrapping his work once again. Chris apparently still intended to complete #14, as he announced <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_15\" title=\"Sonichu 15\"><i>Sonichu</i> #15</a>. The comic was intended as a remake/<a href=\"/cwcki/Retroactive_continuity_in_Sonichu\" title=\"Retroactive continuity in Sonichu\">reboot</a> of the early issues. This was derailed after Chris found the fancomic \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Things_Chris_has_ripped_off\" title=\"Things Chris has ripped off\">Rosechu's Story</a>\", which he began to plagiarize instead of making an original story for #15.\n</p><p>Sonichu 15 was put on hold when communication with the <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys</a> began. These trolls made Chris illustrate <a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_beliefs_brainwashed_into_Chris\" title=\"List of beliefs brainwashed into Chris\">their own narrative</a>, which heavily focused on the <a href=\"/cwcki/Nazis#Idea_Guys\" title=\"Nazis\">politically incorrect</a>, retcons, and generally horrible, unfunny things. Several pages were leaked in January 2018 by <a href=\"/cwcki/Kiwi_Farms\" title=\"Kiwi Farms\">Kiwi Farms</a> users in contact with the Idea Guys. After months without updates, Chris revealed in May 2018 that he had continued to work on #16, but was hesitant to release the nearly-finished comic now that he realized the Idea Guys had such an influence on it. Sonichu 16 was sent to Patreon supporters in fall of that year.\n</p><p>On 26 June 2019, Chris uploaded eight new pages for a new issue of <i>Sonichu</i> designed to be a sequel to <i>Sonichu</i> #16. Two days later, in a Patreon post, he would renumber issues #14, #15, and #16. <i>Sonichu</i> #14 would be moved to <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_16\" title=\"Sonichu 16\">#16</a>, <i>Sonichu</i> #16 would be renamed <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_13\" title=\"Sonichu 13\">The Awakening of a CPU aka The Idea Guy Corruptions</a>,</i> (later renamed to issue #13<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-8\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">[8]</a></sup>) and the new issue would be numbered issue <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_14\" title=\"Sonichu 14\">14</a>. \n</p><p><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_17\" title=\"Sonichu 17\"><i>Sonichu</i> #17</a> was later revealed to exist, but only its cover has been seen. It appears to be influenced by the Idea Guys. After his stint in <a href=\"/cwcki/Jail_Saga\" title=\"Jail Saga\">jail</a>, the cover for <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_82\" title=\"Sonichu 82\"><i>Sonichu</i> #82</a> was also uploaded on Chris's <a href=\"/cwcki/DeviantART\" title=\"DeviantART\">DeviantART</a>.\n</p><p>Issues <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_14\" title=\"Sonichu 14\">14</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_15\" title=\"Sonichu 15\">15</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_16\" title=\"Sonichu 16\">16</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_17\" title=\"Sonichu 17\">17</a> are incomplete. Sonichu #14 was dropped after the Idea Guys lost power, Sonichu 16, or rather its few <a href=\"/cwcki/DIRTY,_CRAPPED_BRIEFS\" title=\"DIRTY, CRAPPED BRIEFS\">brown paint covered</a> pages, were sold on Ebay and issues #17 and #82 never went past the cover. Out of all of them, only Sonichu 15, renamed Sonichu #0 HD, continued having work done on it, progressing very slowly, mainly being colored in during <a href=\"/cwcki/December_2023_livestreams#Over_the_shoulder_colouring_stream\" title=\"December 2023 livestreams\">some of</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/March_2024_livestreams#Christ_Chan_Live_Stream:_Over_the_Shoulder_Colouring_and_Drawing_2\" title=\"March 2024 livestreams\">Chris's livestreams</a>.\n</p><p>On 11 September 2020, when asked what he felt were the best <i>Sonichu</i> issues, he would reply with (in no particular order) <i>Sonichu</i> #0, <i>Sonichu</i> #12-9, and <i>Sonichu</i> #15 <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ego\" title=\"Ego\"> (all of which are origin stories for a self insert character)</a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-9\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">[9]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Currently\">Currently</span></h2>\n<p>Like all people, Chris was at his most productive when he is motivated. The unfortunate truth is that much of Chris's motivation in earlier years came from trolls and <i>being</i> trolled. He has created <a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_videos\" title=\"List of videos\">hundreds of videos</a> under the influence of trolls; the same could be said for the <i>Sonichu</i> comics. While Chris claims that the stress from trolls prevented him from writing comics, the opposite is likely true. <i>Sonichu</i>  issues 8 through 10 were all created during the classic trolling era, and they happen to be some of the longest comics Chris has ever made (each one around 100 pages long, compared to the usual 50-or-so page length for <i>Sonichu</i> comics). After those, <i>Sonichu</i> 11 was finished eight years after it was started, with no content in it relating to trolls. Much of the content in issue 12-9 is inspired by <a href=\"/cwcki/Jessica_Quinn\" title=\"Jessica Quinn\">Jessica Quinn</a> and the Idea Guys (who ostensibly began their mind games with Chris in order to get him to work on his comic more frequently), all of whom are trolls. The Idea Guys were even able to force an entire issue out of Chris on their own, due in no small part to their emotional manipulation and extortion of him. The only outlier of a comic post-classic-trolling-era is <i>Sonichu</i> 12, which was finished in half a year and had nothing to do with trolls; Chris's motivation to create #12 stemmed from his burgeoning relationship with the LGBT community.\n</p><p>Simply put, Chris had no real reason to be writing and illustrating new <i>Sonichu</i> comics, which quite bluntly have always been an exercise in boosting his self-esteem rather than in creating a coherent narrative for his own characters. The relative <a href=\"/cwcki/Na%C3%AFve\" title=\"Naïve\">innocence</a> of the original <i>Sonichu</i> comics (before trolling) has long since been lost, and Chris has generally been less productive on a creative level than since the ousting of the Idea Guys. A lack of long-term relationships has left Chris's motivation for art stagnant, while his <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality#Fantasy_and_fiction\" title=\"Chris and reality\">delusions</a> festered. While it was not impossible for Chris to complete any of his unfinished <i>Sonichu</i> comics, it was unlikely he would do so without making a change in his life. And anyone that though that <i>they</i> should be that \"change\" in his life would quickly learn that <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Weening#Arguments_against_weening\" title=\"Weening\">trolling Chris is a bad idea</a>.\n</p><p>That being said, after considerable time on the backburner, Chris revealed in <a href=\"/cwcki/2023\" title=\"2023\">2023</a> that <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_0_HD\" title=\"Sonichu 0 HD\">Sonichu 0 HD</a></i> (formerly known as <i>Sonichu 15</i>) <a href=\"/cwcki/DeviantART#Post-jail\" title=\"DeviantART\">was still in the works</a> and in <a href=\"/cwcki/April_2024\" title=\"April 2024\">April of the following year</a>, he announced on his Twitter that he has indeed returned to working on his magnum opus<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-10\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">[10]</a></sup>. Whether he slips back into his old ways (updating at his own pace), delays production, or stops outright yet again because of any external factors remains to be seen.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Sonichu_canon\">The <i>Sonichu</i> canon</span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Official_releases\">Official releases</span></h3>\n<table class=\"wikitable\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<th style=\"background:silver;\">Issue\n</th>\n<th colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:silver;\">Episode\n</th>\n<th style=\"background:silver;\" width=\"20%\">Title\n</th>\n<th style=\"background:silver;\">Plot Summary\n</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"5\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Sonichu_-_Issue_0,_Cover.jpg\"><img alt=\"Sonichu - Issue 0, Cover.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"195\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/e/ea/Sonichu_-_Issue_0%2C_Cover.jpg/150px-Sonichu_-_Issue_0%2C_Cover.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/e/ea/Sonichu_-_Issue_0%2C_Cover.jpg/225px-Sonichu_-_Issue_0%2C_Cover.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/e/ea/Sonichu_-_Issue_0%2C_Cover.jpg/300px-Sonichu_-_Issue_0%2C_Cover.jpg 2x\" width=\"150\"/></a><br/><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_0\" title=\"Sonichu 0\"><b><i>Sonichu</i> #0</b></a><br/><i>Begun</i> 3 Jan <a href=\"/cwcki/2004\" title=\"2004\">2004</a><br/><i>Complete</i> 24 Mar <a href=\"/cwcki/2005\" title=\"2005\">2005</a>\n</td>\n<td bgcolor=\"yellow\" height=\"10px\">\n</td>\n<td>Episode #1\n</td>\n<td>\"Sonichu's Orgin\"\n</td>\n<td>Sonichu and Rosechu are created by the Chaotic Rainbow.

He finally made this happen – sort of – in <a href=\"/cwcki/September_2015\" title=\"September 2015\">September 2015</a>, when he discovered <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lulu_(company)\" title=\"wikipedia:Lulu (company)\">Lulu.com</a> and put a bound copy of <i>Sonichu</i> #0 for sale for ten bucks. A print version of Book #1 appeared the following month. Although his Lulu account disappeared from public view after about a week, he continued to offer the books (autographed upon request) on <a href=\"/cwcki/Etsy\" title=\"Etsy\">Etsy</a>.

If by some shitty reason you ever wanted to buy multiple future issues to put on your shelf, you'd never be able to tell which one is which. I don't know if this is because he just copied/pasted a book spine he <i>assumed</i> would work, or if he really underestimated how big the book would be. Probably both. The result is that the cover is one of the worst things in comic history. It honestly is so poorly done and so low quality that if Chris wasn't <i>saying</i> it was his I would assume this was a troll attempt to make him look bad.\n</p><p>The back cover is significantly less pixelated, but still looks like garbage because it is, of course, drawn all in markers and pen by Chris.\n</p><p>The paper used is matte and looks like the lowest quality/cheapest option he could get it printed on. Someone else mentioned it looks like \"draft\" quality and that pictures make it better – it seriously is so ugly and the resolution so low, it looks like a test page, and I can't even capture how shitty it is on camera. I've purchased comics from Lulu before, and they weren't nearly this bad, so there must be varying levels of publishing quality (or Lulu themselves has dropped in quality significantly – it's been years) and Chris picked the worst.\n</p><p>So, it's exactly what you expect. Low quality and no effort by Chris other than uploading it. He didn't even check to see if things fit on the <i>cover</i>.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>As advertised on Etsy:\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Printed_and_Autographed_Sonichu_.230_Comic_Book\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Printed_and_Autographed_Sonichu_#0_Comic_Book\">Printed and Autographed Sonichu #0 Comic Book</span></h3>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_0\" title=\"Sonichu 0\">Sonichu 0</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>\n<p>$10.00\n</p><p><b>Overview</b>\n</p>\n<ul><li>Handmade item</li>\n<li>Materials: paper, ink</li>\n<li>Made to order</li>\n<li>Ships worldwide from Ruckersville, Virginia</li></ul>\n<p><b>Item Details</b>\n</p><p>This is a Preorder of a Printed version of my first Sonichu Comic Book, #0.

Are we ALL so Bleeding Paranoid that we are forced into a Sense of Psuedo-Autism by remaining CONSTANTLY with our faces looking at Screens and Monitors, with LACK of REAL Eye Contact from Initial In Person, Face-to-Face MEETINGS at a Bar, Shopping Mall, College Library, or Coffee Shop?! Not Only do I, PERSONALLY, Suck at Meeting and Communicating with People ONLINE, ESPECIALLY to Establish Honest and Real and True Relationships in the Trials and Errors that are Not Only More Efficient and Better WITHOUT Hiding Behind Screens and Monitors,... *sigh* BUT I remain Constantly LONELY and Freaking SHY from Lack of Women ACTUALLY offering me their Time of Day Or Interest, Face-To-Face. But I digress.\n</p><p>(Of which SEGA is still quoted for their Sonic characters, and Nintendo for Pikachu). But I have my own personal copyright on Sonichu, Rosechu, and everything else therein. Also, any names, or persons, illustrated in any of the Sonichu Comics, except that of my own, that may seem similar to anyone in real life or wherever else, are purely coincidental or otherwise parodic, and not cannon to their source stories and/or formats). Also, the legal page, and the corner author note on the front will be updated to respectively match my current name and other related items. The contents of this and the other completed and future books have been edited to allow the age range to be for the TV-Y7 and above.\n</p><p>Also, please do continue to show me your support by buying a medal, a custom figure, or donate towards my creation and peace of mind cause. Thank You, and have a Great and Safe Day.\n</p>\n<ul><li><ul><li>Please note: This is the ONLY way to order the book.</li></ul></li></ul>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"OfficialCWCmart_listings\">OfficialCWCmart listings</span></h3>\n<p>Later on, on 19 <a href=\"/cwcki/January_2024\" title=\"January 2024\">January 2024</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Praetor\" title=\"Praetor\">Praetor</a> also started selling the first 4 issues of Sonichu on <a href=\"/cwcki/OfficialCWCmart\" title=\"OfficialCWCmart\">OfficialCWCmart</a> for $30 an issue, a significant markup from his ealrier offerings.
