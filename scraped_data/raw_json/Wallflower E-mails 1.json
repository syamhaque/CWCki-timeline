I may have missed it during our last talk, but how did you think of &lt;CENSORED&gt; for a pen name?\n<p>Anyway, other things on my mind. I have read from you &lt;CENSORED&gt; bio page that you are about non-stop on listening to <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_music\" title=\"Chris and music\">music</a>; that is cool. My father has raised me on a variety of jazz, classic, country, \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Plush_breasts\" title=\"Plush breasts\">jugs</a>, kazoos and washboards\" music and others. I like all kinds of music, as long as it has a good beat and the lyrics are comprehensible. Mostly I listen to Pop and Lite Rock, but I do occasionally enjoy the classics. My favorite artists are <a href=\"/cwcki/Britney_Spears\" title=\"Britney Spears\">Britney Spears</a> and the Backstreet Boys (I like a lot of others as well, but the list would take me a while to type, and I have like way over 1,000 tracks on my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Playstation_3\" title=\"Playstation 3\">Playstation 3</a> HDD.\n</p><p>Mostly, I enjoy drawing, writing and playing <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Video_games\" title=\"Video games\">video games</a>, but I do get out often for good exercise, plus some more exercise playing <a href=\"/cwcki/Guitar_Hero\" title=\"Guitar Hero\">Guitar Hero</a> (I stand to play; it is a great way to go wild in a rockin' way). As you know, I update my <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia\" title=\"CWCipedia\">CWCipedia</a> most daily with at least answering my letters in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag\" title=\"Mailbag\">mailbag</a>, rather or not I upload a new page or two to my <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\">comic</a> pages. (Just a reminder, ignore all the current ads, especially the oversized ones that occupy the top space of every page; this guy, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Mao\" title=\"Mao\">Mao</a>, of his copycat website called the <a href=\"/cwcki/Asperchu#Asperpedia\" title=\"Asperchu\">Asperpedia</a> have bought out the previous person who had control of the adspace. Now he is abusing me with cheap shots at things that irritate me; people can be so cruel and vicious) I am working on finding someone locally in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Charlottesville\" title=\"Charlottesville\">C-Ville</a> who has a piece of citizenship within Europe who can buy out the adspace and all that. I'm hoping I can get someone like the <a href=\"/cwcki/My_Coke_Rewards\" title=\"My Coke Rewards\">Coca Cola</a> company or even a videogame company like Rockstar or something to help me out there. The hateful letters I get are minuscule compared to having to cope with the oversized cheap-shot taunts from that S.O.B. of Asperpedia.\n</p><p><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress_sigh\" title=\"Stress sigh\">*sigh*</a> But I digress. You can still enjoy the comic pages I have drawn from <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_0\" title=\"Sonichu 0\">my Book 0</a> to the latest page in 10.\n</p><p>I mentioned a book to you earlier, \"<a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Giver\" title=\"wikipedia:The Giver\">The Giver</a>\"; the author is <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lois_Lowry\" title=\"wikipedia:Lois Lowry\">Lois Lowry</a>, and I highly recommend it. I quote the preview on my copy of the book's back, \"Jonas's world is perfect. Everything is under control. There is no war or fear or pain. There are no choices. Every person is assigned a role in the Community. When Jonas turns twelve he is singled out to received special train from The Giver. The Giver alone holds the memories of the true pain and pleasure of life. Now it's time for Jonas to receive the truth. There is no turning back.\" Lois received the \"John Newbery <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Medal\" title=\"Medal\">Medal</a>\" for this book and another she wrote.\n</p><p>To learn more about each other, let's learn some basics; I'll ask you a question, to respond in your reply or phone/IM conversation, and I give you my answer right after each question. -What is your favorite color?

I also enjoy building with <a href=\"/cwcki/Lego\" title=\"Lego\">Lego</a> bricks and pieces, I collected Transformers and other toys, and doing chores around the house. -Do you currently go to, or have already completed, College? I went to <a href=\"/cwcki/Piedmont_Virginia_Community_College\" title=\"Piedmont Virginia Community College\">Pidemont Virginia Community College</a> for a few years and earned a Degree and a Certificate in Computer Aided Drafting and Design (<a href=\"/cwcki/CADD\" title=\"CADD\">CADD</a>). -What is your favorite food to eat?

I saw it in a fanfiction I read about 3 years ago, and I really liked it, so I kept it for myself ( I guess I can't really claim it). Yeah, I liked <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Backstreet_Boys\" title=\"wikipedia:The Backstreet Boys\">Backstreet Boys</a>, but that was during high school, I still listen to them occasionally. I don't like most kinds of music, especially country. But I also like soundtracks (from the movies I've seen), songs or scores, doesn't matter.<br/>\n<p>2. Thanks, I like my writing style too. Like I said, I've been writing since 8th grade and haven't stopped. So I guess when you looked at my bio at &lt;CENSORED&gt;, you probably know my hobbies, movies, music, and shows. I guess I haven't updated on my shows in awhile, since Sanctuary isn't on the list. By the way, you can watch season 2 on <a href=\"/cwcki/YouTube\" title=\"YouTube\">Youtube</a>. I've been watching those to catch up on the season.<br/>\n3. to answer questions: my fav color(s) is red, black, emerald, &amp; turqouise (i hate that word, spelling it I mean), I like mint chocolate chip too (but it has to be green), I also like dove bars and nutty buddy (I used to eat those at school too). For my other hobbies, I love studying/reading about owls. I have three good books about them. I didn't go to college, but I did take a course on computers (that sucked) at <a href=\"/cwcki/Piedmont_Virginia_Community_College\" title=\"Piedmont Virginia Community College\">PVCC</a>. I think I just like working, and having my four days off. Hmm, thats hard. I really like spaghetti with just butter, orville microwave popcorn (my dad also makes really good popcorn), and I love seafood (shellfish, catfish), definitely prime ribs (i grew up on those), and of course I love Japanese food (shrimp tempura and smoked eel sushi). Mostly I like cheese and black olives (not the expensive kind), but at TipTop, I love gyro meat and mushroom.\nI also love watching my anime from time to time.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p><b>January 28</b>\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>I agree with you on the Ice Cream; I have tried both the Green and the White M.C.C.s, and I liked the Green better. In fact, when I first tried the flavor, it was Green. Gyro Meat, and I have had Gyro Sandwiches before, is a bit of steak, so Steak and Mushrooms are your choice, cool. I hear you on the spelling of turquoise, it's like you have to have a spell-checker for it, OR have one of Crayola's thick markers or original crayon and read the word from the side. :-D But it does seem we both are on the blue-side, since emerald and turquoise are shades of green, which is made of blue and yellow. I have not tried Dove candy bars, but my family and I like Nutty Buddy bars.\n<p>My personal experience at <a href=\"/cwcki/Piedmont_Virginia_Community_College\" title=\"Piedmont Virginia Community College\">PVCC</a> could have been better; it sucked for me too. Mostly because I didn't have too many friends there, and that was where my <a href=\"/cwcki/Love_Quest\" title=\"Love Quest\">Sweetheart Search</a> had started at (which you'll read about a bit in my <a href=\"/cwcki/Sub-Episodes\" title=\"Sub-Episodes\">Sub-Episodes</a> of my comics). The <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh#Renaming_and_retcons\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Slaweel Ryam</a> character was originally based of of <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Mary Lee Walsh</a>, the \"Dean of Student Services\". I have some troubles with authority awareness; Unless it is as high as a President, Principle, or the <a href=\"/cwcki/Jerkop\" title=\"Jerkop\">Police</a> People in Blue/Black or something like that, if they get on my nerves, I gave little regard and look down upon them. I am better on that nowadays. In a nutshell, in my early days of my Search, I had a <a href=\"/cwcki/Attraction_Sign\" title=\"Attraction Sign\">sign</a> next to me (later learning from my <a href=\"/cwcki/Barbara_Chandler\" title=\"Barbara Chandler\">mother</a> that it made me look <a href=\"/cwcki/Slow-in-the-minds\" title=\"Slow-in-the-minds\">retarded</a>) letting the ladies know I was single (I was way more shy back then, even to speak), and Mary came to me, grabbed my sign and ripped it up right in front of me... it shattered my <a href=\"/cwcki/Heart_level\" title=\"Heart level\">heart</a>. So I took it out creatively by making her a major villain in my books. I forgave her about <a href=\"/cwcki/October_2009\" title=\"October 2009\">October of 2009</a>, and I drew and framed (with a nice frame I bought from a Goodwill) an apology drawing/note; she responded to me with a Trespassing Notice, which was snail-mailed to me a couple of days later. My family and I did not accept it, and we fought it for a little while. Slaweel and I are to have our final battle, put her in jail and remove her as a major villain in the 10th book I'm working on now. <a href=\"/cwcki/Count_Graduon\" title=\"Count Graduon\">Count Graduon</a> will be the Major Villain beyond then, possessing the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Metal_Sonichu\" title=\"Metal Sonichu\">Metal Sonichu</a> that crashed on the moon back in <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_1\" title=\"Sonichu 1\">Book 1</a>.\n</p><p>Do you keep with current events locally as well? I do sometimes. I've followed the story of the search for <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Morgan_Dana_Harrington\" title=\"wikipedia:Murder of Morgan Dana Harrington\">Morgan Dana Harrington</a>; I never met her, and I was not at the Metallica concert, but I just could not ignore it. I paid my respects an early Sunday last December at the push-pin board on the bridge by the J.P.J. and left a note saying that she has a lot of people worrying about her and that she come back home safely, with a little <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(character)\" title=\"Sonichu (character)\">Sonichu</a>/<a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu\" title=\"Rosechu\">Rosechu</a> drawing on that note. I wonder how it stood the test of time over the weather; I plan on checking it the next time I'm there. It saddened me a bit on how they found her dead in a hayfield on the farm, but at least we don't have to question her condition anymore. Also, I showed my <a href=\"/cwcki/Evan\" title=\"Evan\">respect</a> for the Haiti victims with a <a href=\"/cwcki/File:HelpHaitSonichu.jpg\" title=\"File:HelpHaitSonichu.jpg\">drawing</a> on the Cwcipedia, and I read this morning in the Washington Post about how a little girl miraculously survived for 15 days under steel and concrete rubble. Most of the time, I don't pay attention to most news topics due to bad news or that it can confuse me. I am no Stock Market expert. :-D\n</p><p>I have more drawing and coloring to do today, so I'll wrap it up for now. Also, I was thinking about inviting you to some hang-out time, and maybe dinner, one day next week. I can pick you up at the wellness center after you finish work, or meet you at <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Fashion_Square\" title=\"Fashion Square\">Fashion Square</a> or Downtown Mall, and we'll share a nice afternoon together.

By the way, just to be honest, and I like mentioned to you on that Friday, I'm not totally ready to be in a relationship yet. Definitely friends. I'm not the romantic type. I devote my time with work and stories. Lol, sometimes my friends try to force me out of the house. Just to get me some fresh air, and out of my chair, and away from my 'prescious' laptop.<br/>\n<p>Yeah, I don't follow the news or local ones, unless it delts with my fav music group (like the CW coming to CVille).

If you made it to work at the C.W.C. today, I hope you had a good work day.\n<p>I watched the marathon of \"Ghost Hunters\" season 5 episodes yesterday, starting from the one guest-investigating Meat Loaf. I really enjoyed watching the debunking and spook-findings. It was fascinating, yet spooky, how M.L.'s water bottle went from the windowsill to the toilet back. Fort Henry and the Hindenberg's Harbor 1 had quite a few spooks in themselves. I also was intrigued on the Rocky Mountain house, with the bloody walls that turned out to be a plumbing fixer-upper and a young Hyancith entertaining a couple of customers. \n</p><p>Also, I have a question that your vast G.H. knowledge can answer. The first ever G.H. episode I watched on SyFy was one with two investigations; I vaguely remember the episode. All I can remember of it was the second investigation was at a restaurant/hotel in a U.S. state (the building was vintage and red), and one of the spooks was in an upstairs bathtub where the women who were bathing felt like they were constantly being watched. I know they had one of their girls with them on the case, one of the Krises or Amy, who personally emped the tub. I only saw the episode once, and I have searched on the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PSN\" title=\"PSN\">Playstation Store</a> for the episode, but their descriptions can be made easier to understand. Do you remember which season/episode is the one I'm describing? \n</p><p>Also my PC went down last Saturday (I think I've said that, but I'm unsure) after the 40 minute power failure. I have finally managed to get it fully operational again, so I'll be updating my Cwcipedia today with <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag\" title=\"Mailbag\">Mailbag</a> answerings and new Character Bio Pages. \n</p><p>Also, I have <a href=\"/cwcki/Father_Call\" title=\"Father Call\">shoveled a lot of snow</a> yesterday and today.

Actually, I've just had an idea; since we'll be having the next Young Adult Social Group meeting Friday of next week, how about I pick you up from work, we go to the Tip Top, then I drive us to the Key Center for the meet, and I can drive you home after.

And I'm curious, what is your life <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Dream\" title=\"Dream\">dream</a>(s)? In a nutshell, I had the dreams of being married to my woman <a href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart\" title=\"Sweetheart\">sweetheart</a>, and having and being a father of a daughter; her name will be <a href=\"/cwcki/Crystal_Weston_Chandler_(daughter)\" title=\"Crystal Weston Chandler (daughter)\">Crystal Weston Chandler</a>.

For years, I went to the League hosted at <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/The_(Game_%26_Hobby)_Place\" title=\"The (Game &amp; Hobby) Place\">The (Game &amp; Hobby) Place</a>. It was good, and I helped out a lot being Vice-Gym Leader, maintaining peace, putting together strong decks from scratch for new young players and all the good volunteer work. The Leader was a Physics Teacher at the local C-Ville High School, you may know him, Tony Wayne. He was a good <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Family_guy\" title=\"Family guy\">family guy</a>. Last I heard, he gave that up and passed the G.L. torch to someone else.\n</p><p>Anyway, for some easons, the \"store manager\", <a href=\"/cwcki/Michael_Snyder\" title=\"Michael Snyder\">Mike</a>, hated me. And in June of <a href=\"/cwcki/2008\" title=\"2008\">2008</a>, he <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Banned\" title=\"Banned\">banned</a> me from the store for good-like. Unwritten Trespassing Notice and all. I didn't care much for Mike either; it really hurt me, what he did to me there, and <a href=\"/cwcki/6_June_2010\" title=\"6 June 2010\">I still feel a bit of old anger against him</a>. Hopefully, though, by now he's either moved on or replaced at the store.\n</p><p>Those were good times over the years. Anyhoo, I lately was considering starting up my own Poke'mon TCG League at another store in C-Ville. I have found information on how on pokemon.com.

I also watched his other movie, Hoot. I just got into the book, and let me tell you, I get so sucked into it. I'm started to enjoy reading it from Percy's pov (then again I'm picturing him as Logan ). I can't tell you which is better, the book or the movie; because they're both excellent, in my opinion anyway.<br/>\nI guess Dustin decided to take a break from ghost hunting; I guess I can't blame him. Lol.<br/>\nI actually have two lifetime goals. I've always wanted to be an author (getting there) and to be an owl biologist. I guess you would expect something like that from me.
