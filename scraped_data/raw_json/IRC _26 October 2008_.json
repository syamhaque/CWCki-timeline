  "html_content": "<div class=\"mw-body-content mw-content-ltr\" dir=\"ltr\" id=\"mw-content-text\" lang=\"en\"><div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p>In the early morning of 26 <a href=\"/cwcki/October_2008\" title=\"October 2008\">October 2008</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris\" title=\"Chris\">Chris</a> chatted in <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(IRC_chat)\" title=\"Sonichu (IRC chat)\">#sonichu</a> for about an hour.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Summary\">Summary</span></h2>\n<p>This is one of Chris's earlier fan chats, taking place just after the climax of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Blanca_Weiss\" title=\"Blanca Weiss\">Blanca Weiss</a> saga. Thanks to the cumulative <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress\" title=\"Stress\">stress</a> of losing Blanca and seeing his <a href=\"/cwcki/Medallions\" title=\"Medallions\">medallions</a> immersed in pickle juice, on 21 October Chris <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_Chan_Update_21_October_2008\" title=\"Chris Chan Update 21 October 2008\">crashed into slumber</a>. At this point Chris is trying to bounce back a bit.\n</p><p>The most historically significant element of the chat is Chris's first reference to <a href=\"/cwcki/Chloe\" title=\"Chloe\">Chloe</a>, one of the rare occasions where he's made up a <a href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart\" title=\"Sweetheart\">sweetheart</a> almost entirely out of thin air. He claims that they met at Gamestop, that they went to Taco Bell together, that she's gorgeous, that he's gotten to second base with her, and that she is his \"VIRGIN-TAKER,\" but of course she is \"shy\" and doesn't want to be seen on the Internet.\n</p><p>Chris's story doesn't hold any water on its face, but it's possible to spot some specific inconsistencies if one is familiar with the details of his life around this time. He claims to have met Chloe in mid-September, which means he was seeing her at the same time he was declaring (at the end of September) that Blanca was his one, true, divinely-ordained future partner. Likewise he claims that they officially hooked up in mid-October, before Blanca dumped him. If that was the case, why did losing Blanca hit him so hard? In any event, Chloe would be a short-lived phenomenon. Chris mentioned her in a video the next day, and then never again.\n</p><p>Besides the tales of Chloe, the chat features more of Chris's usual creepy sexual revelations. He advises one fan with a curiosity about sex toys to \"talk to your mother about it,\" which inspires visions of a truly disturbing conversation between Chris and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Barbara\" title=\"Barbara\">Barbara</a> on the same subject. He also answers a privately messaged question from another troll with, \"<a href=\"/cwcki/User:Falsion\" title=\"User:Falsion\">Falsion</a>, you can have some of your stuff surgecally removed and put into your woman\" - use your imagination.\n</p><p>On more mundane subjects, Chris says that he likes raisins and he wants to visit England someday, since his ancestors came from there. He's alright with censorship in the media, since it protects small children. Probably the funniest line of all, though, is a comment on his self-defense skills: \"I've watched a lot of television, and I've taken a lot of P.E. Classes.\" We're sure that will serve you in good stead, Chris.\n</p><p>One troll repeatedly asks Chris what he would do \"if <a href=\"/cwcki/Robert_Simmons_V\" title=\"Robert Simmons V\">Robert Simmons</a> raped Chloe and popped her virginity before you had a chance?\" This prefigures <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">Clyde Cash</a> raping <a href=\"/cwcki/PandaHalo\" title=\"PandaHalo\">PandaHalo</a> three months later, but it's probably a coincidence.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Transcript\">Transcript</span></h2>\n<p><font color=\"#BDBDBD\">[03:49:28] Guest joined.\n<br/>[03:49:29] Guest is now known as Guest1.\n<br/>[03:49:30] Fag\\ is now known as Fag.</font>\n<br/>[03:49:31] <b>veronichan:</b> haha\n<br/>[03:49:31] <b>SonichFan1:</b> omg omg omg omg\n<br/>[03:49:40] <font color=\"#B45F04\"><b>falsion:</b></font> less obvious plz\n<br/><font color=\"#BDBDBD\">[03:49:40] Fag was kicked from the chat room by Sonee.</font>\n<br/>[03:49:44] <font color=\"#B45F04\"><b>falsion:</b></font> good\n<br/>[03:49:46] <b>veronichan:</b> must...roll...joint...quickly\n<br/>[03:49:49] <b>SonichFan1:</b> I am ripe with glee\n<br/>[03:49:56] <b>SonichuZapsOfThunder:</b> heyyy\n<br/>[03:49:58] <font color=\"#E3319D\"><b>SonichuGal:</b></font> Chris, is that you?
