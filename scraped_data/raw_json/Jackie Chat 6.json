how it originally was.<br/>\n<font color=\"#CC3299\">[8:23 pm] <b>Jacklyn Romy:</b></font>\n???<br/>\n<font color=\"#CC3299\">[8:23 pm] <b>Jacklyn Romy:</b></font>\nyou decide what canon is.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\">[8:24 pm] <b>CWC:</b></font>\ncanon in this sense means to be relative and matching.<br/>\n<font color=\"#CC3299\">[8:24 pm] <b>Jacklyn Romy:</b></font>\nhere's what you said:<br/>\n<font color=\"#CC3299\">[8:24 pm] <b>Jacklyn Romy:</b></font>\n\"Anyway the trial, and the execution will be replaced with pages that are more accurate to the stories\"<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\">[8:25 pm] <b>CWC:</b></font>\nYes.<br/>\n<font color=\"#CC3299\">[8:24 pm] <b>Jacklyn Romy:</b></font>\nso that statement means the trial wasnt canon<br/>\n<font color=\"#CC3299\">[8:25 pm] <b>Jacklyn Romy:</b></font>\nwell, you know that alec and asperchu arent trolls, they arent your enemies. so you owe it to them to replace that trial with something that shows you have nothing against them<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\">[8:25 pm] <b>CWC:</b></font>\nActually, anything having to do with specific cyber bullies/trolls were never canon to the series.<br/>\n<font color=\"#CC3299\">[8:25 pm] <b>Jacklyn Romy:</b></font>\nthe asper-ha-me-ha was just one suggestion, but you could show them do something else together<br/>\n<font color=\"#CC3299\">[8:25 pm] <b>Jacklyn Romy:</b></font>\n?<br/>\n<font color=\"#CC3299\">[8:25 pm] <b>Jacklyn Romy:</b></font>\nbut the majority of the series is about you and sonichu attacking
