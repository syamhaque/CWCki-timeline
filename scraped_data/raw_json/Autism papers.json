His original, earlier papers, dating to when Chris was five or six years old, remain locked away in <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler\" title=\"Bob Chandler\">Bob's</a> filing cabinet. Ivy discovered that it is impossible for Chris to recover them himself, as Bob kept the keys on his person at all times. As a result of Bob's death, the keys are presumably in Barbara's possession now. Either way, these autism papers can be considered lost Holy Fails, due to Chris's paranoid nature and the fact that he'd actually have to put effort into finding them, not to mention that they may have been destroyed in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Destruction_Of_Chris%27s_House\" title=\"Destruction Of Chris's House\">the house fire in January 2014</a>.\n</p><p>Chris was scheduled to receive a new mental health evaluation between August and November 2021, as part of his <a href=\"/cwcki/Jail_Saga\" title=\"Jail Saga\">court hearings</a> for <a href=\"/cwcki/Affair_with_Mother\" title=\"Affair with Mother\">incest</a>.

Kacey shared these papers with her new husband, <a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris\" title=\"Liquid Chris\">Liquid Chris</a>, who in turn distributed them online. The papers are presented here in their original form, edited only for wiki styling and linking. \n</p><p>A number of passages of this copy have been outlined in yellow highlighting marker. Most of them either describe Chris's search for a <a href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart\" title=\"Sweetheart\">sweetheart</a> or contain some of the evaluator's more favorable judgments of Chris's mental state. A few are passages that confirm the diagnosis of Chris's autism.\n</p><p>To date, this is the only independent, professional evaluation of Chris's condition available.\n</p><p>Several observers have pointed out that these documents seem to paint a surprisingly rosy picture of Chris's behavior and mental state. It helps to keep a few factors in mind, though: \n</p>\n<ul><li>The survey took place in <a href=\"/cwcki/2004\" title=\"2004\">2004</a> — at the time, Chris still attended school (at least until the suspension), went outside on a regular basis, was yet to be banned from his <a href=\"/cwcki/The_GAMe_PLACe\" title=\"The GAMe PLACe\">favorite hangout</a>, and received at least a modest amount of social interaction. He was probably in a genuinely better state of mind at the time of the exam, as opposed to Chris after years of isolation and staying indoors for days at a time.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>This survey also predates all of Chris's major run-ins with <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_the_law\" title=\"Chris and the law\">the law</a>. At the time, there was no strong evidence to suggest Chris had the potential for violent acts and merely came off as a socially awkward outcast.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Despite being famous for his wild confrontations with authority, Chris is in fact extremely deferent in the face of authority figures so long as he doesn't think they're a hindrance to him (consider the opening moments of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Father_Call\" title=\"Father Call\">Father Call</a>).</li></ul>\n<ul><li>To the uninitiated, his <a href=\"/cwcki/Love_Quest\" title=\"Love Quest\">Love Quest</a> can come across as rather sweet in an idiotic way, the desperate actions of a socially awkward but basically sincere and harmless person – after all, the majority of people want love.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>The survey was based on a fairly brief encounter with Chris by a psych<i>iatr</i>ist. Deeper autism evaluations are generally the job of a clinical psych<i>olog</i>ist, and they can involve multiple lengthy sessions. The psychiatric diagnostic process is much quicker than the psychological process, relying more on simple checklists than a battery of tests.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>The mental status exam was cursory – full autism evaluations are usually conducted alongside thorough IQ tests, while Chris's evaluator used the much quicker Folstein test. Most people, even those with mental illnesses, can still get a perfect Folstein score.</li></ul>\n<p>As trolls have learned over the years, he gets much worse with regular exposure.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Intake_Survey\">Intake Survey</span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Page_1\">Page 1</span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:CWCPsychicEvaluation11052004P1.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"413\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/b/b7/CWCPsychicEvaluation11052004P1.jpg/300px-CWCPsychicEvaluation11052004P1.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/b/b7/CWCPsychicEvaluation11052004P1.jpg/450px-CWCPsychicEvaluation11052004P1.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/b/b7/CWCPsychicEvaluation11052004P1.jpg/600px-CWCPsychicEvaluation11052004P1.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:CWCPsychicEvaluation11052004P1.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Scan of page 1.</div></div></div>\n<center><b>OUTPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES</b></center>\n<p><br/>Department of Psychiatric Medicine\n<br/><a href=\"/cwcki/University_of_Virginia\" title=\"University of Virginia\">University of Virginia</a> Health System \n</p><p><br/>Northridge Building, Suite 210, P.

His attempt took the form of a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Attraction_sign\" title=\"Attraction sign\">sign</a>, which he placed next to himself while sitting in the lobby at Piedmont. The sign was a list of qualifications that a potential girlfriend would have. He said that <span style=\"background-color:#FFFF00\">he has been very frustrated by his inability to find a girlfriend and he suffers from \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Noviophobia\" title=\"Noviophobia\">novio phobia</a>.\" This refers to his frustration that females often tell him that they already have a boyfriend.</span> While he does have <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_sex\" title=\"Chris and sex\">physical attraction</a> towards females, <span style=\"background-color:#FFFF00\">his primary frustration is with his lack of companionship.</span> He had also carried his sign in the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Fashion_Square_Mall\" title=\"Fashion Square Mall\">Fashion Square Mall</a>. This unfortunately led to him being detained by <a href=\"/cwcki/Jerkop\" title=\"Jerkop\">the police</a> and placed in handcuffs briefly, although he was not taken to jail.\n</p><p>During the interview, the patient provided the examiner with a number of examples of his <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_art\" title=\"Chris and art\">artwork</a>. Much of this artwork was centered on his interest in a video game, <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog\" title=\"Sonic the Hedgehog\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>, as well as <a href=\"/cwcki/Pok%C3%A9mon\" title=\"Pokémon\">Pokeman [<i>sic</i>]</a> cartoon characters.\n</p><p>The patient's parents provided additional historical information and documentation as to the reasons for his suspension from PVCC. According to his parents, there have been a number of incidents which led to his suspension. They feel strongly that the suspension was unwarranted and did not take into account the patient's developmental limitations. One such occurrence was during an interaction with <a href=\"/cwcki/Niggos\" title=\"Niggos\">African American</a> classmates. These young women were questioning the patient regarding his search for a girlfriend, at which point he told them they could not be his girlfriend because they were not white. This was perceived as racially insensitive, although from the patient's perspective, he was merely pointing out they did not meet his standard criteria for a <a href=\"/cwcki/Gal_pal\" title=\"Gal pal\">female companion</a>. He says that he was unaware at the time that there was any other connotation to this. Various guidance counselors at the college were working with the patient to help him adjust to the college setting. They had apparently asked him to stop carrying the sign around campus, per the patient, one of these counselors actually physically destroyed the sign to prevent this behavior. He left an angry note with <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Ms. Walsh</a>, who is in administration. He provided a copy of this note, and it is contained in the chart.

Based on the letter sent to him by the college, this was interpreted by the administrator as being a form of harassment. There were several hearings held on the matter and ultimately the patient was suspended. The criteria that have been set for his return to Piedmont included <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_anger\" title=\"Chris and anger\">anger</a> management classes, psychological evaluation, and \"social skills counseling.\" He has already undergone psychological evaluation by Robin Hawkes at the Center of Learning Potential. The recommendation concerning Mr. Chandler's <a href=\"/cwcki/Heart_level\" title=\"Heart level\">emotional status</a> is that he seek psychiatric and psychological treatment. The psychologist felt that counseling and medication would possibly address his obsessive thought patterns and assist him with social skills. She also recommended anger management training.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"PAST_PSYCHIATRIC_HISTORY:\">PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:</span></h4>\n<p>Mr. Chandler was diagnosed with autism around age five or six.

He had a normal prenatal period. He walked at normal age but was delayed in his language ability. He had some high frequency hearing loss early on. Per his parents, he did not speak until the age of seven. At around age twelve, he began to develop more effective communication skills. He apparently used the closed captioning on the television to learn how to read. There was conflict over where he would have his schooling. The school system or the Department of Social Services had attempted to place the patient in a special school. His parents were very adamant that he be in a mainstream high school. In order to maintain custody of the patient, <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler\" title=\"Bob Chandler\">the patient's father</a> moved them to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Richmond\" title=\"Richmond\">Richmond</a>, Virginia. He went to a regular middle school and <a href=\"/cwcki/Manchester_High_School\" title=\"Manchester High School\">high school</a> while there.

He was also wearing a makeshift necklace that has <a href=\"/cwcki/Medallions#Prototype\" title=\"Medallions\">a large plastic medallion in the shape of a Pokeman [<i>sic</i>] characters head</a>. He also had a number of “shrinky dink” decorations attached to this necklace. He had a large backpack that he carried with him and had a <a href=\"/cwcki/Scrapbook_of_Fail\" title=\"Scrapbook of Fail\">notebook containing a large number of drawings</a>. He showed the examiner an extensive set of <a href=\"/cwcki/Card_games\" title=\"Card games\">trading cards</a>, which he created for his video game characters. The artwork was hand drawn and then scanned into the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Computers\" title=\"Computers\">computer</a> for transfer to the card. He had a number of statistics and other information on the backside of the card. The patient pointed out a series of cards that were of a video game theme, but depicted him in various difficult situations in which he has dealt with recently. He also presented the examiner with his <a href=\"/cwcki/Business_card\" title=\"Business card\">business card</a> containing a link to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu.net\" title=\"Sonichu.net\">his website</a>. His speech was somewhat nasal with frequent, awkward laughing during his sentences. His speech was fluent. His responses were appropriate to the questions posed to him. Overall, the volume of his speech was slightly elevated, although his tone was generally pleasant and almost jovial. <span style=\"background-color:#FFFF00\">His thought processes were linear and logical. He was somewhat concrete, especially regarding social interactions.

He is left feeling somewhat frustrated as he has a strong desire for companionship, although his social limitations prevent him from being able to realize this in the way which he would like.</span> He has been on antidepressants for many years and it is not entirely clear what role they played. As mentioned above, there is a certain obsessional quality to his thoughts, although it is not clear that he meets criteria for an obsessive-compulsive disorder. Overall, he has a sense that the Paxil has been affective [<i>sic</i>] in tempering his frustrations and anger. His parents also feel he has benefited from it.
