Spamton</b>. \n</p><p>This letter contains Chris's \"Updated Ten Commandments\".<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Highlights of this letter include:\n</p>\n<ul><li>The writer of this letter is noted by Chris as being the 62nd \"Good/neutral individual who has expressed genuine good vibrations\", implying that he has received letters from 62 individual writers whist incarcerated, not counting the \"Toxic minority.\"</li>\n<li>\"...And absolutely no one of aural vibrational negative/Toxic intentions shall Ever sway me or Any of my Body and Spiritual Components within…\" Likely means that Chris, like always, outright ignores any negative or critical commentary he receives. Chris’s standard for this is anything short of mollycoddling.</li>\n<li>Chris’s supposed second coming as Jesus Christ is announced as “near-coming” in this letter, though with no precise time given, it is likely that Chris will keep claiming that it will be coming soon, just like many fundamentalist Christians and doomsayers do with the second coming of Jesus Christ.</li>\n<li>Chris brings up “… the Popular and recent Increase of Dreams in Everyone of this Earth…” and goes on to describe various unpleasant and apocalyptic scenarios. This implies that Chris is having nightmares in jail.</li>\n<li>Chris’s ‘Neo-Christianity’ is open to “…ALL valid Gods, Goddesses, and Religions….”. Which deities and beliefs are valid and which aren’t isn’t addressed, implying that this is decided by the whim of Chris himself.</li>\n<li>Chris devotes a portion of the letter to his deceased father, Bob Chandler, ten years after his death. Chris feels the need to reaffirm that Bob has merged with his counterpart from C-197. This implies that Chris might be reminiscing about his father in jail and that he misses him.</li>\n<li>When describing the Sonichu species Chris lists a few attributes, but closes with “… or whatever…” showing negligence in his supposed work as a God.</li></ul>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Letter_written_to_Chris\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Letter written to Chris</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Chris's_Response\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris's Response</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Updated_Ten_Commandments\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Updated Ten Commandments</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Gifts\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Gifts</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Original_scans\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Original scans</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Chris's_Response_2\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris's Response</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Amendments\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Amendments</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Gifts_2\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Gifts</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#See_Also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See Also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Letter_written_to_Chris\">Letter written to Chris</span></h2>\n<p>On 30 July 2021, Spamton wrote about the contents of his letter as follows:\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#F2CECE; border:1px dotted #BFA3A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>I'm not entirely sure where else I should go for this, so I'll just throw this out in the open along with a question. Recently, I've been writing letters to various prisoners (unrelated) for the holidays. Usually there's very little support for those who are incarcerated, regardless of whether they're guilty or innocent. So, oftentimes prisoners will end up feeling rather isolated and discontent, which increases their chances of reoffending. The nature of the letters I've thus far sent are religious in nature, as visiting the imprisoned is a work of mercy.\n<p>This leads me to my main point and question: I sent a letter to Chris for the holidays. I wrote to him primarily about the nature of prayer and his general circumstances in prison. I was not expecting him to write back at all, but lo and behold I managed to receive a reply from Chris. I'm a lurker at heart and not actively involved in the site itself; however, I feel an obligation to post the letter onto the site. The only issue is that I don't have the privileges to do that. So my question is if there's someone who has the ability to post threads who would be willing to share it onto the site? Or alternatively should I just dump the letter's contents in this thread so it can be reposted?\n</p><p>Again, I'm new and don't really understand how the infrastructure of the site works, nor who to contact for CWC related stuff specifically. If proof of some kind is needed, I have it. If there was a better place to post this, I apologize. I'm not really sure where else to go and I have an obligation to share this information with the rest of you.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>When told to post his letter on a thread, he replies as follows:\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#F2CECE; border:1px dotted #BFA3A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>This was likely the best option anyways. For reference, the \"JMJ\" Chris credits as a writer in the letter was attached to the top of my letter sent. It literally stands for \"Jesus, Mary and Joseph\" and is used in primarily Catholic circles and letters. The SWC is a charity organization that is an irrelevant party. Anything blacked out is personal information of some kind, just for context. I will not include the envelope itself, as there's nothing new or relevant on it.\n<p>That's all from me, your pal, Spamton.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span id=\"Chris.27s_Response\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris's_Response\">Chris's Response</span></h2>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>\n<p>(Many Spiritual Greetings)\n</p>\n<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>December 22, 2021</dd>\n<dd>1 (Chris Cross) (Chris Cross) 2021</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>\n<p>(Numerology)\n</p><p>1+(2x5)+1=12=3\n</p><p>Gala fa la ni, ⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛, and all of JMJ, SWC, ⬛⬛⬛\n</p><p>I have recieved your kind letter, and I am thankful to count you, ⬛⬛⬛, as the 62nd Good/Neutral individual who has expressed genuine good vibrations.\n</p><p>To address your letter, thou hath not told me anything I have long already Known and Foreknown.
