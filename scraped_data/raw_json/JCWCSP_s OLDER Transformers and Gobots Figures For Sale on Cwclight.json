Chris sits on his newly revealed couch and uses his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PlayStation_4\" title=\"PlayStation 4\">PlayStation 4</a> to record an announcement for his upcoming plan to sell his old <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Transformers\" title=\"Transformers\">Transformers</a></i> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Toys\" title=\"Toys\">toys</a>. Chris claims his reasoning for this is so that he can clear up space in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Big_Island_House\" title=\"Big Island House\">his home</a>, and he also continues his questionable claim that all of the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Money\" title=\"Money\">money</a> he receives goes straight to his \"savings\" to \"<a href=\"/cwcki/14_Branchland_Court#Mortgage\" title=\"14 Branchland Court\">pay off the mortgage</a>\". Chris also says that he plans to sell his <a href=\"/cwcki/Burger_King\" title=\"Burger King\">Burger King</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Pok%C3%A9mon\" title=\"Pokémon\">Pokémon</a> toys, and at the very end of the video, Chris teases his <i>Transformers</i> poster which is planned to be sold on his <a href=\"/cwcki/OfficialCWCmart\" title=\"OfficialCWCmart\">Etsy store</a>. One minute after publishing this video, Chris published <a href=\"/cwcki/JCWCSP%27s_older_Transformers_for_sale\" title=\"JCWCSP's older Transformers for sale\">JCWCSP's older Transformers for sale</a>.\n</p><p>The background music is a bit loud throughout most of the video. Shots of Chris recording some toys are edited to play while Chris's speech goes on. Chris is notably wearing his <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superdry_%26_Co\" title=\"wikipedia:Superdry &amp; Co\">Superdry</a> shirt that he likely purchased in <a href=\"/cwcki/Finland\" title=\"Finland\">Finland</a> with <a href=\"/cwcki/Flutter\" title=\"Flutter\">Flutter</a>.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Video\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Video</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Description\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Description</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Transcript\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Transcript</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Comment_Section\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Comment Section</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Video\">Video</span></h2>\n<table style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa;

We got a lot of these, uh, got a lot of the, uh, rarities and we got some, uh, all sorts. We got obviously- we got a bunch of Optimus Prime. We got some Bumblebees. We got your Megatrons. Uh, one or two Star Screams in here. I mean, obviously as you'll see in this establishing shot that's going all around panning the entire set, all of these are going to be available on the Cwclight. I am selling all of these and I am having milt- I have multiple reasons for doing this. I am clearing space for one and for another reason, I am doing this- this is why I am giving some of them for the prices that they are being listed- I'm saving money to pay off the mortgage. That still remains a very top priority with me. So, as you can see right here on the floor everybody is just, uh, individual and standing and what you see is what you get and all that. Uh, but, um... in another detail, each of these before they go out we're going to make sure all the matching pieces are with them. All these they will be wrapped in sealed plastic like this Megatron here. And that's to help make sure everything is together and so forth. And also with a lot of these where there's loose parts and pieces or additional parts, yeah, we put them in a Ziploc bag like this and they are individually labeled so they know that they match up and everything. And yep, I'm just gonna move this over so you can see. Yep this box is, uh, is full of these guys that are tagged and bagged pretty much. I'm also mentioning this as well as I'm zooming in on everybody here with the- within the, uh, Ziploc bags. We paired them with what- all their weapons as best we could, okay? At least I did. Between the  [<i>mumbles</i>] reference and just what pieces I still had when I was putting these, uh, together. So, we definitely matched up Minicons with their respective, uh, bots and cons and we've also matched up Cyber Keys with their respective bots and cons as well.\n</p><p>Yep. But yeah, at this point I'm still saving money and I'm just- I'm still getting started with that. Uh, it's not substantial enough to, uh, totally make that dent in the, uh, what's left of the mortgage but still I am doing, I am saving. You can quote me. I prom- I promise you that very much. And my intention with that is this: the sale of all of these and the bigger price, that's all going towards the mortgage. Okay? So, you buy from here, you're helping me out. And there's a lot here to collect. You'll see them on the Cwclight shortly enough. They might be categorized like you got some Gobots like obviously there's a ringleader one and a crasher and a copter in there. Yep. So, you're definitely getting your collector's value all around, throughout. So, I do thank you all for your condic- consideration of this and the Transformers alternators are in that short video that's also on my YouTube. \n</p><p>[<i>cuts to clip from <a href=\"/cwcki/JCWCSP%27s_older_Transformers_for_sale\" title=\"JCWCSP's older Transformers for sale\">JCWCSP's older Transformers for sale</a></i>]\nWe are going to be selling all nine of these figures on the Cwclight and they each will come with a personally signed certificate of authenticity that I personally owned these figures and these will be shrink-wrapped. So, that's just to let you know. So, I'll be providing a link to it on the, uh, on my Bluesky and if I can- I can put-- [<i>video cuts abruptly</i>]\n</p><p>All right and also to mention this as well, uh, each and every one of these figures they will be complete with a certificate of authenticity personally signed by me letting you know that you are getting one that has been personally owned and blessed by me. And, uh, also this is going\nto take a while for me to, uh, have set up on the Cwclight. So if there's anybody that, uh, from watching this video, uh, know who they are and see anything you like, message me personally and directly through Cwclight and maybe we can arrange something. But uh, obviously yeah I gotta give priority to the mortgage so that price is going to be high. I'm being honest with you and direct. All right? I got to do that. And there will be other things I'll be putting on the Cwclight later of which, uh, I will be selling those as well. Like, uh, just to mention this as well. I'm going to be selling my collection of Burger King Pokemon toys, Pokeballs labeled and included so they have the matching Pokemon in them. So that's just to let you know. It's- I'm giving you at least most of them. Um, I don't have the containers for the Mew or Mewtwo anymore but at least I do have both of those figures. But that's a whole different day, another time.\n</p><p>But anyway, this is just one lovely massive update I am letting you all know about. So, I pray that y'all will consider this and help me out and buy one, buy a bunch or if you actually have all that money buy them all, haha. A highly highly impossibility there but I'm just remain as optimistic as possible. Thank you all very much and have a lovely, safe, blessed day all of you.\n</p><p>[<i>cuts to Transformers poster</i>]\nAnd coming soon to our Etsy store, we have the full art of our Transformers Legacy United Merge poster. So, you're not just getting one half or the other, you're getting the whole poster. And the size will vary. It'll be a bit bigger than the one we have on display right here. And each poster will be personally signed as you can see right there for this one. So be sure to get your orders in after we start stocking them and then you can enjoy in a big memorable thing with this lovely poster art.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Comment_Section\">Comment Section</span></h2>\n<p>On 9 November, Chris replied to a commenter on the video:\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#F2CECE; border:1px dotted #BFA3A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">n00bzers</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Hello at 1:17 you brought up a Megatron I very much would like to purchase.
