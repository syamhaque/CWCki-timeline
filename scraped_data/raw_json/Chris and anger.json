Chris has <b>anger</b> management issues that usually surface when he is under <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress\" title=\"Stress\">stress</a>. Trolls refer to Chris's fits of rage as \"<b>tard rage</b>\", an expression normally used to describe the seemingly <a href=\"/cwcki/100_2278\" title=\"100 2278\">superhuman strength</a> a normally mild-tempered <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Slow-in-the-mind\" title=\"Slow-in-the-mind\">slow-in-the-mind</a> displays when he or she is pushed too far and goes on an anger-fueled rampage.

She allegedly traumatized Chris by locking him alone up in a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris%27s_room\" title=\"Chris's room\">room full of toys</a> when he was a year old. Ironically, Chris did the same to himself up until the date of his <a href=\"/cwcki/Jail_Saga\" title=\"Jail Saga\">arrest</a> at almost age 40.\n</p><p>Another person who may be behind Chris's anger issues could have been his late father, <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler\" title=\"Bob Chandler\">Bob</a>. Being Bob's son, Chris would likely have been afraid to retaliate to the things Bob did that annoyed him, such as very rarely washing his hands, making Chris remove videos from \"the damn Internet\", and occasionally <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Walks_In\" title=\"Bob Walks In\">cutting down Chris's access to the web</a>. Chris then takes out his anger on innocent, well-meaning <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">trolls</a>, such as <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">Clyde Cash</a>.\n</p><p>Another cause of Chris's anger is the fact that up until 30 years of age, Chris was a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Virgin\" title=\"Virgin\">virgin</a>. Being a virgin seemed to make Chris feel like he was entitled to be allowed frequent moments of rage and seeing as he only <a href=\"/cwcki/Mass_debating\" title=\"Mass debating\">mass debated</a> twice a week due to his bent <a href=\"/cwcki/Duck\" title=\"Duck\">duck</a>, he may have had large amounts of <a href=\"/cwcki/Semen\" title=\"Semen\">testosterone</a> stored up in his body he just needed to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Recycling\" title=\"Recycling\">get out</a>. Sexual frustration can make even the best of us a bit cranky, though never to this extreme. After supposedly losing his virginity to <a href=\"/cwcki/Mia_Hamm\" title=\"Mia Hamm\">Mia Hamm</a>, Chris did not hesitate in ending his 2-year hiatus from <a href=\"/cwcki/Twitter\" title=\"Twitter\">Twitter</a> just to wish death upon <a href=\"/cwcki/Michael_Snyder\" title=\"Michael Snyder\">Michael Snyder</a>.\n</p><p>Furthermore, Chris is <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Autistic\" title=\"Autistic\">autistic</a> and therefore lacks an understanding of the social restraints of anger. When he gets angry, he sees no reason why he shouldn't go positively <i>nuts</i>. This and the amount of bottled-up stress that autism produces have shown that autistic <i>children</i> can be very short-tempered. Chris, however, is not an autistic child – he is an autistic <i>adult</i>, and while most other autistics learn how to cope with stress in ways other than tantrums by the time they're in their 30s, Chris hasn't. Somewhat ironically, Chris's autism seems to cause him a large amount of anger, since the rest of the world will not acknowledge the \"brilliance\" of <i>Sonichu</i> – which is apparently directly brought about by Chris's autism.\n</p><p>But the one thing that causes Chris's anger, more than anything, is the lack of control he has over everything. His own <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ego\" title=\"Ego\">ego</a> refuses to allow Chris to think of anything but himself, and when things spiral out of control, he gets frustrated. When <a href=\"/cwcki/THAT_IS_MY_HOUSE\" title=\"THAT IS MY HOUSE\">Bob demanded that Chris take down the videos of their house</a>, Chris could only flail and tell him that he didn't know what to do, only to tell his \"fans\" to take it down for him. When <a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris\" title=\"Liquid Chris\">someone pretends to be him</a> and be more popular than him, he rages because he feels that it's his popularity, not the faker's. When people <a href=\"/cwcki/Asperchu\" title=\"Asperchu\">poke fun at him</a> or <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_39\" title=\"Mailbag 39\">constantly question one's gender</a>, he goes into a hissy fit.\n</p><p>Chris's anger issues date back to before even the formal beginning of his <a href=\"/cwcki/Love_Quest\" title=\"Love Quest\">Love Quest</a>. In <a href=\"/cwcki/2000\" title=\"2000\">2000</a>, he was prescribed the antidepressant <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paroxetine\" title=\"wikipedia:Paroxetine\">Paxil</a> to help manage his frustration and anger, and he continued to take the drug for several years. Whatever effect his medication had, it clearly wasn't enough.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Examples_of_Chris.27s_anger\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Examples_of_Chris's_anger\">Examples of Chris's anger</span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Blachu_Medallion.JPG\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"360\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/3/3f/Blachu_Medallion.JPG/300px-Blachu_Medallion.JPG\" srcset=\"/w/images/3/3f/Blachu_Medallion.JPG 1.5x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Blachu_Medallion.JPG\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Now with the Blachu Medallion.</div></div></div>\n<p>The way Chris expresses his anger can be considered confusing, to say the least. In one of his early fits of rage, he began to shout \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Curse-ye-ha-me-ha\" title=\"Curse-ye-ha-me-ha\">Curse-ye-ha-me-ha</a>\" at several <a href=\"/cwcki/Jerkop\" title=\"Jerkop\">jerkops</a> who were trying to kick him out of a local <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Walmart\" title=\"Walmart\">Walmart</a>. In general, Chris expresses anger like an Internet tough guy would do, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/A_Message_to_the_Trolls\" title=\"A Message to the Trolls\">taking out his anger on a video camera</a> knowing that it obviously can't and won't fight back. This can be seen in one of his videos on Clyde Cash where he seems to be \"Hulking up\". He also used to beat up representations of people he disliked in <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Soul_Calibur\" title=\"Soul Calibur\">Soul Calibur</a></i>. On the other hand, even as he is seemingly scared of expressing his anger in real life, he seems to have outbursts when sufficiently pushed as well. Chris was at one point forced to take anger management classes sometime after his final confrontation with <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Mary Lee Walsh</a>. What happened during this epic struggle is only known in Chris's own words.\n</p>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">\"Then that B-Dog ripped up my notes and all, dragged me to her quarters and talked down to me very RUDELY AND HOARSELY.

In this video Chris repeatedly threatens poor Clyde, claiming he will indeed <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Strangle_that_Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Strangle that Clyde Cash\">strangle him</a> someday, even going as far as telling Clyde he will even commit this heinous and reprehensible act in a police station, showing Chris has no control over his angry feelings. The fact Clyde was only trolling Chris in an attempt to lash out at him for his role in the fictional death of his late brother <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ryan_Cash\" title=\"Ryan Cash\">Ryan Cash</a> shows even further how much Chris may still require a couple of anger management classes. His cameras would also benefit from some relief as he often punches them to dramatically end his more rage-infused videos.\n</p><p>On several occasions, Chris has also shouted and screamed in videos, and concluded his argument with some sort of a heinous threat — and promptly followed this up with his trademark conclusion of saying \"peace\" and showing the peace sign, or with \"Have a nice day,\" or something similar. Chris is apparently completely oblivious to how jarring it is to go from yelling <a href=\"/cwcki/THAT_IS_MY_HOUSE\" title=\"THAT IS MY HOUSE\">\"get everything off the internet <i>now</i>, <i><b>now, NOW, NOWNOWNOWNOOOOOW!!!!</b></i>\"</a> to \"Curse the trolls, peace to everyone else\" immediately afterward.\n</p>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">I will be continuing my comics at the moment.

In the <a href=\"/cwcki/Take_that_Page_DOWN_NOW!\" title=\"Take that Page DOWN NOW!\">Take that Page DOWN NOW!</a> video a picture of Clyde Cash was taped to the doll and Chris beat it like a spoiled 3-year-old who smashes a plate of broccoli because he didn't get his way. He also attempted to rip off its head at one point, only to have it slide out through his greasy palms. Chris would attempt to bite the doll's head off again in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Sign_Destruction_Video\" title=\"Sign Destruction Video\">Sign Destruction Video</a>, but fans of the doll will be relieved to know that Chris is far too weak to break anything of value; he was merely only able to tear off the clown's hat. In his video <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_Loses_It\" title=\"Chris Loses It\">Chris Loses It</a>, Chris proved to us that he's able to shred in half a small cardboard box, but is unable to go through light press wood. The video also shows his poor acting skills only equal his overall stamina, since he's out of breath before the end of the first minute of the video. A rare example where Chris's anger manifested into physical violence against others would be the infamous <a href=\"/cwcki/26_December_2014\" title=\"26 December 2014\">blarms incident</a> where he maced a GameStop employee during his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Blarms\" title=\"Blarms\">war on Sonic's new arm color.</a>\n</p>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">RRRAAAARRGGHH!!\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:11px; padding:0 0 0 16px; vertical-align:bottom; width:20px\">”\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\" style=\"font-size:smaller; padding:8px 36px; text-align:right;\"><cite>Most of the monologue in the Chris Loses It video.</cite>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>Another example has shown that Chris can and will blow up at people even on the telephone. When Chris mistakenly believed that <a href=\"/cwcki/Jason_Kendrick_Howell\" title=\"Jason Kendrick Howell\">Jason Kendrick Howell</a> had hacked his website, he left an <a href=\"/cwcki/Jason_Kendrick_Howell_message\" title=\"Jason Kendrick Howell message\">angry voicemail</a>. In the <a href=\"/cwcki/Father_Call\" title=\"Father Call\">Father Call</a>, Chris quickly became rude to <a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey\" title=\"Kacey\">Kacey</a>'s father, Matthew, especially when the man came down on Chris for his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Health\" title=\"Health\">health</a> and his attitude. Even worse, when Chris <a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey_and_Liquid_Call\" title=\"Kacey and Liquid Call\">talked to Kacey and Liquid</a>, he came up in arms over Liquid's continued referral of \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Ian_Brandon_Anderson\" title=\"Ian Brandon Anderson\">Ian Brandon Anderson</a>\" and was completely oblivious over the fact that Kacey was getting upset over the entire thing. Even worse, Chris attempted to hang up on both Matthew AND Kacey, only succeeding with Kacey because he got his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Barbera_Chandler\" title=\"Barbera Chandler\">mom</a> and dad in on the conversation. Both instances show that Chris loses his <a href=\"/cwcki/Speech_impediment\" title=\"Speech impediment\">stammering</a> and actually starts speaking normally when enraged.\n</p><p>Around the time when Chris opened the Mailbag to his <a href=\"/cwcki/True_and_Loyal_Fanbase\" title=\"True and Loyal Fanbase\">adoring fans</a>, another factor that causes Chris some notable grief was discovered to be the mention of any similarity between high-functioning autism and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Asperger%27s_syndrome\" title=\"Asperger's syndrome\">Asperger's syndrome</a>. Chris has shown himself to be quite adamant that HFA and Asperger's are entirely unrelated, despite documentation by researchers suggesting quite the opposite. Whilst the anger related to this is of a far lesser magnitude in comparison to, for example, the Liquid Chris saga, it's still clear he's easily irritated by the mere mention of the matter:\n</p>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">IF ANYTHING, the Asperger people ARE and HAVE BEEN NORMAL.

However, the CWCipedia article makes it clear that Chris is angry at Asperger's sufferers for \"stealing\" the limelight from autistic folks such as himself. He seems to believe that those diagnosed with the condition are faking it to get attention, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_Ego\" title=\"Chris and his Ego\">attention that he feels he deserves as an autistic person</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Decline_of_the_tard_raging\">Decline of the tard raging</span></h2>\n<p>In recent years, Chris's behavior has generally started to get much less aggressive. Possible reasons for this include medication, effects of therapy, becoming more relaxed in his older age, or an increasing (but not perfect) resistance to trolls and <a href=\"/cwcki/Weens\" title=\"Weens\">weens</a> brought on by years of wear.\n</p><p>Some of Chris's medication is credited for anxiety relief by him, including Paxil/Paroxetine, an unspecified blood-pressure prescription, and Valium.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-meds_2-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-meds-2\">[2]</a></sup> He attended therapy after the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Pepper_spray\" title=\"Pepper spray\">pepper spray</a> incident and apparently learned new methods of coping. An example of this can be seen in the revised <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_10\" title=\"Sonichu 10\"><i>Sonichu</i> #10</a>, which includes a text that appears to be inspired by a therapy session.\n</p><p>For examples of trolling which didn't elicit rage, Chris did not go into a fit when the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jeff/Francine\" title=\"Jeff/Francine\">Jeff/Francine</a> troll tried to \"steal\" his identity, making videos on it but refraining from <a href=\"/cwcki/CHRIS!!!_CHANDLER!!!\" title=\"CHRIS!!! CHANDLER!!!\">screaming like he did during the Liquid Saga</a>. <a href=\"/cwcki/Michael_Hirtes\" title=\"Michael Hirtes\">Michael Hirtes</a>'s attempts to troll him were almost always met by Chris simply blocking his multiple accounts, until Chris gave up and just \"[disabled notifications] with this kid, and let him go on\". Similarly, in response to <a href=\"/cwcki/PewDiePie\" title=\"PewDiePie\">PewDiePie</a>'s video dedicated entirely to Chris, instead of complaining about him making that video, which is completely devoted to criticizing him, Chris instead simply requested for him to direct message him. \n</p><p>On the other hand, examples of when Chris recently raged include threatening <a href=\"/cwcki/Lulu\" title=\"Lulu\">Lulu</a>'s executives with violence, <a href=\"/cwcki/Pmurt\" title=\"Pmurt\">Pmurt</a>'s presidency, <a href=\"/cwcki/August_2017_tweets\" title=\"August 2017 tweets\">becoming angry at weens when they hassled Nowacking about him</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/HarassCWCdirectly\" title=\"HarassCWCdirectly\">getting angry about weens harassing Doopie to get into her pants</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/CLog_10042017_-_Q%26A_NO_MORE\" title=\"CLog 10042017 - Q&amp;A NO MORE\">having a meltdown when he thought trolls ruined his relationship with Jessica Quinn</a>, and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Twitter_blocks_from_TF2_Analysis_crew\" title=\"Twitter blocks from TF2 Analysis crew\">raging</a> at weens who got him <a href=\"/cwcki/Apologies_to_the_liked_Bronies_and_Pegasisters;_PLEASE_UNBLOCK_ME_ON_TWITTER!\" title=\"Apologies to the liked Bronies and Pegasisters; PLEASE UNBLOCK ME ON TWITTER!\">blocked</a> by several people in the My Little Pony fandom which he follows. This shows that some things still trigger Chris more than others.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Fan_videos\">Fan videos</span></h2>\n<table style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa; background-color: #f9f9f9;
