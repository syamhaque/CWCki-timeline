Being a nerd and, as of <a href=\"/cwcki/2014\" title=\"2014\">2014</a>, a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tomgirl\" title=\"Tomgirl\">member of the LGBT community</a>, Chris has common interests and values with his friends. Awkwardness arises when Chris attempts to take part in conversations which exceed his limited interests, as his broken social filter and lack of common social etiquette due to his <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">autism</a> can lead to him saying <a href=\"/cwcki/Honest_Content\" title=\"Honest Content\">inappropriate things</a> or attempting to steer the topic to cartoons, video games, <a href=\"/cwcki/Messiah_complex\" title=\"Messiah complex\">godhood</a>, or the <a href=\"/cwcki/SLGBTQ\" title=\"SLGBTQ\">SLGBTQ</a>. \n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#In_real_life\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">In real life</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Over_the_Internet\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Over the Internet</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Planet_Dolan\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Planet Dolan</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Conventions\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Conventions</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Looking_forward\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Looking forward</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#See_Also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See Also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"In_real_life\">In real life</span></h2>\n<p>The earliest known example of Chris socializing with someone other than <a href=\"/cwcki/Borb\" title=\"Borb\">Borb</a> were his interactions with <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sarah_Hammer\" title=\"Sarah Hammer\">Sarah Hammer</a>, who moved in next door to the Chandlers when he was approximately three years old. Chris fondly remembers using her swing set, playing hide and seek among other things <sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup> <sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup>, but he, far from a good judge of character even in his younger days, seemed oblivious to Sarah's less than good intentions. At least twice, she could have caused him harm of her own volition, locking him in a crawlspace and convincing him the berries of a honeysuckle (which can cause <a href=\"/cwcki/DIRTY,_CRAPPED_BRIEFS\" title=\"DIRTY, CRAPPED BRIEFS\">stomach problems</a>) tasted like honey. <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_%2B_Sarah%27s_Life-Shares\" title=\"Chris + Sarah's Life-Shares\">He nonchalantly documented both incidents</a>, in stark contrast to <a href=\"/cwcki/Kick_the_Autistic\" title=\"Kick the Autistic\">what he thinks of perceived wrongdoers</a>.\n</p><p>He stated his formative years also included interactions with \"other neighborhood children\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup>. Chris himself noted <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Gal-pals\" title=\"Gal-pals\">they were mainly girls</a>, though he also befriended <a href=\"/cwcki/Joshua_Martinez\" title=\"Joshua Martinez\">Joshua Martinez</a> (who'd eventually troll him) when attending speech therapy.\n</p><p>More notably, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Manchester_High\" title=\"Manchester High\">in his high school years</a>, he attended classes and ate lunch with a female circle of friends (because he found the <a href=\"/cwcki/JERKS\" title=\"JERKS\">males</a>, except for his older friend <a href=\"/cwcki/Joseph_Herring\" title=\"Joseph Herring\">Joseph Herring</a>, to be immature). However, the only time they were ever known to have spent time with each other outside Manchester High was for <a href=\"/cwcki/My_big_18th_party\" title=\"My big 18th party\">his 18th birthday party</a>, and even then, no photos of the occasion show him and even one of the girls near each other. Chris found out about 15 years later that they were never legitimate friends; their attention was <a href=\"/cwcki/Kiwi_Farms_posts_(Thetan)#Gal_Pals\" title=\"Kiwi Farms posts (Thetan)\">arranged</a> by <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bob\" title=\"Bob\">Bob</a> and the principal in a misguided attempt to socialize Chris.\n</p><p>After high school, and in particular after he was suspended from <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/College\" title=\"College\">college</a>, Chris used whatever free time he wasn't using at home to attempt socializing in the wild, whether it be for attempting to score <a href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart\" title=\"Sweetheart\">sweethearts</a> or otherwise. His most notable social endeavors occurred at <a href=\"/cwcki/The_GAMe_PLACe\" title=\"The GAMe PLACe\">The GAMe PLACe</a>, where he met <a href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Schroeder\" title=\"Megan Schroeder\">Megan Schroeder</a>. The two formed a strong friendship, but Chris failed to pick up how she merely wanted to be just friends with him, even when she outright told him so numerous times. To cut a long story short, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chop_Chop_Master_Onion%27s_Rap_Showdown\" title=\"Chop Chop Master Onion's Rap Showdown\">things went</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/ShecameforCWC.JPG\" title=\"ShecameforCWC.JPG\">very rocky</a>, and by 2008 Megan had severed ties with him; Chris was also banned from the aforementioned GAMe PLACe, due to acting too hostile to other patrons and card game players.\n</p><p>His other notable social endeavors occurred at the <a href=\"/cwcki/Charlottesville_Fashion_Square\" title=\"Charlottesville Fashion Square\">Charlottesville Fashion Square</a>, which he'd haunt regularly. When he wasn't shopping at its stores or going on <a href=\"/cwcki/Date_with_Emily\" title=\"Date with Emily\">ill-fated dates</a>, Chris spent a lot of his time <a href=\"/cwcki/The_Tale_Of_The_Crazy_Pacer\" title=\"The Tale Of The Crazy Pacer\">pacing around</a> in the hopes that he would eventually meet a <a href=\"/cwcki/Boyfriend-free_girl\" title=\"Boyfriend-free girl\">boyfriend-free girl</a>. Due to his antics, Chris received many run-ins with <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jerkops\" title=\"Jerkops\">jerkops</a> and temporary (eventually permanent) bans from the outlet.\n</p><p>In <a href=\"/cwcki/2014\" title=\"2014\">2014</a>, Chris began attending <a href=\"/cwcki/Cville_Pride\" title=\"Cville Pride\">Cville Pride</a> and the <a href=\"/cwcki/Impulse_Gay_Social_Club\" title=\"Impulse Gay Social Club\">Impulse Gay Social Club</a>, both of which would gradually become frequent hangout spots for him. These would serve as stepping stones for Chris to further grow out of his shell, and he later began regularly attending other places of that ilk, including LGBT events at <a href=\"/cwcki/University_of_Virginia\" title=\"University of Virginia\">University of Virginia</a>. The next year would see him attending <a href=\"/cwcki/The_End_Games\" title=\"The End Games\">The End Games</a> (a card game store) before being banned in 2018. There, he met a few adult <a href=\"/cwcki/Pok%C3%A9mon_League_friends\" title=\"Pokémon League friends\">Pokémon League friends</a> who hung out with him outside of the club.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:202px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Cwc_cville_pride_2017.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"150\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/0/0a/Cwc_cville_pride_2017.jpg/200px-Cwc_cville_pride_2017.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/0/0a/Cwc_cville_pride_2017.jpg/300px-Cwc_cville_pride_2017.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/0/0a/Cwc_cville_pride_2017.jpg/400px-Cwc_cville_pride_2017.jpg 2x\" width=\"200\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Cwc_cville_pride_2017.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>At Cville Pride.</div></div></div>\n<p>Sadly, though, Chris regressed back into staying at home thanks to what the <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys</a> did to him, giving up real life socializing in favor of his <a href=\"/cwcki/Imaginary_friends\" title=\"Imaginary friends\">imaginary friends</a> and internet <a href=\"/cwcki/Enablers\" title=\"Enablers\">enablers</a>.

For him, he's generally had a great time attending them; it's a rare chance for him to get out of his house and surround himself with like-minded people, therefore making it easier to Chris to socialize with others. He's stated he's felt more accepted at conventions, though it's debatable whether this interpretation of his is true or not.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Looking_forward\">Looking forward</span></h2>\n<p>In <a href=\"/cwcki/August_2021\" title=\"August 2021\">August 2021</a>, Chris was arrested after it was revealed he had engaged in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Affair_With_Mother\" title=\"Affair With Mother\">incestuous acts</a> with <a href=\"/cwcki/Barbara_Chandler\" title=\"Barbara Chandler\">his mother</a>. Chris eventually received an <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism_disorder_deferred_disposition\" title=\"Autism disorder deferred disposition\">autism disorder deferred disposition</a> after a lengthy court process (that included a stint in <a href=\"/cwcki/Central_Virginia_Regional_Jail\" title=\"Central Virginia Regional Jail\">Central Virginia Regional Jail</a>, a stay at a <a href=\"/cwcki/Western_State_Hospital\" title=\"Western State Hospital\">psychiatric hospital</a>, and a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Gateway_Homes\" title=\"Gateway Homes\">group home</a> transfer). Due to the deferred disposition program, Chris was released from jail in <a href=\"/cwcki/March_2023\" title=\"March 2023\">March 2023</a> and his case was dismissed in <a href=\"/cwcki/August_2023\" title=\"August 2023\">August 2023</a>. Chris gradually returned to social media where he resumed his usual antics.\n</p><p>A mysterious woman nicknamed <a href=\"/cwcki/Flutter\" title=\"Flutter\">Flutter</a> by Chris has been routinely spotted hanging out with him in public following the dismissal of his charge; she had reached out to Chris while he was in jail, and her role or purpose in interacting with him is unknown.\n</p><p>Chris apparently still maintains contact with his mother, although now living separately from her. According to a comment in April 2024 by Gamer from Mars, Chris said he meets with her about once a month.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-11\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">[11]</a></sup> While Chris didn't socialize much with his extended family prior to the incest, he may have a more difficult time with it now, given that his <a href=\"/cwcki/Aunt_Harriet_and_Uncle_Tom\" title=\"Aunt Harriet and Uncle Tom\">Aunt Harriet and Uncle Tom</a> banned him from their home upon initially learning of the incest.\n</p><p>Even after his release, the affair still comes back to haunt him.
