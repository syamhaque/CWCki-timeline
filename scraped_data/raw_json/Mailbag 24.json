Masturbating to porn is not being \"adult\"; being adult is expanding your horizons rather than being confined to your <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Video_games\" title=\"Video games\">video games</a> and kids' movies. Being adult is understanding other peoples' feelings rather than assuming their own desires. Being adult is not screaming out every goddamn secret you have to your friends, family, and even girls you may be infatuated with. Being adult, especially, is respecting others rather than bringing revenge and curses upon them just because they gave you doses of tough love you couldn't understand. An adult is not somebody who's 18 or older; I'm 18 and I'm far from being an adult. I have <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Asperger%27s\" title=\"Asperger's\">Asperger's</a>. I'm quite insulted by the way you dissed people with that disorder, calling them \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Retard\" title=\"Retard\">retards</a>\" and other derogatory words of that caliber.

However, learning my lesson, I improved my writing, humor, and overall taste in everything...and that was in one year! You have taken about 15 years to correct yourself and you haven't not corrected yourself one bit. I won't be surprised to see if you ignored this or if you want to retort in your fancy way; you can't take it, not even from your parents. If I was you, I'd run away from home and discover myself.

According to it, your father took Nathanael Greene Elementary School to court in order to prevent them from sending you to a private institution. According to it, the teachers claimed you were unruly in class, that you routinely shouted in class during lessons (they audio taped you being disruptive during class time), and even had to be physically restrained. According to it, you put a little kid in the hospital after biting off a chunk of his nose. What do you have to say to this? Why would you do this, and then lie about it and make it out like teachers were bullying you when, in reality, you were a bad child? Why the smear campaign? And why did your parents continue mainstreaming you when you obviously needed professional help and to be surrounded by people who understood your autism (mainstream teachers shouldn't have to accommodate for retards like you when retards get special schools and special teachers)?

I regularly read your comic, but I was quite Angry when I read your CWCipedia Site and saw you insult the people with Aspergers. As a REAL and GENUINE growing 31 Year-Old with Aspergers All My Life, I am Offended. I was there to Nurture the First Generation of Asperger People, as well as go beyond my Asperger Dreams above and beyond. Those with Autism dare to try and take the Limelight away from us Asperger People with their inability to do anything useful. The Autistics also dare to imitate those with Aspergers to appear Normal, but they will never Match Up with a TRUE ASPERGER PERSON!\n</p><p>VICTORY OVER ASPERGERS ONLY BELONGS TO US TRUE ASPERGER PEOPLE.\n</p><p>- Winston Quentin Shambler\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<div style=\"clear:right; background:#ffffbb; width:300px; padding:3px; border:2px solid #99aaee; float:right; font-size:90%\">\n<div class=\"floatleft\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:CWCipedia_logo.png\"><img alt=\"CWCipedia logo.png\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"60\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/5/54/CWCipedia_logo.png/60px-CWCipedia_logo.png\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/5/54/CWCipedia_logo.png/90px-CWCipedia_logo.png 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/5/54/CWCipedia_logo.png/120px-CWCipedia_logo.png 2x\" width=\"60\"/></a></div>\nFor <a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_Chris%27s_lies\" title=\"List of Chris's lies\">Truth</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Honest_Content\" title=\"Honest Content\">Honesty</a>, see the archived <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia\" title=\"CWCipedia\">CWCipedia</a> page on <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160301/http://archive.sonichu.com/cwcipedia/index.php?title=Mailbag_24\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mailbag 24</a></div>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n</p>\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"navbox\" style=\";\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"padding:2px;\">\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"nowraplinks collapsible mw-collapsed mw-collapsible\" style=\"width:100%;background:transparent;color:inherit;;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<th class=\"navbox-title\" colspan=\"2\" style=\";\"><div style=\"float:left; width:6em;text-align:left;\"> <span class=\"noprint plainlinksneverexpand\" style=\"white-space:nowrap; font-weight:normal; font-size:xx-small; ;;border:none;;\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Template:Emails\" title=\"Template:Emails\"><span style=\";;border:none;;\" title=\"View this template\">v</span></a> <span style=\"font-size:80%;\">•</span> <a href=\"/cwcki/Template_talk:Emails\" title=\"Template talk:Emails\"><span style=\"color:#002bb8;;;border:none;;\" title=\"Discussion about this template\">d</span></a> <span style=\"font-size:80%;\">•</span> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"//sonichu.com/w/index.php?title=Template:Emails&amp;action=edit\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#002bb8;;;border:none;;\" title=\"You can edit this template.
