I did not read much of the story, and I did not see the need to bother you about it.

Anyway, I'll get to the point; there is a way you can help on the elimination of the \"Chris-chan\" page on ED, basically the pages on whole ED website are wiki (similar to html editing), and setting up an account to edit the page is free; you may want to use a fake e-mail address. Anyway, you can remove the \"Crazy Pacer\" story from the page for starters, but be careful not to take out TOO MUCH; they may undo your doing, so you may want to make multiple edits; remove the story on the first time, then add some random thing that comes to your mind onto the bottom of the page.\n</p><p>I can only do so much at one time, since after I make an edit (behind their backs), they \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ban\" title=\"Ban\">ban</a>\" my IP address from undoing their undoing, and I have to wait a few hours to a day or two before I can anything more against them.\n</p><p>That's the story there.\n</p><p>On another topic, please let me know when you plan to access your Skype account; I'll try to call you from my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PSP\" title=\"PSP\">PSP</a> to properly test my headset... \"Can you hear me now?\"\n</p><p>Thank you for your help, and for caring about me. :)\n</p><p>Love,<br/>\nChris Chan.\n</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4;padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<p>−−−−−Original Message−−−−−\n<br/>From: CWCSonichu@aol.com\n<br/>To: info-en-q@wikimedia.org\n<br/>Sent: Wed, 19 Mar 2008  5:13:38 PM Eastern Daylight Time\n<br/>Subject: Wiki Edit Lock Help\n</p><p>Sir, or madam, my name is <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler\">Christian Weston Chandler</a> (aka Chris Chan).

However, I will say that I am going to be blunt and tell you straightfoward what I want to say, which may in turn hurt you. It is up to you whether or not you would want to read this.\n</p><p>With that said, I want this e-mail to help you with some advice on your current \"quest\", as you put it, for love.\n</p><p>First off, it is not your fault you were born with <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">Autism</a>. I feel sympathy because it makes it all that more difficult to land you a girl. However, you must realize that not everyone will feel oh-so sympathetic or understand your troubles. The most saddening part of life is that not everyone will like you or the things you do, but you must move away from them and realize there are plenty of like-minded people like you.\n</p><p>Now, even though you have Autism, this doesn't mean that you are destined to live a horrible lonely life, but you should know that you can't use \"autism\" as an excuse for everything. Blaming a disorder for all the troubles in you life will not get you far. If you want others to look past your autism, you must do so as well. You must see yourself as you, regardless of what disorder you have.\n</p><p>I have plenty of friends with <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Asperger%27s\" title=\"Asperger's\">Asperger's</a> and high-functioning autism. One of my close friends Alex has to deal with autism standing in his way of fitting in at school, yet he has a great talent of singing. He took that good thing about him and won the talent show, and gained friends. You should take the very best talent you have and expand it to the best of your ability.\n</p><p>Now on to your <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Girlfriend\" title=\"Girlfriend\">girlfriend</a> troubles..\n</p><p>I think at this moment in your life, you goal shouldn't be just scoring with a chick, but making friends. If I'm correct, you have a <a href=\"/cwcki/MySpace\" title=\"MySpace\">MySpace</a>. Try finding people in your area that share you like for video games. Be it a guy, don't ignore him. After all, he does have his friends, some of who may be single girls.\n</p><p>You also need to not set your expectations so high. I'm not saying you should go off and date the nearest obese <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Black\" title=\"Black\">black</a> lady. However, what you need most is dating experience. After having been through various relationships, you can get past that akward \"approaching\" phase with confidence. Think of meeting a girl as a friend, not as a future life partner.\n</p><p>Also, I do not mean to offend, but the whole sign thing has to go. If it hasn't worked for the past 8 or so years, it probably won't work now. To us females, it shows you as someone who lacks the confidence to go up to someone. Women want someone who can have the courage to break the ice and start a conversation. Maybe if you see a nice girl with a dog in the park, start with something simple like complimenting how cute/burly/adorable her dog is. Then you can go on and start a conversation about your dog and what it looked like, etc... \nAny compliment about her can most likely be used as a convo starter, aside from pick-up lines and the plain creepy.\n</p><p>Another thing you may want to work on is...your wardrobe. I have to say that you I feel as if it's trapped in the 80's. Also, your <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_medallion\" title=\"Sonichu medallion\">Sonichu medallion</a>..oh man, this really hurts to break it to you, but...it'd be best left at home. Sorry man, but it's like one giant pussy deflector. That's all I can say about it, and I'm trying my best not to be harsh about it here.\n</p><p>You may want to revise your MySpace profiles and such a bit. When you talk about marrige and the like in your profile, it'd tend to ward off women, for they'll feel that if they even talk to you that they'd be all of a sudden committed. Talking about marrige should wait when you and her feel it's right.\n</p><p>I hope this will help you in your \"girlfriend\" <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Love_quest\" title=\"Love quest\">quest</a>. I know that Encyclopedia Dramatica will keep their article up about you, but if you move on and not bother talking about it or vandilize it, it'll soon be forgotten. Anonymous feeds off of you being upset over the article. Once you move on and forget about it, the sooner you can live a better life.\n</p><p>Please Reply Soon,<br/>\nSome Random Gaiafag\n</p>\n</div>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"July\">July</span></h3>\n<div style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4;padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<p>−−−−−Original Message−−−−−<br/>\nFrom: cwcsonichu@aol.com<br/>\nTo: theprimegamer@comcast.net<br/>\nSent: Sat, 12 Jul 2008 3:16 am<br/>\nSubject: More words to add, since I was typing the earlier message on my PSP...\n</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I've only had a few things to keep me sane, my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Video_games\" title=\"Video games\">video games</a> (mostly <a href=\"/cwcki/Guitar_Hero\" title=\"Guitar Hero\">Guitar Hero</a>), my family, going to church, and the ocassional outtings with my family.

Also taking note of possible liars and trojan horses from those who mock me in such slanderous ways. (http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Chris-chan has been pestering me for almost a year, but thank our Lord and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/God\" title=\"God\">God</a> that \nthat website is finally on the verge of being removed for good). \n</p><p>Anyway, to confirm the identity of \"women\" who have contacted me in e-mails, I've been pondering what would be the most comfortable way for me to confirm the identity and intentions for myself.

If I may quote my new blog on my MySpace page, which was also a reply to a black male who e-mailed me inquiring if I was prejudiced.\n</p><p>\"It is also proven that Majority of the Male Population are arrogant,\nignorant of others' feelings and emotions, rarely give full thought to\ntheir actions before executing them, testosterone driven, more for\ndanger than Peace. A lot of women will likely have the same feelings\nagainst the Males they encounter. Yet among all the women, they find\nthe FEW among the males who are the opposite of the traits I have just\nlisted, and they accept them for not only their potential husbands, but\ntheir True Emotional supporters and providers.\"\n</p><p>So, from the considerably sterotypical qualities of majority of the male population, yet well-proven facts, they ARE just jerks, looking for cheap laughs at others' expense. ED is losing their power, and so is a great chunk of cheap laughs at peoples' expenses. I feel that if someone wants a cheap laugh at others expenses, just turn on the TV, and leave those laughs there; don't take them with you in public.\n</p><p>Also, let20me ask you, considering the 50/50 chance of you having watched \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Family_Guy\" title=\"Family Guy\">Family Guy</a>\" or not. How do you feel about<a href=\"/cwcki/Meg_Griffin\" title=\"Meg Griffin\">Megan Marie Griffin</a>? Honestly, in my humble opinion, I meant what I said about Megan Marie Griffin. She is NOT ugly; she has always been a beautiful catch in my eyes. I just do not understand how anyone would see Megan as ugly, and I feel it is very pitiful that Seth McFarline would make her the \"punching bag\" of most everyone else on the show, when clearly she does not deserve such torturous punishment. I am in the same boat as she is, if you think about it; I'm the punching bag of the jerks on ED who are getting their heinous \"LULZ\" (a rehash of LOL, meaning \"Laugh Out Loud\"), but in my opinion, LULZ means \"Laughs Under Lucricities,\" which is obviously not good.\n</p><p>Two more things I will let you know about, in the comment I left in your video with the song, when I thanked you, I honestly meant that in a good way. I hoped after reading that comment, it made your day. And after watching that video, I am considering dedicating two or three pages in the comic I've resumed work on to me interviewing you, based on your video(s). Keep that under your hat; the <a href=\"/cwcki/Ghostbusters\" title=\"Ghostbusters\">Ghostbuster</a>/Family Guy <a href=\"/cwcki/Parody\" title=\"Parody\">parody</a> I've provided was enough of a foretaste.\n</p><p>Also, I don't know where Christiansburg is, but it sounds like it's way more than 25 miles from Rucker\nsville and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Charlottesville\" title=\"Charlottesville\">Charlottesville</a>, so thank you for your offer there. And while I would have nothing to do beyond having to tolerate most of the male population, you have earned yourself a respectable spot in my margin-of-error for acquaintances, the President, celebrities and my father and other relatives.

Repentence means \"turning away,\" which means that it is important not only to feel badly about what one has done, but also to take steps to turn away from the behavior--remember what Marty Peterman said about not sending anything over the internet you wouldn't want your grandmother to see. The internet offers anyone the opportunity to create any identity they wish; it's easy to deceive people if that's what they want to do. This means you have to be smarter than they are and not play their games.\n</p><p>I was hoping that meeting with Marty would help you to do that, so I've been surprised by this recent turn of events. Did you know that we have a new staff member at church? I am wondering if you might find talking with her to be helpful; I know talking with <a href=\"/cwcki/JERKS\" title=\"JERKS\">men</a> is difficult for you, and she is a woman. Her name is <a href=\"/cwcki/Rocky_Shoemaker\" title=\"Rocky Shoemaker\">Rocky Shoemaker</a> and she is a pastoral counselor, which means that she is a pastor but also someone trained to listen and help people with personal struggles and difficulties.\n</p><p>I would be glad to meet with you and with Rocky together, to see if talking with her would be a good place to talk about your feelings related to what has happened with Kawaii Kitsune and your quest for a sweetheart. I trust Rocky and think she is very good at what she does. We are both available on Thursday afternoon--please give me a time that would be convenient for you.\n</p><p>I know God has heard your pain, and the church wants to be helpful to you. I hope you will be in touch.\n</p><p>Blessings,<br/>\nElizabeth\n</p><p>−−−−−Original Message−−−−−\n<br/>&gt;From: cwcsonichu@aol.com\n<br/>&gt;Sent: Sep 11, 2008 11:20 PM\n<br/>&gt;<br/>To: elizabethfoss22@earthlink.net\n<br/>&gt;Subject: I'm warning you about a mistake I made from being deceived\n<br/>&gt;\n<br/>&gt;My ex-friend, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Blanca\" title=\"Blanca\">Blanca</a> W, AKA Kawaii Kitsune, and I recently had an \n<br/>&gt;exchange of e-mails; she was ready to open up to me more, in an \n<br/>&gt;exchange of digital photos.
