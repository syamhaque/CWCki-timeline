In this chat, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris\" title=\"Chris\">Chris</a> is basically locked up in an hour-long torture session with <a href=\"/cwcki/BlueSpike\" title=\"BlueSpike\">BlueSpike</a>, who poses as <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Julie\" title=\"Julie\">Julie</a>'s fake brother, Max. After being deceived by him <a href=\"/cwcki/Julie_Reveals_Herself:_The_Prequel\" title=\"Julie Reveals Herself: The Prequel\">earlier in the day</a>, Chris crosses paths with him one last time later that night. Max continued his onslaught on the manchild; he threatened to sell Chris's <a href=\"/cwcki/PlayStation_Network\" title=\"PlayStation Network\">PlayStation Network</a> account on <a href=\"/cwcki/EBay\" title=\"EBay\">eBay</a> several times, going so far to even allow all the proceeds to go directly to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/4chan\" title=\"4chan\">4chan</a> as well as <a href=\"/cwcki/Encyclopedia_Dramatica\" title=\"Encyclopedia Dramatica\">Encyclopedia Dramatica</a>. He also threatened to send <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Julie\" title=\"Julie\">Julie</a> back to Europe, forced Chris to declare <a href=\"/cwcki/BILLY_MAYS\" title=\"BILLY MAYS\">BILLY MAYS</a> as the new Mayor of <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a>, and have Chris imprisoned. But the icing on the <a href=\"/cwcki/Cakefarts\" title=\"Cakefarts\">cake</a> was when Max made Chris cut up his precious <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Medallion\" title=\"Medallion\">medallion</a> and shove it up his ass. After all was said and done, Max kept true to his promise and let Julie talk to Chris. Little did Chris know that Julie had a <a href=\"/cwcki/Pickle\" title=\"Pickle\">little surprise</a> for him...\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Summary\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Summary</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Audio\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Audio</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Transcript\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Transcript</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#eBay._No._eBay._No._(0:00-11:16)\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">eBay.

Needless to say, even they were disgusted and horrified at how far BlueSpike took it. Because of this, the following day, <a href=\"/cwcki/BlueSpike#Reaction\" title=\"BlueSpike\">an explosive troll war took place on ED due to controversy over BlueSpike's actions</a>.</li>\n<li>BlueSpike, posing as Max, tauntingly greets a grumpy Chris. He asks Chris why he's \"down in the dumps\", which he explains it's because \"Max\" is holding his hacked PSN and Yahoo! accounts ransom. Max says Chris can either choose between having his account back or being with Julie.</li>\n<li>Blue repeatedly riles Chris up by insulting and taunting him, and threatening to sell his PSN on eBay and give all the proceeds to 4chan and ED.</li>\n<li>After making him dance for his personal lulz, Blue tells Chris to put on his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Medallion\" title=\"Medallion\">medallion</a>. He says he will give him his PSN account if he burns the medallion while holding it and then <a href=\"/cwcki/Mass_debating\" title=\"Mass debating\">jizzes</a> on it, but at the same time he can't have Julie. If Chris doesn't comply, then Max will send Julie back to Europe. Chris hesitates, not only because he doesn't have anything to light up the medallion, but because he (of all people) doesn't know what \"jizz\" means.</li>\n<li>Blue goads Chris into declaring <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Billy_Mays\" title=\"Billy Mays\">Billy Mays</a> as the new mayor of CWCville, and that Chris will be thrown in jail, \"where he will be raped by a bunch of niggers.\" Chris infamously says \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Niggos\" title=\"Niggos\">niggos</a>\" instead of the N word. Blue has him say the word anyway, and he gets the \"hang\" of it before Blue makes him stop.</li>\n<li>Blue orders him again to jizz on the medallion, explaining to him it requires <a href=\"/cwcki/Mass_debating\" title=\"Mass debating\">mass debating</a>. Chris says he can't get a hard-on while under <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress\" title=\"Stress\">stress</a>, so Blue orders him to burn the medallion while holding it, and in a psychopathic way <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/A-Logging\" title=\"A-Logging\">screams he wants to see Chris lose a finger from the burn</a>. Chris goes quiet for a good while. Blue then says he can either choose to burn the medallion, or cut it up into pieces and shove it up his ass. Chris takes the latter choice.</li>\n<li>While Chris prepares to cut his medallion, Blue taunts him by saying he's bringing over a black friend of his to come watch Chris, requesting him to record and take pictures of himself. Chris <i>actually goes through with his demands</i>, much to the delight of Blue, and the audible disgust of the other trolls; he gets so stressed that his <a href=\"/cwcki/DIRTY,_CRAPPED_BRIEFS\" title=\"DIRTY, CRAPPED BRIEFS\">fecal leakage</a> kicks in. The trolls repeatedly tell Blue to stop. Ignoring them at first while continuing to mock Chris, Blue eventually tells Chris he can stop trying to put the pieces in his ass. He attempts to leave to wash his shit-covered hands, but Blue tells him to stay put.</li>\n<li>Blue wonders what else he can make Chris do, much to the other trolls' annoyance. This culminates in him repeatedly demanding that Chris burn down <a href=\"/cwcki/14_Branchland_Court\" title=\"14 Branchland Court\">his house</a>, seriously alarming the other trolls, but fortunately Chris refuses point-blank to do this. Blue decides to have Chris get on Mumble to let him talk to \"Julie\". Chris spends over ten literal minutes trying to get a microphone working and logging onto Mumble, but eventually succeeds.</li>\n<li>Chris finally gets to talk to Julie. She reveals to him she is nothing more than Max/BlueSpike in disguise, telling him that all this time, Chris had been engaging in cybersex with a 13-year-old boy, who had been talking in pretty much his normal voice while pretending to be a girl. This doesn't quite get the reaction Blue expected from Chris; while Chris was certainly disappointed and tried to say he wasn't aware of Max's age, he seems to be apathetic towards what happened, seeing as this wasn't the first (and definitely <i>not</i> the last) time Chris was tricked into being in a relationship with a fake woman.</li>\n<li>Blue tells Chris to send him the video footage of him shoving the medallion up his ass. Chris reveals he lied and didn't videotape anything when that happened, refusing to do it all over again. In response, Blue gets Clyde to come out and talk to Chris. Clyde, already quite disgusted with the whole ordeal, simply decides to tell Chris in a straightforward manner that there are no actual fans of <i>Sonichu</i>, that there is far more to life than his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PS3\" title=\"PS3\">PS3</a>, and that he needs to spend more time going out socializing instead of sitting on his ass all day indoors playing <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Vidya\" title=\"Vidya\">vidya</a>. A nonplussed Chris pretty much ignores this, and leaves the call.</li>\n<li>Blue and the others reflect on what they did to Chris. After a while of them chattering over each other, a female troll asks if she can stop recording the Mumble, and after they give her the green light, does so.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Audio\">Audio</span></h2>\n<center>\n<table style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa; background-color: #f9f9f9; color: black; margin: .5em auto .5em auto; padding: 0.2em; font-size:89%; width:260px;-moz-border-radius:10px\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFFF00\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size:110%; color:#008080;-moz-border-radius:10px\"><b>Julie Reveals Herself</b><br/>\n</td></tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<td colspan=\"2\"><div class=\"thumb embedvideo autoResize\" style=\"width: 328px;\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo autoResize\" style=\"\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideowrap archiveorg\" style=\"width: 320px\"><div class=\"embedvideo-consent\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo-consent__overlay\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo-consent__message\">Click to load content</div><!--\n--></div><!--\n--></div><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" data-src=\"//archive.org/embed/JulieRevealsHerself\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"247\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"320\"></iframe></div><!--\n--></div><!--\n--></div>\n</td></tr>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#696969\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;-moz-border-radius:5px;color:#ffffff;\"><b>Stardate</b>\n</td>\n<td>3 <a href=\"/cwcki/March_2009\" title=\"March 2009\">March 2009</a>\n</td></tr>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#696969\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;-moz-border-radius:5px;color:#ffffff;\"><b>Featuring</b>\n</td>\n<td><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris\" title=\"Chris\">Chris</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/BlueSpike\" title=\"BlueSpike\">BlueSpike</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Clyde\" title=\"Clyde\">Clyde</a>\n</td></tr>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#696969\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;-moz-border-radius:5px;color:#ffffff;\"><b>Saga</b>\n</td>\n<td><span style=\"display:none\">Julie</span><a href=\"/cwcki/Julie\" title=\"Julie\"><img alt=\"Julie\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"32\" src=\"/w/images/c/ca/Julie_saga.png\" width=\"32\"/></a> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Julie\" title=\"Julie\">Julie</a>\n</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n</center>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Transcript\">Transcript</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"eBay._No._eBay._No._.280:00-11:16.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"eBay._No._eBay._No._(0:00-11:16)\">eBay.
