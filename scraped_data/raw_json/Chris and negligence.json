The effects of his negligence have ranged from <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris%27s_room\" title=\"Chris's room\">letting his room go</a>, to <a href=\"/cwcki/EBay#Suspension_of_Chris's_eBay\" title=\"EBay\">getting his eBay banned</a>, to even possibly <a href=\"/cwcki/2014_house_fire#Actual_Timeline_of_Events\" title=\"2014 house fire\">burning down his own house</a>. Chris's failure to properly deal with problems often leads him into tricky situations that bring humorous responses. A significant portion of Chris's content can be attributed either directly or indirectly to his negligence. \n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Vehicles\">Vehicles</span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Chris_car_April_2021-3.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"532\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/0/08/Chris_car_April_2021-3.jpg/300px-Chris_car_April_2021-3.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/0/08/Chris_car_April_2021-3.jpg/450px-Chris_car_April_2021-3.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/0/08/Chris_car_April_2021-3.jpg/600px-Chris_car_April_2021-3.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Chris_car_April_2021-3.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Chris's Car after backing into a big rig in April, 2021.</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Totem_after_CWC_1.jpeg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"400\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/5/5c/Totem_after_CWC_1.jpeg/300px-Totem_after_CWC_1.jpeg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/5/5c/Totem_after_CWC_1.jpeg/450px-Totem_after_CWC_1.jpeg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/5/5c/Totem_after_CWC_1.jpeg/600px-Totem_after_CWC_1.jpeg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Totem_after_CWC_1.jpeg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>The box Chris shipped the <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_Totem\" title=\"Sonic Totem\">Sonic Totem</a> in, in all its scotch-taped glory.</div></div></div>\n<p>Chris has a long history of vehicular struggles. His first car, the <a href=\"/cwcki/Son-Chu#Ford_Escort\" title=\"Son-Chu\">original Son-Chu</a>, went through horror as it was revealed in October 2010 that he went well over a year without changing the oil. Unsurprisingly, the car didn't last much longer. Fast-forwarding to July 2018, it became clear that Chris failed to learn his lesson; in <a href=\"/cwcki/My_Car_is_Heating_Up_Worse;_PLEASE_BUY_from_my_eBay_and_HELP\" title=\"My Car is Heating Up Worse; PLEASE BUY from my eBay and HELP\">a begging video</a>, Chris revealed that his 2010 Ford Focus was heating up and wouldn't start. Despite fans sending him money to get the car fixed, it died three months later. It was reported by <a href=\"/cwcki/The_Captain\" title=\"The Captain\">The Captain</a> that the car's engine was permanently broken. Being that the car had only clocked up 110,000 miles, it's likely that Chris's neglect was the cause of its untimely demise.\n</p><p>In 2021 a fan snapped a picture of the fourth iteration of <a href=\"/cwcki/Son-Chu\" title=\"Son-Chu\">Son-Chu</a> in the wild, featuring a dented rear door and smashed rear windshield with a plastic covering. Another fan texted Chris, asking about the damage done to the van. Chris responded, revealing that he had backed into the trailer of a big rig. \n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Finances\">Finances</span></h3>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_money\" title=\"Chris and money\">Chris and money</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>Beginning in 2014, Chris took to eBay as a means to supplement his <a href=\"/cwcki/Monthly_tugboat\" title=\"Monthly tugboat\">tugboat</a>. Capitalizing on his internet legacy, Chris began producing Sonichu <a href=\"/cwcki/Medallions\" title=\"Medallions\">medallions</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_Amiibo\" title=\"Sonichu Amiibo\">custom Amiibo</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Commissions\" title=\"Commissions\">commissions</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Autographed_photos\" title=\"Autographed photos\">autographed photos</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/2014-2015_Sales_Listings#Bob.27s_Straduarius_Violin\" title=\"2014-2015 Sales Listings\">family heirlooms</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_Totem\" title=\"Sonic Totem\">Relics of Fail</a>, and several other items. Almost as soon as Chris started ramping up his eBay presence, buyers began complaining. On eBay, feedback is incredibly important. Anything short of 90% positive feedback is considered very poor, and if enough complaints are levied against a seller, eBay will take action. Chris struggled to maintain an 85% positive feedback percentage. Many buyers complained that Chris was taking too long to ship items, of items coming in broken due to faulty packaging, or of outright not receiving purchased items altogether. One buyer even reported being sent \"an empty envelope\" after purchasing a bootleg Pokemon game from Chris in <a href=\"/cwcki/March_2018\" title=\"March 2018\">March 2018</a>.\n</p><p>These complaints levied against Chris frequently caused his PayPal to become frozen, preventing him from pulling funds out. This enraged Chris, and resulted in him getting into scuffles with various buyers. One notorious example was when a buyer, referred to as <a href=\"/cwcki/Medallions#The_Mr._Smith_Situation\" title=\"Medallions\">Mr. Smith</a>, opened up a dispute after Chris failed to make and ship a Sonichu medallion and commission within the specified two-week period, resulting in Chris's PayPal getting frozen. In response, Chris <a href=\"/cwcki/Dox\" title=\"Dox\">doxed</a> the buyer on Facebook. Chris then proceeded to send an <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://sonichu.com/cwcki/File:Chris%27s_Commission_to_Mr._Smith_(compressed).jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">art of an exasperated Sonichu</a> along with an <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://sonichu.com/cwcki/File:Mrsmithangryeyessonichu.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">angry-eyed Sonichu medallion</a>. The buyer, refusing to lift the dispute until Chris sent the item described in the listing, eventually received a proper Sonichu medallion along with a full refund from eBay. Chris's eBay exploits eventually came to an end in <a href=\"/cwcki/June_2019\" title=\"June 2019\">June 2019</a>, as <a href=\"/cwcki/EBay#Suspension_of_Chris's_eBay\" title=\"EBay\">eBay finally restricted his account</a> after years of complaints.\n</p><p>In <a href=\"/cwcki/2015\" title=\"2015\">2015</a>, Chris began using <a href=\"/cwcki/Etsy\" title=\"Etsy\">Etsy</a> as an alternative to eBay, after breaking the site's rules too many times. Things went as per usual, until Chris purchased a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PS4\" title=\"PS4\">PS4</a> in <a href=\"/cwcki/March_2016\" title=\"March 2016\">March 2016</a>, which sucked his attention away from his Etsy orders, and led to him ignoring several of them, often for months. This caused his Etsy shop to be eventually shut down in <a href=\"/cwcki/June_2016\" title=\"June 2016\">June</a>. Chris would return to Etsy in <a href=\"/cwcki/2020\" title=\"2020\">2020</a> with the help of <a href=\"/cwcki/Praetor\" title=\"Praetor\">Praetor</a>, but the quality of his shipments and items haven't improved much.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Art\">Art</span></h3>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_art\" title=\"Chris and art\">Chris and art</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>Chris has always viewed <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(character)\" title=\"Sonichu (character)\">Sonichu</a> and the <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\">series he headlines</a> as his pride and joy, but to call his updates infrequent or inconsistent is an understatement. While personally attributing his slipshod schedule to the idea that his inspiration 'comes in and out' - which, on the surface, is something that does affect those with creative persuasions - Chris has been known to go vast lengths of time without any news on the progress of his work. The most glaring example of this was <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_11\" title=\"Sonichu 11\">Sonichu 11</a></i>, a book first mentioned and conceived in 2009, that was effectively abandoned twice over the staggeringly long course of its production: once in 2010 the wake of the infamously divisive <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_10\" title=\"Sonichu 10\">Sonichu 10</a></i>, and again five years later, shortly after Chris summoned up the willpower to dust off his work and after he was paid to produce more pages by two separate parties, a delay that lasted two more years with little in the way of clear explanation.\n</p><p>In the <a href=\"/cwcki/Alec_Benson_Leary\" title=\"Alec Benson Leary\">Alec Benson Leary</a> saga, over the course of numerous <a href=\"/cwcki/Alec_Benson_Leary_calls\" title=\"Alec Benson Leary calls\">phone calls</a>, Alec frequently took Chris to task for his lack of consistent work ethic - in particular, he emphasized the importance of keeping to a schedule to maintain a constant level of external interest in his output. There, he attributed his diminished productivity to the existence and pressure of outside stressors. More specifically, he pinned the blame for his creative drought on the existence of ads on the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia\" title=\"CWCipedia\">CWCipedia</a>, the presence of which proved so troublesome that he couldn't stand to look at them, and hence couldn't use the site to upload his work. This simply proves how easy it is for Chris to be sidelined, or to put off work simply because other factors make him feel vaguely uncomfortable - in the years since, he has often said that he hasn't taken up producing his comic due to the lingering presence of various external factors, all of which can be boiled down to \"stress\". Another likely reason for this crushing negligence despite Chris's myriad explanations in his lack of timeliness is that <i>Sonichu</i> isn't a work that's held aloft by any real creative inspiration on his part. Rather, most of the time, it's a semi-autobiographical account of Chris's own life wearing the garb of a nonsensical fantasy realm. While the passing of his father in late 2011 doubtlessly impacted his drive, a combination of factors such as a lack of anything going on in his life, lingering discomfort regarding the events of <i>Sonichu 10</i> and its perceived violation of his personal imaginary world, and Chris's own enduring laziness - even when paid $1000 with the express purpose of making 100 new pages in mind - have ultimately led to his negligence smothering his creativity.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"House_fire\">House fire</span></h3>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/2014_house_fire\" title=\"2014 house fire\">2014 house fire</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>Perhaps among the most consequential events in Christory, many have speculated that the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Destruction_Of_Chris%27s_House\" title=\"Destruction Of Chris's House\">fire at the Chandler residence</a> may have been caused indirectly by Chris. According to the person who leaked the fire report, the fire appears to have been caused by a spark from an extension cord running through the bathroom door, of which the plastic coating had been rubbed away. The report seems to corroborate this claim, indicating that the fire started from the downstairs bathroom. Chris had run an extension cord from the bathroom to power a Keurig machine in the hallway, which was plugged in at the time of the fire.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup> How much of the blame that <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Barb\" title=\"Barb\">Barb</a> shares for allowing the brazen fire hazard to exist, along with the hoard's role in the fire, however, is up for debate.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Body\">Body</span></h3>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_health\" title=\"Chris and health\">Chris and health</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>Surprising absolutely nobody, one of the biggest things Chris's negligence has affected is <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_health\" title=\"Chris and health\">himself</a>. As mentioned plenty of times on this site, he has shown to not take anything close to good care of his hygiene or diet, no doubt causing various health problems that could potentially endanger his very life. One noticeable example is <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_nutrition\" title=\"Chris and nutrition\">Chris's eating habits</a>, where he rarely eats vegetables or fruit, and when he does, he usually adds something unhealthy. Also worth noting is his well known lack of showering which, combined with <a href=\"/cwcki/DIRTY,_CRAPPED_BRIEFS\" title=\"DIRTY, CRAPPED BRIEFS\">other factors</a>, makes him smell horrid.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Causes_of_Chris.27s_negligence\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Causes_of_Chris's_negligence\">Causes of Chris's negligence</span></h2>\n<p>There are several potential causes of Chris's negligence. Perhaps the most apparent cause is Barb's own negligence. <a href=\"/cwcki/Tour_of_Chris%27s_House\" title=\"Tour of Chris's House\">Several</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Tour_of_Chris%27s_House_II\" title=\"Tour of Chris's House II\">house</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Tour_of_Chris%27s_House_III\" title=\"Tour of Chris's House III\">tours</a> of <a href=\"/cwcki/14_Branchland_Court\" title=\"14 Branchland Court\">the Chandler residence</a> shined a light on just how serious her hoarding problem had become. Barb seemed to have little regard for the squalor that she and Chris lived in. The hoard seemed to have started many years ago, but absolutely exploded after the death of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bob\" title=\"Bob\">Bob</a>, who had at least some awareness of just how much of a dump the Chandler residence was; he even commented on this during the infamous <a href=\"/cwcki/THAT_IS_MY_HOUSE\" title=\"THAT IS MY HOUSE\">THAT IS MY HOUSE</a> video from August 2009.\n</p><p>Another contributing factor could possibly be Chris's <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ego\" title=\"Ego\">ego</a>. Chris tends to see himself, and everything he creates, as flawless. In recent years, he has begun developing an outright <a href=\"/cwcki/Messiah_complex\" title=\"Messiah complex\">god complex</a>. It is entirely possible that this perceived flawlessness prevents Chris from being able to acknowledge any mistake he may make, causing problems for him down the road. These problems he encounters only further fuel his victim complex.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_health\"
