Rosey, our Prime <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu\" title=\"Rosechu\">Rosechu</a>, Sweetheart of Sonichu...\n</p><p>Was born, as a Pichu, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/MALE\" title=\"MALE\">MALE</a>. The D***ed Trolls were correct. Up until around the 4Cent Garbage Adventure, Rosey did have, not a vagina, but a penis. She had the Operation to become Fully Woman, and give birth to Christine, Roberta and Cera. I felt Super Mortified and Beyond Shocked when she came out to me as a Transwoman, herself. Since when I created her after Sonichu, around 2000, I had created her to be a Female-Only Pokemon, like a Kangaskhan. But, apparently, even though I am Creator, apparently, I am not a total Goddess over my own city and creations.\n</p><p>So, I will now put this to Everyone Online, for their responses: Do You Like It That For Once, The Trolls WERE Right, or would you rather I revert back to telling everyone, in book 15, that our Miss Rosey Rosechu was always Female?\n</p><p>SHE wanted me to come forward with her Truth on her behalf. As much as it really hurts me deep. I Really feel like I should be reeled into my Poke Ball and stored in the PC a while.

I have a Major Announcement if Great Importance! Silvana Rosechu is Lost at this time, Destroyed in the Past. BUT, there is a way to Bring her back into existence! Everyone, I will tell all of you the tale of Silvana Rosechu, and then ALL Of You Here, and Everywhere Else, BELIEVE IN SILVANA. OPEN YOUR HEARTS AND MINDS; Remember Silvana Rosechu! We Must Bring Her Back!\n<p>I quote from My Own \"Sonichu\" #8:\n</p>\n<ul><li><ul><li>To best introduce this new Rosechu, we have to go back to the Fateful Chaotic Rainbow that spawned All Sixty-Nine Special Sonee and Rosey Eggs, and the Thousands of Regular Sonee and Rosey Eggs, and distributed them all throughout the reaches of Space, Time, AND Dimensions.</li></ul></li></ul>\n<p>Silvana Rosechu's Egg launched directly from the Chaotic Rainbow, Widely Protected and Safeguarded from Any And ALL Manipulations from Any And ALL Outside Forces, Along with EVERY SINGLE EGG birthing from that One Rainbow, Including the Pikachu and Raichu that would transform into Sonichu and Rosechu on either End of the Rainbow.\n</p><p>Silvana's Egg was projected into Space and landed on the Earth's Moon. She hatched out of egg safely, complete and in tact. Able to breath in space as well, despite the lack of oxygen.\n\\\nSeconds Later, the soul of Count Graduon, from within his sphere prison, telepathically and magically linked with Silvana, \"AH, NEW LIFE... FOR ME TO CORRUPT!\", Graduon thought to himself. Then he spoke to Silvana Rosey, \"LITTLE ONE AMONG MANY, I AM COUNT GRADUON, ILLUSTRIOUS WIZARD, REVERED BY ALL, MORE POWERFUL THAN MOST. I HAVE TAKEN HEART OF YOU BEING BORN ALL ALONE ON THE EARTH'S MOON. I AM HERE TO TAKE YOU IN MY WING AND REAR YOU PROPERY UNDER MY CAREFUL AND WISE JUDGMENT. I AM A WELL-PRACTICED OF A YOUNG LADY, MUCH LIKE YOURSELF; NOW SHE IS A WARRIOR PRINCESS, MY BEAUTIFUL SYLVIA. I MISS HER EVERY DAY SINCE BEING ENSPHERED IN MY WAND OF A PRISON CELL. I ONLY WANTED TO BRING PEACE AND ORDER, BUT A CHEROKIAN CHIEF SEALED ME IN.\"\n</p><p>From his mentioning of the name, Sylvia, Silvana spoke what would become her name. \"SIL...VA...NA.\" Count Graduon replied, \"AND WITH THAT, WHICH WAS YOUR FIRST WORD, I DUB THEE, SILVANA ROSECHU. BUT MY CARE FOR YOU, AND YOUR TRAINING HAS A SMALL PRICE. TO BETTER YOU, I AM GOING TO GRANT YOU ITH THE POWER TO TRANSFORM, LIKE A DITTO. MY PRICE IS THAT YOU WILL HAVE TO RELINQUISH YOUR ABILITY TO GIVE BIRTH, AND YOU WILL BE UPGRADED TO HAVE BOTH PARTS.\" Then Count Graduon enchanted the young Rosey. Then he said, \"SO WITH THE BIOLOGICAL UPGRADE COMPLETE, YOUR YEARS OF TRAINING CAN BEGIN.\"\n</p><p>Silvana Rosechu, Born on May Tenth, 1989, on Earth's Calendar; Silvana is a Psychic Type, with no Electric Typing, her Ability is Oblivious. And so, after birth, Silvana Mentally and Physically became a Strong Warrior, under the wicked guidance from Count Graduon on the Earth's Moon. Without maternal guidance, and low social interactions, Silvana had never to truly love, and she/he learned to flirt without emotions.\n</p><p>During her life, when she served under Count Graduon, she would go on espionage spy missions, as well as full-on direct contact missions of manipulation and influence. Among her missions, as quoted from \"Sonichu\" #1, she had Transformed and Disguised herself as Sonic the Hedgehog, and intercepted Sonichu as Blake was kidnapping Rosechu for Gionvanni and Doctor Ren Skysoar. Her mission was Espionage and Set Up, to learn more of Sonichu, but she still helped him rescue Rosey. Later on, Silvana would disguise herself as Amy Rose, and have a lovely conversation with Rosey to learn more about her for the Count.\n</p><p>Silvana would eventually encounter and meet Magi-Chan Sonichu; he would become enchanted by her beauty, but also defensive against her mental manipulations, as he is a Psychic/Electric Type, himself. They shared a conversation, but then had a squabble. Then she left him that day, as her mission at the time was interrupted and aborted. Later on, in \"Sonichu\" #9, Silvana would meet up with Magi-Chan on the top of one of Graduon's jets. The two shared another short discussion, then the two fought. Ending up both being worn out after the fight, and the day of saving Cwcville was well and good, Silvana left Magi-Chan once again.\n</p><p>Back to \"Sonichu\", or special-made \"Rosechu\", #8, Silvana Rosechu was on mission to seduce and take out Blake Sonichu in order to attempt to steal the acquired Crystal S-Chu Ball Bubbles had retrieved from the ocean depths that day. But with Magi-Chan's guidance, Bubbles saw through Silvana's disguise as Blake Sonichu, and whirlpooled her with electricity in the waters. Silvana teleported out of there back to Graduon, the mission having been aborted then.\n</p><p>In \"Sonichu\" #10, After Count Graduon was released from his sphere prison, Silvana was freed from Graduon's influence, and she had regained her ability to give birth within a year or two since then. And she joined Magi-Chan Sonichu, and the other Sonichus and Rosechus of Cwcville, to defend the city and do good for everyone. Including, and especially for Magi-Chan Sonichu, and his mentor, Mewtwo.\n</p><p>\"Sonichu\" #11, Christmas of 2008, During the Holiday events, Silvana, dressed in a warm, red overcoat, met a warmly-dressed Magi-Chan Sonichu, for a lovely picnic date in the mountains east of Cwcville. They shared a Mental Telepathic bond, a delightful and romantic conversation, and the two of them kissed, made out, and the works. And on Christmas Morning of 2008, along with the other Sonichus and Rosechus, they celebrated the yearly get-together at the Cwcville Shopping Center, as they also talked about Christian having become the Lesbian Transwoman she is, Christine, very much like I, myself, Christine Weston Chandler, have and still am transitioning, but for the Christine of Cwcville, it was much more quick a process.\n</p><p>Later that same Christmas Day, Silvana and the other Sonichus and Rosechus, went to both the house of Christine Chandler's in Cwcville to visit and celebrate with her, and ALSO, to MY own house, Right Here, in Ruckersville, Virginia, in this Reality and World. We took a Family Photo together, along with my Autobot friend, Son-Chu.\n</p><p>Silvana also performed in a few roles of Espionage and Tactical Maneuvers, but also in portraying the roles of others on the stage for sharing entertainment, in her spare time.\n</p><p>And for \"Sonichu\" #12, Silvana attended the first annual SLGBTQ Pride Festival with Christine and the other Sonichus and Rosechus, where Reldnahc made his return, and signed up again with Graduon, as he was construction a new body for himself with the broken Metal Sonichu on the Moon. Silvana had made some insightful commentary. Silvana worked with Magi-Chan and the others to take out the Thousands of Jerkops and Janekops, led by Reldnahc, while he and Christine as Chris Chan Sonichu, battled it out in Reldnahc's private and personal dimension. Silvana had helped take out and collect the Sniper Jerkops and Janekops around the perimeter. After that battle was won, and Christine exited the different dimension, with the passed out Reldnahc in her arms, she was greeted by Slautes from Silvana Rosechu and Magi-Chan Sonichu, and received the reports of the events in Christine's absence.\n</p><p>I forgot to mention, Silvana Rosechu speaks with a Russian accent.\n</p><p><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Silvana_with_Chris_Chan_Sonichu_Amiibos.jpg\"><img alt=\"Silvana with Chris Chan Sonichu Amiibos.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"150\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/5/55/Silvana_with_Chris_Chan_Sonichu_Amiibos.jpg/200px-Silvana_with_Chris_Chan_Sonichu_Amiibos.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/5/55/Silvana_with_Chris_Chan_Sonichu_Amiibos.jpg/300px-Silvana_with_Chris_Chan_Sonichu_Amiibos.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/5/55/Silvana_with_Chris_Chan_Sonichu_Amiibos.jpg/400px-Silvana_with_Chris_Chan_Sonichu_Amiibos.jpg 2x\" width=\"200\"/></a>\n<a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Silvana_and_Magi-Chan.jpg\"><img alt=\"Silvana and Magi-Chan.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"150\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/d/dc/Silvana_and_Magi-Chan.jpg/200px-Silvana_and_Magi-Chan.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/d/dc/Silvana_and_Magi-Chan.jpg/300px-Silvana_and_Magi-Chan.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/d/dc/Silvana_and_Magi-Chan.jpg/400px-Silvana_and_Magi-Chan.jpg 2x\" width=\"200\"/></a>\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>He continued:\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>**Continuing the Story of Silvana Rosechu** See previous post, below.\n<p>In addition to all of that, she watches over the city and nation of Cwcville with Magi-Chan Sonichu and the Alakazams from the Psychic Tower above Cwcville. Silvana also tended to Magi-Chan when he was in need, like the time he came down sick. She also gave birth of a Sonee with Magi-Chan, in 2016; dubbing him Stubenchu. This was also during a time when Magi-Chan was possessed by Count Graduon, for his purposes of taking the city and nation down once again. And to con Silvana to joining him once again. She was pregnant with Stubenchu at the time. Silvana stood up to Count Graduon, and dispelled his mental influences over Magi-Chan, during his weakened-with-cold state. Magi-Chan was healed, and became more mentally resistant to Graduon after that.\n</p><p>Silvana Rosechu is also the reason why Count Graduon signed the Peace Treaty with Cwcville, as she was kidnapped by Mutual Enemy Forces shortly before then.\n</p><p>Miss Silvana Rosechu: Tactical Espionage Expert, Loyal Sweetheart Of Magi-Chan Sonichu, and more Loyal to the City and Nation of Cwcville, Virginia, her family Sonichus and Rosechus, and to Christine Weston Chandler, Myself, and herself in Cwcville.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p><i>And continued</i>:\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>❤️❤️❤️We ALL would be Lost without our Silvana Rosechu.
