Like all of his \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Attraction_Location\" title=\"Attraction Location\">Attraction Locations</a>\", it didn't do  much for him, as his behavior led to several run-ins with its management and security personnel, ultimately resulting in a <a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_places_that_have_banned_Chris\" title=\"List of places that have banned Chris\">ban</a> from the mall. Owing to the mall's popularity with Chris as a social and Attraction Location, it has since became a place of hallowed ground among <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">trolls</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Weens\" title=\"Weens\">weens</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCki\" title=\"CWCki\">Christorians</a> alike. It closed in <a href=\"/cwcki/2025\" title=\"2025\">2025</a>, exceeding <a href=\"/cwcki/The_GAMe_PLACe\" title=\"The GAMe PLACe\">The GAMe PLACe</a> in terms of Chris's longest ban-to-closure period (just less than thirteen years compared to six years from The GAMe PLACe). It is located about 9 miles away from <a href=\"/cwcki/14_Branchland_Court\" title=\"14 Branchland Court\">14 Branchland Court</a>.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Chris_and_the_Fashion_Square\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris and the Fashion Square</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Chris_vs._Fashion_Square\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris vs. Fashion Square</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Closure\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Closure</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Comic_references\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Comic references</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href='#Sub-Episode_#1:_\"Jerkop-tastropie\"'><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Sub-Episode #1: \"Jerkop-tastropie\"</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href='#Sub-Episode_#2:_\"The_Rise_&amp;_Fall_of_My_Heart\"'><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Sub-Episode #2: \"The Rise &amp; Fall of My Heart\"</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#External_links\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">External links</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris_and_the_Fashion_Square\">Chris and the Fashion Square</span></h2>\n<p>Chris was first introduced to <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog\" title=\"Sonic the Hedgehog\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> at the Fashion Square Sears in \"mid to late <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/1991\" title=\"1991\">1991</a>\", playing a demo version of the original <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i> Sega Genesis game there.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup>\n</p><p>It's safe to say that, at one point, a large portion of Chris's time spent outside the house was at this mall. It became one of his biggest stomping grounds by the early <a href=\"/cwcki/2000s\" title=\"2000s\">2000s</a>, especially following his <a href=\"/cwcki/Piedmont_Virginia_Community_College#Kicked_out_of_college\" title=\"Piedmont Virginia Community College\">college suspension</a>. When he wasn't shopping at its stores, Chris spent a lot of his time <a href=\"/cwcki/Attraction_Location#Attraction_time\" title=\"Attraction Location\">pacing around</a> in the hopes that he would eventually meet a <a href=\"/cwcki/Boyfriend-free_girl\" title=\"Boyfriend-free girl\">boyfriend-free girl</a>.\n</p><p>It was in this mall where Chris met <a href=\"/cwcki/Anna_McLerran\" title=\"Anna McLerran\">Anna</a> and \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/The_Tale_of_the_Crazy_Pacer\" title=\"The Tale of the Crazy Pacer\">The Tale of the Crazy Pacer</a>\" got its start.\n</p><p>It was also where he had his heart smashed down to 15% by <a href=\"/cwcki/Hanna\" title=\"Hanna\">Hanna</a>, and presumably where he (accompanied by <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler\" title=\"Bob Chandler\">his father</a>) went on his \"date\" with <a href=\"/cwcki/Emily\" title=\"Emily\">Emily</a>, who was later rescued by <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/The_Man_in_the_Pickle_Suit\" title=\"The Man in the Pickle Suit\">The Man in the Pickle Suit</a>.\n</p><p>Due to the numerous misadventures he has had there, this place held a significant role in Christory and became something of a pilgrimage location for the CWC community at large.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris_vs._Fashion_Square\">Chris vs. Fashion Square</span></h2>\n<p>Chris has gotten himself into trouble at Fashion Square on a number of occasions over the years, eventually leading to him getting banned from the mall in spring <a href=\"/cwcki/2012\" title=\"2012\">2012</a>.\n</p><p>On 5 August <a href=\"/cwcki/2004\" title=\"2004\">2004</a>, according to <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC%27s_Diary\" title=\"CWC's Diary\">CWC's Diary</a>, Chris's attempts to fish for a girlfriend with a <a href=\"/cwcki/Red_String_of_Fate\" title=\"Red String of Fate\">Red String of Fate</a> were cut short by a <a href=\"/cwcki/Jerkop\" title=\"Jerkop\">jerkop</a> who destroyed that particular Love Quest accessory. A month later, on 6 September, he had another run-in with a security guard who was apparently treated to a rendition of Chris's \"Lonesome Virgin story\".\n</p><p>11 September 2004 saw Chris's first partial ban from the mall, forbidding him from returning without a parent to accompany him. His diary doesn't explain exactly why he was banned, but <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sub-Episode_1\" title=\"Sub-Episode 1\">Sub-Episode #1</a> dramatizes the day's events. Reading between the lines of the comic book version, Chris was loitering and soliciting with his <a href=\"/cwcki/Attraction_Sign\" title=\"Attraction Sign\">Attraction Sign</a>, became belligerent with security, and was arrested and removed from the mall.\n</p><p>Chris was apparently able to return to the mall unaccompanied by the next spring. On 29 March 2005, the infamous date with Hanna took place, after which Chris emitted an anguished \"NOOOOOOOO\" that led him to being banned from the mall once again.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup> <a href=\"/cwcki/Vivitheg%27s_AIM_chat\" title=\"Vivitheg's AIM chat\">Vivitheg's AIM chat</a> indicates that the ban (which again prevented Chris from going to the mall without a parent) was still in effect towards the end of 2008.\n</p><p>According to the reports of a field agent, Chris was seen sperging at the mall accompanied by his parents in the summer of 2010. Subsequently, on 31 August 2010, he was spotted (and filmed) hanging out at the mall alone. This suggests that either the bans have expired, or Chris has managed to <a href=\"/cwcki/Flipnote_Hatena\" title=\"Flipnote Hatena\">evade yet another ban</a>.\n</p><p>In early 2012, Chris's leaked <a href=\"/cwcki/Facebook_statuses\" title=\"Facebook statuses\">Facebook statuses</a> revealed that he had returned to loitering at the mall on a regular basis. His \"normal plan\" at the mall, according to the leaks, is to \"sit, hang and wait for a Ms. Right\".\n</p><p>On 4 February, he managed to get himself in trouble again, by leaving flyers decrying <a href=\"/cwcki/Michael_Snyder\" title=\"Michael Snyder\">Michael Snyder</a> around the mall. A security guard found them and attempted to speak to Chris about them. Chris then fled the mall and drove away.\n</p><p>On 31 March, he managed to get himself in trouble for a second time this year, this time by yelling on his phone towards his trolls. Security guards came to confront Chris, but he ended up fleeing the mall once more. This was evidently the final straw for the mall's staff, as after this incident, Chris was permanently banned from the mall on 25 <a href=\"/cwcki/April_2012\" title=\"April 2012\">April 2012</a>. Chris wouldn't confirm this until 28 April, when he released a Facebook message confirming he had received the ban-hammer.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup>\n</p><p>On 15 <a href=\"/cwcki/August_2014\" title=\"August 2014\">August 2014</a>, Chris wrote an <a href=\"/cwcki/Apology_Letters\" title=\"Apology Letters\">apology letter</a> in an attempt to get his ban lifted. The letter has Chris blaming <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Troll\" title=\"Troll\">trolls</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress\" title=\"Stress\">stress</a> for his misdeeds, and asking the manager to allow him and <a href=\"/cwcki/Catherine\" title=\"Catherine\">Catherine</a> to shop there.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Chris_chan_dec_2014.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"240\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/9/9b/Chris_chan_dec_2014.png/300px-Chris_chan_dec_2014.png\" srcset=\"/w/images/9/9b/Chris_chan_dec_2014.png 1.5x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Chris_chan_dec_2014.png\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Chris, shortly before pepper-spraying a GameStop employee.</div></div></div>\n<p>On <a href=\"/cwcki/26_December_2014\" title=\"26 December 2014\">26 December 2014</a>, Chris attempted to evade his ban from the <a href=\"/cwcki/GameStop\" title=\"GameStop\">GameStop</a> there and (<a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_fashion\" title=\"Chris and fashion\">wearing sunglasses for girls</a>) tried to vandalize the store's <i>Sonic Boom</i> display. When he failed and staff made a move to call security, Chris left, but not before macing an employee. In his rush to get away from the scene before the police could get him, Chris accidentally left his mom behind at the mall; he was then arrested after they drove Barbara home. Reports from a police radio mention that Chris was still banned from the mall at that point.\n</p><p>On 20 <a href=\"/cwcki/March_2018\" title=\"March 2018\">March 2018</a>, Chris again <a href=\"/cwcki/March_2018_trespass_charge\" title=\"March 2018 trespass charge\">trespassed at the mall</a> and was charged. As a result he was sentenced to the <a href=\"/cwcki/Therapeutic_Docket\" title=\"Therapeutic Docket\">Therapeutic Docket</a>, resulting in the charge ultimately being dropped.\n</p><p>On 20 <a href=\"/cwcki/September_2020\" title=\"September 2020\">September 2020</a>, Chris yet again went to the mall, but was not caught. He later remarked about the decline of the mall, noting that more than half of its stores were still open but that the JCPenney was closing. He also called it a \"gyp\" that the GameStop in Forest Lakes had closed, yet the one in the mall - and site of his macing incident - remained open.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Closure\">Closure</span></h2>\n<p>Malls have been declining as a whole since the <a href=\"/cwcki/2010s\" title=\"2010s\">2010s</a> due to the increasing popularity of online shopping websites like Amazon and <a href=\"/cwcki/EBay\" title=\"EBay\">eBay</a>, and the effects of the <a href=\"/cwcki/COVID-19\" title=\"COVID-19\">COVID-19</a> pandemic have certainly not helped matters. Charlottesville Fashion Square is no exception; throughout the late 2010s, several stores in the mall closed due to dwindling customers, while some of the mall's biggest tenants like Sears went bankrupt, leaving the mall with big chunks of unleased space. By <a href=\"/cwcki/2025\" title=\"2025\">2025</a>, the mall was a shell of its former self, having merely 16 stores, restaurants and booths still open, with the only two \"anchor locations\" left being two Belk stores.\n</p><p>The mall was at risk of closure in <a href=\"/cwcki/February_2020\" title=\"February 2020\">February 2020</a>, having defaulted on $45.2 million of loans.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]</a></sup> In response to this news, Chris wrote on <a href=\"/cwcki/Twitter\" title=\"Twitter\">Twitter</a>, \"Well, this is most disappointing.
