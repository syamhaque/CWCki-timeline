the game, Chris made his own ad to decrease production costs.</div></div></div>\n<p>Unfortunately for people who want to make sense of the whole mess, Chris is extremely vague about what he envisions his ideal games to be. He seems to come up with different game ideas and names, without really bothering to make them too different from each other. The game ideas seem to come and go based on the systems Chris has owned and used at the time, and he seems to be perfectly willing to let the <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">game designers</a> take full charge of every aspect of naming and design these games, as long as his vague parameters are followed.\n</p><p>Chris has been very quiet about any sort of concrete plans for what the games should be like gameplay-wise and has only stated what characters he envisions the games should have, what sort of \"adventures\" he envisions them having, and how those characters could possibly tie into level designs. According to the <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_dispels_videogame_rumors\" title=\"Chris dispels videogame rumors\">13 September 2009 video</a>, Chris only has the \"story arcs\" of the games in his head and on paper:\n</p>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">I got so many more story arcs in there <a href=\"/cwcki/Transformers\" title=\"Transformers\">than meets the eye</a>, yes- I mean multiple character switches and I have all the story plots, I'm- I have all the story plots in my head, and ON PAPER.

He is possibly picturing the games as some sort of a continuation of the 3D Sonic game series, with Chris scoffing at the idea of the games being in 2D (and offering no information beyond that). All this is highly alarming because even the most clueless fangame designers can usually get <i>this</i> much done. Chris spends much more time pitching the game idea itself and considering his personal involvement with the project (making advertisements, and offering to act as a voice actor) than he does on thinking about the actual <i>gameplay</i>.\n</p><p>Ironically, Chris's dream of a Sonichu game, at least based on <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Miyamoto_saga\" title=\"Miyamoto saga\">Miyamoto saga</a> is that his Sonichu game isn't even really about Sonichu but rather pushing for <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler%27s_Adult_Chronicles\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler's Adult Chronicles\">Christian Weston Chandler's Adult Chronicles</a></i>, where Sonichu and Rosechu are minor characters with the main focus on Chris <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">struggling to adjust to adult life</a>.\n</p><p>The Sonichu game was planned to be released on all consoles except the <a href=\"/cwcki/HEXBox\" title=\"HEXBox\">HEXBox 360</a>, due to Chris's pathological Sony-fanboyism and/or his unwillingness to spend his <a href=\"/cwcki/Monthly_tugboat\" title=\"Monthly tugboat\">monthly tugboat</a> on an online connection rather than games. Chris is also hoping the games to be developed on both PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3, in spite of the fact that PlayStation 2 has been put on the back-burner as far as most developers are concerned.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Why_all_this_is_futile\">Why all this is futile</span></h3>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_the_industry\" title=\"Chris and the industry\">Chris and the industry</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>Plain and simple, none of the media companies want unsolicited ideas from the public. There are several reasons for this. While companies do market research and figure out whether the time is ripe for games, they rarely take direct input from gamers on what kind of games they should publish. There are time constraints; a publisher would need to deal with a huge volume of ideas, all of which would need all due consideration. There are legal constraints; if a company rejects the idea, they have to agree to never implement a similar idea even if they came up with it on their own, or the dejected fan might sue them for idea theft. Ideas also take considerable time and energy to be actually implemented. Finally, Chris is in no position to make demands to Nintendo and Sega, since it is, ultimately, <i>they</i> who hold the copyrights to Pikachu and Sonic.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Games_proposed\">Games proposed</span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sonichu_Adventure\">Sonichu Adventure</span></h3>\n<p><i>Sonichu Adventure</i> was a game <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris\" title=\"Chris\">Chris</a> planned to release for the <a href=\"/cwcki/Nintendo\" title=\"Nintendo\">Nintendo GameCube and Game Boy Advance</a> systems before deciding that <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ego\" title=\"Ego\">he</a> was a far more interesting topic for a game, and diverted his attention towards <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler%27s_Adult_Chronicles\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler's Adult Chronicles\">Christian Weston Chandler's Adult Chronicles</a></i>. \n</p><p>The game is a blatant rip-off of <i><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Adventure\" title=\"wikipedia:Sonic Adventure\">Sonic Adventure</a></i>, as evidenced by the title and its release for the GameCube (<i>Sonic Adventure</i> was originally released exclusively for the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Dreamcast\" title=\"wikipedia:Sega Dreamcast\">Sega Dreamcast</a>, but was later re-released for the GameCube).\n</p><p><i>Sonichu Adventure</i> was one of the ads in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_0\" title=\"Sonichu 0\">first issue</a> of <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\">the <i>Sonichu</i> comic</a>. In true Chris style, the design of the game never went beyond a mocked-up bit of boxart and a <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Nintendo_Power\" title=\"Nintendo Power\">Nintendo Power</a></i> magazine cover that displayed the depths of Chris's awesome talent.  \n</p><p>In early promotional materials, it was titled \"Sonichu's Adventure\", but the \"'s\" was dropped in the final box art and images in-game.

Chris also says that <a href=\"/cwcki/Magi-Chan\" title=\"Magi-Chan\">Magi-Chan</a> would have been involved in some way as well, but Chris never thought of an idea for what he could do.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sonichu_Advance\">Sonichu Advance</span></h3>\n<p><i>Sonichu Advance</i> was Chris's proposed Sonichu game for the Game Boy Advance. The title indicates that it would have probably been a ripoff of the <i>Sonic Advance</i> series, which are GBA installments of Sega Genesis-style <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog\" title=\"Sonic the Hedgehog\">Sonic</a> games with sprites updated to the <i>Sonic Adventure</i> art-style, and other graphical improvements.\n</p><p>Sonichu Advance first featured in an advertisement in <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_0\" title=\"Sonichu 0\">Sonichu #0</a>. It also appeared on Chris's second <a href=\"/cwcki/Homemade_Nintendo_Power_magazine\" title=\"Homemade Nintendo Power magazine\">Homemade Nintendo Power magazine</a> cover, as featured in his <a href=\"/cwcki/The_Sonichu_Chronicles\" title=\"The Sonichu Chronicles\">Sonichu Chronicles</a> PowerPoint presentation for Nintendo.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Pok.C3.A9mon:_Lightning_Version\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Pokémon:_Lightning_Version\">Pokémon: Lightning Version</span></h3>\n<p><i>Pokémon: Lightning Version</i> was a <a href=\"/cwcki/Pok%C3%A9mon\" title=\"Pokémon\">Pokémon</a> game for the Game Boy Advance that Chris planned on releasing, possibly at the same time as <i>Sonichu Advance</i>. Not much is known about this game, as Chris said very little about it, even in advertisements, other than implying you would get to \"catch\" Sonichus at some point. Chris merely stated that \" I have the idea for the story beginning in my head\" and that it would feature \"Babies for ALL the Sonichus and Rosechus (minus Blake) and Evolutions (For Original Sonichu and Rosechu ONLY).\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Christian_Weston_Chandler.27s_Adult_Chronicles\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Christian_Weston_Chandler's_Adult_Chronicles\">Christian Weston Chandler's Adult Chronicles</span></h3>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler%27s_Adult_Chronicles\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler's Adult Chronicles\">Christian Weston Chandler's Adult Chronicles</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p><i>Christian Weston Chandler's Adult Chronicles</i> is Chris's extremely dumb and <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">narcissistic</a> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Video_game\" title=\"Video game\">video game</a> idea where one plays Chris trying to fight <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jerkops\" title=\"Jerkops\">Jerkops</a> to find a true <a href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart\" title=\"Sweetheart\">sweetheart</a> and kill <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Mary Lee Walsh</a>, with <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu\" title=\"Rosechu\">Rosechu</a> as useless, but determined, sidekicks.

And upon the unity in business between Nintendo, the company who provided me with my second gaming system, the Game Boy, after my very first <a href=\"/cwcki/Commodore_64\" title=\"Commodore 64\">Commodore 64</a> computer, SEGA, the company who introduced Sonic the Hedgehog as not only my Life-Long Hero, after <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/The_American_Rabbit\" title=\"The American Rabbit\">the American Rabbit</a>, but as the True Role Model Icon I am proud to have learned some of my attitudes and beliefs from since <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/1991\" title=\"1991\">1991</a>, and myself, Christian Weston Chandler, we will make Sonichu and Rosechu and their world being more Real than I was able to make them by myself with pen and markers in hand, and a vasly-knowledgeable imagination\n<p>You won't be able to truly say you've \"Caught Them All\", until you've caught the Original Sonichu and Rosechu in a CWC Approved Nintendo/Sega Pok'emon Lightning Version on GBA and DS to catch a great share of the other currently avilable Four Hundred and Ninty-Three Pok'emon.\n</p><p>Think you know the ins and outs of Sonichu and Rosechu, wait until Season Two of <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\">the Comic Book Series</a>, likely to start within the year 2009.

Sonichu is more than Lightning and Lightning-Speed, and Rosechu is more than delightful Bolts and Heart-Felt for Sonichu.

Chris also set up a (now deleted) blog dedicated solely to the game development. JK Productions later turned out to be trolls and cut off all ties with Chris. Chris went back to harassing Nintendo executives shortly afterwards.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Miyamoto_Saga_.28January_2009.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Miyamoto_Saga_(January_2009)\">Miyamoto Saga (January 2009)</span></h3>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Miyamoto_Saga\" title=\"Miyamoto Saga\">Miyamoto Saga</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>In the beginning of <a href=\"/cwcki/2009\" title=\"2009\">2009</a>, Chris thought he was in talks with Nintendo about releasing the game on the Sony platforms, exchanging several emails with trolls posing as <a href=\"/cwcki/Shigeru_Miyamoto\" title=\"Shigeru Miyamoto\">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Takashi_Tezuka\" title=\"Takashi Tezuka\">Takashi Tezuka</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Reggie_Fils-Aim%C3%A9\" title=\"Reggie Fils-Aimé\">Reggie Fils-Aimé</a> among others. He was of course being trolled, as part of an elaborate scheme set up by his future arch-nemesis, <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">Clyde Cash</a>.\n</p><p>Of particular interest here, (from the game design point of view, as well as deciphering Chris's intentions), was <a href=\"/cwcki/The_Sonichu_Chronicles\" title=\"The Sonichu Chronicles\">the PowerPoint presentation</a> he made for Nintendo. Yet, even <i>this</i> presentation will disappoint most people greatly: <i>one</i> slide that maybe even dares to mention the topic of the discussion at hand - to wit, the Sonichu games, and all the rest about <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\">his comic</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_Ego\" title=\"Chris and his Ego\">Chris himself</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Chris.27s_own_game_development_projects_.28November_2008.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris's_own_game_development_projects_(November_2008)\">Chris's own game development projects (November 2008)</span></h3>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/LittleBigPlanet\" title=\"LittleBigPlanet\">LittleBigPlanet</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>Being a level designer game, Chris quickly became obsessed with LBP in later <a href=\"/cwcki/2008\" title=\"2008\">2008</a>, as it allowed him to finally live out his dream of creating the Sonichu video game he had always wanted. He created two or three sub-par levels based around Sonichu and then forgot about that idea completely, instead making levels about the <a href=\"/cwcki/PS3_History_Level\" title=\"PS3 History Level\">PS3 itself</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Rescuing_Kacey_From_Christian_W_Chandler\" title=\"Rescuing Kacey From Christian W Chandler\">his then current sweetheart</a> and later, <a href=\"/cwcki/The_Wallflower\" title=\"The Wallflower\">owls</a>. Thus even Chris gave up on making a Sonichu game, content with his single unplayable Sonichu level and Sonichu themed Sackboy costume.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"
