He hit the <a href=\"/cwcki/Wigwam\" title=\"Wigwam\">wigwam</a>, and eventually came up with an \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Anchuent_Prophecy\" title=\"Anchuent Prophecy\">ancient Native American prophecy</a>\" as his explanation. This gave him the opportunity to talk about his alleged cultural background in the comic. Being that he knew nothing about real Cherokee (and even less about his ancestor specifically) he instead decided to just make up his own version of the Cherokee and his ancestor, and assumed it was true to life.\n</p><p>This lead to the creation of the bizarre \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Cherokian_Clan\" title=\"Cherokian Clan\">Cherokian Clan</a>\" featured in the <i>Sonichu</i> comic. Since Chris was making up the whole thing, he also declared his <s>fictional</s> ancestor to be the <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">leader of the entire Cherokee Nation</a>. \n</p><p>Chris's Cherokee ancestor was introduced in <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_2\" title=\"Sonichu 2\">Sonichu #2</a></i>, which was completed on 3 May 2005. The ancestor was long assumed to be nonexistent, but on 16 January 2025 - 19 years and 8 months later - the ancestor was discovered to be real by CWCki editor <a href=\"/cwcki/User:Cilria2\" title=\"User:Cilria2\">Cilria2</a>. <b>Polly \"Cherokee Mother\" Cherokee</b>  (c. 1703 to 1790) is Chris's 7th great-grandmother.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Character\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Character</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Role_in_the_comics\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Role in the comics</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href='#Sonichu_in_\"Anchuent_Prophecy\"'><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Sonichu in \"Anchuent Prophecy\"</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href='#Christian_Chandler_in_\"McAttack_Part_2\"'><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Christian Chandler in \"McAttack Part 2\"</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href='#Christian_Chandler_in_\"Off-Target_Part_2\"'><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Christian Chandler in \"Off-Target Part 2\"</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Appearance\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Appearance</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Chris_and_reincarnation\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris and reincarnation</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Actual_Cherokee_ancestor\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Actual Cherokee ancestor</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Character\">Character</span></h2>\n<p>It is explained that the Cherokee and <a href=\"/cwcki/Wasabi_Clan\" title=\"Wasabi Clan\">Wasabi</a> clans were at war in the ancient past over both the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Cherokian_Crown\" title=\"Cherokian Crown\">Cherokian Crown</a> and the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Queen_of_the_Cherokian_Clan\" title=\"Queen of the Cherokian Clan\">Queen of the Cherokian Clan</a>, the Ancestor's wife. However, the two clans would later ally to fight off <a href=\"/cwcki/Count_Graduon\" title=\"Count Graduon\">Count Graduon</a>, a new evil who first came to power around that time. They sealed him away, but their power of prophecy told them that he would come back one day. They then set up safeguards, such as the transformation powers, so that the three of them (the Leader, the Queen and the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Wasabi_Rival\" title=\"Wasabi Rival\">Wasabi Rival</a>) could eventually destroy him in present day <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a>. Hundreds of years later, the king of the Cherokee Clan would be reincarnated as <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler_(comic_character)\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler (comic character)\">Christian Weston Chandler</a>. His present day self would go on to fulfill the prophecy with his queen and rival, guided by an avatar of his ancient alter ego.\n</p><p>The character is never given a name, and so Chris only ever refers to him as \"Ancestor.\"\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Role_in_the_comics\">Role in the comics</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Sonichu_in_.22Anchuent_Prophecy.22\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id='Sonichu_in_\"Anchuent_Prophecy\"'><a href='/cwcki/Sonichu_2#Episode_7:_Sonichu_in_\"Anchuent_Prophecy\"' title=\"Sonichu 2\">Sonichu in \"Anchuent Prophecy\"</a></span></h3>\n<p>The Ancient leader appeared only very briefly in Episode 7 of <i>Sonichu #2</i>. His only purpose here is to explain to Chris that he is his reincarnation, tell him the evil <a href=\"/cwcki/Count_Graduon\" title=\"Count Graduon\">Count Graduon</a> is coming back, and ask if he's a bad enough dude to stop him. Chris gets his powers then and there and pisses off to go train with Sonichu.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Christian_Chandler_in_.22McAttack_Part_2.22\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id='Christian_Chandler_in_\"McAttack_Part_2\"'><a href='/cwcki/Sonichu_4#Sub-Episode_5:_Christian_Chandler_in_\"McAttack_Part_2\"' title=\"Sonichu 4\">Christian Chandler in \"McAttack Part 2\"</a></span></h3>\n<p>The Ancestor appears once again in <i>Sonichu #4</i>, acting as the resident Deus Ex Machina in Sub-Episode 5 of that issue. He randomly pops into Chris's head as he's getting the shit kicked out of him by <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/W-M-Manajerk\" title=\"W-M-Manajerk\">W-M-Manajerk</a>, and tells Chris that he can use the <a href=\"/cwcki/Heart_Torch_of_Fail\" title=\"Heart Torch of Fail\">Heart Torch of Fail</a> to bring his imaginary twin sister, <a href=\"/cwcki/Crystal_Weston_Chandler_(sister)\" title=\"Crystal Weston Chandler (sister)\">Crystal Weston Chandler</a> into being. Chris does so, and the ancestor dissappears again.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Christian_Chandler_in_.22Off-Target_Part_2.22\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id='Christian_Chandler_in_\"Off-Target_Part_2\"'><a href='/cwcki/Sonichu_4#Sub-Episode_8:_Christian_Chandler_in_\"Off-Target_Part_2\"' title=\"Sonichu 4\">Christian Chandler in \"Off-Target Part 2\"</a></span></h3>\n<p>The Ancestor appears one last time in the series after that, in the final Sub-Episode of <i>Sonichu #4</i>. When Chris is about to fight <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Mary Lee Walsh</a> at the <a href=\"/cwcki/Private_Villa_of_Corrupted_Citizens\" title=\"Private Villa of Corrupted Citizens\">Private Villa of Corrupted Citizens</a>, the Ancestor appears in his head to encourage him, telling him to focus and remember all the friends he made during his <a href=\"/cwcki/Love_Quest\" title=\"Love Quest\">Love Quest</a>, as if he were a supporting character from a <a href=\"/cwcki/Yu-Gi-Oh!\" title=\"Yu-Gi-Oh!\">children's anime</a> or <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog\" title=\"Sonic the Hedgehog\">Saturday morning cartoon</a>. \n</p><p>This tactic fails not due to the realization that Chris's Love Quest has accomplished nothing, but rather because Chris was actually so <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stressed\" title=\"Stressed\">badly beaten</a> by that point that <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Honest\" title=\"Honest\">he couldn't even remember a single friend</a> he'd made on the Love Quest so far. No, not even his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Myspace\" title=\"Myspace\">Myspace</a> friends. The Ancestor then suggests that he call upon the ancestral spirits for a morality boost, and surprisingly, this DOES work. Apparently ancient Native American spirits are interchangeable with <a href=\"/cwcki/Care_Bears\" title=\"Care Bears\">Care Bears</a>. Chris then transforms, beats up an old woman, and the Ancestor disappears into the aether once more, never to be mentioned again.\n</p><p>Given his frequent appearances in Sub-Episodes, it is reasonable to assume that the Ancestor was once meant to be a recurring character, but for one reason or another (perhaps under pressure from his mother), Chris abandoned the concept after he abandoned Sub-Episodes.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Appearance\">Appearance</span></h2>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"/cwcki/Anchuent_Prophecy\" title=\"Anchuent Prophecy\">Anchuent Prophecy</a>, Christian is in fact the reincarnation of this figure, which apparently explains the many dreams and visions in which the ancestor reveals new anchuent powers for Christian to use to fight <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jerkops\" title=\"Jerkops\">mall security</a>. As Chris <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_race\" title=\"Chris and race\">didn't care enough</a> to research the culture he is allegedly descended from, the ancestor looks absolutely nothing like a genuine Cherokee, being a white child-like man. Judging by the size of his head, he appears to be encephalitic. \n</p><p>Befitting his status as a Native American chieftain, he is always depicted wearing a gold and purple, vaguely Greco-Roman-looking breastplate (with <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">sculpted abs</a>) and the coveted <a href=\"/cwcki/Cherokian_crown\" title=\"Cherokian crown\">Cherokian crown</a>, items of metallurgy that the Cherokee did not possess. All this supports the theory that Chris just knows jack shit about actual Cherokees and their culture.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris_and_reincarnation\">Chris and reincarnation</span></h2>\n<p>Although Chris is said to be the reincarnation of the Ancient leader,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup> and several references are made to \"previous lives,\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup> several factors seem to contradict the idea. For one thing, none of the supposed reincarnations of the ancient Native Americans seem to have any memory of their previous lives after the prophecy is fulfilled, and none of them really seem to see their ancient alter egos as iterations of themselves. Sarah refers to the Ancient leader when told about him by the Queen of the Cherokian Clan as \"your husband,\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup> even though he should technically be her husband too if she were a reincarnation. Also note that Chris and friends seem to hold actual conversations with the ancient Native Americans, even though they were supposed to be long dead. \n</p><p>tl;dr: Chris probably doesn't know what \"reincarnation\" means.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Actual_Cherokee_ancestor\">Actual Cherokee ancestor</span></h2>\n<p><b> Polly Bowman \"Cherokee Mother\" Cherokee</b> (c. 1703 to 1790) was the 7th great-grandmother of Chris and Chris's actual Native American Ancestor.  She was the wife of Joshua Odum (1700 to 1745) and had one daughter Melissa Talivia Odum. They married in 1719 (<a href=\"/cwcki/Pedofork\" title=\"Pedofork\">when she was 16</a>) in <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orangeburg,_South_Carolina\" title=\"wikipedia:Orangeburg, South Carolina\">Orangeburg, South Carolina</a>.
