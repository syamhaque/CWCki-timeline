In fact, his schools most assuredly did have \"Coping Skills\" instruction in their <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_education\" title=\"wikipedia:Special education\">special education curriculum</a>, which he was required to attend.

Mine and their dreams could have been made individual realities sooner with a simple, great idea, <b>DATING EDUCATION CLASSES</b>.\n</p><p>We currently enforce, and have made required, Sexual Education classes in High Schools most everywhere.

I envision the teacher starting with the social basics, such as the simple greeting of “Hey, there. It’s a good day.”  :) Even quoting the Alec Grevin and his little red book, <i>“How to Talk to Girls”</i>. Also, later in the semester, teaching empathetic social skills that can benefit both of the straight partners in each couple. I also envision classroom distribution/loaning of female Barbie Dolls for MEN to practice socializing on, and 8” GI-Joe Figures for WOMEN to practice socializing on as well. The Classmates could also be paired up, Male-for-Female/Female-for-Male, in Class Workshop(s). If there were any unpaired people of one gender in the class, volunteers of the opposite gender from within the school’s student roster can be brought in for them. There would be <b>NO SAME-GENDER PAIRINGS, PERIOD</b>.\n</p><p>It is a fact that individuals who were unable to find their opposite-gender Sweetheart or crushes and get lucky before adulthood are likely tempted to turn homo… A dismal future NO God-Loving Individual, including myself; I swear on my Holy Bible as I type this essay with every keystroke I make with my keyboard resting on my Bible, would ever want to see occur.  :( The Dating Education Classes can best enforce the Natural Man-and-Woman Pairings/Couples; the homosexual count would be reduced.\n</p><p>If my essay is selected, I would give the money to our local High Schools to begin the Long-Necessary and Required Dating Education Class Trend within these United States, and then Worldwide, for a Better, Bright Future for All.\n</p><p>Thank You.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"In_Sonichu\">In <i>Sonichu</i></span></h2>\n<dl><dd><i>Main Article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_9#Episode_19\" title=\"Sonichu 9\">Episode 19: Date Ed (Even Though the Idea Sounds Dated)</a></i></dd></dl>\n<p>Depending on how charitable your mood is, you might argue that Chris's idea for Date Ed is <i>stupid</i> but not <i>insane.</i> That is to say that it makes sense for Chris to want some guidance, and to extrapolate that to mean that other people want the same.

Aprroach the boy<br/>\n- \"Hi, what's up!\"\n</p><p>2. Get the name<br/>\n- \"I'm Alex, what are you called?\"\n</p><p>3. Find out more, get his interest<br/>\n- \"So what are you into? What music do you like? Seen any good movies lately?\"\n</p><p>4. Give feedback, get opportunities for him to ask questions and get interested<br/>\n- \"I'm into anime (my favorite is Puni Puni Poemy, by the way - Kobayashi Poemi is so funny!!). I’ve seen that movie too! I like that actor.\"\n</p><p>5. Give interest/compliments back<br/>\n- \"I love your haircut (t-shirt, belt. etc)! What's that cologne?\"\n</p><p>6. Get more intimate details<br/>\n- \"So how old are you? Come here often? You from around here?\"\n</p><p>7. Food is a conversation foundation<br/>\n- \"Can we go get lunch/dinner? Can you buy me something to drink?\n(I think a gentleman should buy the lady a drink. although I don't drink alcohol or smoke).\"\n</p><p>8. At the food place you can expand on the themes previously discussed, such as art,\nmusic or cinema. but allow the boy to talk as well, support him if he gets\nshy or stumped.\n</p><p>9. A walk to help with digestion. Usually there's a couple of shops around\nin crowded places, so you can always visit a couple together. Not necesserily\nbuying anything, just browsing. A bookshop or a music/video store\nis always a good choice.\n</p><p>10.
