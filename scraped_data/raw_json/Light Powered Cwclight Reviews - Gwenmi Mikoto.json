other\n[Music]\nwords prime\n[Music]\nThere is no room left for you on this\nvery timeline Gwen\nmeakoto you get out so that our timeline\nmay be restored to the prime as it was\nbefore\nP\nEvery last one of you toxic worst\ndarkest sitting\nindividuals\nout Hey everybody what's up jesus Christ\nscience prime here once again and today\nwe are going to be reviewing the next\nfigure the legacy of Diver Burge\n9 Decepticon\nGlebbeotto and here we are and well here\nshe is and first and foremost as always\nwe're going to take a look at the\npackaging so right up here we have\nMakoto in her truck mode a lovely a fine\nlittle pickup Truck looks so dirty and\ngrimy and covered in filth Anyway yeah\nAnyway she is a deluxe class Classic\ndelet classic class The little hole All\nright Decepticon webbby threads for buzz\nOn this side of the box you got some uh\nsome artwork of uh Miss Makoto right\nhere And she just looks like she's out\nfor something Out for revenge Look at\nthat face and even her name and\ncybertronian\nwriting On the other side of the box you\ngot the top half of the lovely poster\nartwork And I feel like as when you\ncould when you look at the previous\nfigure video and yeah I feel like they\ndefinitely got a new piece of art here\nfor this And this you put these two\nhalves here They look great This is very\nnice I like this Anyway uh there's the\ntop of the box Lacy night birds There's\nthe B bird stage barcodes And on the\nback of the box you got your obligatory\nproduct She does this that and the other\nAnd uh little ly bio if you want to read\nthat if in your own time or if you want\nto just take your time This will be\nposted on that lovely little page on the\nquick light blog So there you go And\nthat's basically it for the packaging\nAnd moving right along here we have uh\nMiss Makoto in her truck mode And I'll\ngive you all the uh brief story in case\nyou have not heard So during the events\nof Idea Guy and Johnson Wilds in between\nlate 2017 and early 2018 where we\nheavily diverted away from the prime\ntimeline at which we haven't always been\nWe were the prime we at least I and a\nwhole lot of y'all watching this were of\nthat prime timeline as well\nAnd these people came in they shifted us\nfastly away from that timeline And we\nhave been slowly and steadily with as\nmany of the obvious signs that have been\nappearing over the years the recent\nyears since then that have confirmed\nthat we have been shifting and\neverything is coming back to place\ncorrecting itself and so forth It should\nbe very obvious to you It shall be very\nclear and obvious to anybody that is\nhighly intuitive and psychic\npowered essentially saying ask an\nauthentic\npsychic All right So anyway so here she\nis at her truck mode It's just uh little\nbrown pickup truck Just looks dirty We\ngot some mud on top So let's get a\ncloseup here Look at the uh details\nThere's a Decepticon symbol right there\non top a trans color windshield with uh\ndetails on the inside and uh just even\nmore details on the inside if you uh\ntake a look in\nthere and so\non Anyway yeah So then you got uh the\nyellow headlights and pinks and little\nbit of silver some whites and uh goes\nalong the side of the truck Uh just a\nlot of muddy brown more grays It just\nlooks so dank and grim grungy And\nthere's your tail lights that red and\nyellow And yep So there is the\ntop There is the bottom She does roll as\nonly thing Hooray for rolling rolling\naround dirty brother trucking\nthings And now for\ncomparison So here she is with the CC82\nin her tank mode\ncomplete with their little Titan master\nmanina\ntank And yeah just to uh get the other\nobvious comparison as place So here she\nis with uh Christian Prime right there\nAs if that uh punch through time did not\ndamage Makoto\nenough\nAnyway and we'll throw this in as well\nSo here she is with Sonu right there\nwith\nPrime And of course now we get on to the\nuh the show so far with her actual\nteammate So here she is\nwith Megatron right\nthere Uh\nwith\ncrasher\nwith put a slab of the first Hey Parsley\nwhat are you doing here i'm just getting\nin my review video now You lousy hunk of\nscrap I'm going to burn your ass so bad\nwhen we get back into the office I'm so\nscared\nwith SIV the\nfirst\nwith Septic Clone\nTractor And now for the uh kind of an\nobvious mold mate comparison Here she is\nwith Time's Return\nCup So there you\ngo And moving right along let's run to\nher accessories So she comes with a few\nof course Uh we'll start off with her\nTitan Master So here she is And just uh\nYep there you go Little tiny GBY Makoto\nthat just uh drives her pickup truck\nself because she was a human that\nidentified a robot but then she did\nupgrade it and as she became a\ncyberronian unwittingly unwillingly And\nwe can look at the uh details So here we\nhave a lovely little molded face right\nthere the body and arms and\njust Oh we'll just leave that in But at\nleast we got a good shot of the face\nthis time And uh obviously uh to go\naround the back and there we have the uh\nupside down face right there Low and\narticulation What we got so we got the\nball on the joint You got got your\nwiggly waggly Uh look up a little bit Uh\nlook down a little bit It can do a full\n360 And arms can uh move up about that\nfar And of course they go down They can\ngo out side to side And uh legs as usual\ncan move forward that far and back that\nfar And then you got the back and forth\nknee joint right there\nAnd uh for comparison here she is with\nuh Christian Cham Prime\nHeadmaster And here she is with a G1\nheadbuster And she does get some she\ndoes have some weapery So yep So she\nfirst comes with this little silver\nrifle gun right here And that little\ndetail on it Lots of silver paint some\nreason why white they used white plastic\non this Yep She gets this little gun And\nshe does come with her own little blade\nright here which also looks like it\nmight double as a rifle if you think\nabout it But yeah there you go Uh it's a\nsword She can wield it That'll work And\nshe also comes with her own bashing pink\nshield right there And yeah she can uh\nlike you know defend herself and just\nbig big bash has like a one air jump\nweapon she has and it comes with this\nlittle uh has this little handle on here\nwhich uh she can you can rotate that up\nand then it could double as in battle if\nyou want to You're totally dependent on\nwhich\nso it's uh so we can incorporate the\ntide master into the vehicle mode as uh\nusually it's just a simple it's in the\ndriver's seat So we open this up There's\nthe uh little groove in there for the\nback of the feet to go into So yeah just\nuh there like that And best you can you\nmight want to undo the uh connections at\nthe point the transmission connection\njust to get in there But it can be done\nIt can be\ndone And this is not working right now\nThis is not connecting Why is that\nbecause the camera's on because the\ncamera is\non Um Oh you know what i think we got it\nThat'll do There you go She's driving\nher pickup truck itself All right So we\ngot five mil ports here on the either\nside and ports up here So weapon storage\nEasy enough Uh could pop one right there\nand uh pop this You could put it up here\nor you can just uh put on the side to be\nlike that Little creaky but at least you\nknow it's not going to fall out And uh\nmaybe not the best delicate for the\nshield but at least you can store it up\nthere Make it look like uh she's\ncarrying this bit of luggage in her\ntruck\npocket Is she not a tank all right Well\nanyway so without further ado let's get\nuh down the transformation shall we\nlet's Let's I'm going to make her feel\ndizzy Dizzy I got to spin and spin and\nI'm gonna make her\ngo there Yes Okay Anyway let's get down\nto transformation So we'll move the uh\nweaponry and uh take a little headmaster\nout Yes there's emotional baggage But\nanyway so first step is uh we take the\nback of the uh truck here We pull that\nout That's going to split apart right\nthere a little while And uh on either\nside you get pull the legs out There's\nuh slots right there These tabs are\ngoing to glue into Just pull that down\nThat'll go right there And then yep same\nthing on the other side We can go ahead\nand uh flip the feed out right there\nThey're on either\nside Takes might take a little\nfingernail to do that with And uh we can\ngo ahead and angle this So we're going\nto take this and uh rotate this up This\nis the uh top of the uh body This goes\nright down there We can go ahead take\ncare of this as well So that stays there\nAnd you just want to rotate that up And\nthen we close the uh windshield over all\nthat We can lower these a little bit And\nuh and we got to rotate at the waist as\nwell So we just fold these These are a\ncouple of hinges You got a slot right\nthere that this tab is going to go\ninto And then you take these There's a\nslot right there tap right there And uh\nyou just uh put that down here And then\nyou pull this down You got the little\ngroove right there Can you see that\nlittle groove right behind the wheel\nthat this little tab is going to slip\nright into so you just pop that in there\nAnd there you go Satisfying click And\nsecond verse Just like the first Put the\nleg together like that And put the put\nthe thigh down the shining guard and\nthis in there And now we'll uh work on\nthe upper body a little bit Just uh take\nthe arms There's a slot tab connection\nright there that keeps them in place\nJust put it right there Now uh it's like\na gay looking What the is going on\nthere cuz her hands are up like that And\nuh you just take hold of them off right\nthere There's like a little post right\nthere that goes the slot to keep that in\nplace And you then you just fold the\nhand\ndown The same thing on the other side\nThis is a bit tight on my copy And then\nthat that and yep And of course uh she's\nmissing her head and which that's going\nto be\nremedied You know just a simple\nheadmaster\ntransformation right there And you plug\nthat\nin And there you go So there you have\nGwen\nMakoto in her robot\nmode And well that's it This is her This\nis freaking We Makoto as she is you\nknow Yeah But let's get in closer Look\nat the details I'm going to rotate the\ncamera up a little bit because that's\nLook at there Look in the eyes So anyway\nso there's her mug and she's got that\nbug that just is no good right there She\nlooks so angry all the time And yep\nDecepticon symbol right there on the\nchest and the details we see on the\ntruck mode and\nother did some details going on there\nthose\ncarvings And then just going down the\nlegs she got some pink stripes on her on\nher thighs right there I mean yeah Wait\nour shins I mean our shin guards and\nthat was her choice There's taillights\nand uh going up the uh back Yeah there's\nsome there's some loose joints in this\nfigure Anyway so uh articulation wise\nwhat we got i'm going to tell you So the\nhead is on a ball joint So you got your\nwiggly waggly wiggly leg She can look up\nonly a slight bit She can look down that\nlittle bit Uh it can rotate a full 360\nArms can rotate a full 360 They can move\nin and out A little bit of rotation\nthere Oh bicep rotation Here you go And\nyou have a double joint You have a\ndouble jointed elbow for full range of\nmovement Uh no rotation at the wrist but\nuh that hand can move outward like that\nif you need it to Waist\nrotation And legs can move forward that\nfar and\nback that far Yep and uh\noutward that far She cannot even do a\nfull split And you got the thigh\nrotation up\nthere 90 degrees of bend at the foot And\nuh the toe chain can move down if you\nneed to And that's pretty much it for uh\nfor her for\narticulation So now let's uh run through\nher uh weaponry and assortments So of\ncourse she can wield her weapons She can\nuh hold her hold her sword like that and\nshe can hold her gun in the other\nhand It's a tight fit but yeah there you\ngo She can pew pew slash pew pew slash\nand all that good stuff right there And\num yep there Take that out And yes you\ncan even put the shield in her hand like\nso So they go shield shield Bad bash or\nYep Um there you go Hack hack\nhex\nYeah Or yet cuz she got this little\nposter right here Let's see what that\nlooks like You can even have holding her\nblade like as if it was a gun It looks\nlike a gun I mean this is not bush\ncompatible but I just would mainly just\ncount this as a sword So yeah So you got\nthat going on All right So you got some\nyou have some weapon storage You just uh\nmain you mainly just have the uh these\ntwo these two five mil ports on her back\nYou can uh take her sword and put that\nback here You can take her gun and try\nkind of put it back there kind of but\njust they goofed up on that It's not\nexactly the most elegant thing Oh you\nknow what may as well I may as well do\nthis\ngive her a mock\nMegatron type of look since she's\nleading her this leading her share of\nDecepticons on Earth at this point\nMostly Decepticones but yeah you can\nstore these weapons on her back And uh\nyeah you can even store the shield back\nhere Again not the most uh elegant way\nto store it but there you go Storage if\nyou want it H Anyway so at least this\none gun she's holding that is blouch\ncompatible So yes it is We can take a\nblouch and just uh pop it right on in\nthere And we can have a big\nold timeline diverting chaos bringing\nmakotoing and it fails epically\nAnd now for Come Paradise Here is\nMakakota with the\nCC82 Definitely shorter but hey she\nstill had some growing to do\nwith\nprime\nwith another\nprime She's\noutclassed and uh\nwith Sonu right there And now of course\nher associates Here she is\nwith\nMegatron\nwith\nCrasher with Decepticone\nCorrector\nwith PL the\nfirst\nwith SIV the\nfirst And lastly but not leastly here\nshe is compared\nwith Times Return Cup An old man versus\na grouchy lady So there you\ngo All right So yeah this is the Gweni\nMakoto I mean I'm just going to switch\nto being nonbiased and just as a figure\nitself you know this a decent figure\nTake it for what you will at least uh\nyou know a few loose joints here and\nthere but other than that you know it's\nnot bad And the fact that we have like a\ndirty looking truck al mode kind of\ngives the uh figure some appeal It's\njust obviously it's uh clear that she's\nbeen through quite one bit of ordeal or\nanother but still you know she has had\nshe still wants to take out her revenge\non me and uh but all the other\nChristians Christ out the multiverse but\nthen again you know what we've been\nthrough our share of emotional or times\nand well and all that and we have grown\nimmensely And by that of course I mean\nemotionally and mentally but that's uh\njust uh going a bit into personal\ndetails But yeah this essentially um not\nbad figure It's here and there you know\nyada yada yada All right so anyway there\nyou go So now I picked up this figure\nfrom Target You got these are pop these\nfigures are pop up in your Walmarts is\nyour Targets your big bad toy store\neverything Earth and everywhere the toy\nstores are sold even our toy stores even\non Amazon.com\nBut yeah just essentially uh yeah if you\nuh the links to the some of these\nwebsites claim BBTS will be in the\ndescription down below So yeah um as for\nmy socials I forgot to mention this last\ntime There's a bit of a slight trend I\nmean I'll still post on a rare on\noccasion time on my blue sky I'm not\nposting anymore on Twitter except for\nthe purely occasional uh Etsy detail or\nthere's like a fact that I want to\nretweet that just I feel like it heavily\nresonates and whatnot But anyway uh\nbetween that and the blogs on my quick\nlight the links to all that will be in\nthe description down below And I think\nthat pretty much it So uh that is\nTransformers Legacy Night Merge Gwi\nMakoto and this is Jesus Christ Chance\nPrime saying remember you don't stop\nplaying because you grow you grow up\nbecause you stop playing be geek be\nproud bro I had to go through a few\njunkyards but I finally found a nose\ncode that fit me I'm able to go back and\njoin the battle You know what i just\ndon't get our superior sometimes They're\njust so tough at Even the boss\nlady she's just so critical and\njudgmental Doesn't give us even\nDecepticons a break I know the boss lady\nand first our superiors they rarely ever\ngive us a hard time Well at least the\nparty was good But let's at least the\ncharacter that actually survived\nactually was able to host it Yeah even\nI'm just a background lonely deceptive\nclone but even I can count and\nappreciate the good things in life Uh\nhey you guys see that coming to the\nwindow some distance i don't know what\nit is but I think it's coming this way\nWhat what are you talking about oh the h\nI see it I think it is coming this way I\ngot to get out of\nhere Oh It's the boss lady Uh\nboss ma'am Uh are you all right\n[Music]\nyeah I say she's all right All right All\nright You think I'm okay you pair of\ndeceptic goons I just got wet miles away\nby Christian\nbright She makes me so\nfurious There's so around here Hey Hey\nWhat day is\ntoday well ma'am today is actually June\n20th You've been gone for a little while\nCrasher took your place Ma'am she'll be\ngiving orders to us Ma'am And we've been\nactually very reluctant and very\nhesitant about her Ma'am crush her Damn\nit She lights worse than Starscream\nsometimes Or she just works worse than\nStarcream I'm going to have to fight the\ncrap out of that stomping\nbot What's it up with you now\nand you landed on me so hard\nboss Man that really hurt my\nback Damn it I just had that nose code\nreplaced Damn it Uh now I'm going to\nhave to go find another one Ah damn\nright You're going to have to find\nanother one that fast Ma'am Yes ma'am\nCome boss Ma'am sir Ma'am Uh yes\nMeanwhile I'm going to have to go give\nCrasher a talking to and report her to\nMegatron that psycho in the process\nShe's not going to have a good day about\nit\nall And neither was\nI Well yeah I suppose uh getting beat up\nby Prime and flying that's definitely a\nlot worse than me losing my nose cone\nagain Shut up you dip wit\n[Music] \n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Transcript\">Transcript</span></h3>\n<center>\n<table
