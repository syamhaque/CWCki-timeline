If children are \"channel surfing\" and viewing adult programming, I am assuming they have cable. Therefore it is the parents' responsibility to lock those channels. Maybe your parents were bad parents and <a href=\"/cwcki/IRC_(27_December_2008)\" title=\"IRC (27 December 2008)\">let you watch soft porn on HBO when you were sixteen</a> but I lock those channels from my children. My children will never unlock them because they are well behaved. Only badly behaved spoiled brats would unlock cable to watch porn.\n</p><p>You have still failed to explain why <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu\" title=\"Rosechu\">Rosechu</a> allow their children to watch unsuitable adult shows. Like I asked - and I want a straight answer this time - who explains to a three year old what pedophilia is?\n</p><p>I stand by my claim that Sonichu and Rosechu are bad parents and their children should go into care until you prove how letting children watch unsuitable adult programming is beneficial for them.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Children are going to Channel Surf and ACCIDENTALLY land on adult content, EVEN as far as to CRACK THE Parental Lock Code on the Cable/Satellite Box and <a href=\"/cwcki/Mass_debating#Discovery\" title=\"Mass debating\">turn on Cinemax Late Night</a> at worst.

My name is Davros Skaledthal. I am a geneticist, and I have a few questions after reading the latest issue of Sonichu. I deeply enjoy your comic, and especially the portrayal of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Cwcville\" title=\"Cwcville\">Cwcville</a> as a utopia. Every man should have a place to call his own, don't you agree?\n</p><p>First off, though, may I say how inspiring it is that you manage to make a high-quality page nearly every day. It must be incredibly taxing on you, but you seem to be coping admirably. Now, as to the questions.\n</p><p>1. You say that there is a 'gay gene' that can be cured. How exactly does this cure work, and which chromosome is said gay gene attached to?\n</p><p>2. As you have said in a previous mail post, you understand the basics of how evolution works. I'm not expecting you to discuss it at doctorate level of course, but as you know, a gene that is not used or is recessive does not transfer to the next generation. How then is the gay gene transmitted? Obviously every gay man or woman has two heterosexual parents, therefore the gay gene is not represented in either of them.\n</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to read this letter, and I know this is asking rather much from you, so I apologize in advance, but would you please elaborate on each of these questions with at least one full sentence? If not, I completely understand. Genius must do as genius must.\n</p><p>Thank you for your time, Mister Chandler.\n</p><p>Eagerly awaiting your response, Davros Skaledthal\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>1) It is neutrally attached to an X Chromosone. 2) It can be spread through such methods as Blood or Organ Transfusion, or there may be a slim, yet present, chance in spreading it through <a href=\"/cwcki/Semen\" title=\"Semen\">bodily liquid exchange</a> such of which is sneezing.\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"In_which_Chris_plays_along\">In which Chris plays along</span></h3>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #B48246; padding:5px; background-color:#FCC\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>From: <a href=\"/cwcki/Family_Guy\" title=\"Family Guy\">Meg Griffin</a> &lt;meggriffin@quahog.com&gt;\n<p>Why don't you come down to Quahog?

This is Jim Lee! I'm a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_the_industry\" title=\"Chris and the industry\">professional comic artist</a> who's worked for DC, Marvel, and <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_Comics\" title=\"wikipedia:Image Comics\">Image</a>!\n</p><p>Sorry about not including my email, but I'm a very busy man and I just barely have time to get in a few kind words for a budding young talent. Some of my friends have linked me comic pages you've done and I have to say you're doing extremely well for a kid your age! Most eight-year-olds don't have the focus for one comic's worth of material, let alone several hundred pages' worth!  That shows a great deal of dedication!\n</p><p>You've got a long way to go, but don't we all? I'm 45, I've been drawing comics professionally since I was 25, and I still feel like greatness is just ahead of me. I've won the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Awards\" title=\"wikipedia:Harvey Awards\">Harvey Special Award</a> and drew the best-selling comic issue in history, but I can't let that get to me. If I ever slow down or give in to temptation to slack off, I'll squander all the goowill and fandom I've got, and I can't let that happen. With a couple more decades under your belt, you can stand alongside the greats with pride.\n</p><p>Just a few tips: 1) Get used to drawing your own characters, not just <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonic\" title=\"Sonic\">Sonic</a> in different colors. It's nice to draw for comics you love, but you've got to show you can create your own characters too. 2) Don't just imitate your favorite artists' style, try and find your own. 3) <a href=\"/cwcki/Giant_Penis_Comic\" title=\"Giant Penis Comic\">Draw from life</a>, every day; draw every day, period! Last, don't forget to look up some really good book on how-to-draw; I recommend \"Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,\" \"Drawing Comics the Marvel Way!\", and \"Making Comics\" by Scott McCloud. Those are great books and they'll teach you a lot about how the pros do it.\n</p><p>Keep reaching for the dream, Chris!\n</p><p>--Jim Lee\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Thank you, Jim.

Do not be such a monster.\" I'm afraid that he's in the right, Chris. You're experiencing what many comic companies suffer--what you might call \"rights syndrome.\" When you use someone else's character, they still have the rights to that character, and what they say, goes. If you make any permanent changes to the character, you must get permission, and if the rights holder wants you to kill off or retire that character, you must.\n</p><p>This is why \"shared universes\" are so difficult to manage. Because <a href=\"/cwcki/Evan\" title=\"Evan\">Evang-y</a> created <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Simonchu\" title=\"Simonchu\">Simonchu</a>, he has the right to withdraw him from the setting. Seeing as how you also changed Simonchu's gender without permission, that's already a strike against you. You should fulfill your obligation as writer and creator and listen to Evang-y. This happens all the time. There's no easy fix, either. You should also be thankful that Evang-y has allowed you to keep Simonchu/\"Simonla's\" previous appearances, because otherwise you would have to redraw and rewrite those comics to exclude Simonla if he just wanted her retconned out!\n</p><p>As for Wild losing his \"sweetheart,\" don't look at it as him \"losing a sweetheart,\" but you gaining a whole metric ton of storytelling opportunities! Hardship and difficulty is the backbone of storytelling. <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_10\" title=\"Sonichu 10\">You could devote an entire issue to the story of Simonla's final battles and death,</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_10#The_Final_Countdown\" title=\"Sonichu 10\">then whole issues afterward about the aftermath of the event, especially Wild's reaction.</a> The Sonichu comics are lacking in any sort of pathos. <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler_(comic_character)\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler (comic character)\">Comic-Chris</a> doesn't seem to care a bit about his various <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sweethearts\" title=\"Sweethearts\">sweethearts</a> being killed or leaving, the entire team has forgotten about <a href=\"/cwcki/Crystal\" title=\"Crystal\">Crystal</a>, and even <a href=\"/cwcki/Blake\" title=\"Blake\">Blake</a> being raped by <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Silvana\" title=\"Silvana\">Silvana</a> has been glossed over. (<a href=\"/cwcki/Lovely_Weather\" title=\"Lovely Weather\">Having sex with someone under false pretenses, e.g. posing as someone they love even though they're not, is most definitely a rape</a>.) Wild's true love being killed isn't something you can just gloss over. It will allow for all kinds of character growth and change--storytelling gold! Don't think of it as being \"a monster\" to Wild, think of it as tough love to make him better as a character.\n</p><p>I like my characters too, but it's not entertaining at all if the only changes that happen to them are for the better. Every character is defined as much, if not more, by loss than by gain, by their weaknesses as much as their strengths. If <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Parker\" title=\"wikipedia:Peter Parker\">Peter Parker</a> hadn't used his superhuman talents for petty gain, his uncle wouldn't have died; it's his grief over his uncle's death and shame over his selfishness that motivates him into becoming one of the greatest superheroes of all time, <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde%27s_Buddy_Matt_Getting_SUPER-LAID!!!\" title=\"Clyde's Buddy Matt Getting SUPER-LAID!!!\">Spider-Man</a>. It's his constant struggle between <a href=\"/cwcki/Monthly_tugboat\" title=\"Monthly tugboat\">selfish gain</a> and the greater good that makes him so entertaining, so fascinating, so well-rounded a character. When people try to make him less complex and more happy, as with the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_One_More_Day\" title=\"wikipedia:Spider-Man: One More Day\">One More Day</a> fiasco, it backfires dreadfully.

It's pretty obvious that you're <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_remorse\" title=\"Chris and remorse\">incapable of feeling guilt or remorse</a> or even empathizing with other people. You drew pornography of your best friend, published it on the internet to prove some stupid point or affirm your manliness, and you only felt bad because <a href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Schroeder\" title=\"Megan Schroeder\">Megan Schroeder</a> stopped talking to you afterwards. You only befriend women because you want to have sex with them (some people would call this \"nice guy\" syndrome, but I think that it speaks to something much darker). And it's quite evident you're more interested in finding <a href=\"/cwcki/Jackie\" title=\"Jackie\">a woman to mooch off</a> of when your parents die than entering into a relationship out of love. You're incapable of love because you only love yourself.\n</p><p>For somebody with \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">autism</a>\" you sure don't know a lot about it. I mean, you get basic facts about the disorder wrong, and become infuriated when people try to correct you. For starters, \"High-functioning autism\" isn't a formal diagnosis, and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Asperger%27s_Syndrome\" title=\"Asperger's Syndrome\">Asperger's Syndrome</a> and autism are on the same spectrum. I think you found out about autism sometime in your teens and started using it as an excuse for your immaturity, lack of empathy, selfishness and disturbed behavior, and took the scam further in adulthood by getting <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tugboat\" title=\"Tugboat\">disability money</a> out of it. People with autism recognize they have limitations and get help to overcome or work around those limitations. Despite their autism they put forth effort to survive in a world they do not understand.\n</p><p>Autistic people don't run over small animals repeatedly and call it \"the highlight of their day.\" Autistic people don't try to impersonate <a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris\" title=\"Liquid Chris\">a woman's boyfriend</a> and lure <a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey\" title=\"Kacey\">that woman</a> to their home so they can rape them.
