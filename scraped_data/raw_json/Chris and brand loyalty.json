Companies often use advertising, loyalty programs, product placement and contests to establish a brand in which consumers will recognize, value, and seek out at the expense of other brands. Due to his <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">difficulty separating</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">reality and fiction</a>, Chris tends to think advertisement is <a href=\"/cwcki/Axe\" title=\"Axe\">literal documentation of a product's effectiveness</a> rather than an intrinsically biased attempt to lure consumers. As a result of his sense of entitlement, he views <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_contests\" title=\"Chris and contests\">winning games of chance</a> as a validation of his self-worth. These qualities, in combination with his <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">rigid thinking, fear of change and attraction to routine</a>, has led Chris to have intense brand loyalty for certain products as well as hatred for their perceived rivals. His loyalty even extends to areas that would not normally be considered \"brands\", such as mental disabilities and sexual orientations. \n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Overview\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Overview</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Sonic_the_Hedgehog\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Sonic the Hedgehog</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#PlayStation_3_vs._HEXBox\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">PlayStation 3 vs. HEXBox</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Autism_vs._Asperger's\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Autism vs. Asperger's</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Harry_Potter_vs._Pokémon\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Harry Potter vs. Pokémon</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#My_Little_Pony\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">My Little Pony</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Nintendo\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Nintendo</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Apple/iOS\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Apple/iOS</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#Sexuality\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">9</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Sexuality</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Axe\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">10</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Axe</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#McDonald's_vs._Burger_King\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">11</span> <span class=\"toctext\">McDonald's vs. Burger King</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#Coke_and_Pepsi\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">12</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Coke and Pepsi</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-13\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">13</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Overview\">Overview</span></h2>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">Oil of <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olay\" title=\"wikipedia:Olay\">Olay</a> brand bar soap...

He considers those who abandon a brand in favor of a competitor, such as <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a> fans who became fans of <a href=\"/cwcki/Asperchu\" title=\"Asperchu\">Asperchu</a>, to be \"hypocrites\". Chris seems to consider being a consumer of a particular brand as something like a relationship — at one point clumsily attempting to use a mangled quote from the video game <i><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Br%C3%BCtal_Legend\" title=\"wikipedia:Brütal Legend\">Brütal Legend</a></i> to explain this strange belief, saying that merchandise was like a wedding ring and that as long as there was branded merchandise available, fans should stay loyal.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup>\n</p><p>As Chris's allegiance to brands plays such an important role in defining Chris's personal understanding of his identity, he feels highly threatened when either his favorite brands or his loyalty to them are called into question. Many of Chris's most notorious outbursts are a direct result of this insecurity. While this was the basis for much of Chris's internet trolling, it apparently dates back into Chris's early life when school bullies, in a form of proto-trolling, would tell him that Sonic the Hedgehog was dead in order to get a rise out of him.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Chris is highly susceptible to marketing and branding; he feels strong loyalty to brands even, and perhaps especially if they are essentially identical to their rivals. He is drawn to virtually every attempt at generating brand loyalty, compulsively entering any contest he encounters and fastidiously collecting various loyalty points, including <a href=\"/cwcki/My_Coke_Rewards\" title=\"My Coke Rewards\">My Coke Rewards</a> and <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald%27s_Monopoly\" title=\"wikipedia:McDonald's Monopoly\"><i>McDonald's Monopoly</i></a>.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Lbpsucks.JPG\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"112\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/e/e9/Lbpsucks.JPG/300px-Lbpsucks.JPG\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/e/e9/Lbpsucks.JPG/450px-Lbpsucks.JPG 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/e/e9/Lbpsucks.JPG/600px-Lbpsucks.JPG 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Lbpsucks.JPG\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div><a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_copyright\" title=\"Chris and copyright\">Free advertising</a>.</div></div></div>\n<p>Chris seems to struggle to understand the economics of advertisements, instead of seeing them as positive features in the media he enjoys. He happily included his own versions of advertisements and product placement for real brands in his <a href=\"/cwcki/Homemade_Nintendo_Power_magazine\" title=\"Homemade Nintendo Power magazine\">Homemade Nintendo Power magazine</a> and nearly every issue of <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a>; he seemed genuinely surprised that Coke, for example, wouldn't want one of his fake Coke ads — \"hand-drawn charm\" notwithstanding — on the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia\" title=\"CWCipedia\">CWCipedia</a>. He also frequently states that his videos are sponsored or \"brought to you by\" various companies with which he has no business relationship and uses his own variation of marketing speak to plug their products.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup> Likewise he often attempts to promote his favorite brands by parroting their advertising language, a habit he has had since at least high school.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup>\n</p><p>He is a vigorous defender of his favored brands in unusual ways, warning his readers not to purchase pirated versions of <i><a href=\"/cwcki/LittleBigPlanet\" title=\"LittleBigPlanet\">LittleBigPlanet</a></i> (a PS3-exclusive title) for Xbox 360, despite the fact that this is impossible. \n</p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sonic_the_Hedgehog\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog\" title=\"Sonic the Hedgehog\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></span></h2>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">HERO OF MY LIFE\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:11px; padding:0 0 0 16px; vertical-align:bottom; width:20px\">”\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:0064-ChristianWSonic.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"417\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/7/7c/0064-ChristianWSonic.jpg/300px-0064-ChristianWSonic.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/7/7c/0064-ChristianWSonic.jpg/450px-0064-ChristianWSonic.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/7/7c/0064-ChristianWSonic.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:0064-ChristianWSonic.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>A match made in heaven?</div></div></div>\n<p>Sonic is the quintessential example of Chris's intense brand loyalty. Chris is, in many ways, the product of Sega's attempt to allow people to feel a personal connection with electronic appliances. Following <a href=\"/cwcki/Super_Mario_Bros.\" title=\"Super Mario Bros.\">Mario</a>'s success for Nintendo, Sonic was designed to appeal to young children all over the world and act as a mascot for Sega. He was concocted by combining elements from other popular cultural elements of the early 1990s, including Michael Jackson, Bill Clinton, and Santa Claus. Part of Sega's strategy was to employ a multi-pronged marketing technique, including video games, television shows, toys and contests. Chris followed all of these closely, and in a fateful moment became the winner of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_Watch_%26_Win_Sweepstakes\" title=\"Sonic the Hedgehog Watch &amp; Win Sweepstakes\">Sonic the Hedgehog Watch &amp; Win Sweepstakes</a>, which cemented Sonic's place of honor in Chris's mind. Sonic became Chris's \"lifelong hero,\" replacing his previous \"lifelong hero\" <a href=\"/cwcki/The_Adventures_of_The_American_Rabbit\" title=\"The Adventures of The American Rabbit\">The American Rabbit</a> (despite Sonic's much greater grip on his life, Chris has often felt compelled to mention the American Rabbit, as if out of some obligation). While Sonic is certainly a popular franchise, Chris became obsessed with the hedgehog to a level likely unanticipated by Sega. During the 1990s, Sonic occupied nearly all of his thinking, serving as a fantasy world in which he could escape from the realities of daily life. Chris would generally combine Sonic with whatever he was doing, whether it was replacing the characters in <i><a href=\"/cwcki/R.L._Stine\" title=\"R.L. Stine\">Goosebumps</a></i> books with Sonic characters, or combining Sonic with basketball to form the recolor \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Bionic_the_Hedgehog\" title=\"Bionic the Hedgehog\">Bionic</a>.\" Over the past two decades, Chris has purchased nearly every Sonic-branded game, toy, and bit of merchandise, and seems to view Sonic as something resembling an old personal friend.  \n</p><p>Instead of growing up and moving on when the Sonic brand began to grow stale at the end of the 1990s, Chris merged Sonic with his other beloved franchise at the time, <a href=\"/cwcki/Pok%C3%A9mon\" title=\"Pokémon\">Pokémon</a>, to create <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a>, who has largely replaced Sonic as the primary character in his internal fantasy world - although Sonic still makes occasional cameo appearances.    \n</p><p>Despite Sonic's sidekick Tails' major presence in the Sonic canon, Chris rarely refers to him and conspicuously left him, or any recolor of him or two-tailed anything, absent from <i>Sonichu</i>. Some have speculated that this may be due to popular schoolyard rumors that conjectured that Sonic and Tails were in a homosexual relationship. Chris's notorious <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">homophobia</a> may have caused him to have an aversion to a character that he imagined might have tempted Sonic from \"the straight path.\" \n</p><p>Although Mario and Nintendo were vicious rivals of Sonic and Sega, Chris seems to have been largely oblivious to this tension (<a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_hypocrisy\" title=\"Chris and hypocrisy\">or simply did not care because he liked both brands</a>) and never subjected them to the kind of hatred he would aim at rivals of his favored products later in his life. \n</p><p>Chris appears to worship Sonic <i>the character</i> more than Sonic <i>the brand</i>, as he would be easily teased at school when other students said that Sonic was dead<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup>, and believed that YouTube animator Max Gilardi (a.k.a. Hotdiggedydemon) had murderous intent against the <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">fictional character</a> in <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WF9CS3L_ezw\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sonic: Too Fast?</a> and insisted <a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_Chris%27s_comments_on_YouTube#Sonic:_Too_Fast?\" title=\"List of Chris's comments on YouTube\">that Sonic was alive</a>. Chris's almost religious dedication to Sonic reached a surprising apex when he <a href=\"/cwcki/26_December_2014\" title=\"26 December 2014\">vandalized products and assaulted retail workers</a> over a superficial change to Sonic, <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_Boom_Protests\" title=\"Sonic Boom Protests\">the color of his arms</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"PlayStation_3_vs._HEXBox\"><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PS3\" title=\"PS3\">PlayStation 3</a> vs. <a href=\"/cwcki/HEXBox\" title=\"HEXBox\">HEXBox</a></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:KillThatHexBawx.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"170\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/1/1f/KillThatHexBawx.jpg/300px-KillThatHexBawx.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/1/1f/KillThatHexBawx.jpg/450px-KillThatHexBawx.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/1/1f/KillThatHexBawx.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:KillThatHexBawx.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Violence is never the answer.</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Cwcps3_by_nevermonkey-d4jrnny.jpg\"><img alt=\"Cwcps3 by nevermonkey-d4jrnny.jpg\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"300\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/9/99/Cwcps3_by_nevermonkey-d4jrnny.jpg/300px-Cwcps3_by_nevermonkey-d4jrnny.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/9/99/Cwcps3_by_nevermonkey-d4jrnny.jpg/450px-Cwcps3_by_nevermonkey-d4jrnny.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/9/99/Cwcps3_by_nevermonkey-d4jrnny.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Cwcps3_by_nevermonkey-d4jrnny.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div></div></div></div>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">Sony's Playstation 3 and Playstation Portable are Truly a place I can call My Digital Home. :D Happy Anniversary, Playstation 3; you are Truly the Best Life Upgrade Ever\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:11px; padding:0 0 0 16px; vertical-align:bottom; width:20px\">”\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\" style=\"font-size:smaller; padding:8px 36px; text-align:right;\"><cite><a href=\"/cwcki/PS3_History_Level\" title=\"PS3 History Level\">Chris expressing TRUE and HONEST love.</a></cite>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>Perhaps Chris's best known case of brand loyalty is his sycophantic love of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Sony\" title=\"Sony\">Sony</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/PlayStation_3\" title=\"PlayStation 3\">PlayStation 3</a> and abject hatred for the <a href=\"/cwcki/HEXBox\" title=\"HEXBox\">Microsoft Xbox 360</a>. While fanboyism for these video game consoles is certainly well-known and the rivalry between these products is referred to as a \"console war\", Chris, as he frequently does, took it to a new level, irrationally hating the Xbox 360 and heaping love and money on Sony. Chris was obsessed with the PlayStation 3 long before he was able to purchase one, stating that he would throw out the cure for autism for the $600 hunk of black plastic.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]</a></sup> When he finally bought a PS3, after failing to <a href=\"/cwcki/Pixelated_PS3\" title=\"Pixelated PS3\">win it in a contest</a>, he considered it to be the \"ultimate life upgrade\". The PS3 and its online component the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PSN\" title=\"PSN\">PSN</a>, where he has spent thousands of dollars, became an extremely important part of every day for Chris. He would also use his limited budget to purchase numerous Sony-branded accessories, including a flat-screen TV, a <a href=\"/cwcki/PSEye\" title=\"PSEye\">PSEye</a>, PSmove, PSmove Sharpshooter and multiple <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Guitar_Hero\" title=\"Guitar Hero\">Guitar Hero</a></i> controllers. Chris seems to find more pleasure in the purchasing of PS3 content than in its actual use. He frequently buys downloadable content for games he does not own. Chris seems to consider the PS3 and its games and accessories to be a genuine life improvement or something akin to investments rather than a glorified hugbox; how these electronic gizmos do anything but distract him from reality remains unclear. Chris went to great lengths to express his distaste for the PS3's primary rival: the Xbox 360, or \"HEXbox\" as he liked to call it. When Chris would propose a video game such as <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler%27s_Adult_Chronicles\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler's Adult Chronicles\">Christian Weston Chandler's Adult Chronicles</a></i>, he would make sure to state that it would be for all consoles... HEXbox excepted. Chris went as far as defacing in-store advertisements for the Xbox while yelling \"kick that hex-bawx\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-7\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">[7]</a></sup> and frequently lashing out at those who appeared to like or be affiliated with the Xbox.\n</p><p>Chris's reasons for hating the Xbox 360 have never been clearly defined. When pressed for answers, Chris would generally cite Xbox Live's (Xbox's online component) cost or the infamous \"<a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360_technical_problems\" title=\"wikipedia:Xbox 360 technical problems\">red ring of death</a>\".<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-8\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">[8]</a></sup> He would later admit that his anger stemmed from jealousy over being unable to afford an original Xbox and that the aforementioned reasons were merely excuses<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-9\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">[9]</a></sup>. Though he later softened his stance against the Xbox under the influence of <a href=\"/cwcki/Jackie\" title=\"Jackie\">Jackie</a>, the rivalry between the consoles and Chris's loyalty towards Sony was at its peak during the height of Chris trolling. This caused his hatred to become well known and the Xbox 360 to become a bit of a mascot for trolls. Chris also associated the Xbox with trolls, depicting <a href=\"/cwcki/Asperchu\" title=\"Asperchu\">Alec Benson Leary</a> as an Xbox user.

Just as with the PS3 and Xbox 360, Chris has identified a rival to autism in Asperger's syndrome. This is a classic case of Chris's propensity to choose one \"brand\" over another despite the fact that they are identical; Chris's \"high-functioning\" autism and Asperger's are essentially the same diagnoses. Chris feels that people with Asperger's are trying to \"steal his limelight\" and in fact stated that the name of the disorder, beyond merely sounding like \"a bad cut of meat,\" brought to mind \"competing retards.\" He seems to believe that people with Asperger's syndrome are somehow faking their symptoms. \n</p><p>Chris's loyalty to autism and insistence on believing it to be different from Asperger's syndrome forces him to ignore any kind of reason.

Chris used the 8GB iPhone for everything requiring cell service, and he used the 32GB iPod for entertainment - and it wasn't even his only iPod Touch at the time.

To Chris (prior to his <a href=\"/cwcki/Transgender\" title=\"Transgender\">coming out</a>), heterosexual love is the purest joyous expression of emotion that can be experienced, the search for which is the noblest of quests. Its opposite — homosexual love — on the other hand, is a warped dangerous temptation and those who practice it are worthy of scorn. Chris had even forgone platonic same-sex friendships in an effort to avoid any possibility that he might associate with and be tempted by a homosexual. Just as with his hatred for the Xbox, Chris was completely closed-minded when it comes to evaluating homosexuality; to him, it was the enemy and the mere thought of it made him blind with rage. Despite his efforts at finding heterosexual love, Chris seemed more concerned with ensuring that he was properly labeled as a STRAIGHT man. His efforts to prove to the world that he was in fact not a homo included going as far as planning to record and publicize his first heterosexual experience against the wishes of his hypothetical partner. Whether Chris's former hatred for homosexuality stems from jealousy, as it did with his hatred for the XBox, is unknown. \n</p><p>The origin of this loyalty can be traced back to his childhood: <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler\" title=\"Bob Chandler\">Bob Chandler</a>, being a not-so-nice Southern gentleman, not only disliked homosexuals in the traditional bigoted manner, but suffered from frequent paranoid delusions regarding their role in his life. When Chris ran into trouble at <a href=\"/cwcki/Nathanael_Greene_Elementary_School\" title=\"Nathanael Greene Elementary School\">Nathanael Greene Elementary School</a> Bob blamed the problems not only on the principal (who he was certain was a homosexual), but on the school board which, for reasons left unclear, he believed to be stacked with homosexuals who despised his family. Even the incredibly <a href=\"/cwcki/Na%C3%AFve\" title=\"Naïve\">naïve</a> Christian was capable of seeing that this was, at the very least, an exaggeration, if not a paranoid persecution fantasy<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-18\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">[18]</a></sup>. Nevertheless, this kind of hatred and paranoia sunk into Chris's mind and was compounded by Bob's unfounded and bizarre belief that Chris's trolling originated with several homosexuals who he believed frequented <a href=\"/cwcki/The_GAMe_PLACe\" title=\"The GAMe PLACe\">the GAMe PLACe</a>.  \n</p><p>Chris's feelings on lesbianism were more nuanced.

He loosened his stance on sexuality, and he now considers himself to be part of the <a href=\"/cwcki/SLGBTQ\" title=\"SLGBTQ\">LGBT</a> community. In 2018, the <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys</a> convinced him that he was <a href=\"/cwcki/Bisexual\" title=\"Bisexual\">bisexual</a>, giving his loyalty to the LGBTQ+ community completely.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Axe\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Axe\" title=\"Axe\">Axe</a></span></h2>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">I respectfully and humbly request that on the package a statement li—such as \"DESIGNED ONLY FOR STRAIGHT ORIENTED MEN\"\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:11px; padding:0 0 0 16px; vertical-align:bottom; width:20px\">”\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\" style=\"font-size:smaller; padding:8px 36px; text-align:right;\"><cite><a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_Address_to_Unilever_About_AXE\" title=\"CWC Address to Unilever About AXE\">Chris</a></cite>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>Chris's loyalty to this multinational deodorant brand (called Lynx in the UK and <a href=\"/cwcki/PandaHalo\" title=\"PandaHalo\">Australia</a>) is a classic example of Chris taking advertising literally.

Obviously, Axe has never worked as advertised for Chris, but he has maintained his status as a loyal customer for many years.\n</p><p>Axe is also an example of how Chris considers the products he buys an integral component of his identity. As a loyal Axe customer, he was deeply disturbed when he was told that Axe was popular in the gay community, and he felt the need to use <a href=\"/cwcki/YouTube\" title=\"YouTube\">YouTube</a> to <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_Address_to_Unilever_About_AXE\" title=\"CWC Address to Unilever About AXE\">request that the Unilever Corporation</a> use labels to specifically forbid homosexuals from using their products.
