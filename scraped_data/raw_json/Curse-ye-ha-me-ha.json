It's also possible that Chris was inspired by a scene in <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Excel_Saga\" title=\"Excel Saga\">Excel Saga</a></i>, where the characters at one point perform a \"Nabehameha\"; a parody of the Kamehameha named after the series director, Shinichi \"Nabeshin\" Watanabe. If not directly inspired by <i>Excel Saga</i>, it likely at least caused Chris to think of deriving his own version of the famous attack. \n</p><p>And before you ask: yes, Chris has done this in public and actually thinks that he has the power to do this.

For optimal results, say it like <a href=\"/cwcki/User:Dethchemist77\" title=\"User:Dethchemist77\">the second narrator</a> of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Audiobooks\" title=\"Audiobooks\">audiobooks</a> says it.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup>\n</p><p>When desired, the Curse-ye-ha-me-ha generally acts as a standard energy blast to vaporize enemies. However, in other situations, the attack has no immediately apparent effects. Therein lies the \"curse\" — the attacker has subtly hexed the victim, guaranteeing that he will soon suffer unbearable misfortune.\n</p><p>While negotiating the production of <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Video_games\" title=\"Video games\">video games</a> with <a href=\"/cwcki/Nintendo\" title=\"Nintendo\">Nintendo</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Shigeru_Miyamoto\" title=\"Shigeru Miyamoto\">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> informed Chris that \"curse\" is considered offensive in Japanese culture, and so all references to the spell have been changed to \"Shin-ye-ha-me-ha.\" By <a href=\"/cwcki/August_2009\" title=\"August 2009\">August 2009</a> Chris had become more willing to revert to the original name when sufficiently angry. \n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Curse_Shot\">Curse Shot</span></h3>\n<p>A less theatrical version of the move, the <b>Curse Shot</b>, is delivered by simply holding out one's hand in the shape of a gun and miming the act of shooting the target. This achieves the same sort of ominous misfortune without requiring several seconds of preparation, which is handy if you happen to be running away from mall security. On a few occasions, he has performed a variation on this theme using his <a href=\"/cwcki/Megatron_pistol\" title=\"Megatron pistol\">Megatron pistol</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Purpose\">Purpose</span></h2>\n<p>Aside from creating the impression that Chris has <a href=\"/cwcki/Messiah_complex\" title=\"Messiah complex\">delusions of godhood</a>, the Curse-ye-ha-me-ha allows him to feel some sense of control over his world. Chris is too weak, stupid, and cowardly to directly act against those who give him <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_stress\" title=\"Chris and stress\">stress</a>, but his curses require no effort from him except his own faith in their power. As long as it is impossible to prove the Curse-ye-ha-me-ha has no effect, Chris can allow himself to believe the universe will ultimately destroy his enemies, giving him a sense of triumph.\n</p><p>However, it seems to have two different effects within the comics. First officially seen in <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_0#Classic_Sonichu_Strips\" title=\"Sonichu 0\">Classic Sonichu Strip 3</a>, Curse-ye-ha-me-ha seems to be the finishing move similar to Dragon Ball. However, within the same issue, in <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_0#Sub-Episode_1:_Christian_Chandler_in_.22Jerkop-tastropie.22\" title=\"Sonichu 0\">Sub Episode 1</a>, the move is used on the Jerkhief, and is said to lay a curse on someone, unfairly ruining their life- causing the character to slip on a random banana peel, shattering his glasses, and his wife suddenly leaving him just for his smoking habit, taking his children and all his belongings without a court case.\n</p><p>Later in the comics, Chris is seen again using the move in a combo attack with his sister's \"shocking tiara magic\". This causes the W-M-Manajerk's head in a jar to become detached from his robot body. The Manajerk does not seem to be cursed or suffering from random bad luck. The move was simply a finishing move. \n</p><p>The move within the comics only seems to now be a finishing move - so its real purpose is up for debate.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Yes.2C_he_actually_does_this_in_public\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Yes,_he_actually_does_this_in_public\">Yes, he actually does this in public</span></h2>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">Verbal Combat had started, and during the fight, I ran off, still giving verbal punishment, as well as da finger, and many “Curse-Ye-Ha-Me-Has.” I nearly backed up onto him with my car, and I gave him another finger.
