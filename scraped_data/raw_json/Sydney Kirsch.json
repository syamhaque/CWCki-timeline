Since she had forgotten this handsome, devilishly charming man's email address, she simply searched up <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris\" title=\"Chris\">Chris</a> and The GAMe PLACe then emailed the first place that came up. The following is a record of what took place. \n</p><p>Sydney had the noble end-goal of wanting to get Chris to resume answering the <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag\" title=\"Mailbag\">Mailbags</a>, by trading <a href=\"/cwcki/Nudes\" title=\"Nudes\">naked pictures of herself</a> for answered questions. Unfortunately, things did not turn out that way at all and, ultimately, this was a rare win for Chris. His smugness at (finally) uncovering a troll is still chuckle-worthy, as is his mention of his cleavage (or, as normal human beings might put it, shockingly <a href=\"/cwcki/Collosal_Chan\" title=\"Collosal Chan\">colossal</a> man-boobs).\n</p><p>Some subject matter (mostly audio clips and voice mail messages) have not been posted because they are mostly irrelevant, don't add to the story and/or don't contain input from Chris. Note that the date and time stamps on emails are for <a href=\"/cwcki/Virginia\" title=\"Virginia\">Virginia</a> time, while the date and time stamps on audio clips are <a href=\"/cwcki/PandaHalo\" title=\"PandaHalo\">Adelaide, Australia time</a>. The <a href=\"/cwcki/User:Ronichu\" title=\"User:Ronichu\">woman herself</a> quite happily admits that there is not a lot of new information about Chris in these documents, and that the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCki\" title=\"CWCki\">CWCki</a> exists to document Chris, not failed troll attempts. However, making the information public will hopefully make it clear that Chris <b>is</b> beginning to adapt, so just remember, nobody trolls Chris quite so well as Chris.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#E-mails\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">E-mails</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Mistaken_identity\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Mistaken identity</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#A_little_nibble...\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">A little nibble...</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Interest_is_building\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Interest is building</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#What_a_sexy,_sexy_man\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">What a sexy, sexy man</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Houston,_we_have_liftoff!\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Houston, we have liftoff!</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#All_about_Sydney\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">All about Sydney</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Phone_call\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Phone call</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#Transcript\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Transcript</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Radio_silence_broken\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Radio silence broken</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#OH_SHI-\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">OH SHI-</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#Transcript_2\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Transcript</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-13\"><a href=\"#Epilogue\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Epilogue</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"E-mails\">E-mails</span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Mistaken_identity\">Mistaken identity</span></h3>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#F2CECE; border:1px dotted #BFA3A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Thursday, April 22, 2010 8:54 AM\n<p>Subject: Hi Chris, it's Sydney (the girl from The Game Place) again!\n</p><p>From: \"Sydney Kirsch\" &lt;hugsrfun@yahoo.com&gt;\n</p><p>To: ChrisChanSonichu@aol.com\n</p><p>Hi Chris,\n</p><p>It's Sydney here!

Those long flights, plus hugely boring stayovers in LAX meant that I got to see lots of jets, inside and out, haha.\n</p><p>When I graduated high school, I applied to be a pilot in the National Guard, but I was told that since I d spent so long in Australia I might be a security risk, plus I have asthma, so I was denied entry. :( Serious, that was the worst day of my life, I cried for weeks.\n</p><p>After that, I basically went back to Australia for a while, because my dad got a job there, but six months later his work moved him to VA... And here I am! Hehe. Because I got moved around so much, I barely got to be really close friends with anyone or really stay at any one place for long, which is a real bummer, lol.\n</p><p>Anywho. It s okay if you don t wanna discuss your past relationships, to be honest, I d rather keep mine to myself too at this point. I m not interested in what happened in the past. Thanks for the offer of your cell phone- I will consider giving you a call once we know each other better. :) Just don t laugh at my accent!\n</p><p>Anyway, wow.
