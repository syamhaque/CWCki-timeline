I'm\n<p>evolving. I'm developing. I'm growing.\nI'm upgrading. I'm\nupdating. I am\nmultitasking. And you know what? In all\nthat, that's just prime.\n[Music]\nHey, what's up everybody on YouTube?\nJesus Christi Prime here once again and\ntoday we are recording yet another\nversion of my Cyberronian self\ncounterpart combiner mode autobot\nChristian Prime. So here we are and\nthere she is and first and foremost as\nalways we'll take a quick look at the\npackaging. So right up front we got a\nlovely little bit artwork of Christian\nPrime in their combined mode\nvehicle\nclass\ncombin artwork of her and her combiner\nboat if you know just she has a sword\nand shields going around the front of\nthe box and uh Got the uh got the little\nlasers though. I will go ahead and just\nstate this as well. And you guys see on\nthe back of the box at the moment I\nsuppose the original figure. This figure\ndoes not come with the uh guns that go\non the shoulder with the wings. No. No.\nYeah. Oh well. Anyway, here you go.\nChris Chad Prime and Cyber Tronia. And\non this side of the box, you got half of\nthe lovely uh art there. Lovely poster\nart. There is the top. There is all the\nthere is the bike with the worst things\ncode stuff and on the back of the box\nyou have your old blade tri this that\nthere can become a\naratron and there's a short civil bio if\nyou want to read that but this will also\nbe a quick flight and that's basically\nit\nfor the\npackaging and moving right along here we\nhave champ Prime in her in her car mode\nand just Yeah, it's uh well, she can go\nfrom being her original self to uh\noriginal form itself to being in a\ncombiner form. It's like a thing. It's\nlike you're shifting your physical form\nas opposed to just having the additional\na combination cognitive, which uh she\ndoes. She just changes what form form to\nanother almost as quickly as scanning an\nal scanning another vehicle mode except\nuh the cabin mode form is actually\nalready put in her because she had done\nthis before. H. So yeah, it's just that\neasy uh copy paste back to and then\nrevert back to earlier form than\nwhatever you choose to. Anyway, let's\nget a closer look at the details. So we\ngot lots of pink and blue all over the\nplace, even on the headlights, the\nfender, and of course the hood. All by\nsimple front center right there on the\nhood. And uh yep, there's the side of\nthe vehicle. Lots more pinks and blues.\nI mean, yeah, you probably should not be\nso shocked by now. But on the back of\nthe car, you got your soap. probably a\nsilver and the upper right there. But\nyeah, there is the top. There is a\nbottom and she does well as Roy Jay for\nlovely bullying Christian prime things\nand good unique one of a kind items and\nindividuals like and now\nfor I said we'll get to the group shot\nin a little while but let's start with\nuh Optimus Prime. Yes, the\noptimist. Getting a good little prime\nstar here\nwith hot\nrod and bringing them in as well for\nthis before we get to the trail. Here,\nhere she is with the\nsonu going on right\nthere. And there you go. She's\nessentially beside herself with her\norigin form in the back. Her buzzing\nform in the middle and then yes her\ncombiner form self right there closest\nto the\ncamera and just because but here you go\nCCA2 right there in the middle and her\nmicroscope\nform with Mr. Long going on right\nthere. And here she is\nsituina silver prowler armadum and even\njetness guitar mode rolling on out to\nanother\nadventure. And here she is in the group\nshop with the combiner team wave roll\nout fire shot and chapper.\nAnd here she is with the uh first\ncrackctor punlab and\nsiv. And here she is with the deceptic\nclones crackctor punlab and\nsiv. And because we ought to with the\nrecent one. So here she is with kabider\nmode at\nSelena when the bike big is bigger than\nthe car. And of course, yes, the mold\nbait comparison. Uh, we're just gonna\npretty much bring in the same guy from\nearlier, combine wars, street wise. So,\nthere you\ngo. And for being a lot class, you still\nget a lovely little bunch of accessories\nwith it. So, we'll run through these uh\none at a time. So, of course, being the\ncombined mode, she gets the combiner\nmode hand right here. I mean, you see\nwhat it is just like, you know, the\nfingers go in and out and the thumbs on\neither end. So, you can make it\na left hand or a right hand either way.\nSo, you got that. And uh instead of her\nlovely little wing guns, they they just\nhigh two little blasters here.\nYou little blasters just you know the\nblue plastic the bowling all\naround. No wor okay but here you go.\nHere's a good little payoff. So she gets\nher blue shield right here which uh you\nknow it's similar to her title thing but\njust you can rotate\nthat. It pulls out and it can also\nbecome an\naxe. We got that. And we get the sword.\nThis lovely\nsword. If I remember correctly, we also\ngot this with the Sonu as well, but it's\nnice to get this back. But we I'll show\nyou a fun thing when we uh get to robot\nmode that you can do with this. But as\nfor storage mode, just um h I don't know\nif we can get the I don't know if we get\nthe sword and shield on it, but I know\nwe got the five parts on either side,\nthe one on the top of the car and this\none back here. So, we're going to go for\nit. So, at least we can make like the\nwings and the uh little blasters will go\ninto the sides of the car like\nso. And uh yep, just drawing this out\nhere as well. could make this into a\nbooster rocket and she can go fishing\nfaster.\nFish fish. Yeah. Fishing all around.\nYes. Anyway, so let's just I think I'll\nleave that back there. I feel like\nthat's okay. But of course, if you\nwanted to, this can go on top of the car\nand be on one hand a zoom and blaster or\na booster for the top depending on what\nyou want to do. depending on what you\nwant to do with\nit. And then uh yes, well, you have a\noption or two regards to the uh shield\nhere. You\ncould Okay. Well, that's not going to\nwork. Well, you can still plug it into\nthe thing back here. So, that's not\ngoing to be the most elegant, but there\nyou go. You can do that. Add a sword. Um\num just plug it in the other one. There\nyou go. It's not the best looking thing,\nbut there you go. It's a bit of junk in\nthe booster\ntruck. Oh.\nWell, actually, you know\nwhat? There you go. That's a bit of a\ngood looking thing right there. It's\nlike\na type of\nmoment. Little mini a little mini pace\nshe's towing there. So, that's a thing\nif you want to do it.\nSo, that's basically it for the big\nboats. Let's get to chimish, shall we?\nYes. Okay. Don't get off. Don't fall off\nthe table there. As if we could. All\nright. So, anyway, we're going to go\ninto combine mode first. And um well,\nyou may leave these on if you want to,\nbut I think obviously we want to if you\njust if you're just going to robot mode,\nyou could leave those guns on like\nwould. All right. Right.\nBut we're going to goodbye mode. So it's\nbetter to have the guns not on.\nSo leg mode. This goes down and all this\ngoes\ndown. Not\nsimp kick\nit. Kick it to the boot and all\nthat. H. Okay. Well, anyway, so arm\nmode. I believe you know how this goes\nif you watch the if you don't pop a\nwheel off if you watch the un slab\nseptic plum video. So you take this with\nyou you pull these up like that and\nlet's uh point them down and be mindful\nof those uh knee things again and\ngetting them all the way down there. Get\nthe knees up there. Super knees. Get\nthem and close the knees up.\nPull the arms out like that. And uh\ntabs. No\ntabs. Go into the slots right\nthere. Uh rotate the combiner peg. And\nuh rotate the waist. And there you go.\nAnd uh I believe this should be pretty\nobvious, but I am going to make it more\nclear in this very\nmoment. Oh, I forgot the important\ndetail. How do I keep forgetting this?\nThis down here so you can make that\nconnection. There you\ngo. Right\nhand. Piece it\ntogether. Divine right hand.\nOkay. Just hang. Anyway, she's nar. You\ndefinitely have to hand it to her. Okay.\nNow, robot mode. Let's uh do that.\nCombiner peg goes down. And this rotates\nhere. That's the front of the leg. We\nmay split the legs. Pull the arms out.\nAnd uh get your fingernail. Pull the\nhands out. Those lovely little pink\nhands. Pull that down. Pull arm the\nelbow. And pull all this up. Make sure\nthat's all there. and all\n[Music]\nthis. I'm going to edit that sound\nout\nanyway. Get all that out slots,\ntaps right\nthere and all\nthat. Then I do believe that's uh\nbasically it. So there you go. There you\nhave combiner mode. Christian Prime in\nher robot mode. And she looked quite\ndecent in this form. I mean, just uh\npretty much the lovely little pink car\nright there and on par with her original\nof her present form and everything, but\nshe anyway. Let's get closer here. Look\nat the details. Not on the belly. Let's\nuh raise up. Look at the head. All\nright. Don't try on the head. Anyway, so\nOh, perfect. Yes. So, we got lovely\ndetails in the head and yes, still has\nchromia. Still has heterocchromia. The\nright eye is green. The left eye is\nblue. All black symbol front and center.\nLots of pinks and battery charged blues\nall around all over. And some of the\nlovely details. And uh yep. Going up the\nback. Just pretty much. Yep. This time\nyou got the the car on the backpack but\njust uh not similar. But\nanyway,\nyes, our articulation dies. What we got?\nI'm going to tell you. So, this head is\non a ball joint. You definitely got your\nwiggly waggly wiggly right here. Um,\npick up a tiny bit. Look down a little\nbit. Head can rotate. Do a full\n360. Arms can rotate. Do a full 360.\nThey can move in and out and downward if\nyou use that transformation joint. Uh\nyou got bicep rotation\narms over 90° of bend at the elbow. Uh\nnothing at the hands. They can move\ninward and outward if you want them to.\nWaist rotation. Legs can move forward\nthat far.\nBack that far\noutward almost to the full splits. You\nhave thigh\nrotation a little bit over 90 degrees\nopen bend there at the knee and\nunfortunately nothing at the feet. So\nyeah, but yeah, let's uh run through her\naccessories\nuh one more time. So yes, uh the little\nguns, she can hold those in her hands\nand shoot bang like that. But yep, we'll\nwe'll keep it on par with the form as it\nshould be. Yeah, I wish they actually\ninclude the uh likely the wings for\nthis. That would have worked a bit more\naccurately and good, but we'll roll with\nthis. This is good. This works. And um\nyep, of course, you can use this as a uh\ngun. She can hold\nthat and go bang by thush rush brush and\nall that. And of course, I forgot to\nmention\nhere, pull that out. Put your prime\nmaster target master in there. And oh\nyeah, these pop in the hand that could\nbe used like a little gun or something.\nJust There you\ngo. You got the option. Options. They're\ngood. The options are good. All right.\nBut anyway, um not much storage room\nthere, but yep, she can hold her sword\nand shield like so.\nYes. All right. So, yeah. stuff. But\nessentially with this, yes, you can uh\nhack slash that hack bash bash hack hack\nbash bash or Yeah, there you go.\nJust a whole bunch of slashing,\nslashing, thrashing d. Yeah, there you\ngo. So, you got the options and the\noptions, they're\ngood. Also, regards to the uh sword and\nshield, there is one other thing you do.\nThis is mainly meant when you go into\ncombine mode and she is an R, but you\ncan essentially put the sword into the\ntop of the uh at mode portion of like\nthat. And there you\ngo. A really big blade of all glorious\ngoodness. All right. All right. Well,\nanyway, aside from that, I mean, as\nopposed to the, uh, original guns on her\nshoulders. Uh, these are, well, not as\ngreat, but a bit better because they are\nBlush compatible. Yes, that's right. So,\nuh, you know what? So, we could do this.\nI'm going just, uh, do this. You know\nwhat? Let's, uh, have a little, let's\nsee if we can have a little fun right\nhere. I'm going to do this. There she'll\nput this back up in a I will put those\nback up in a moment. So, yes, we're\ngonna do this. We're gonna have a fun\ngood moment right here. I'm gonna get I\nhave her\nuh I have her body here.\nYep. So, let's uh do this. She can hold\nthe uh lovely little matrix as best she\ncan with these hands.\nholding her matrix and not only liking\nyour darkest hour, but there's a big old\nmatrix blowing Chris Chad\nprivate earth shaking bloo.\nYes. And now for co\nparadise. Here she is with the octopus\nprime. Yep.\nwith hot\nrod. Boy, could we get any more\ncentering on this? There we\ngo.\nWith su.\nAnd here you have essentially a holy\ntrinity of Christian primes between her\nclassic\nCC38 her more modern present self and of\ncourse her combined mode form. Yeah,\nit's like a holy trinity going on here.\nI mean you just how could you deny this?\nAnd just I mean times\nthree they are just\nprime.\nYes. And here she is in a dynamic group\nshot with Sonu Silver Armorat Jet\nProwler Selena and Bumba\nLumba. And here she is in a lovely\ndramatic pose and set with the combiner\nbots wave chapper farot and roll\nout. Here she is with the first tractor\npunlab and\nsavv. Here she is with the deceptic\nclones savv punislav and\ncoractor. and a spliced in comparison I\ndidn't think about doing or remembering\nuntil after I was editing the video.\nThere she is with Mr. Terrone. So enjoy\na little grass in this scene as well.\nLol\nwith combiner mode at\nSelena and of course the special guest\nstar the bold bait. So here she is with\nKabider Wars Street wise.\nSo there you\ngo. And here you have Kabider mode\nPrime. And you know what? I'd say this\nis considerably a budget friendly\nversion compared to the other two. But\nI'd say you know what for what for what\nit's worth lacking the init the other\nthe accessories that the other two have\njust yes I feel like this is a decent\nfigure. Plus, it can bless it can\ncombine as an arm or a leg to actually\nland a massive aid in guards to support\nfor her fellow Autobots. But yeah, still\nat least the joints are good. The colors\nare great. I mean, obviously pinks and\nblues, but hey, there you go. Wait for\nChris Chan Prime. Anyway, hey, so good\nstuff. Just lots of good stuff. I can\nprice this vehicle. I can price this\nform quite a bit. Obviously, her her her\nactual form as opposed to her combiner\nform that she more often uses is is\nbetter, but you know what? For a budget\nfriendly consciousness, I'd say this is\na fairly decent way to go. Now, there\nyou go. So, I got this from my local\nTarget. You can get the they're popping\nup in your Targets, your Walmarts, Big\nBad Toy Store, Entertainment Earth,\nAmazon, all that. All right. Yeah. And\ndon't forget to check me out on my\nsocials with Blue Sky and of course the\nquick like links to all those at the\nEtsy store are link in the description\ndown below. And I feel like that's\npretty much it. So, yep. This is\nTransformers Legacy\nDieiver Chad Prime and this is Jesus\nChrist Chad's Pride. Say remember you\ndon't stop playing because you grow. You\ngrow up because you stop playing. And\nyou still you know what I'm going to\nsay? I'm going to do it because it's\ngood. That's just prime. Be it be\nproud. 15 minutes\nlater. Okay,\nElena, that should be all the fun\nexplosive sets. And if my timing is\nright, Far should be getting ready to\nmake that explosive right about\nover\nthere. Did you guys hear that? Hey, that\ncould have been anything. Cracktor.\nAnything? That sounded like an explosion\nfrom a distance. Maybe there's somebody\nnearby. Well, that's possible, Posh\nLady. But thank you Goget here. We're\nnear an active volcano, so could be an\nexplosion from the magma. There it is.\nIt wasn't my fault this time. I did not\nstop the ground or\nanything.\nReally?\nMr. on the radar. We got something\nactive going on. We just heard the\nexplosion from a few miles away to the\nwest, but then also radar's picking up\nenergy signals coming in from the\nnortheast. I wonder what that could be.\nBetter not be\ndamned to go by them. Alert. Alert.\nLarge gray space shuttle coming in from\nthe northeast. Gray space shuttle. No,\nit can't be.\nGuardians. Hey, no doubt some autobots,\ntoo. Did the radar show how fast that\nspacecraft is coming in? Pretty damn\nfast. I'll be here in seconds. Blast it.\nBlast it. See all parameters. Some\nDecepticons go west. A bunch of\nDecepticons go to the northeast. Crafter\nget ready to fake your move. You're\ngoing to for a crafter D and help take\ndown these guardians in autobot. Right.\nYes, ma'am. Come on, Seth. We got a lot\nof box to bust. Right you are, crafter.\nI got my big under. Let's go get a\ncouple of our Decepticons and make our\nway out of here to where that shuttle\nis. Right. We'll go to source and take\nthem all down for good. Crafters, put us\nlast SAVs. Follow my\nlead and follow by big gun.\nAnd just when things are going so well,\nfirst mention of any primary be optimist\nor Christian or even freaking hot rod.\nYou tell me. Tell the others to tell me\nat the first instance possible. Right.\nYes, ma'am. Small blue UFO identified\nheading towards the center of the area\nnear the volcano. Various Autobots and\nGuardians heading out from the gray\nspace shuttle. And a few Autobots are\ncoming in from the west. Prime energy\ndetected. I thought so. Well, then now's\nthe time as any for me to go out and go\nstop and crash some box and\ngar. Damn right, boss lady. Damn right.\nMeanwhile, I think I got their attention\npretty good, Chris. Yes, you did. Fire\nshot. I believe that will do. With those\nDecepticons out of the cave, we will be\nable to explode the explosives and make\nthe John the B useless. They're not\ngoing to be able to mine any more John\nfrom here after that, but also making\nsure this this volcano is safe. In this\ncase, it'll become dormant. But still,\nwhat a\nmess. Chris. Chris, I come with the good\nnews. All right. Yes, Pathfinder.\nPerfect timing. We just got the\nDecepticons out of the mountain. We'll\nbe able to dispect itself the explosives\nshortly and be get the air John safe.\nThat will be Yes. Leader White has\nactually been able to confirm that we\nhave made success. And the team want to\nwait here for the command center.\nExcellent. Pathfinder.
