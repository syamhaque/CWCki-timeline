The letters were answered without too much incident. Chris even managed to talk about Asperchu without going into a <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_anger\" title=\"Chris and anger\">nuclear tard rage</a>. <a href=\"/cwcki/Evan\" title=\"Evan\">Evan</a> contacted Chris again about his blatant <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_hypocrisy\" title=\"Chris and hypocrisy\">hypocrisy</a>, but Chris brushed his comments aside. The Mike Jackson saga continued, with Chris's inability to produce a simple video resulting in a young man's life being ruined.
