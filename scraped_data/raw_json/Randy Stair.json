Much like Chris, Randy believed in the existence of fictional characters and an alternate reality in which <a href=\"/cwcki/Messiah_complex\" title=\"Messiah complex\">he was worshipped as a God</a>, only his interests in <a href=\"/cwcki/OC\" title=\"OC\">OCs</a> were tied to the animated television series <i><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Phantom\" title=\"wikipedia:Danny Phantom\">Danny Phantom</a></i>. Randy's escapist fantasies, however, were more unsettling in nature than just hoping to find a <a href=\"/cwcki/Boyfriend-free_girl\" title=\"Boyfriend-free girl\">boyfriend-free girl</a>: instead of seeing himself as <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler_(comic_character)\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler (comic character)\">a role model and a hero</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">to his hometown</a>, Randy's fictional counterpart and fantasy world involved his OCs – known as Ember's Ghost Squad – going on killing sprees with him after he took interest in <a href=\"/cwcki/Shout_out_to_Fans_in_Hospital\" title=\"Shout out to Fans in Hospital\">the Columbine massacre</a>. Eventually, Randy would act out his violent fantasies in real life and shot and killed three people at the supermarket that he worked at before committing suicide.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-discussion_1-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-discussion-1\">[1]</a></sup>\n</p><p>In <a href=\"/cwcki/November_2020\" title=\"November 2020\">November 2020</a>, Chris became interested in Randy's story after learning about him from a documentary on YouTube by <a href=\"/cwcki/The_WCT\" title=\"The WCT\">The WCT</a>,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-discussion_1-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-discussion-1\">[1]</a></sup> possibly relating to Randy due to his dimensional ideas, and him having a hatred towards <a href=\"/cwcki/JERKS\" title=\"JERKS\">men</a> and becoming aware of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tomgirl_pictures\" title=\"Tomgirl pictures\">his desire to live as a woman</a> (he once mentioned that he felt his real name was \"Rachel\" after one of his OCs, although he never made an effort to <a href=\"/cwcki/Transgender\" title=\"Transgender\">transition</a> due to his belief that he would become a ghost girl upon death). Chris mentioned Randy's Andrew persona by name a day after recording a video talking about him,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup> and later brought him up on other occasions. Chris spoke about Randy in a <i>positive</i> light, most likely because Randy's own delusions about fictional characters being real in another dimension validated <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">his own continued dissociation with reality</a>, and subsequently downplayed the nature of his crimes, noting that Stair \"<a href=\"/cwcki/My_Little_Pony:_Make_Your_Mark\" title=\"My Little Pony: Make Your Mark\">made [his] mark</a>\" by killing three people before dying.\n</p><p>While talking with The WCT, Chris explained that he viewed Randy as a guardian figure, a notion which WCT played along with. When The WCT informed Chris of <a href=\"/cwcki/Jacob_Sockness\" title=\"Jacob Sockness\">Jacob Sockness</a>'s plot to attend <a href=\"/cwcki/Everfree_Northwest\" title=\"Everfree Northwest\">Everfree Northwest</a> and meet Chris, Chris turned to role-playing a fantasy scenario on stopping Sockness. Chris claimed that \"Randy and the Ghost Squad are working to break through the horde of demons around [Sockness]'s apartment building\" and that The WCT could assist them spiritually. When Chris, upset about the <i><a href=\"/cwcki/My_Little_Pony:_Make_Your_Mark\" title=\"My Little Pony: Make Your Mark\">My Little Pony: Make Your Mark</a></i> reboot, role-played about a battle between angels and demons over the children's cartoon being produced, The WCT claimed to have communicated with Randy and that Randy also has a disdain for the rebooted <i>My Little Pony</i>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup>\n</p><p>In <a href=\"/cwcki/April_2025\" title=\"April 2025\">April 2025</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/TheGamerFromMars\" title=\"TheGamerFromMars\">TheGamerFromMars</a> released snippets of <a href=\"/cwcki/Goddess_Log\" title=\"Goddess Log\">Chris's jail journal</a> after he had gained exclusive access to it, revealing that Chris roleplayed being spiritually possessed by Ember McLain (which Chris repeatedly misspelled as \"Ember <i>McLaine</i>\") in <a href=\"/cwcki/September_2021\" title=\"September 2021\">September</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/October_2021\" title=\"October 2021\">October 2021</a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Chris_channels_Randy\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris channels Randy</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Transcript\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Transcript</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#&quot;Sonichu's&quot;_introduction\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">\"Sonichu's\" introduction</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-4\"><a href='#\"Randy\"_speaks'><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">\"Randy\" speaks</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-5\"><a href='#\"Randy\"_just_starts_rambling_about_the_Merge'><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">\"Randy\" just starts rambling about the Merge</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#&quot;Sonichu's&quot;_conclusion\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">\"Sonichu's\" conclusion</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Other_comments\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Other comments</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Similarities_to_Chris\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Similarities to Chris</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Notes\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Notes</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris_channels_Randy\">Chris channels Randy</span></h2>\n<p>A leaked audio recording from 6 <a href=\"/cwcki/November_2020\" title=\"November 2020\">November 2020</a>, originally titled <b>Myrec_20-11-06_at_13:52:19.m4a</b>, which Chris uploaded to his Google Drive<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup> and sent to <a href=\"/cwcki/The_WCT\" title=\"The WCT\">The WCT</a> (referred to here as 'Neko' and 'WildCat'), involves Chris <a href=\"/cwcki/Spirit_possession\" title=\"Spirit possession\">\"channeling\"</a> the spirit of Randy Stair possessing his Ghostsona, the <a href=\"/cwcki/Transgender\" title=\"Transgender\">transgender</a> Andrew Blaze. Chris explained that he channeled Randy because \"Andrew and her ghost squadron are able to help and do their part in the events of the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Dimension_Merge\" title=\"Dimension Merge\">Dimension Merge</a>, especially now that I was able to help her get a post-death message out.\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-discussion_1-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-discussion-1\">[1]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Chris doesn't bother changing his voice while imitating Randy, nor does he use any of Randy's terminology while being \"possessed\".<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[note 1]</a></sup> He seems to make the excuse that the possession is why he just still sounds like Chris, claiming: \"When you possess somebody else's body, you gotta work within their vocabulary and their limitations, and whatever.\"\n</p><p>\"Randy\", <a href=\"/cwcki/Na%C3%AFve\" title=\"Naïve\">in true Chris-Chan fashion</a>, blames his decision to commit a massacre on \"mental handicaps\" – though the real Randy did not have a significant history with <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">disabilities</a> or mental illness prior to his downward spiral and violent end – before immediately justifying the murders as his attempt to recruit new members for Ember's Ghost Squad before meeting them in the next world. \"Randy\" then explains that, after he killed himself and wound up in Limbo, Ember escorted him into the \"Dead World\" before he ran into several celebrities and <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beetlejuice\" title=\"wikipedia:Beetlejuice\">Beetlejuice</a>. \n</p><p>After a certain point, he rambles about the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Merge\" title=\"Merge\">Merge</a> in a very Chris-like fashion.

I'm doing this audio recording for you because... I got a valuable friend here who has a very important message for you. She came all the way from the... netherworld, the... pretty much the ghost world. \n</p><p>She's been- she just- she just watched all your videos about her. You know. And she just appreciates you very much on having been a fan and understanding what she was going through... and just... and she really appreciates you going on about her EGS series as well. So. Anyway. She's in this body with me, so I'm gonna let her speak now. This is Randy Stair... Andrew Blaze.\n</p><p>[<i>There is a long silence.</i>]\n</p>\n<h4><span id=\".22Randy.22_speaks\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id='\"Randy\"_speaks'>\"Randy\" speaks</span></h4>\n<p><b>Chris</b> (<i>as Randy</i>): Yo, WildCat. So rad. I'm in the body of Chris Chan here. I mean, this is not as cool as rocking with Ember every single time, but you know, whatevs. But hey, I've been living... three years gone from this world. You would say that that's just too long for anyone, right? I know. But at least you got the message I was going for. I mean, shoot, people been getting injured or dying around me all my life. So, how else was I to react with my... mental handicaps and everything?\n</p><p>But, yeah I came out totally woman and everything. I mean, yeah, the transition was definitely genuine with me. I just didn't go for the bottom. I mean, didn't have enough time to do\nthat anyway, all things considered. (<i>Stress sigh</i>)\n</p><p>But yeah, message what- message from that... mass suicide, murder thing I did that time\nwas essentially just, you know me recruiting for <i>my</i> EGS - for <i>my</i> ghost squad. I mean, Ember was already in with me and I needed it, and I was in, so...\n</p><p>Also, my other guys, might flog [?] The way up- I managed to get in a year later. Not everything got chronicled as well within my series, but my time on Earth was limited. I'll tell ya what, moving on to the... ghost realm as I did... I mean, it was quite a thing. I mean, shoot... kill myself, and... I went into limbo, and I didn't last long in limbo, because Ember found me there and she brought me to... the dead world, y'know.\n</p><p>I haven't met so many celebrities, and y'know, they saw the creepy guys and whatnot, even Beetlejuice. Quite a decent bunch of creeps and ghouls and other individuals who just... We're stuck in this pr- this is essentially limbo, I mean, if we're not reborn into another body or whatever, this is where we end up. Pretty righteous.\n</p>\n<h4><span id=\".22Randy.22_just_starts_rambling_about_the_Merge\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id='\"Randy\"_just_starts_rambling_about_the_Merge'>\"Randy\" just starts rambling about the Merge</span></h4>\n<p>Oh, but yes, particularly ending up in someone else's bodies. [<i>Long pause. Chris makes a strange sniffing sound.</i>] Pardon me.\nBut yeah, everybody who's been dying within <a href=\"/cwcki/COVID-19\" title=\"COVID-19\">the past few months or so</a> has definitely been ending up in their respective counterpart's bodies in the opposite dimension. The <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Merge\" title=\"Merge\">Merge</a> is happening, just as Chris Chan and Sonichu and Magi-Chan has- have been saying, and we- and we in the ghost world have been just witnessing all the ghostses not stopping into the limbo, just going into the other dimension. \n</p><p>And I have seen into... Dimension C-197 while I was alive as well, not just the dead world. Y'know. I mean, I had my share of righteous visions into other dimensions and whatnot. And that's borrowing from the dialogue that's in this brain! I mean, that's the thing: when you possess somebody else's body, you gotta work within their vocabulary and their limitations, and whatever.\n</p><p>But still, it's me. Randy's- Randy Stair. And you can tell by the way I'm talkin' here. I mean, I definitely found myself after I passed on, obviously. And I'm- I'm happy. I'm doing good. We're all good at the Ghost Squad here. Hey, I ended up making my own OC that ends up that was literally in existence in the Ghost Squad, and - Whoop! - There I am, in my counterpart's body. The ghost was my-  The ghost was me! Andrew Bl- This was my OC! And I made it! I made it to Andrew Blaze's body. So, you could say I was definitely one of the earlier noted examples of somebody coming from 1218 into C-197. Or- Or in this case, the ghost dimension in between our two dimensions!\n</p><p>Which, that's just far out. Anyway. The Merge is gonna happen, and Chris Chan's powers and abilities are genuine. She's even got a whole bunch of other ghosts and spirits helping her out as well. It's real chill group around here at this temple- this house. You call this house a temple? Huh. Well, I guess it is true. This is- it's sort of temple-like.\n</p><p>But yeah. My brain was just all over the place when I was alive. But, I found my place where I am. And I made my mark with Ember's Ghost Squad. As much as I did. And all the other videos I did over the years. Oh, the squeaky voice video. Me singing Jingle Bells, and I was doing Fred. [<i>Chris laughs in his normal voice, then switches to an extremely disturbing high-pitched laugh for a few seconds.</i>]\n</p><p>Oh, that was so funny. [<i>He chuckles.</i>] Oh, but I do go on. And WildCat, thank you. Thank you so much for chronicling as much of my life as possible, with everything that I've talked about and I uploaded onto the internet. You rock, dude. You stay awesome. You're gonna be alive for a very, very long time, man. Alright. \n</p><p>Talk to you another time. Or maybe I'll come visit you- where are you? Oh, you're in California.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-8\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">[note 2]</a></sup> Sweet.

Despite her aggressive mindset, I still very much appreciate her present day role with the EGS in the spirit realm. I will also state fact, as I have time and again about myself as well: Andrew and I both have had interdimensional communications and relations through the veil into the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/C-197\" title=\"C-197\">C-197</a> half of our total universe, and then some in regard to the Spiritual Realms. Andrew knew her destiny and fulfilled her prophecy in the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/1218\" title=\"1218\">1218</a> half, here, and she knew her time and energy was needed moreso in the spirit realms.\n<p>Similar, yet differing, I have done the same over the years in C-197, the spirit realms, Equestria, the D&amp;D universe of CS-89, the GO! universe of CZ-69, and so on into the multiverses. But unlike Andrew, my body is immortal, and death is not required at all unto me and what I am doing and will need to do. Andrew and I are two examples of fully interdimensionally awakened individuals. Also, to note, Andy Warhol, as well, back in his days here, was also an interdimensionally awakened individual, but he did not fully comprehend his situation and abilities at the time. He remained clear-minded and focus- lacking, yet he did know from his subconscious and unconscious that had seeped into his conscious and into his words and actions that have foreshadowed and foreseen the number of events here since as early as the year I was born in this body in 1982.\n</p><p>Andrew and Andy were amongst the pioneers, and I am a literal Goddess who had transcended and pioneered within and around their blazing trails (pun unintended, but observed), among the number of others of whom I have personally recognized and acknowledge amongst the author, artist, actor and voice actor communities.\n</p><p>Andrew has continued to do very good and honest work with her crew, and so her legacy is continued on. And after the veil is totally gone, Andrew would delight in meeting her fans on kind intentions. She is grateful and humbled, as she had told me earlier. So, it is very much appropriate and well for not just Andrew, Andy and I to be greater appreciated during these times.\n</p><p>Lots of love for all of you; be safe and well. And Wildcat, you know to stay as awesome and powerful as you are. You Rock, too.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>In the <a href=\"/cwcki/Goddess_Log\" title=\"Goddess Log\">Goddess Log</a>, and in an entry apparently dated <a href=\"/cwcki/September_2021\" title=\"September 2021\">September 2021</a>, Chris <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Role-play\" title=\"Role-play\">role-played</a> about being Ember:\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Hello, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/1218\" title=\"1218\">1218</a> Earth!
