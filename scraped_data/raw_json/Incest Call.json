The call was partially recorded by Bella, who compiled together \"random clips\" from the conversation.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-BellaReaction_1-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-BellaReaction-1\">[1]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Other subjects discussed in the call include <a href=\"/cwcki/Everfree_Northwest\" title=\"Everfree Northwest\">Everfree Northwest</a> convention plans and the consideration of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Fiona\" title=\"Fiona\">Fiona</a> as a potential girlfriend in lieu of Chris's mother (a notion which Chris rejects).\n</p><p>Bella has claimed the full call lasted around four hours and that the bulk of conversation was a \"long and actually very pleasant talk\", but the full conversation was not recorded. She said she \"didn't start recording until AFTER he showed [...] the vibrators and \"organic lube foam\" he was using on his mom\".<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup>\n</p><p>According to Bella, Chris talked in detail about kinky sexual acts on his mother - such as usage of vibrators, candle wax, and nipple clips - but that this alleged talk was not saved due to her iPad cutting off the recording.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-BellaReaction_1-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-BellaReaction-1\">[1]</a></sup> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Fabricated_BDSM_texts\" title=\"Fabricated BDSM texts\">Given Bella's extremely unreliable nature</a>, such claims should be taken with a massive amount of salt.\n</p><p>The Call, along with the <a href=\"/cwcki/Incest_Texts\" title=\"Incest Texts\">Incest Texts</a>, led to Chris being jailed on an incest charge for nearly two years, until the <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism_disorder_deferred_disposition\" title=\"Autism disorder deferred disposition\">autism disorder deferred disposition</a> caused the court to dismiss the charge in exchange for Chris completing the program's terms.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Background\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Background</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Longest_Version\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Longest Version</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Transcript\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Transcript</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Background\">Background</span></h2>\n<p>Prior to the call, Chris had been sustaining a misleading cover story to multiple trusted individuals, including Bella, that his sex partner was simply an older woman. In a display of <a href=\"/cwcki/Honest_Content\" title=\"Honest Content\">Honest Content</a>, Chris decided to reveal the truth to Bella. In a text message to Bella before the call, Chris strongly implied that his cover story was concealing an illegal act and recommended the encrypted text/video call app Signal.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup> During the call, as Chris began speaking about how he'd been having sex with his mother, Bella secretly began to record the conversation using her iPad.

Fiona in turn shared the news with her friends in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_Chan_Conservation_Collective\" title=\"Chris Chan Conservation Collective\">Chris Chan Conservation Collective</a> and gave them an edited version of the call as proof, in which she edited out Bella's side of the conversation.\n</p><p>Audio from the call was then publicly leaked multiple times with varying amounts of censorship or cuts in the audio.\n</p>\n<ul><li>The first was leaked to YouTube on 29 July 2021 by Chris Chan Conservation Collective member EllDudeRocks / GunLoader420,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup> who then created a thread at <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/R/ChrisChanSonichu\" title=\"R/ChrisChanSonichu\">r/ChrisChanSonichu</a> about it, dated 30 July 2021 at 12:23 AM EST.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]</a></sup> This had a runtime of about 4 minutes and consisted only of Chris's voice.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-7\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">[7]</a></sup></li></ul>\n<ul><li>A few hours later, another cut with Bella's voice retained was leaked.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>On 31 July, Bella's friend ternarymercury leaked a longer cut.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-8\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">[8]</a></sup></li></ul>\n<ul><li>On 3 August, the longest version to date was leaked, measuring 21 minutes.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Longest_Version\">Longest Version</span></h2>\n<p>This is the longest available version of the call.\n</p><p><br/>\n</p>\n<table style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa; background-color: #f9f9f9; color: black; margin: .5em auto .5em auto; padding: 0.2em; font-size:89%; width:260px;-moz-border-radius:10px\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#3366CC\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size:110%; color:#ffffff;-moz-border-radius:10px\"><b>The Incest Call</b><br/>\n</td></tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<td colspan=\"2\"><div class=\"thumb embedvideo autoResize\" style=\"width: 328px;\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo autoResize\" style=\"\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideowrap youtube\" style=\"width: 320px\"><div class=\"embedvideo-consent\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo-consent__overlay\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo-consent__message\">Click to load content</div><!--\n--></div><!--\n--></div><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" data-src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E1pNvrqpx04\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"180\" loading=\"lazy\" modestbranding=\"1\" width=\"320\"></iframe></div><!--\n--></div><!--\n--></div>\n</td></tr>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#696969\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;-moz-border-radius:5px;color:#ffffff;\"><b>Direct link</b>\n</td>\n<td><a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=E1pNvrqpx04\" rel=\"nofollow\">YouTube</a>, <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/E1pNvrqpx04\" rel=\"nofollow\">archive</a>\n</td></tr>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#696969\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;-moz-border-radius:5px;color:#ffffff;\"><b>Stardate</b>\n</td>\n<td>27 July 2021 (leaked 3 <a href=\"/cwcki/August_2021\" title=\"August 2021\">August 2021</a>)\n</td></tr>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#696969\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;-moz-border-radius:5px;color:#ffffff;\"><b>Performance Style</b>\n</td>\n<td><span style=\"display:none\">Crazy</span><a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Crazy\"><img alt=\"Crazy\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"32\" src=\"/w/images/1/10/Crazy.png\" width=\"32\"/></a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">Crazy</a>, <span style=\"display:none\">Smug</span><a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Smug\"><img alt=\"Smug\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"32\" src=\"/w/images/e/e7/Smug.png\" width=\"32\"/></a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">Smug</a>\n</td></tr>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#696969\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;-moz-border-radius:5px;color:#ffffff;\"><b>Saga</b>\n</td>\n<td><span style=\"display:none\">Incest</span><a href=\"/cwcki/Affair_with_Mother\" title=\"Incest\"><img alt=\"Incest\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"32\" src=\"/w/images/2/2b/IncestSagaIcon.png\" width=\"32\"/></a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Affair_with_Mother\" title=\"Affair with Mother\">Incest</a>\n</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><br/>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Transcript\">Transcript</span></h3>\n<p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CHRIS</b></font>: ...We pro- we proceeded towards it more slowly.\n</p><p><b>BELLA</b>: \"Mhm.

But I had- I didn't have any idea that Barbara was, um, that Barbara and you had that sort of relationship. I never got any of those, uh, vibes.

What did she say?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CHRIS</b></font>: I don't, I don't remember exactly what she said, but it was kind of, I think, she was <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Rape\" title=\"Rape\">partially confused</a> at one point but, but then she came around, obviously, with the more approaching, with the more approaching that I was doing with her along the way.\n</p><p><b>BELLA</b>: Right, so she... so she got into it.

You know, they say there's no, there's no stronger bond than a mother and her daughter, that's true. I'm- I'm pretty close to my mom, I don't- I don't think I'd be <i>that</i> close, but... I do- I do in some ways project, you know, the kind of woman I'm interested in, with the kind of woman my mother is, and I didn't realize it until I got older. I was like, wow! She's- she's not- she kind of, y'know, similar- has similar qualities to my mother! And I think, 'Oh! Well, shoot!' Um, I'm very- I'm glad that you're telling me, because a lot of people would hold this inside, and it would tear them apart, you know, but then again, yeah your, your body is, um, your body now,  isn't it\nonly like a projection of your true form?

To keep up more with your energy? Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CHRIS</b></font>: Uh, yeah, obviously, but, y'know, obviously, if I could find some...\n</p><p><b>BELLA</b>: There's Fiona!

[<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CHRIS</b></font>: Yeah.] Because Fiona- Fiona talks to me, saying how great you are, and how much she loves you, right? Maybe 'cause the future can change, with fate?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CHRIS</b></font>: Um, it's a possibility, but it's- \n</p><p><b>BELLA</b>: Why don't you try for her? Because- y'know- 'cause [stammers] Fiona consented [?] to having an open relationship, right? I'm sure she's- you're fine, with, uh, both of them now. BUt, over time, Fiona really, really, really adores you. And she's a wonderful girl. I text her a lot, we chat. We, um- She has never said a single negative thing about you. She- She adores you, like, and- She'll be more open to stuff like, you know, having spa days, getting pizza, going out together, you know, and, she's um, she's probably newer in the bedroom, but she's willing to do it. She's willing to have fun with you.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CHRIS</b></font>: Yes, I agree. And I appreciate all that, yeah, I'm making the uh, short time, as a short time, count, as best as I can with her.\n</p><p><b>BELLA</b>: Oh, I understand.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CHRIS</b></font>: ...we're seen out and about [?] in the future, plus, I don't want to take her away from the colleges she chose to go to, which I'm sure, is still in Washington state right there.\n</p><p><b>BELLA</b>: Uh, how far away do you live- um, from Washington state?

And plus, she's young! She has a lot of time to, um, she has a lot of time to travel, visit you, I mean- You've done long distance before, haven't you? \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CHRIS</b></font>: Uh, yeah, a long-distance relationships, but- [<i>Bella coughs loudly</i>]\n</p><p><b>BELLA</b>: Oh, yeah, they suck. I know they suck, but what's important is that you make, uh, you make a relationship with her now, and that way, it'll stay, like, forever! And she'll come back to you, like she'll come back to you, I'm sure!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CHRIS</b></font>: Yes, it is a possibility, but I am more- I am more open.
