But I can share what someone close to Praetor told me about them after I got on their radar.\n<p>So my initial contact with them was when Christine sent me Caden's phone number and asked me to call him. I initially thought that he was going to tell me to fuck off, but he at the time at least entertained the idea of bringing 'us' (LAnon) on board. He pitched the idea of 'golden sonichu medallions' to me, which were basically regular Sonichu medallions with a code or something on them that would grant people access to a discord group to talk with Chris directly. He said that Christine \"was a very busy woman with everything going on, and that Praetor basically served to screen out trolls from legitimate business dealings so she could have time to focus on her tasks.\" I said that I would entertain their offer, and I would just need to take a headcount of who would be interested in one.\n</p><p>Now I particularly wanted Chris to follow and interact with the furry fandom and other folks as a whole because I wanted to see if they could have legitimate business dealings with people. The results of that are pretty obvious when he sent those messages out in bulk when they were only supposed to go to a couple of other lolcows.\n</p><p>At this point, I would have thought that Chris was on to me, if not for some really random message from someone else wondering what the hell was going on (quite a few people have approached me wondering how the hell I got Chris to do what I did). I explained who I was to them (a troll), and they said that they knew that, because the Praetor groups they were in were going apeshit over what I did, and they wanted to see for themselves. I asked them about Praetor, and they told me quite a few things about them and Chris, which I will simply list off:\n</p><p>-Praetor was the brainchild of Caden, and was initially just like the Teen Troon Squad before they had the idea to make a cult around Christine, and eventually even this devolved into them basically becoming a slightly less shitty version of the idea guys 2.0\n</p><p>-They work in a nasty basement painting Sonichu medallions to sell. Now people seem to think that they just give Chris the money. They don't, they basically hold it from him unless he does what they want\n</p><p>-The amount of money they make is apparently enough that Christine could have hired a private investigator to come after me, and this person contacted me after Chris threatened to call the cops on me\n</p><p>-My 'big plan' (Sending Chris to Florida) was apparently liked by Caden, to the point that he would pay for a ticket for Chris\n</p><p>-Chris claimed that Null was on Praetor's side, and was working with them to hunt me down (whether this is real or a delusion of Chris' is yet to be determined)\n</p><p>In Regards to Chris, there are some pretty shocking and disturbing revelations about him this person told me:\n</p><p>-The Sonichu roleplay is basically a thing 24/7, and includes characters such as Pickle Rick, Morty, and Yogi Bear\n</p><p>-Chris is getting nervous why the merge isn't happening, which is likely a motivation for why he was open to tazing himself\n</p><p>-Chris is still going after his high school galpals to the point that people close to him have had to contact them to change their Facebook profiles\n</p><p>-Despite his obsession with them, he has yet to attend a high school reunion because it's full of trolls\n</p><p>-He thinks that everyone is a troll to some degree\n</p><p>-Oh, and when he thinks he's talking to them, he drops the charade that he's Sonichu\n</p><p>-He developed an obsession with symbols and math, thinking that it will help to bring about the merge\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Leaking_DMs\">Leaking DMs</span></h2>\n<p>11 February 2021<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup>\n</p><p>In response to a user's comment, \"@Larry Vaughn, mind sharing some never-before-seen DMs between you, Chris, and possibly others (if you have any)? \":\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #edf2ce; border:1px dotted #4b5320; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Oh yeah.
