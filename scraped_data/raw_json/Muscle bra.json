He wore his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Mother\" title=\"Mother\">mother</a>'s undergarments for <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Blanca\" title=\"Blanca\">Blanca</a> in mid-2008. In the <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_Sex_Videos\" title=\"Chris Sex Videos\">Chris Sex Videos</a>, recorded around the same time, he appears to be wearing a cut-off red t-shirt as a makeshift bra. In the summer of 2009, he admitted to <a href=\"/cwcki/Ivy\" title=\"Ivy\">Ivy</a> that he enjoyed wearing women's underwear. She persuaded him to draw a picture of <a href=\"/cwcki/Punchy_Sonichu\" title=\"Punchy Sonichu\">Punchy Sonichu</a> wearing a bra and panties \"to symbolically display an acceptance of Chris’ interests.\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup> He did so, but for reasons which remained a mystery to his fans for the time being.\n</p><p>For a while, he also had mixed feelings about showing his own naked chest, <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_6\" title=\"Sonichu 6\">having previously made his aversion to seeing male nipples known</a>. For Ivy, he drew several pictures of himself <a href=\"/cwcki/File:CWCFlex.jpg\" title=\"File:CWCFlex.jpg\">topless</a>, and notably without nipples. In one image, he is pointedly waving his clown shirt above his head. In this idealized self-image, he's got a ripped upper body, and with a pair of pecs on his chest, his manboobs are non-existent and thus need no support. Also, in April 2009, he made <a href=\"/cwcki/Power\" title=\"Power\">three short videos</a> in which he demonstrated his physical strength whilst topless, being able to lift \"a grand number of pounds\".\n</p><p>On 1 September 2009 he told <a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey\" title=\"Kacey\">Kacey</a> he was planning on buying a bra, presumably to control the bouncing of his manboobs while jogging. A few days later, he bought his first bras, and was so happy with them that he photographed himself wearing one and sent the images to a gal-pal.\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">I just spent a whole minute just lookin' at myself without my shirt on, and it with- with my bra- with my bra on.

This was confirmed when he told Kacey that he threw away each bra after it accumulated three days' worth of 'tard sweat, because he didn't think that bras were washable.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup> We already know from the below email that Chris bought one set of sports bras in a three-pack, and due to his notorious cheapness we have no reason to think he did not do the same with the second set of bras. Chris also reveals in a video that he wears bras with a band size of 42. His cup size has not been confirmed, although in one of his videos where he is mumbling and rambling he seems to say, \"Might say a little bit an A, a little bit of a size A,\" as he slaps the slabs of fat. While this could be a confirmation, he does not exactly have the ability to accurately determine the size of things. (Update: As of 2015 and him flashing his viewers under the reasoning to #FreeTheNipple, he is now claiming he is a D cup. It is up to you, the reader, to decide if you'll believe he grew three cup sizes.)\n</p><p>The general public first became aware of Chris's muscle bras in <a href=\"/cwcki/April_2010\" title=\"April 2010\">April 2010</a> with a <a href=\"/cwcki/For_J-R%27s_Eyes_Only.MOV\" title=\"For J-R's Eyes Only.MOV\">leaked video</a>. The following day, possibly to steal the trolls' thunder, he voluntarily appeared in another <a href=\"/cwcki/04232010_-_Autism_Awareness_%26_Men_Should_NEVER_be_Topless\" title=\"04232010 - Autism Awareness &amp; Men Should NEVER be Topless\">video</a> for the public wearing his muscle bra. By this time, however, his rationale had shifted--it was not for comfort, but rather because he was offended by the sight of shirtless men. This new conviction would spur his campaign described below.\n</p><p>In <a href=\"/cwcki/June_2010\" title=\"June 2010\">June 2010</a> Chris went to <a href=\"/cwcki/Fridays_After_Five\" title=\"Fridays After Five\">Fridays After Five</a>, where he continued to carry out his campaign against exposed manboobs among the general public by wearing his muscle bra to the event. It seemed that Chris has also found another use for his muscle bra, demonstrated by his converting it into an <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Attraction_sign\" title=\"Attraction sign\">attraction sign</a> with a black marker. Whereas most normal people would perhaps draw on a t-shirt to make their point, Chris has devised a seemingly superior method of <a href=\"/cwcki/Love_Quest\" title=\"Love Quest\">making his</a>. That's right: for a woman to have read his statement of intent to engage in a romantic and sexual relationship with her, she'd have to have stared at one of the more disturbing outward pieces of evidence that he <i>just doesn't understand how those relationships work</i>, which may or may not be a poetic microcosm of his entire life since puberty.\n</p>\n<center>\n<ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\">\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\"><div style=\"width: 155px\">\n<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><div style=\"margin:15px auto;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:WantWoman.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"120\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/9/91/WantWoman.jpg/72px-WantWoman.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/9/91/WantWoman.jpg/107px-WantWoman.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/9/91/WantWoman.jpg/143px-WantWoman.jpg 2x\" width=\"72\"/></a></div></div>\n<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n<p>Chris after converting his bra into a wearable <a href=\"/cwcki/Attraction_Sign\" title=\"Attraction Sign\">Attraction Sign</a>.\n</p>\n</div>\n</div></li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\"><div style=\"width: 155px\">\n<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><div style=\"margin:15px auto;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Wantwoman.png\"><img alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"120\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/6/63/Wantwoman.png/73px-Wantwoman.png\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/6/63/Wantwoman.png/109px-Wantwoman.png 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/6/63/Wantwoman.png/146px-Wantwoman.png 2x\" width=\"73\"/></a></div></div>\n<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n<p>Artist's depiction.\n</p>\n</div>\n</div></li>\n</ul>\n</center>\n<p>In 2011 a new wrinkle appeared--he was into not just bras, but transvestism in general. He declared himself to be a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tomgirl_Saga\" title=\"Tomgirl Saga\">Tomgirl</a> and, later, a male lesbian, and he enthusiastically walked around in public wearing a blouse and skirt. He wore bras in photos uploaded to dating websites and Facebook. The muscle bra was folded into his new fashion paradigm.\n</p><p>Chris continues to wear bras, even purchasing a sports bra from the commissary while jailed in <a href=\"/cwcki/October_2021\" title=\"October 2021\">October 2021</a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Chris would begin wearing <a href=\"/cwcki/Negligee\" title=\"Negligee\">negligee</a> sometime when he began his <a href=\"/cwcki/Affair_with_Mother\" title=\"Affair with Mother\">affair with his mother</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Muscle_bras_for_everyone\">Muscle bras for everyone</span></h2>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Brassieres_For_Males\" title=\"Brassieres For Males\">Brassieres For Males</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>Chris's appreciation for bras goes beyond his penchant for dressing like a woman. It is also tied closely to the disgust he feels at seeing male bodies. Chris seems to find the sight of bare male chests extremely unappealing and even offensive. As early as October 2009, in a <a href=\"/cwcki/Warning_-_Naughty_Women_;)\" title=\"Warning - Naughty Women ;)\">video</a> he released showing an illustration of himself bare-chested, he censored his own drawn nipple with a slip of paper. In the <a href=\"/cwcki/April_2010\" title=\"April 2010\">April 2010</a> video message <a href=\"/cwcki/04232010_-_Autism_Awareness_%26_Men_Should_NEVER_be_Topless\" title=\"04232010 - Autism Awareness &amp; Men Should NEVER be Topless\">Men Should NEVER be Topless</a> he strongly insisted that all men should wear bras and said he would actually make it a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Law\" title=\"Law\">law</a>.

In October 2014 he raged to a friend, \"those UGLY, OFFENSIVE, VULGAR TOPLESS HIDES JUST GIVE ME REALLY BAD SHIVERS AND QUAKES; NEAR ENOUGH TO CAUSE A FREAKING SEIZURE!!!\" He is convinced that at least half the population - especially straight men - share this belief. At other times he has claimed that \"NOBODY is ever truly impressed with the topless male nudity.\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]</a></sup>\n</p><p>At first, it was supposed among his fans that there might be unstated reasons for his campaign. Perhaps due to his <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_art\" title=\"Chris and art\">inability</a> to differentiate differences in the anatomy of other human beings, he saw it as necessary for other males to cover up as well. Or perhaps, he simply wanted to rationalize the fact that he needed one for his big breasts by encouraging people who do not need one to wear one as well, thus hiding his embarrassment. As the years passed, however, his statements of repugnance at the male physique only multiplied, and it became apparent that he was being sincere in his rationale. Whether this stems from autism, projected self-hatred, or some undiagnosed mental illness, none can say.\n</p><p>Hiding the male body became such an important cause for Chris that in <a href=\"/cwcki/September_2013\" title=\"September 2013\">September 2013</a>, he revealed a <a href=\"/cwcki/Brassieres_For_Males\" title=\"Brassieres For Males\">Facebook page</a> dedicated to the muscle bra.
