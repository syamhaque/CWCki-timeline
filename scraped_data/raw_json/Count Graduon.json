Count Graduon is an ancient evil spirit residing in the scepter of the evil witch <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Mary Lee Walsh</a>. Despite being a powerful supernatural being envisioned as the overarching director of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Greene_County_Conspiracy\" title=\"Greene County Conspiracy\">campaign</a> against <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler_(comic_character)\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler (comic character)\">Chris</a> and the driving force of Chris and <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a>'s enemies, the ensemble cast of Electric Hedgehog Pokemon apparently never take the time to learn anything about him, leaving the reader in the dark about his motivations and importance.\n</p><p>Graduon's name (pronounced [ˈɡrædʒ.uː.ən], \"GRADGE-oo-un\") derives from <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris\" title=\"Chris\">Chris</a>'s feelings about his <b>gradu</b>ati<b>on</b> from <a href=\"/cwcki/Manchester_High_School\" title=\"Manchester High School\">high school</a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup> Beyond his anger and embarrassment about <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">not receiving special treatment</a> at his class's commencement ceremony, Christian likens his departure from high school to being exiled from comfortable surroundings and cherished friends. He also regards his efforts to adjust to life after school as a <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler%27s_Adult_Chronicles\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler's Adult Chronicles\">great adventure story</a>, so it should perhaps come as no surprise that this manchild's greatest enemy is a metaphor for growing up.\n</p><p>Chris claims that Graduon (along with <a href=\"/cwcki/Reldnahc_Notsew_Naitsirhc\" title=\"Reldnahc Notsew Naitsirhc\">Reldnahc Notsew Naitsirhc</a>) is inspired by evil wizards and evil twins from various TV shows, movies, <a href=\"/cwcki/Anime\" title=\"Anime\">anime</a>, and book stories.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup>  His title of Count could possibly be a reference to the villain character of Count Weirdly from <i><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slylock_Fox_%26_Comics_for_Kids\" title=\"wikipedia:Slylock Fox &amp; Comics for Kids\">Slylock Fox &amp; Comics for Kids</a></i>, where Chris once had a <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_in_the_media#Slylock_Fox\" title=\"Chris in the media\">drawing of Sonichu published</a> (at the youthful age of 29).\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#In_the_comic\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">In the comic</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Appearance\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Appearance</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Gallery\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Gallery</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Sources\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Sources</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#See_also:\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also:</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"In_the_comic\">In the comic</span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:152px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Graduon.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"189\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/7/7d/Graduon.png/150px-Graduon.png\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/7/7d/Graduon.png/225px-Graduon.png 1.5x, /w/images/7/7d/Graduon.png 2x\" width=\"150\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Graduon.png\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>The true form of Count Graduon</div></div></div>\n<p>In the original canon, according to the <a href=\"/cwcki/Anchuent_Prophecy\" title=\"Anchuent Prophecy\">Anchuent Prophecy</a>, Count Graduon is an ancient being of supreme evil sealed away by the leaders of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Cherokian_Clan\" title=\"Cherokian Clan\">Cherokee</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Wasabi_Clan\" title=\"Wasabi Clan\">Wasabi</a> clans. Interestingly enough, despite being trapped for thousands of years, Graduon was able to go to <a href=\"/cwcki/The_Moon\" title=\"The Moon\">the Moon</a> and teach <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Silvana\" title=\"Silvana\">Silvana</a>, as well as give her a <a href=\"/cwcki/Pickle\" title=\"Pickle\">penis</a>.\n</p><p>The Prophecy foretold that upon its own discovery by <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(character)\" title=\"Sonichu (character)\">Sonichu</a>, Graduon would be released from his imprisonment to endanger mankind. Once Sonichu alerted Christian to this fact, Chris accepted the powers of <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris-chan_Sonichu\" title=\"Chris-chan Sonichu\">Chris-Chan Sonichu</a> in order to find and defeat Graduon.\n</p><p>When Chris-Chan, <a href=\"/cwcki/Wes_Iseli\" title=\"Wes Iseli\">Wes-Li Sonichu</a>, and <a href=\"/cwcki/Sarah_Nicole_Hammer\" title=\"Sarah Nicole Hammer\">Saramah Rosechu</a> discovered the ancient evil they were looking for, they found an enormous golem marauding through <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a> at the behest of Mary Lee Walsh. It was soon revealed that Walsh's scepter contained the evil spirit, who identified itself as Count Graduon after the three prophesied electric creatures defeated the golem.\n</p><p>Graduon has not yet established his motive for aligning with Mary Lee Walsh and targeting Christian, his city, and his friends. It may be inferred from the <a href=\"/cwcki/Anchuent_Prophecy\" title=\"Anchuent Prophecy\">Anchuent Prophecy</a> though, that Chris's super powers are a critical threat to Graduon's evil, so therefore he seems to ally with her primarily because they see him as a common enemy, but for their own reasons between them. It is also unknown as to how and when he aligned himself with Mary Lee Walsh.\n</p><p>In <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_9\" title=\"Sonichu 9\"><i>Sonichu</i> #9</a>, it is revealed that he cannot stand Mary Lee Walsh - now <a href=\"/cwcki/Retroactive_continuity_in_Sonichu\" title=\"Retroactive continuity in Sonichu\">inexplicably</a> called Slaweel Ryam - due to her inability to either defeat Chris and his <a href=\"/cwcki/Electric_Hedgehog_Pok%C3%A9mon\" title=\"Electric Hedgehog Pokémon\">Electric Hedgehog Pokemon</a>, nor free him or give him a new body. He was content to let her die when she nearly fell off a platform whilst fighting Sonichu, but, after Sonichu saved her, he holds off and waits for a chance to utterly remove her from the picture.\n</p><p>Chris has stated that at the end of the \"first season\", he would fling Count Graduon to the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Moon\" title=\"Moon\">Moon</a>, breaking the staff in which he was imprisoned. He then hinted (in other words, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_writing\" title=\"Chris and writing\">revealed</a>) that whilst he was there, Graduon would locate and possess the deactivated <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Metal_Sonichu\" title=\"Metal Sonichu\">Metal Sonichu</a>, and prepare to return to <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a> as a new villain. His primary motive might have been to use the robotic copy as a replacement vessel for his broken staff, but it was speculated that Metal Sonichu would get to battle <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(character)\" title=\"Sonichu (character)\">Sonichu</a> (or <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_Ego\" title=\"Chris and his Ego\">Chris</a>, depending on how you look at it), that is, until Chris smashed the staff in <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_10\" title=\"Sonichu 10\"><i>Sonichu</i> #10</a> at the behest of Slaweel Ryam so she can \"punish him another day\". Whatever this might mean, it looks like Graduon is out of the picture for the time being. This is not entirely unconnected to the rapid rise of <a href=\"/cwcki/Asperchu\" title=\"Asperchu\">Asperchu</a> as the primary source of Chris's ire. \n</p><p>During the development of <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_11\" title=\"Sonichu 11\"><i>Sonichu</i> #11</a>, Chris claimed that Graduon will return: <i>\"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Metal_Sonichu\" title=\"Metal Sonichu\">METAL SONICHU</a> is NOT a secondary character; HE will be making his return as a MAJOR VILLIAN after Book 11 Possessed by the soul of Count Graduon.\"</i><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup> However, he later said that this would happen in \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_12\" title=\"Sonichu 12\">12</a> or later.\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]</a></sup>\n</p><p>In <a href=\"/cwcki/September_2015\" title=\"September 2015\">September 2015</a>, after taking up Sonichu #11 again, Chris teased his fans with the information that Graduon had originally been a physically diminutive \"expert wizard and a master of his witchcraft\" in the 14th century. Tormented and misunderstood, he took it out on the world by harassing women and generally becoming a maleficent sorcerer. He was executed and his soul was trapped until Slaweel Ryam released it. Chris hinted that Graduon might again assume corporeal form in the future.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-7\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">[7]</a></sup>\n</p><p>In a conversation on Etsy, upon being asked about Graduon's nationality (seeing as how he was trapped in his sphere by a pre-Columbian Cherokee Indian and yet appears very white), Chris said \"<i>\"he was in Medieval times; the times of castles, Queens and Kings, Wizards, Witches and Sorcerers; reminiscent of around Camelot and the Knights of the Round Table and all that sort of rot. I had not really thought of Nationality, but if I had to say, I would definitely put him around London <a href=\"/cwcki/Honor_roll\" title=\"Honor roll\">or</a> UK.\"</i>\"\n</p><p>Count Graduon was set to have a story revolving around him in <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_16\" title=\"Sonichu 16\"><i>Sonichu</i> #16</a>, formerly <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_14\" title=\"Sonichu 14\"><i>Sonichu</i> #14</a> before Chris reordered the comics. From what little was been released, Chris wrote a completely new origin for him. The new canon has his origin being of him born into British nobility on 17 November 1433; taking part in the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Years%27_War\" title=\"wikipedia:Hundred Years' War\">Hundred Years' War</a>, dying in battle at the hands of a French soldier in 1448. He was then reborn a second time on 17 November 1733, with his memories of his past life still present. He would later take part in the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War\" title=\"wikipedia:American Revolutionary War\">American Revolutionary War</a>, fighting for the Redcoats. After the war, he lived with a family of <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_race\" title=\"Chris and race\">Jewish wizards</a>, where he learned magic from them in his last ten years of his life. In his third life, he was reborn as <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Montgomery\" title=\"wikipedia:Bernard Montgomery\">Bernard Montgomery</a>; taking parts in both World Wars and eventually dying on 24 March 1976. Count Graduon is currently in his fourth life.\n</p><p><br/>\n</p>\n<table style=\"background:#FFF; border:1px solid #502350; border-top:8px solid #502350; color:#000; width:100%; max-width:618px; margin:0 auto 16px;\">\n<tbody><tr style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<td style=\"padding:5px;\"><div style=\"border:1px solid #502350\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Wise.JPG\"><img alt=\"Wise.JPG\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"88\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/7/7f/Wise.JPG/88px-Wise.JPG\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/7/7f/Wise.JPG/132px-Wise.JPG 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/7/7f/Wise.JPG/176px-Wise.JPG 2x\" width=\"88\"/></a></div>\n</td>\n<td style=\"padding:0 5px 0 1px; width:100%;\"><div style=\"font-size:1.25em; margin:0\"><b>The <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys</a> were here.</b></div>\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:0\"><i>Chris was <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Brainwashed\" title=\"Brainwashed\">brainwashed</a> into believing that</i> Count Graduon made peace with Chris and helped him in <a href=\"/cwcki/Operation_BARBarossa\" title=\"Operation BARBarossa\">Operation BARBarossa</a>, generously contributing land for prison camps with showers and ovens 'to keep prisoners warm'.</div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Appearance\">Appearance</span></h2>\n<p>Count Graduon is shown mostly as an <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/energy_being\" title=\"wikipedia:energy being\">energy being</a> contained inside a steel scepter, presumably with the immeasurable evil being trapped inside the purple <i>finial</i> on top of it.

He explained on <a href=\"/cwcki/Facebook\" title=\"Facebook\">Facebook</a> that Graduon \"wore a girdle to hide his <a href=\"/cwcki/Obesity\" title=\"Obesity\">muffin top</a>\" and had \"[a] sharp chin, sharp nose, sharp eyelids.\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-8\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">[8]</a></sup> Chris later created an <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_Amiibo\" title=\"Sonichu Amiibo\">Amiibo</a> and a Mii to support this design, and topped it off with several videos of Graduon commanding a squadron of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jerkops\" title=\"Jerkops\">Jerkops</a> to assist him in fights against <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Mary Lee Walsh</a>.
