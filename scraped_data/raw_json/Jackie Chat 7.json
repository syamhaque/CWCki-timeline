<b>CWC:</b></font>\nFirstly, the other useful things, non-console related, don't come up until later.<br/>\n<font color=\"#CC3299\">[8:56 pm] <b>Jacklyn Romy:</b></font>\n\"saving money\" is always useful. just because you had $300 on hand didnt mean you were required to go throw it on a video game<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\">[8:56 pm] <b>CWC:</b></font>\nSecond, I would drop to get money for
