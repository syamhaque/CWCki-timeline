But while they are in here, I'm still dominant and observant, and the body and brain are heavily self- sufficient, as that was made apparent throughout some of what she said.

I disagree on the impression she had left and how far and wide it had become. Although not everything was put online as she had foreseen, the fact that people are still talking about her, and that there are those, locally and distant around the world, who remember her, feel Andrew had left a great size viral amount from the event and her ranting and venting prior to that. I agree she had quite the ego while alive during that later time. He did however legitimately see into our dimension as well as the spiritual realm and have communications with those amongst us OCs and FCs in both of those dimensions.\n<p>I have also taken into consideration another theory: the timing between the shooting and when Mama started talking with <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Johnson Wiles and IdeaGuy</a>, though I'm still meditating on the common links.\n</p><p>The rantings and how Andrew was feeling throughout were ones that not only tugged at the heart strings, but did show his upset and anger with others. And the empathy went off in this noggin in a read of those emotions, although I did maintain my own mentality and strength to not totally copy her personality at the times. Not to mention the number of things in common she and Mama had, including that their respective families were really heavily concerned about money, among other traits I fail to recall at this moment. (edited)\n</p><p>I will also mention that while she look up to Ember, Andrew found faith in a Goddess. (edited)\n</p><p>I was able to see into her mind at times, and the Goddess she ended up praying to was not Ember, obviously, but seeing an aura and person outline very much similar to Mama Chris Chan, herself.\n</p><p>From that, you could talk about that Andrew had an inkling of knowledge of who and what Mama is even before IdeaGuy did his shit, and Mama found those details about herself later on.\nGood or bad, and regardless, Andrew and her ghost squadron are able to help and do their part in the events of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Dimensional_Merge\" title=\"Dimensional Merge\">Dimension Merge</a>, especially now that I was able to help her get a post-death message out.\n</p><p>And that is regardless of someone wanting to become famous \"on the coat tails of Chris Chan's fame\". Also, for the longer time, <a href=\"/cwcki/Magi-Chan\" title=\"Magi-Chan\">Magi-Chan</a> had Danny Phantom on call. And their participation was foreseen to be one for our favour. Oh, yeah, another thing in common, at least between Andrew and me: she wanted and waited to get into the spirit realm, and nowadays, I've been wanting and waiting to get myself and this body back into <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/C-197\" title=\"C-197\">C-197</a> and complete the tasks and quests leading up to my returning this body to Mama in the <a href=\"/cwcki/COVID-19\" title=\"COVID-19\">Covid</a>-free timeline.\n</p><p>Difference being that Mama does not have to die to transition. That's only more than my two bolts worth for now. One more thing, at the end of Part 9, after the credits, there's a clip from Thaddius' documentary; I feel like that was just a left-field transition. Really out of place. You could have got the same advertisement of the other documentary series by adding a link at the end of the video. \"Four Years Earlier\" feels a bit weird on that.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #F2E6CE; border:1px dotted #BFB6A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">The WCT</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>I did that on purpose to give people a sneak preview of the next documentary.\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #fffdb8; border:1px dotted #BFBFA3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">Chris (as Sonichu)</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Obviously, but it still feels like an awkward placement.\n<p>At least you have a new message from Andrew to share with the world.

Darn Toyworld figure really fell apart on\nhim in the prep work for the MPM figure.\n</p><p>Anyway, I have had a really significant <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Dream\" title=\"Dream\">dream</a> last night.\n</p><p>And it actually looked similar to, and as if it was a combination of some of my\nother dreams from before over the years.\n</p><p>We were here at the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Temple\" title=\"Temple\">temple</a>, I looked out of the window, and there are\nMassive happenings in outer space right above our area, seen from over and\nbeyond the house across from us.\n</p><p>There were all of the other eight planets, arranged like a collection of Chaos\nEmeralds (counting the eighth Emerald), with an empty center; the planets\nmade a ring and came together, and there was now this massive fire ball like\nplanet. And alien beings that I can remember were amongst the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Rokat\" title=\"Rokat\">Rokat</a> crew,\nand others my noggin fabricated. I was the major key in taking them down\nand stopping the invasion and the Earth being conquered.\n</p><p>There is also a Very Special literal Flag with a Flag Pole; a Blue and White\nflag; different from the flag that would have been considered hand drawn even\nby my hands.\n</p><p>It looks very similar to the Blue Team’s flag from <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Red_Vs_Blue\" title=\"Red Vs Blue\">Red Vs Blue</a>.\n</p><p>And That flag in My hands is apparently a major element in my ability to take\ndown this incoming threat. Also, in the dream, everyone else was working on\ndefending themselves and the planet. Even the Decepticons were allied with\nthe Autobots in this common cause and goal to defend themselves and their\nsecond home, here.\n</p><p><a href=\"/cwcki/Transformers\" title=\"Transformers\">Starscream and Megatron</a> were lead defenders alongside other ally Autobots\nin this area of our planet, here.\n</p><p>I managed to defend myself and keep the temple safe in the dream, though this\ndream was more of an observational one, as I sensed and momentarily saw a\nfuture version of myself with that blue flag being helped aboard to take out the\nlikes of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jakoba\" title=\"Jakoba\">Jakoba</a> and the boss group on there. I do remember ending up on the\nEarth’s moon in part of those Boss Battles as well.\n</p><p>Leo, have you had similar dreams as of late as well?\n</p><p>Off-topic, I also wanted to let you know about: my partner and I are also\nworking with a lovely massage oil I purchased from Rebeckah’s Natural\nFoods recently; this is a really goood massage oil. The scent is energizing,\nand it just feels so sensational on the skin for both of us.
