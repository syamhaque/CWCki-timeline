It introduced features such as the ability to play Blu-ray discs, further social and online features, and the PlayStation Network. However, the console had a rocky start due to a high price tag ($599 for a 60GB model, and $499 for a 20GB model, equivalent to $896.82 and $747.10 respectively considering inflation as of 2023), among other problems; still, during its 11-year lifespan, it sold 87.4 million units, which while nothing compared to the PlayStation 2's numbers (where it is still the highest-selling console of all time) is still quite respectable.\n</p><p>The PS3 is notable for being <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris\" title=\"Chris\">Chris</a>'s original \"life upgrade\".

While Chris did apparently understand that the component was actually the system's wireless networking antenna, he removed it anyway. It seems to have had no effect on his ability to connect his PS3 to the Internet, indicating that he either uses a wired Ethernet connection or he realized how fucked he was and put it back in place.

Through repeated abuse (see above), Chris's PS3 was misbehaving, prompting him to contact <a href=\"/cwcki/Sony\" title=\"Sony\">Sony</a> tech support. They apparently guided him through an attempt to fix corrupted files on the PS3's hard drive, but he did not succeed and Chris was given a choice to reformat his drive, which he accepted.\n</p><p>In the video, Chris blamed a \"misunderstanding\" between him and the support representative as the reason why he ended up formatting his drive; perhaps he didn't realize or know what formatting was.
