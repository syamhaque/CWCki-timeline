But this is a matter of principle - we, as the Wikipedia user community, are supposed to give every contributor a chance.

Going to a website, ignoring its rules, then threatening them when the ignored rules lead to one's post being removed and claiming that other people will somehow punish Wikipedia, those aren't the acts of a person deserving of respect.  Nor are they the acts of a good Christian.

Having looked at what you've done (and peeked at your deleted user page), I think it's time for a bit of my usual newbie admonishment/encouragement: we <i>all</i> come here and begin stacking up stuff in our user pages and and think about writing articles about ourselves (well, I didn't do the latter, but a <i>surprising</i> number of people seem to do that)... but that's not where the <i>real</i> fun in Wikipedia can be found. Since you undoubtedly know heck of a lot about video games, how about helping us out with video game articles? Take a look at <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:WPCVG\" title=\"wikipedia:WP:WPCVG\">WikiProject Video Games</a>, or just peek around any articles that interest you and improve them. Easy, fun, and I can't remember the last time we saw any bigger conflict among the editors (apart of the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:LAME\" title=\"wikipedia:WP:LAME\">really <i>really</i> lame conflicts</a>).

Normally I wouldn't delete this unilaterally (especially after it had been deleted and recreated twice before), but I don't want this issue to get any more complicated than it needs to be.

You first need a wikipedia article and wikipedia is really picky about notability, especially for articles.  You'd need to be in a notable physical newspaper multiple times or on non-internet television to qualify to keep your article would end up getting deleted.\n</p><p>I call myself a loyal sonichu fan but like all such fans, we're not fans of sonichu, but of you.  You have a talent for being seriously funny.  However, you are squandering it and I say this to be helpful, not offensive.  First of all, your goal should be to become a youtube partner, which means a paying job and a career.  Your only other way for a career is to spend a long time, a lot of work, and a lot of money going through college only to find out that all employers are assholes and there's no jobs anywhere -- that's what happened to me.  If you become a Youtube partner, you may eventually end up on real television like <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LisaNova\" title=\"wikipedia:LisaNova\">LisaNova</a> did.\n</p><p>Now for being a youtube partner, you need an actual strong password as your websites keep getting broken into.  It should have letters and numbers.  It should be as long as the site lets you and be the result of hitting random keys on the keyboard, not a real word.  Then write it down somewhere and hide it so no one ever sees it.  Next, connect the account to an email address you don't tell to anyone, absolutely no one and make the email address's password the same way.  Also make all the answers to secret questions not real answers, which people know when you're famous, but just make the answers completely unrelated, random words, and write them down.  Check out the password recovery system on youtube and your email address and if it asks for your real info to recover it (stuff people already know) then change it with fake info and write all the fake info down.\n</p><p>Next, when you switched youtube accounts, recently, I hope you kept them linked from the same main account so youtube can see your stats.  Secondly, do not delete a single video until you're a partner.  More videos means more views, means more chance of being a youtube partner.  You should also re-upload every video you've ever made (except ones against the youtube TOS like the nude ones) to your new youtube account and in the youtube description, write the date it was made so people aren't confused.  In fact, edit all your descriptions to have the date.  It's nice at least you start videos with \"Captains Log\", but sometimes you don't and even if you do, who wants to spend time loading bunch of video to find out if it's new or not?  There's also various archives of your videos precisely because you delete them.\n</p><p>You also could increase viewership and make more videos by:\n</p>\n<ol><li>Q &amp; A with people</li>\n<li>Respond to the youtube comments you get.  While most are basically typical youtube comments that being inane flames, some are worth responding that being intelligent flames or entertaining flames.  Well, it is youtube so most of the comments on the site are flames.</li></ol>\n<p>As for your website, cwcville is the best name, and it's a name you can trademark, too.  Do the same password stuff on the domain name.  Use moniker as the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_registrar\" title=\"wikipedia:Domain registrar\">domain registrar</a> (this is the most secure registrar) and get their extra security package.  Every time you change your domain name, your <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_pagerank\" title=\"wikipedia:Google pagerank\">google pagerank</a> goes down to 0 and you must start all over again--very bad.\n</p><p>Did you know security guards only have the powers of private citizens?  That means they can only detain or arrest someone for a felony.  If they violate that, they can be sued for false arrest.  If they think you're tresspassing, they must call the police, not arrest you.  But at Target (I think) they beat you up, arrested you, took you to jail, and you had to go to court.  If I were you, I would press charges and sue for false arrest before the statute of limitations expires for doing that.\n</p><p>As for your sonichu comics, copyright law in the USA says for derivative works (which sonichu is, even though it's not technically fanfiction), you have copyright of it, but those who you derived it from can control the distribution of the work.  So I recommend you retitle it to cwcville, rename the characters not resembling sonic the hedgehog or pokemon, redraw them so they don't resemble them too, and redo the whole comics that way.  The storyline of the comics is original an unrelated to the works you derived it from so that whole thing can stay.  Call it cwcville and have the characters renamed and redrawn a bit and then you control the copyright on them.  I'd also recommend that you draw them using some fancy computer software (I don't know which is good) so it's easier to edit them.  Or maybe you can draw the outlines on paper withOUT lines and then scan them and then draw them via computer.\n</p><p>And them I have a question to you:  Do you ever read the comments on your videos?  I mean some advised you of the health dangers of the mold on your shower but then I see more videos of it and there's still mold.  Others advise you things like they'll warn you if a girl is a troll and so far they'll all been right. \n</p><p>And I hope you read it all because it took me over an hour of work writing it. <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Are_you_ready_for_IPv6%3F\" title=\"wikipedia:User:Are you ready for IPv6?\">Are you ready for IPv6?</a> (<a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Are_you_ready_for_IPv6%3F\" title=\"wikipedia:User talk:Are you ready for IPv6?\">talk</a>) 05:56, 4 May 2009 (UTC)\n</p>\n<ul><li><b>IPv6:</b> I find this hard to say... but Chris is not going to read <i>nothing</i> of what you wrote. A friend of mine tried to talk some sense upon him the other day. But doing so was like talking to a wall. Chris never even read a single word of what he was writing. I sort of know him, I managed to read the page, and not only I can certify that telling him anything will be futile, but I could also feel, while he was talking about his \"Sweetheart Search\", that apart from being terribly childish, he was whitewashing himself. I mean, who else calls plastering the campus with signs saying \"Christian Chandler wants a girlfriend!\" a wholesome, epic love quest? -- <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Da_nuke\" title=\"wikipedia:User:Da nuke\">Da_Nuke</a> (<a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Da_nuke\" title=\"wikipedia:User talk:Da nuke\">talk</a>) 07:54, 4 May 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>\n<dl><dd><ul><li>Da nuke, you know that might explain why he doesn't read the thousands of warnings others give him, such as when someone that he thinks is his internet sweatheart turns out to be a troll or that wearing the sonichu medallion turned women off.
