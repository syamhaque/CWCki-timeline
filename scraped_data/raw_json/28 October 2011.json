On that fateful Friday evening, at around 5:20 p.m.,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup> <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler\">Chris</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Barbara_Weston_Chandler\" title=\"Barbara Weston Chandler\">Barbara</a> visited the GAMe PLACe, where Chris had been banned since <a href=\"/cwcki/2008\" title=\"2008\">2008</a>. Chris had then recently heard that the shop was under new management thanks to <a href=\"/cwcki/Pedofork\" title=\"Pedofork\">sexual abuse charges</a> being placed upon the previous owner, and he had hoped that <a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_places_that_have_banned_Chris\" title=\"List of places that have banned Chris\">his ban from the store</a> could be lifted with a new appeal.\n</p><p>To Chris's horror, he realized that <a href=\"/cwcki/Michael_Snyder\" title=\"Michael Snyder\">Michael Snyder</a> was now the man in charge, meaning that Chris was effectively trespassing <a href=\"/cwcki/Michael_Snyder_is_ColdHearted_and_Mean\" title=\"Michael Snyder is ColdHearted and Mean\">after Snyder told him in no uncertain terms that he was not to return</a>. What happened next is still not completely clear, but Chris took a photo of the store and was escorted out, snapping an additional two photos of Michael Snyder in the parking lot. All hell broke loose when Chris allegedly hit Snyder with his car, before switching seats with Barb, who hit him again.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup>. After this, they drove away in an attempt flee the scene. When the <a href=\"/cwcki/Jerkop\" title=\"Jerkop\">Jerkops</a> arrived, Barb assaulted one during their arrests in an effort to protect Chris. Both were subdued and arrested.\n</p><p>Chris and Barb were each charged with felonies, and Chris was also charged with additional misdemeanors, which meant they both were facing possible prison time.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup>  They were bonded out on 29 October,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup> with Chris's initial hearing taking place one week after Barb's. The Chandlers were represented in court by <a href=\"/cwcki/Rob_Bell\" title=\"Rob Bell\">Rob Bell</a>, a Republican member of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Virginia\" title=\"Virginia\">Virginia</a> House of Delegates.\n</p><p>On 10 July 2012, a plea bargain was reached. All of their charges were reduced to misdemeanors. Barbara was sentenced to community service and two years of probation. Chris was sentenced to community service, one year of probation, and mandatory <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_mental_healthcare\" title=\"Chris and mental healthcare\">psychiatric</a> treatment and evaluation. They also had to pay for Michael Snyder's medical expenses. By the time all was said and done, most of <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler\" title=\"Bob Chandler\">Bob</a>'s inheritance was wasted on paying for a defense to justify Chris's personal vendetta against someone who tried holding him accountable for his actions. This, along with the subsequent fines, would later bite his surviving family in the ass with the advent of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Financhu_Crisis\" title=\"Financhu Crisis\">Financhu Crisis</a> a few years later.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#The_charges\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The charges</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Barbara's\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Barbara's</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Court_dates\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Court dates</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Chris's\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris's</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Court_dates_2\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Court dates</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Civil_suit\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Civil suit</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Chris_retaliates\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris retaliates</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Arraignment,_plea_bargain,_and_sentencing\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Arraignment, plea bargain, and sentencing</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#Email\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Email</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Chris's_photos\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris's photos</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#Screenshots\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Screenshots</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#Fan_art\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Fan art</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-13\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">9</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-14\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">10</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_charges\">The charges</span></h2>\n<p>Below are the charges brought against both Barbara and Chris, along with details and court dates based on the details from the <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://epwsgdp1.courts.state.va.us/gdcourts/captchaVerification.do?landing=landing\" rel=\"nofollow\">General District Court Online Case Information System</a> &amp; <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://wasdmz2.courts.state.va.us/CJISWeb/circuit.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Charlottesville City Circuit Online Case Information</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Barbara.27s\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Barbara's\">Barbara's</span></h3>\n<ul><li><b>FAIL STOP ACCIDENT &gt; $1000 FEL</b> (§ 46.2-894.

Barb attended a second hearing on 14 November, a third took place on 15 December, at the same time as her criminal case hearing, and a fourth occurred on 5 January at 1:00 PM. \n</p><p>Chris's case at one point read 'Other Judgement', however, it appears to have been open again. Presumably, Chris appeared again in court on 5 January 2012 at 2:15 PM, shortly after his criminal hearing.\n</p><p>Before the court hearing, Michael Snyder requested and received a Preliminary Protective Order against both Chris and Barbara. This order is similar to a restraining order, and prohibits Chris or Barb from contacting Michael or engaging in any threatening behavior towards him before the hearing. The order lasts for 15 days.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-9\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">[9]</a></sup>\n</p><p>On 5 April, Snyder was awarded full Protection Orders against both Chris and Barbara. A Protection Order can last up to two years and violation of the Protection Order can result in both civil and criminal charges.\n</p><p>No further information on the civil suit has emerged since then, and with the Chandlers having been ordered to pay Snyder's medical bills as part of their plea bargain, it seems likely that the suit will not proceed any further.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris_retaliates\">Chris retaliates</span></h2>\n<p>On 4 November, soon after being bailed out of jail, Chris uploaded the pictures he took of Michael Snyder on the 28th to the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCki\" title=\"CWCki\">CWCki</a>, plastering them on the front page and the page on Michael.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-10\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">[10]</a></sup> In the image descriptions, Chris <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_hypocrisy\" title=\"Chris and hypocrisy\">taunted Snyder for his</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Obesity\" title=\"Obesity\">obesity</a> and claimed that he <a href=\"/cwcki/Pedofork\" title=\"Pedofork\">molests children</a>.\n</p><p>In the February <a href=\"/cwcki/Facebook\" title=\"Facebook\">Facebook</a> leaks, Chris stated 'After October 28, 2011; I now have TOTAL Disrespect and Miscontent of the so-called \"Officers of the Badge\"' as opposed only to those in colors other than blue and black. He also produced 50 copies of a flyer calling the GAMe PLACe a \"Cyber bullies' hang-out\" and encouraging people to stay far away which he then left around his usual attraction locations. This led to another run in with <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jerkops\" title=\"Jerkops\">Jerkops</a>; Chris escaped by \"hiding and weaving around the parked cars\" and by driving a Mistubishi as opposed to <a href=\"/cwcki/Son-Chu\" title=\"Son-Chu\">Son-Chu</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Arraignment.2C_plea_bargain.2C_and_sentencing\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Arraignment,_plea_bargain,_and_sentencing\">Arraignment, plea bargain, and sentencing</span></h2>\n<p>The arraignments took place on 10 July. Two CWCki Forum members named Cyan and Indigo went to the courthouse and afterwards <a href=\"/cwcki/This_is_how_the_Trial_went\" title=\"This is how the Trial went\">recounted the proceedings</a>.\n</p><p>A plea bargain was settled upon because Michael did not want Chris and Barb to be stuck with felony charges. Upon sentencing, all five charges shared between Chris and Barb were reduced to misdemeanors. Rob Bell told the judge that despite this, Chris and Barb maintained their version of the events as accurate. This meant they were both technically making an \"Alford plea\", whereby the defendant does not actually admit to the charges against them, but nonetheless pleads guilty because they do not believe they are likely to win the case, which will still usually result in a more lenient sentence for saving the state the time and expense of a full trial.\n</p><p>Before Chris's turn to speak, Bell referred to him as \"high-functioning autistic\" and then as an \"adult autistic child\", much to the chagrin of Chris. When the judge asked Chris if he understood that he had to pay Michael's medical expenses, Chris, in a stunning display of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ego\" title=\"Ego\">egotism</a> even by his standards, replied something along the lines of, \"Yes, but I don't think that thieving/bribing liar deserves a red cent!\" He then begrudgingly pleaded guilty.\n</p><p>Barbara was sentenced to community service, two years of probation and was ordered to pay $474 in court costs; Chris was sentenced to community service, one year of probation, and mandatory psychological treatment and evaluation, plus jail time unless he complies,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-11\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">[11]</a></sup> and he was ordered to pay $247 in court costs.\n</p><p>The next day, Chris wrote a note on <a href=\"/cwcki/Facebook#You_WILL_be_brought_in!\" title=\"Facebook\">Facebook</a> confirming Cyan and Indigo's report. Chris claimed that Rob Bell confronted the two \"trolls\" and that the trolls will get arrested.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Email\">Email</span></h2>\n<p>Someone purporting to be in contact with Chris leaked an email, supposedly from Chris himself, shedding some light on the events of October 28. <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Surfshack_Tito\" title=\"Surfshack Tito\">Surfshack Tito</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Thorg\" title=\"Thorg\">Thorg</a> confirmed that this email was accurate to the events of the day.\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>I tell about us two landing in jail. During a usual, yettiring, shopping outting with <a href=\"/cwcki/Barbara_Chandler\" title=\"Barbara Chandler\">my mother</a>, we had just stopped at the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation_Army\" title=\"wikipedia:Salvation Army\">Salvation Army</a> story on Cherry Ave and left with a few purchases. She impulsively asked\n<p>to go to the SPCA Rummage Sale, and I ended up taking 4 St. NW to stop by the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/McDonalds\" title=\"McDonalds\">McDonalds</a> there for a cup of tea to go, when at the PLACe, now known as \"C-Ville Game &amp; Hobby\" (status unchanged on the PLACe website), mom and I read the sign on the window that led me to an occurrence I was waiting for, the PLACe under New Ownership (with <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Destruction_Of_Chris%27s_House\" title=\"Destruction Of Chris's House\">burning it down</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Death_threats\" title=\"Death threats\">being the alternative</a>).\n</p><p>So, I continue ahead for the tea, and mom asked for a smoothie. On an impulse of the newfound piece of freedom, I drove back to the PLACe, upon closer inspection, I read the \"New Owner\" sign further, stating, \"Under New Ownership of Mike &amp; Madeline\"; I had thought, <a href=\"/cwcki/Honor_roll\" title=\"Honor roll\">perhaps it was another Mike</a>. Mom insisted on coming in with me, so we did, and a few steps in, who did our eyes see in the new center counter, past employee Nathan, and Michael Snyder.\n</p><p>I hid behind my mother for a moment, and Mike pointed us out the door, but before leaving, I whipped out my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/3DS\" title=\"3DS\">3DS</a>, activated its camera and took his photo, then I shouted, \"For <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/The_Internet\" title=\"The Internet\">the Internet</a>\". Mom and I made our way to the van and entered it; Mike followed us out, and Stood right in front of the van, thinking he was <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_Jackson#First_Bull_Run\" title=\"wikipedia:Stonewall Jackson\">Stonewall Jackson</a>. We backed up the van some; Mike chased us. Mom took the wheel; <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">Mike twice made his own deliberate leg scars, rubbing his legs on our bumper, banged our hood and fell backwards; we had NOT moved our van at either instance of him faking his falls.</a>\n</p><p>And more shit happened. Mom called <a href=\"/cwcki/Jerkop\" title=\"Jerkop\">911</a> on my phone first (followed shortly after by Mike being handed a phone by someone else for him to make his call. Eventually, mother backed us out onto 4 St. NW, northward, and we escaped. But at the traffic light, we were caught up by a <a href=\"/cwcki/Decepti-Clones\" title=\"Decepti-Clones\">cop car</a>. Parked at the nearby courthouse, two of the cop cars, and us in the van, exchanged the tales of the event and our driver licenses. Eventually, I was asked to step out of the van; I was about to be handcuffed, but I would not have another handcuffing, so I fought, I was pinned, and I was handcuffed.\n</p><p>My NEW pair of <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_money\" title=\"Chris and money\">$324</a> Rx lens <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Glasses\" title=\"Glasses\">glasses</a> were broken by THEM in the fight. My mother fought the police in my defense, and she was handcuffed and I was emotionally distraught, I screamed and Screamed and SCREAMED, until an ambulance came for my mother to take her to UVA Hospital; she was okay, but her <a href=\"/cwcki/Obesity\" title=\"Obesity\">Blood Pressure</a> was high. I was driven to, entered and thrown into a cell block. At first for a while, I was as melodramatic and sane as <a href=\"/cwcki/Beavis_and_Butt-head\" title=\"Beavis and Butt-head\">Daria</a>, then I started going crazy, I shouted television talk and songs at random; <a href=\"/cwcki/Muscle_bra\" title=\"Muscle bra\">took off my shirt</a> due to the heat; pretended to be a <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanie_with_the_Light_Brown_Hair\" title=\"wikipedia:Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair\">genie with light brown hair</a> for a while, and made an acquaintance with the stainless steel sink with a hex-shaped bowl.\n</p><p>I prayed a LOT to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jesus\" title=\"Jesus\">Jesus</a> for my release and safe return home with my mother. And I banged the cell door with both my feet while lying on a folding mattress on the floor (to get those bastards to let me see and talk to my mother Eventually, my mother arrived, tried to post bail, but there were errors. <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Rocky\" title=\"Rocky\">Rocky</a> was called to help us, BLESS her and her husband soo much. Then my mother was jumpsuited and jailed; I was too shortly before. And I was moved to two other cells. Only after seeing my mother in her suit pass by my second cell, did I start to calm down. I was REALLY WORRIED about my mother and her health. She Needed Me, and I Needed Her. Eventually in cell 3, I dozed off and slept for a few hours. I did not eat their food; I had Never eaten Prison Food, and I was NOT going to start then. About 3 PM on the 29th, mom and I were released, and Rocky and her husband drove us back to our van.\n</p><p>Now mom and I each have our own courthouse dates. I'm sure mom will be only fined, but I have the worse of cases. Mom and I, we are certain I will be found not guilty; it was a case of a Deliberate Deception, with the \"New Ownership\" sign from Michael, and my falling for his trap. I later printed out the facts of Mike from the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCki\" title=\"CWCki\">Cwcki</a> that night, and I found the \"CWC Michael Snyder Interview\" video on <a href=\"/cwcki/YouTube\" title=\"YouTube\">YouTube</a>, where the clown-faced troll called Mike; Michael Snyder CONFESSES to Wanting to lure me in and land me in jail with a \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Pokemon\" title=\"Pokemon\">Pokemon</a> Tournament on the 22nd\".\n</p><p>I have streamed from my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PS3\" title=\"PS3\">PS3</a> to my Laptop to get an MP4 of the video, and to burn the video onto a DVD-R. <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">With this great amount of evidence, we will find Michael Guilty of being a Troll/Cyber Bully among those who have been pestering, deceiving, tricking, blackmailing, etc, me for about 4 years now.</a>\n</p><p>That's the story I share with you, REDACTED, in Strictest Confidence; DO NOT TELL ANYONE, PLEASE. <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">Do not ask; Do not tell</a>; Barbara and I are working diligently to deal with this. Currently, her court date is set on 12/15; mine is yet to be determined on 11/7, but it'll probably be on the same day as my mother's.\n</p><p>We have also been blessed with connections from Rocky at my church to have Robert B. Bell, Delegate, Republican, Methodist Esquire to represent Barbara and me in both of our cases. It may help to have you come in for support on my trial, and as a character witness. I will send you an update later on.\n</p><p>Stay Safe, REDACTED,\n</p><p>Christian W.
