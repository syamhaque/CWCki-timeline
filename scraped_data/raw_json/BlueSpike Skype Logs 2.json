They then discuss a video that Chris uploaded to reaffirm his heterosexuality. Julie asks Chris to confirm what he stepped on in the video; Chris replies that it is a plastic “dildo” that he received from Adam &amp; Eve as a free gift. He claims that he had never used it, and that he never would; he used it as a representation of the trolls’ dicks, a voodoo dick, if you will. Julie worries about Chris’s level of stress, and offers to alleviate his suffering; Chris declines, but mentions he would enjoy a friendly visit from Julie. Julie then offers to play “games” with Chris, who agrees that they could. Chris stresses the short distance between Julie’s residence in Ohio and his home in Virgina.  \n</p><p>Chris mentions Clyde, and how he posed as Jason and Gregg Mays; he also mentions Clyde’s supposed hacking enterprises. Chris mentions Ryan Cash’s tragic suicide “over the ONE TIME [he] said that [he] would quit drawing comics.” Chris explains that he apologized, and how he will go to the police and make another video to Clyde. A new conversation pops up later – Chris explains that he can’t help with a fight in the IRC as he has to clean up a mess in the kitchen. Julie then mentions how Clyde is making threats to rape Julie and how he already has Panda. Chris dismisses these claims, until Julie mentions that Clyde knows where Julie lives. The conversation continues later; Chris is recovering from the horrific aftermath of the IRC chat.\n</p><p>Later, Chris mentions that his mother has bemoaned several things, including “being old”; Chris’s phrasing demonstrates his egocentrism and shows that he simply doesn’t listen to his mother’s complaints. The next day, Julie brings up the IRC chat again, and seems to throw Panda under the bus by pointing out that Panda has conspired against Chris. Chris states that he will still care about Panda, despite her “transgressions” in the chat. The day after that, Julie expresses her shock that Chris has given away the rights to Sonichu to Clyde Cash; Chris vehemently denies this, and mentions how he’ll make another video to “clear this up.” It seems that Clyde is acting up again in the IRC, and Chris can’t be bothered to defend his sexuality. Julie brings up the unknown address of the new Sonichu site, but Chris still refuses to divulge it. Julie presses Chris for more information about the IRC chat, but he asks for a web hosting site and brushes off her inquiries.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chats\">Chats</span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"19_January\">19 January</span></h3>\n<p><br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\">[19:33:11] <b>BlueSpike:</b></font>\nUh-oh, Chris..I sent an e-mail to one of your accounts!
