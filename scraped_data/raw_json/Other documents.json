I was hoping for a moment like this. And she asked me to have a beverage with her and talk about things. I was very ESTATIC, and my SHATTERED Heart had a speedy recovery back to 100%; We had a nice \"Mini-Date,\" I maintained Eye-Contact, I was very attentive, and I took notes about her. I thought she was very pretty, I enjoyed her charming wit, and I found her to be a very nice and lovely girl. But, later on, as I was figuring out steps for future dates, I learned from a couple of Gal-Pals, that I have previously made at the Shopping Center, that my new girlfriend was not serious; she was setting me up for a prank. I could not believe it at first, so I found and asked her myself. Unfortunately it was true. I was shocked, and my heart was re-shattered down to being 15% intact.\"\n</p><p><br/>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Joshua_Martinez\">Joshua Martinez</span></h3>\n<p>Look, pal, if you REALLY WANT to TAKE DOWN someone who HAS a REPUTATION, consider one <a href=\"/cwcki/Joshua_Martinez\" title=\"Joshua Martinez\">JOSHUA MARTINEZ</a>.\n</p><p>Ladies come a runnin' from at least as far as New York City to his house in Dyke, VA; not just any ladies, but STARS like Megan Fox, Jessica Alba, Jessica Biel, Jessica Simpson and plenty other whores.

Ed Winkler Banned me from the church for a month. He has Banned me from Speaking my peace during the Sharing of Joys and Concerns, and from that, I have felt unnecessarily Silenced. I also feel my meetings with Rocky no longer have much effect on me or my life. My life continues to be at a disappointing standstill of sadness, loneliness and great stress. Only the people way older than me ever do so much as greet me, and I have very little to share in common with any of them. Nobody even close to my age, or even in their twenties, gives me much to do, or include me in their conversations.      \n</p><p>Aside from that, I am hated by a number of people for <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">reasons beyond my full understanding</a>, because I always tried to be a <a href=\"/cwcki/Death_threats\" title=\"Death threats\">good</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos#Hatred_of_homos\" title=\"Homos\">and</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Kill_De_Jack\" title=\"Kill De Jack\">nice</a> person for a long time. And in public, I am constantly overlooked, ignored or ostracized by Everybody. Even speaking out gets me absolutely no attention. I continue to be paranoid of most everyone, because of <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">them likely being among the Internet Trolls that still continue to haunt and taunt me</a>. I am still long desperate for a woman to be my <a href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart\" title=\"Sweetheart\">Sweetheart</a>. I am tired of being single, dang it. I continue to serve my family the best I can, and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_Ego#Fishing_For_Sympathy\" title=\"Chris and his Ego\">I continue to feel sad, depressed and lonely</a>. My heart feels numb, and I am forced to keep a great emotional distance from Everybody outside my house and home. I am an autistic mental and emotional mess, and there is very little I can do to help myself, beyond my knowledge. And God sees fit for some (hate-filled) reason to continue to curse me as a jinx.      \n</p><p>And, so, the church is not helping me much in my life, mentally, or emotionally, at all. So I will not be coming back for a long time.      \n</p><p>Sent from my iPhone\n</p><p>Stay Safe,\n</p><p>Christian W.

Our insurance, State Farm, agent was most helpful to us with temporary hotel accommodations, and our current <a href=\"/cwcki/Rental_House\" title=\"Rental House\">rental house</a> residence. It will take up to six months for the reconstruction of our original house.

Financially, it is slim, and we are unsure of being reimbursed for our turned-in receipts to our agent. But we have recovered many to most of our belongings from the house that did not get destroyed in the fire, as well as replacing some of them. . . . Aside from that, my mother and I are suffering to recovering from bronchitis (hit me first on the tenth of February; hit her a week later; we have prescribed antibiotics, juice and chicken noodle soup to help us recover). I have been feeling better lately. Again, thank you all so much for caring and helping us in our time of loss and need. — Christian\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span id=\"Chris.27s_wingman\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris's_wingman\">Chris's wingman</span></h2>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/July_25,_2014_Leaks\" title=\"July 25, 2014 Leaks\">July 25, 2014 Leaks</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>On 25 July 2014, a correspondence between Chris and an unidentified person was leaked on the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCki_Forums\" title=\"CWCki Forums\">CWCki Forums</a> (now known as <a href=\"/cwcki/Kiwi_Farms\" title=\"Kiwi Farms\">Kiwi Farms</a>)<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup>.
