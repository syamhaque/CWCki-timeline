And It is also good to know that you are still residing at that address. The <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/DVD\" title=\"DVD\">DVD</a> is under production, to be completed a few days after February 24, 2007 (my 25th Birthday...Yay).\n</p><p>You may be able to help me in a portion of it now; there will be a Slideshow (projected from my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PlayStation_Portable\" title=\"PlayStation Portable\">PlayStation Portable</a>) featuring not only pics of me growing up, but the friends, teachers and relatives I've known and remembered (either from heart, like yourself, as well as yearbook signatures). Anyway, do you remember from the ol' class, Sarah and Micha (the blonde girl with glasses, and the slow-talking <a href=\"/cwcki/Niggos\" title=\"Niggos\">african american</a> who Ms. Eckel told over and over to get his dad to teach him how to shave)? I remembered both of them from heart, but unfortunately I don't remember their last names, so it's harder to find them in the yearbooks; could you tell me their last names, please?\n</p><p>As for what had happened during <a href=\"/cwcki/Piedmont_Virginia_Community_College\" title=\"Piedmont Virginia Community College\">PVCC</a>, in a nutshell; about Mid-Summer, <a href=\"/cwcki/2003\" title=\"2003\">2003</a>, I've realize upon revolation that I needed a girl friend to make into a <a href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart_from_the_Ground-Up\" title=\"Sweetheart from the Ground-Up\">Sweetheart from the Ground-Up</a>, so with a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Attraction_sign\" title=\"Attraction sign\">sign</a> (which I've later realized that it made me look slow-minded; the \"R\" Word), I've started my Enduring <a href=\"/cwcki/Love_Quest\" title=\"Love Quest\">Love Quest</a>. The Dean of Student Serveces, <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Mary Lee Walsh</a> came out and tore my sign up right in front of me, and said, \"You're not gonna get a Girlfriend this way or any way.\" That *&amp;^%$ <a href=\"/cwcki/Heart_level\" title=\"Heart level\">SHATTERED MY HEART</a> AND MURDERED MY SOUL. And it wasn't just her, the Policemen Imposters in Brown, White and Red, AKA The <a href=\"/cwcki/Jerkop\" title=\"Jerkop\">Jerkops</a> (Blue and Black ARE the TRUE POLICE SOLDIERS) also seriously indented the impression that \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Virgina_is_for_Virgins\" title=\"Virgina is for Virgins\">Virgina is for Virgins</a>, NOT Lovers\".\n</p><p>But it has a happy ending; in Mid-<a href=\"/cwcki/2005\" title=\"2005\">2005</a>, when I've started playing the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Yu-Gi-Oh\" title=\"Yu-Gi-Oh\">Yu-Gi-Oh</a> TCG, I met <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Megan\" title=\"Megan\">this girl</a> who upon numerous conversations, art-sharing and secret confidence, I've grown fond of, and my Heart and Soul Recovered from the Serious Emotional and Physical Pain I've endured. Although she's not intrested in a serious relationship, I still am fond of her, and I'm hoping that she may have a change of heart.\n</p><p>You may learn more about what had happened to me from the <a href=\"/cwcki/Sub-Episodes\" title=\"Sub-Episodes\">Sub-Episodes</a> in my <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\">\"Sonichu\" Comic Book</a>, which I have the legable images uploaded onto my <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC%27s_Sonichu_Site!\" title=\"CWC's Sonichu Site!\">CWC's Sonichu Site!</a>; those Sub-Episodes are based on my Real-Life Events. *sigh\n</p><p>Well, that's about it for now; I hope you do well as well. And I will make that DVD copy for you after I've finalized the master copy. Please tell the remaing faculty who are still working at Providence that I wish them the best as well. I still remember Mrs. Rogers (my ol' computer teacher) when she played as Woodstock in the 1996 \"Snoopy\" play; that was just fun and cute. :)\n</p><p>Take care;<br/>\nChristian Weston Chandler, A.K.A.

Like I said, Joshua is popular; he's got the looks and the height (about 6'2\").\n</p><p>After running to him at McDonalds at Forest Lakes a few weeks ago, he's kept in touch with me more than I would have after that day, and we've caught up in more or less the current events in our lives. He has become VERY Popular with the ladies, I tell you what. :D He's also hooked a few of his male acquaintances with a good gal each. I am no different.\n</p><p>Also, recently, Joshua received an extra Nintendo Wii console from a friend, so he sold it to me for a solid $240 (I saved about 22.49 in comparison to buying at a store after tax).\n</p><p>Megan broke up my emotions for her after the PaRappa contest, but we're still ONLY Friends. After that e-mail, I've moved on, back to the coal mines (so to speak). Granted that I have had absolutely no luck in having ANY women come to me while I hung out at the Alderman Library up to now. Joshua found a gal who WAS interested in me, after reading about me in my <a href=\"/cwcki/MySpace\" title=\"MySpace\">MySpace</a> profile at least.\n</p><p>Her name is <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Lori_Lopez\" title=\"Lori Lopez\">Lori Lopez</a>. I chatted with her through AOL Instant Message last night... &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3  She was really sweet, and not only did I have a great time getting to know her, but... *blush* I got turned on. I know that she works (at a car lot, I think), she is 23, brunette, brown eyes, and she is a mix of American and Spanish. If you've watched the movie, \"Into The Blue,\" the starring woman, Jessica Alba is an American/Spanish mix as well.<br/>\n=C<br/>\n2<br/>\nI'm keeping the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart_Search\" title=\"Sweetheart Search\">Sweetheart Search</a> details on my profile until I know for certain that Lori is really to be my <a href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart\" title=\"Sweetheart\">Sweetheart</a>. :)\n</p><p>I gtg; my cell phone number is still the same, so feel free to call me.\n</p><p>Take care;<br/>\nChris Chan.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p><br/>\n</p>\n<div style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4;padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<p>−−−−−Original Message−−−−−\n<br/>From: Matthew Kelly &lt;mkelly641@hotmail.co.uk&gt;\n<br/>To: cwcsonichu@aol.com\n<br/>Sent: Tue, 6 Nov 2007 8:16 pm\n<br/>Subject: Cease and desist\n</p><p>Mr. Chandler,\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Sonichucopyright.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"223\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/2/2c/Sonichucopyright.png/300px-Sonichucopyright.png\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/2/2c/Sonichucopyright.png/450px-Sonichucopyright.png 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/2/2c/Sonichucopyright.png/600px-Sonichucopyright.png 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Sonichucopyright.png\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Matthew Kelly's TRUE and ORIGINAL Sonichu</div></div></div>\n<p>Through anonymous sources, it has been made aware to me that you have established a fandom of sorts revolving around my character 'Sonichu'. As the proud writer/artist of the cult 'Sonichu' comic series - having recently enjoyed its fifth year since professional publication through the UK branch of Archie Comics after rough origins of self-publication starting in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/1998\" title=\"1998\">1998</a>, I am excitedly exploring the possibility of bringing the series to North American audiences - I am always one to help and provide information towards other aspiring artists. However, having seen the extent to which you have blatantly plagiarized my work, I feel it is necessary for me to step in. I ask you to view the sample image I have submitted, the cover for Sonichu #4 - clearly used as the exact template for the cover page of so-called CWC Comic's fourth issue of 'Sonichu'. Having spent much time and effort with the creation of characters such as Mary Lee Scott and Christopher Chandley, you can imagine my surprize upon discovering that not only had they been copied in their entirety, but the situations and conflicts they encounter had been directly stolen as well. Christopher's struggles to acquire a soul mate is the glue that has held my series together, and it is a serious blow to me to discover that someone has had the disrespect to use it for their own personal gain without any form of acknowledgment or citation. Perhaps even worse is the, frankly, childlike way you have gone about copying my work page-for-page. The sheer lack of artistic effort on your part is a true slap in the face, one that leaves me convinced that your plagiarism was done with the expressed intent to spite my efforts to make an honest living and support my girlfriend.\n</p><p>It is for these reasons, and the obvious financial liabilities on the part of Archie Comics UK, that I send you a cease and desist notice on ANY AND ALL physical or intellectual property relating to the Sonichu franchise, including the maintenance of your website under its current incarnation as 'CWC's Sonichu Site'. You are expected to remove all offending materials from all online sources with which you are in charge of within one week of November 6, 2007. Failure to comply with these demands will result in talks with the webmasters of Tripod and of Myspace to have aforementioned materials removed forcefully. Thank you for your compliance.\n</p><p>-Matthew David Kelly\n</p>\n</div>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"December\"><a href=\"/cwcki/2007#December\" title=\"2007\">December</a></span></h3>\n<div style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4;padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<p>−−−−−Original Message−−−−−\n<br/>From: CWCSonichu@aol.com\n<br/>To: sweet_angelvanessa162@yahoo.com\n<br/>Sent: Mon, 31 Dec 2007 12:12:17 AM Eastern Standard Time\n<br/>Subject: I've finished my freestyle heartfelt poem\n</p><p>So, here it is. Please share it with Megan and the Jessicas and the others.\n</p><p>For My True Love, I Would…<br/>\nA message from what’s left of my heart and soul,<br/>\nby Christian Weston Chandler, December 30, 2007\n</p><p>For my true love, I'd treat her tenderly, sweetly, gently...like a summer breeze. I'd caress her skin gently with my strong fingers. I'd take her to eat and <a href=\"/cwcki/Monthly_tugboat\" title=\"Monthly tugboat\">provide for her</a> to my ability. I'd start small at <a href=\"/cwcki/McDonald%27s\" title=\"McDonald's\">McDonalds</a>, then let it get <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Country_Cookin\" title=\"Country Cookin\">better</a> in due time. When the mood is right, I'd wisk her in my arms, and lift her up in sweet gentleness. I would share with her the BEST kiss of my life, and hopefully hers, since it would be the first of my life. I would do for her as much as I am able to in getting her the  she desires. Every day, I would try to make her smile with a jest, a spark, or a tender massage. If she is willing to allow the pleasure, I’d lay her down caress her gently tickle her fancy; have her tickle my fancy, and give it to her with the learned lonely experience I’ve endured. But I digress on that. Most importantly, I would hang on to her every word of her life tales, er feelings, her troubled times, and I’d share my condolences accordingly. And I can hope she would be willing to do the same for me. I am nothing without this woman, so I hope and pray that she will stay to love me for me, as I would stay with her for her. “I LOVE YOU” would be shared daily with a French side dish. J I am her soldier, to do for her as she sees fit.\n</p>\n</div>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n</p>\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"navbox\" style=\";\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"padding:2px;\">\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"nowraplinks collapsible mw-collapsed mw-collapsible\" style=\"width:100%;background:transparent;color:inherit;;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<th class=\"navbox-title\" colspan=\"2\" style=\";\"><div style=\"float:left; width:6em;text-align:left;\"> <span class=\"noprint plainlinksneverexpand\" style=\"white-space:nowrap; font-weight:normal; font-size:xx-small; ;;border:none;;\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Template:Emails\" title=\"Template:Emails\"><span style=\";;border:none;;\" title=\"View this template\">v</span></a> <span style=\"font-size:80%;\">•</span> <a href=\"/cwcki/Template_talk:Emails\" title=\"Template talk:Emails\"><span style=\"color:#002bb8;;;border:none;;\" title=\"Discussion about this template\">d</span></a> <span style=\"font-size:80%;\">•</span> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"//sonichu.com/w/index.php?title=Template:Emails&amp;action=edit\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#002bb8;;;border:none;;\" title=\"You can edit this template.
