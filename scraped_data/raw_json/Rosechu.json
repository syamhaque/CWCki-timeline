Having first created <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a>, he would inevitably have to turn to fashioning a girlfriend for his creation, based predominantly on <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Amy_Rose\" title=\"Amy Rose\">Amy Rose</a>, with minor elements from <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Raichu\" title=\"Raichu\">Raichu</a> added. Whereas the Sonic/Amy relationship is deliberately one-sided to create some drama and comedy, Christian prides himself on the fact that Sonichu and Rosechu have absolutely no sexual tension or any complications in their romance at all.\n</p><p>Intentionally or not, the entire Sonichu/Rosechu relationship serves as Christian's model for how he presumes he will interact with his eventual sweetheart. Sonichu's attraction to Rosechu is based entirely on a single wayward glance. He makes no effort to win her affection, and does not need to, as Rosechu falls for him instantly. They are rarely out of one another's sight, and all of their time together is spent kissing, snuggling or screwing. Christian does not depict Rosechu as an unequal partner within the relationship, but since she has almost no purpose or existence outside of her association with Sonichu, the character essentially serves as little more than an <a href=\"/cwcki/Kimmi\" title=\"Kimmi\">object</a> for Sonichu to periodically <a href=\"/cwcki/Semen\" title=\"Semen\">ejaculate</a> inside.\n</p><p>As <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">trolls</a> discovered Chris's weak spot for fan art of Rosechu with a penis, Christian responded with fervent attempts to prove Rosechu's femininity, drawing her less like the cartoonish Amy Rose and with greater attention to her breasts, hips, legs, underwear and cameltoe. This drive to assert Rosechu's sexuality, along with Chris's inevitable sexual attraction to his own character, probably contributed to Rosechu's increasing prominence in the comics. <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_8\" title=\"Sonichu 8\"><i>Sonichu</i> #8</a> is almost entirely about her, even featuring an instance of Rosechu displaying formidable powers (in an attack which needlessly involved face-to-vagina contact).\n</p><p>Chris developed a biography page for Rosechu and revealed that he had created her on 22 December <a href=\"/cwcki/2000\" title=\"2000\">2000</a>, over nine months after creating Sonichu. Nowhere on the page is there any mention of him using <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Amy_Rose\" title=\"Amy Rose\">Amy Rose</a> as a base. It should also be noted that this was done basically out of obligation, as Rosechu (one of the comic's main characters) did not have her own page until <a href=\"/cwcki/February_2010\" title=\"February 2010\">February 2010</a>, while <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Simonla\" title=\"Simonla\">Simonla</a>, a rather minor character, had one back in <a href=\"/cwcki/December_2009\" title=\"December 2009\">December 2009</a>. All information on Rosechu was originally to be found in a subsection of Sonichu's page, despite Chris's efforts to imply she is equal to him.\n</p><p>Chris recorded lines for Rosechu for the <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_World\" title=\"Sonic World\">Sonic World</a> fan game, hoping for a mod of the character. He speaks in a squeaky and high-pitched voice, uttering lines such as \"I'll kick your ass.\"\n</p><p>Her cheeks were originally red, same as Sonichu and the Pikachu evolutions, but later, on 6 November 2023, Chris <a href=\"/cwcki/November_2023_social_media_posts#Rosey's_yellow_cheeks\" title=\"November 2023 social media posts\">tweeted</a> that Rosechu's cheek sacs had become <a href=\"/cwcki/Yellow_Is_a_Mellow_Color\" title=\"Yellow Is a Mellow Color\">yellow</a> after she had \"practiced her electrics\" over the years. This is most likely an excuse for him not to have to pay attention to her unique Raichu ears, as he has commented on that in the same post.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Early_life\">Early life</span></h2>\n<p>In the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia\" title=\"CWCipedia\">CWCipedia</a> article for Rosechu, Chris gives a rambling, pointless backstory for Rosechu. According to Chris, Rosechu was raised by her parents: fathered by a <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxray\" title=\"wikipedia:Luxray\">Luxray</a> and mothered by a <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raichu\" title=\"wikipedia:Raichu\">Raichu</a>. The <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxray\" title=\"wikipedia:Luxray\">Luxray</a> hunts and does other masculine activities, while the Raichu stays home and <a href=\"/cwcki/Women%27s_rights\" title=\"Women's rights\">cooks dinner</a>. Chris gives the small group a family dynamic similar to that of humans (the notion of which is completely ridiculous in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Pok%C3%A9mon\" title=\"Pokémon\">Pokémon</a> universe). While still a <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pichu\" title=\"wikipedia:Pichu\">Pichu</a>, she was captured by a trainer, separating herself from family (though unlike <a href=\"/cwcki/Wild_Sonichu\" title=\"Wild Sonichu\">Wild Sonichu</a>, she expresses no emotion whatsoever about this as an adult).\n</p><p>The Pichu was taken in by <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor_Oak\" title=\"wikipedia:Professor Oak\">Professor Oak</a>, a character from the first-generation Pokémon games, and given to <a href=\"/cwcki/Kel\" title=\"Kel\">Kellie Felix</a> as a consolation for not having arrived in time to receive one of the traditional starters. This plot point is stolen directly from the Pokémon anime and <i>Pokémon Yellow</i>, which begin in almost the exact same way.\n</p><p>More extremely dull biographical information ensues, chiefly concerning Kel gathering a full team of Pokémon. Oddly, every one of her Pokémon has a human nickname (\"David,\" \"Ashley\", et cetera) but the Pichu is not given a nickname at all. The Pichu that would become Rosechu evolves into a Pikachu at one point, and at level 50 Kel uses a Thunder Stone to force it to evolve into a Raichu\n.\n</p><p>It's also interesting to point out that, unlike the other Sonichu/Rosechus in the comic, she is the only one to evolve fully clothed. Sonichu evolved with shoes on (somehow), the others seemed to as well, minus when Chris broke into Angelica's room, giving her shoes and a Scrunchy. When her children evolve, they do not share their mother's magic clothes evolution trait. Before her children, she was the only non-human character to be fully clothed while the other Sonichu/Rosechus run about naked or wear little to no clothing.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sexism\">Sexism</span></h2>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">She is not just a sex object; she is an individual with her own feelings, aspirations and opinions.\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:11px; padding:0 0 0 16px; vertical-align:bottom; width:20px\">”\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\" style=\"font-size:smaller; padding:8px 36px; text-align:right;\"><cite>Chris, <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_10#The_incredible_vanishing_email\" title=\"Mailbag 10\">explaining how he sees Rosechu as a sex object</a></cite>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>Since Chris knows virtually nothing about actual women and considers them completely different from men, he has no frame of reference for Rosechu's characterization beyond qualities that make her a perfect mate in his eyes. Beyond her relationship with Sonichu and her defiance of <a href=\"/cwcki/4-cent_garbage.com\" title=\"4-cent garbage.com\">4-cent garbage.com</a>, Chris will only have Rosechu partake in stereotypical female activities. She enjoys \"shopping\" for no other reason than Chris having deemed this as a compulsory feminine quality, as well as having long \"girly chats\" that can last for hours — as seen with her interaction with Amy Rose, whom according to Chris she does not resemble in any way. Despite all of the shopping she does, she always wears the same outfit in public (when she isn't making porn for <a href=\"/cwcki/Women%27s_rights\" title=\"Women's rights\">Women's rights</a>). Her only other hobbies seem to include lounging in fields of flowers, and playing the damsel in distress and constantly needing her man Sonichu to save her.\n</p><p>Also worth noting is that, unlike Sonichu, Rosechu didn't fall in love at first glance. According to the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia\" title=\"CWCipedia\">CWCipedia</a>, Rosechu only fell in love with Sonichu after he asked her to get him something to eat. <a href=\"/cwcki/Women%27s_rights\" title=\"Women's rights\">Subtle</a>.\n</p><p>Despite being <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Slow_in_the_minds\" title=\"Slow in the minds\">slower</a> than her counterpart,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup> and rarely showing any usefulness or fighting prowess (merely twice at last count), Chris claims that Rosechu is equal to her heartsweet in every way; she's just always \"caught off-guard\".<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup> This tactfully implies that although Rosechu is as formidable in potential as Sonichu against the forces of evil, she is too incompetent to perform this duty. Logically, since Rosechu was created from Raichu, the evolved form of Pikachu, from which Sonichu was created, she should be stronger than him in basically every regard, but her crippling handicap of being female robs her of this.\n</p><p>It is notable that her nickname is the <i>exact same</i> as the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Rosey\" title=\"Rosey\">baby form</a> of her species, in what is totally not an infantilization of her character. To Chris's credit, she probably had the nickname before Chris came up with the Sonee/Rosey idea. Also, this could simply be an emulation of the common term of endearment <i>\"baby\"</i> normal people use (but isn't likely to be considering Chris's unoriginality).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Rosechu_as_a_Trans_Woman\">Rosechu as a Trans Woman</span></h2>\n<div class=\"boilerplate metadata\" id=\"incomplete\">\n<table cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"background-color:#ffff88; border:5px outset #06c4ff;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Stress.jpg\"><img alt=\"Stress.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"91\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/2/2c/Stress.jpg/120px-Stress.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/2/2c/Stress.jpg/180px-Stress.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/2/2c/Stress.jpg/240px-Stress.jpg 2x\" style=\"vertical-align: bottom\" width=\"120\"/></a>\n</td>\n<td><p style=\"text-align: center;\"> <span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms\"><b>This article is still yet to be completed due to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress\" title=\"Stress\">stress</a>.</b></span></p><p> <span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms\">We get a lot of stressful torture in our lives that makes us crash into slumber.

The fourth generation of the <i>Pokémon</i> games introduced a sexually dimorphic feature for <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Raichu\" title=\"Raichu\">Raichu</a>; female Raichu have rounded tails, whereas the males have a defined point - the  latter being the original Raichu design, and as such the design of the Raichu that would become Rosechu. Rather than simply explaining that he had created the character before this gender-specific characteristic existed in the game art, Chris's reaction was to freak out in <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_writing\" title=\"Chris and writing\">CAPS LOCK</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/12_January_2010#Part_2\" title=\"12 January 2010\">scream into his camera</a>. This intense reaction, of course, meant that the trolls had found yet another one of Chris's hot-buttons.\n</p><p>Chris received <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_42#It_was_just_a_girl_that_had_all_the_physical_characteristics_of_a_boy\" title=\"Mailbag 42\">two</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_44#On_Rosechu's_man-parts\" title=\"Mailbag 44\">more</a> letters about Rosechu's transgendered nature before taking further action. He threw together a poorly photoshopped collage, declaring that it proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that Rosechu was female. Unfortunately for Chris, the page in the archives remained unedited. This was pointed out in <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_45#Caught_in_a_lie?_Just_delete_the_evidence\" title=\"Mailbag 45\">Mailbag 45</a>. Chris responded to the serious accusation of lying to his fans the only way he knew: by deleting the letter. Chris eventually used the obvious defense that the gender differences didn't exist when he drew the page in <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_51#Apologizing_deeply\" title=\"Mailbag 51\">Mailbag 51</a>, when a patient fan explained he should have done that all along.\n</p><p>When Chris created the Rosechu biography page, he mentioned that Rosechu had a blunt tail as a Raichu (contradicting his own art) and that it became pointed because of her transformation.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Rosechu_gender_poll_results.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"113\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/b/b7/Rosechu_gender_poll_results.png/300px-Rosechu_gender_poll_results.png\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/b/b7/Rosechu_gender_poll_results.png/450px-Rosechu_gender_poll_results.png 1.5x, /w/images/b/b7/Rosechu_gender_poll_results.png 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Rosechu_gender_poll_results.png\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Official poll results: Rosechu is transgender.</div></div></div>\n<p>On 6 <a href=\"/cwcki/December_2017\" title=\"December 2017\">December 2017</a>, under the influence of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys</a>, Chris took a complete 180 from his original viewpoint and confirmed that Rosechu was, indeed, hatched a male, believing she got an operation on her genitals so that she could give birth to her three children.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-Decposts_7-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Decposts-7\">[7]</a></sup>.\n</p>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">Rosechu is confirmed transgender as of tonight.
