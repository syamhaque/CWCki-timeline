As the post shows, Chris's <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_money\" title=\"Chris and money\">irresponsible spending habits</a> from the <a href=\"/cwcki/PlayStation_Network\" title=\"PlayStation Network\">PlayStation Network</a> quickly carried over to the Wii, Wii U and 3DS; among the titles Chris purchased for the platforms, the post states he purchased nearly all of the Virtual Console titles for 3DS, a whole bunch of shovelware, numerous redundant titles (including two sets of the same three <i>Pikmin</i> videos, one 3D and one 2D), and - most interestingly - both <i><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_Boom\" title=\"Sonic Boom\">Sonic Boom</a></i> titles for the 3DS and Wii U, despite his intense hatred of the franchise.\n</p><p>The following day, Chris made a <a href=\"/cwcki/Facebook\" title=\"Facebook\">Facebook</a> response to the post, claiming that the <i>Sonic Boom</i> games were a gift from <a href=\"/cwcki/Catherine\" title=\"Catherine\">Catherine</a> and that he only registered the 3DS game for <a href=\"/cwcki/Club_Nintendo\" title=\"Club Nintendo\">Club Nintendo</a> points.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Posting\">Posting</span></h2>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #CEF2CE; border:1px dotted #A3BFA3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>The below comes from a Nintendo of America employee.\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<blockquote><p>Consoles registered:<br/>\n</p><p>Nintendo 3DS x2<br/>\nNintendo DS<br/>\nNintendo DSi<br/>\nNintendo DSi XL x2<br/>\nWii<br/>\nWii U<br/>\n</p><p>Currently has 585 interactions in his account, this could be many things, but each one is a purchase in some way. Full game, virtual console title, DLC, in-game purchase, etc. This has occurred over a span of 4.5 years. So roughly 150 payments a year. This is by far the most I've ever seen, and was a big flag determining that this was actually Chris.\n</p><p>I'm fairly certain this can only be downloaded at the stadium, but he downloaded a 3DS app in 2013 that is exclusive for use in Safeco Field in Seattle. This occurred on 12/11/2013 at 7pm. It is likely that he took a trip? The app is \"Nintendo Fan Network at Safeco Field\"\n</p><p>His 3DS is eligible for the Ambassador Program, meaning he bought it at or close to launch in 2011.\n</p><p>Notible recent purchases:<br/>\nPokemon Omega Ruby<br/>\nPokemon Alpha Sapphire<br/>\nSonic Boom (Wii U, Physical)<br/>\nSonic Boom (3DS, digital)<br/>\nHyrule Warriors<br/>\nSmash Bros (Wii U)<br/>\nSmash Bros (3DS)<br/>\nCaptain Toad: Treasure Tracker<br/>\nSkylanders Trap Team<br/>\nAlmost every recent high profile VC release (Bionic Commando: Elite Forces, Duck Hunt, Super Mario Bros. Deluxe, Pokemon Pinball: Ruby &amp; Sapphire, Harvest Moon 3, many, many more)<br/>\nPikmin Short Movies (3D)<br/>\nPikmin Short Movies (HD) (This means he bought the same 3 movies on both systems for convenience sake, huge waste of money)<br/>\nUltimate NES Remix (He also owns NES Remix 1 and 2 for the Wii U, I thought it was weird that he'd buy this one too)<br/>\nMultiple Nintendo 3DS themes\n</p><p>SOME Notable strange/shovelware games for Chris to buy:<br/>\nTekken 3D<br/>\nWii Fit U<br/>\nFamily Tennis 3D<br/>\n3D Solitaire<br/>\nEvery single Anonymous Notes game<br/>\nFaceez! Monsters<br/>\nEvery single \"Learning with the PooYoos\"<br/>\nMany Airport Mania titles<br/>\nOutdoor's Unleashed: Africa 3D<br/>\nTokyo Crash Mobs<br/>\nSweet Memories: Blackjack<br/>\nPong Toss Pro - Frat Party Game<br/>s\nRock Zombie<br/>\nArrow Time U<br/>\nXtreme Sports<br/>\nThe Letter (EXTREME SHOVELWARE)<br/>\nPlain video Poker<br/>\nPoker Dice Solitaire Future<br/>\nCrazy construction<br/>\nVegas Stakes<br/>\nBearShark<br/>\nNaruto: Powerful Shippuden<br/>\nAir Battle Hockey 3D<br/>\nGardenscapes<br/>\nFamily Party: 30 Great Games Obstacle<br/>\n3D MahJong<br/>\nLittle Inferno<br/>\n3D Game collection<br/>\nEvery single Wii U Panorama View video. That's $2 each for cheap camera videos you watch on your Wii U\n</p><p>If I wrote all of these out I would literally be here for hours. Most of his non-virtual console purchases are just complete shovelware garbage that he paid for.\n</p><p>He honestly owns almost every single Virtual Console release for the Nintendo 3DS, as well as most of them for the Wii U. I have yet to find a single 3DS one that he does not own, from the ones at launch to every single one that comes out recently. This includes the 3D classics. That's an ABSURD amount of money.\n</p><p>He bought every single mini game in Rusty's Real Deal Baseball.\n</p><p>He purchases many virtual Console games many times over, including Wario's Woods, Soloman's Key, and Dr. Mario.\n</p><p>He plays almost every single game demo available on the eShop. This includes games that Chris clearly has no interest in, such as FIFA 13 and Jay Z's NBA 13.\n</p><p>Not unexpected, he owns every Sonic the Hedgehog game available on the 3DS and Wii U. As well as the DLC for Lost Worlds.\n</p><p>There was a series of House M.D. games he purchased. I think they're point and click? But I find it strange that he purchased House games. They're called \"Episode 1: Globetrotting\" and \"Episode 2: The Blue Meanie\". I thought that was weird.\n</p><p>That's pretty much all there is to report though. He owns almost every first party game on the 3DS and Wii U, including stuff like Style Savvy. Overall it's easy to tell that he's spent thousands and thousands of dollars on this over the last 4.5 years. He's the biggest account I've seen in the course of the months that I've been here.\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><span id=\"Chris.27s_response\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris's_response\">Chris's response</span></h2>\n<p>The following day, Chris discovered the post and made a response to it on <a href=\"/cwcki/Facebook\" title=\"Facebook\">Facebook</a>.\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>This is in response to the post below this one about the so-called list of my purchased Nintendo software. Direct to the point: I have sincerely NEVER purchased either Sonic Boom game. The 3DS game, however, was actually Hand Given to me as a Gift from my ex-girlfriend, Catherine's Cousin, Al, after out bowling outing in Early December, 2014; Last Month.\n<p>I have registered the 3DS card through my Club Nintendo account, and explicitly told them in the survey that game Was Gifted to me; I Had Not Purchased it, period.  And I Had shortly after received a copy of the Wii U Game In the Mail. I had disposed of the envelope, because there was no return address. I Would have registered that as well, but there as NO Club Nintendo code enclosed. I have Never booted or played either game, and I certainly never have inserted either card or disc into any of my handhelds or consoles at all ever. And to spare having it quoted in the comments below this point, or in any future comments and posts in this group or on my page: Being Gifted the thing you are protesting against against your initial will, regardless of acceptance out of being polite or whatever, it does NOT Change my position or aynthing integral of the Protest that I Have personally started and still am working towards the cause, period.\n</p><p>SEGA!!! CHANGE SONIC'S ARM COLOUR BACK IMMEDIATELY!!! YOUR BLUE ARMS HAVE HURT NOT ONLY ME IN A NUMBER OF GREAT WAYS, BUT COUNTLESS OTHER PEOPLE (GREATER THAN A THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS) AS WELL!!! YOU WILL PAY FOR YOUR LACK OF RECALL AND CORRECTIONS!!!\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>Chris ignores the fact that the post lists the Wii U <i>Sonic Boom</i> game as being a physical item, and that the 3DS game was apparently a digital download and not a physical copy like he claimed.\n</p><p><br/>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a class=\"external free\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150129021434/http://cwckiforums.com/threads/2015-01-13-nintendo-employee-reveals-details-of-chriss-nintendo-transactions.7042\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://web.archive.org/web/20150129021434/http://cwckiforums.com/threads/2015-01-13-nintendo-employee-reveals-details-of-chriss-nintendo-transactions.7042</a> (<a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://archive.ph/SUJx3\" rel=\"nofollow\">archive</a>)</span>\n</li>\n</ol></div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCached time: 20250307035847\nCache expiry: 86400\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: []\nCPU time usage: 0.038 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.041 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 60/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 2215/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 1606/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 4/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/100\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 730/5000000 bytes\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   11.422      1 -total\n 35.94%    4.105      1 Template:References\n 35.83%    4.093      1 Template:Quoteboxgreen\n 26.02%    2.972      1 Template:Quotebox\n-->\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key cwcki-1_:pcache:idhash:35887-0!canonical and timestamp 20250307035847 and revision id 325055.
