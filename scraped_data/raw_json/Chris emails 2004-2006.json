At this time, however, we do not have any plans to create a program that would allow the general public to evaluate games in their homes. The consumer electronics industry is highly competitive. For security reasons alone, we do not generally send games to individuals before we ship them to retail stores. \n</p><p>Also, most of our game testing is done by our own in-house Research and Development Teams. Having game evaluations done at a central location allows us to evaluate all games in the same way. Much of the evaluation process involves watching an evaluator's reaction as they play. Sometimes the information we obtain from watching a game evaluator is just as important, or more important, than the information they provide after they've played the game. \n</p><p>However, it may interest you to know that as a benefit of our My Nintendo Program, we recently sent out beta test discs to our NSider Community of Sages, making them the first public group to get hands on experience with one of our upcoming titles so that they could provide us with valuable feedback. We may offer similar opportunities in the future, so make sure to sign-up for our My Nintendo program, and participate regularly in Nintendo's official online forums and in Nintendo Power Chat sessions to become a Sage.\n</p><p>For additional information about becoming a Sage, head to www.nintendo.com/productregdes. In this section of our site, you'll find information on the three different membership levels that we have available: Member, Nsider, and Sage. For Sage, there will be a link for additional information on how to reach this top honor.\n</p><p>If you haven't already done so, you can sign-up for a My Nintendo membership and become part of Nintendo's extensive online world. If you choose to become a member of this exclusive community, you can maintain your Nintendo Power subscription (update addresses, review your account history, request a replacement issue), view the status of any order or repair, register qualifying products, and gain access to member only content such as our forums. And the best part is it's completely free!\n</p><p>Even if you are not a Sage, you still have the ability to let us know what you like. Each month Nintendo Power magazine has a Player's Poll Contest. This contest asks you to send in an information card concerning Nintendo games and products. We use this information to evaluate the success of current products and to develop plans for future products.

And she will often look down upon her beloved family, me, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Chandler\" title=\"Christian Chandler\">Christian Chandler</a>, my mother, <a href=\"/cwcki/Barbara_Chandler\" title=\"Barbara Chandler\">Barbara Chandler</a>, and my father <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Robert_Chandler\" title=\"Robert Chandler\">Robert Chandler</a>, and the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chandler_cats\" title=\"Chandler cats\">cats</a> who have grown fond of Patti.<br/><br/>\nI will always remember Patti for all the lovely memories she has shared with me from:<br/>\n-When I picked her out of the litter at my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Aunt_Corina\" title=\"Aunt Corina\">Aunt Corina</a>'s house in Redoak, Virginia.<br/>\n-The many walks I have shared with her around this neighborhood, as well as the neighborhood in the Newberry Towne subdivision in Richmond, Virginia.<br/>\n-The time I watched my old best friend, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sarah_Hammer\" title=\"Sarah Hammer\">Sarah Hammer</a>, take Patti by her front paws and danced a bit.<br/>\n-The times I've watched her stand on her hind legs and then rewarded her with a biscuit bone.<br/>\n-The time I took my camera to her pen and took this lovely picture of her and me, and I made a big deal how she'll be like a movie dog star.<br/>\n-The times I've just sat with her in the yard and petted her head. I've always given her a \"Bally-Scratch\" where I stroke her head with all five fingers like as if I was gently squeezing a rubber ball.<br/>\n-The many times I've fed her a can of food and a cup full of dry food, and refilled her bucket with fresh water so she can drink it and wash her face.<br/>\n-There was also the one time I saw her resting on top of her doghouse (not on her back like Snoopy).<br/>\n-I've often wondered why between both her ears, why one was bent and the other was straight like an arrowhead.<br/>\n</p><p>When Patti was brought to the vet on that faithful day, I was distraught with fright and concern for her health. I stayed with her during her final moments with a hand on her head and a tear in my eye. When my mother was brought the paper that gave the doctor permission to send her on her way, I didn't want her to be the one to sign it. I raised Patti since she was a six-week old pup, and I wanted to take the strain for signing the one-way ticket (it was hard for me, but it was for the best). So I signed that paper, with a crying <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a> face saying, \"We love you, Patti.\" After that, I gave her my final  pets, hug, hand-to-paw hold, eye-contact, ear-rub, cheek-to-fur rub, and I sadly waved her for the final time, and I said, \"Good Bye, Patti, I Love You.\" <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">As I stood outside, I heard Patti's last barks saying, \"I will always love you, Chris. Thank You.\"</a><br/>\n</p><p>But we all must move on with our lives with our beloved lucky mutt in our hearts and in our memories. So, Patti, may your old dog house and surrounding flowers forever memorialize your blessed heart, your barks at the stars and strangers, and your loyal love that you have blessed upon me and my family and friends. Bark on, and rest in peace, our beloved lucky Patti.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notes\">Notes</span></h2>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">In his Facebook posts pertaining to the <a href=\"/cwcki/Original_Sonichu_and_Rosechu_Drawing#Fifth_Listing\" title=\"Original Sonichu and Rosechu Drawing\">Original Sonichu and Rosechu Drawing</a>, Chris has revealed that he uses the email address \"IAMMRC@aol.com\".
