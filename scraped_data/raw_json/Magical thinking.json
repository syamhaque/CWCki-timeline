With the \"kidnapping\" of Liquid, he then realized that he had \"the power\" really to curse people. He also developed a new ability to bless people via the <a href=\"/cwcki/Curse-ye-ha-me-ha_Retraction\" title=\"Curse-ye-ha-me-ha Retraction\">Forgiveness Blessings</a> skill. He honestly seems to believe that these powers are real, even stating in one video that if it works, then he knows he has \"the power.\" Chris later stated in a music video that if people antagonize him, they will be cursed, but if you're TRUE and HONEST, you will receive blessings.\n</p><p>The most notorious example is the curse-ye-ha-me-ha, a power that supposedly bestows terrible fortune upon the recipient. Chris has performed this curse on innumerable occasions, both over the Internet and in public. He has even retracted the curse (<a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_remorse\" title=\"Chris and remorse\">albeit reluctantly</a>) on at least three occasions<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup> with a \"Forgiveness Blessing\" which further cements Chris's belief in its efficacy.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Healing_Powers\">Healing Powers</span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:202px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Chris_Healing.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"112\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/0/03/Chris_Healing.png/200px-Chris_Healing.png\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/0/03/Chris_Healing.png/300px-Chris_Healing.png 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/0/03/Chris_Healing.png/400px-Chris_Healing.png 2x\" width=\"200\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Chris_Healing.png\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Chris demonstrating his healing powers to a bewildered Art M. in a strange <a href=\"/cwcki/File:156-CWCMegan1.jpg\" title=\"File:156-CWCMegan1.jpg\">unintentional homage to another famous photo</a>.</div></div></div>\n<p>One of the earliest examples of Chris' magical delusions are the powers of healing. In 2013, he made a post claiming that My Little Pony taught that friendship could provide both magic AND healing.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup> In 2018, he would begin to obsess over <a href=\"/cwcki/Magic_stones\" title=\"Magic stones\">magical pebbles</a> with purported healing properties due to interference from the <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys.</a> From mid 2019, Chris would start to believe that he was being possessed by <a href=\"/cwcki/Magi-Chan\" title=\"Magi-Chan\">Magi-Chan</a> and as of such could perform many of Magi-Chan's magical powers, with one such ability of his being the ability to heal others. He would use his healing <b>touch</b> on Barb, and demonstrated his ability on Art M. (TheGamerFromMars) in December of that year. \n</p><p>Chris' obsession with healing seemed to grow more and more over the years, to the point where he believed he could use his healing abilities regardless of whether he was \"possessed\" or not, no doubt contributing to his <a href=\"/cwcki/Messiah_complex\" title=\"Messiah complex\">messiah complex</a>. In 2020, Chris - whilst roleplaying as Sonichu - claimed that praying to Chris would cure others of illness and disease, and in 2021 Chris frequently mentioned the phrase \"self-healing\" either as a prayer or to describe his own mental state. Whilst the term \"self-healing\" is never properly defined by Chris, it's likely meant to just be emotional recovery with a superstitious tinge.\n</p><p>Unfortunately, due to <a href=\"/cwcki/Affair_with_Mother\" title=\"Affair with Mother\">recent events,</a> the term has adopted a more <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC-isms#heal\" title=\"CWC-isms\">sinister meaning.</a>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Voodooism\">Voodooism</span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:202px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Sept13_Imgur_31.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"268\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/d/da/Sept13_Imgur_31.jpg/200px-Sept13_Imgur_31.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/d/da/Sept13_Imgur_31.jpg/300px-Sept13_Imgur_31.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/d/da/Sept13_Imgur_31.jpg/400px-Sept13_Imgur_31.jpg 2x\" width=\"200\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Sept13_Imgur_31.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div><a href=\"/cwcki/Lego\" title=\"Lego\">Lego</a> voodoo dolls of <a href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Schroeder\" title=\"Megan Schroeder\">Megan Schroeder</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Michael_Snyder\" title=\"Michael Snyder\">Michael Snyder</a>, and <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Mary Lee Walsh</a>, whom Chris blames for his life problems.</div></div></div>\n<p>In Chris's case, he seems to believe that his tirades and tantrums will somehow affect his perceived enemies. His attacks on the <a href=\"/cwcki/Clown_Doll\" title=\"Clown Doll\">Clown Doll</a>, for instance, are a metaphorical threat, but also suggest an attempt at somehow literally harming the trolls through <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sympathetic_magic\" title=\"wikipedia:sympathetic magic\">sympathetic magic</a>, like a voodoo doll. He views his revenge against his enemies in the comic or in <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Soul_Calibur\" title=\"Soul Calibur\">Soul Calibur III</a></i> as being equivalent to actual revenge, rather than simply venting.\n</p><p>In <a href=\"/cwcki/September_2013\" title=\"September 2013\">September 2013</a>, Chris created voodoo dolls out of <a href=\"/cwcki/Lego\" title=\"Lego\">Lego</a> to represent <a href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Schroeder\" title=\"Megan Schroeder\">Megan Schroeder</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Michael_Snyder\" title=\"Michael Snyder\">Michael Snyder</a>, and <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Mary Lee Walsh</a>, people who refused to cave into Chris's demands, earning them the title of \"The Top Three Fiends and Enemies of [Chris's] lifetime\". He derived satisfaction from tormenting the dolls by  shaking them in a container and leaving them upside down.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:202px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Legotrumppence.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"150\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/a/a2/Legotrumppence.jpg/200px-Legotrumppence.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/a/a2/Legotrumppence.jpg/300px-Legotrumppence.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/a/a2/Legotrumppence.jpg/400px-Legotrumppence.jpg 2x\" width=\"200\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Legotrumppence.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Chris hangs Lego effigies of <a href=\"/cwcki/Pmurt\" title=\"Pmurt\">Pmurt</a> and Pence.</div></div></div>\n<p>Chris again used voodooism as part of his tantrum over <a href=\"/cwcki/Pmurt\" title=\"Pmurt\">Pmurt</a> becoming president. Upon learning of the election results, he <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Eid,_Pmurt,_Eid!!!\" title=\"Eid, Pmurt, Eid!!!\">kicked a Transformers toy meant to represent President-elect Trump</a>. Following this, he created effigies of Trump and Vice Presidential pick Mike Pence out of Lego and hanged them.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Spirit_realm\">Spirit realm</span></h3>\n<p>The world of <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a> is also a spirit realm, where Chris is almighty and can create and shape it as he pleases due to his power of \"creativity\". It exists outside, but parallel, to the real world, and sometimes Chris seems to honestly believe that it's a real place, even if it's just imaginary. The idea of this spirit realm became more valid when, in a <a href=\"/cwcki/Asperchu_is_a_Horrendous_Joke\" title=\"Asperchu is a Horrendous Joke\">video</a>, Chris claimed that the soul of his <a href=\"/cwcki/Patti_Chandler\" title=\"Patti Chandler\">dead dog</a> (now <a href=\"/cwcki/Patti-Chan\" title=\"Patti-Chan\">living in CWCville</a>) would devour Alec Benson Leary's soul and haunt his <a href=\"/cwcki/Dreams\" title=\"Dreams\">dreams</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sorcery\">Sorcery</span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Thoushaltnotsufferacwctolive.JPG\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"176\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/e/e5/Thoushaltnotsufferacwctolive.JPG/300px-Thoushaltnotsufferacwctolive.JPG\" srcset=\"/w/images/e/e5/Thoushaltnotsufferacwctolive.JPG 1.5x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Thoushaltnotsufferacwctolive.JPG\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Thou shalt not suffer a CWC to live.</div></div></div>\n<p>Through Chris's perception of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/God\" title=\"God\">God</a> as an instrument of his will comes the delusion that he has magical powers that will permit him to eventually succeed over the enemies that he is unable to dispatch by any more conventional means.\n</p><p>Chris's sorcery was among his more egregious behaviors that were not merely atypical of a Christian, but in fact explicitly proscribed by his faith. <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=galatians%205:19-20&amp;version=KJV\" rel=\"nofollow\">Galatians 5:19-20</a> lists witchcraft as one of the more blatant acts of sin, and <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+22%3A18&amp;version=KJV\" rel=\"nofollow\">Exodus 22:18</a> commands \"thou shalt not suffer a witch to live\". That's right, there's a Biblical mandate for Chris's death. Alec Benson Leary, in one of his <a href=\"/cwcki/Alec_Benson_Leary_Phone_Call_8\" title=\"Alec Benson Leary Phone Call 8\">phone calls</a> with Chris, attempted to point out the thoroughly un-Christian nature of Chris's dabbling in black magic, but his reasoning appeared to have little effect. Of course, his magical practices have only become even more blatant since proclaiming himself a CPU goddess, including threatening trolls on social media with supernatural retribution, meted out by himself.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Dimensional_Merge\">Dimensional Merge</span></h3>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Dimensional_Merge\" title=\"Dimensional Merge\">Dimensional Merge</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>The dimensional merge is Chris's grandest and most convoluted magical thinking to date. The <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys</a> created the concept and brainwashed Chris into believing it, and he has since made it a major part of his day-to-day life. Chris <i>actually believes</i> he is a goddess who has the ability to merge this dimension (<a href=\"/cwcki/Dimensions#1218\" title=\"Dimensions\">1218</a>) with alternate dimensions home to every fictional character created- including his very own <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(character)\" title=\"Sonichu (character)\">Sonichu</a>. \n</p><p>For Chris, getting to see Sonichu in real life is probably enough to warrant a fantasy of this caliber, though his motivation for the merge is deeply rooted in personal (and very real) failures. From his <a href=\"/cwcki/Financhu_Crisis\" title=\"Financhu Crisis\">financial woes</a> to his lack of a significant other, Chris plans for the dimensional merge to fix his life: not only will all Chris's funds from CWCville be transferred to him, his <a href=\"/cwcki/Polyamorous_marriage\" title=\"Polyamorous marriage\">polyamorous marriage</a> to four Pokémon will be official. If Chris has a problem, you can bet the merge has a solution for it.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Necromancy\">Necromancy</span></h3>\n<p>Chris also appears to believe that he can, to an extent, <a href=\"/cwcki/Sarah_May_Skype_Logs\" title=\"Sarah May Skype Logs\">talk to the deceased</a>. He told <a href=\"/cwcki/Sarah_May\" title=\"Sarah May\">Sarah May</a> that when he touched his dead <a href=\"/cwcki/Aunt_Corrina\" title=\"Aunt Corrina\">Aunt Corrina</a>'s hand, he could hear her spirit, along with the spirits of his grandparents and great-grandparents. He also claimed that <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/GodJesus\" title=\"GodJesus\">GodJesus</a> told him to \"make the trip and go to Julie\". Additionally, Chris believes that he can harness the spirits of the dead to do his bidding, notably when he threatened <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Megan\" title=\"Megan\">Megan</a> with revenge by him and his <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler\" title=\"Bob Chandler\">father</a>'s ghost, and when he warned <a href=\"/cwcki/Alec_Benson_Leary\" title=\"Alec Benson Leary\">Alec Benson Leary</a> that <a href=\"/cwcki/Patti_Chandler\" title=\"Patti Chandler\">his dead dog</a> would <a href=\"/cwcki/Asperchu_is_a_Horrendous_Joke\" title=\"Asperchu is a Horrendous Joke\">have his soul for dinner and haunt his nightmares</a>. During his time masquerading as <a href=\"/cwcki/JenkinsJinkies\" title=\"JenkinsJinkies\">JenkinsJinkies</a> on <a href=\"/cwcki/Trollin_Train\" title=\"Trollin Train\">Trollin Train</a>, Chris hoped to dissuade trolls by claiming that his house was haunted, describing <a href=\"/cwcki/Trollin_Train#Hey.2C_the_Equipment_and_the_Digging_.28Thu_26_Aug_2010_5:12_AM.29\" title=\"Trollin Train\">an alleged encounter</a> with the vengeful ghosts of Patti and <a href=\"/cwcki/Christopher%27s_name_change\" title=\"Christopher's name change\">his younger self</a>.
