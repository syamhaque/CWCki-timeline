Oh, yeah, you were... [Kacey starts talking over him]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Actually, Chris, I think you agreed with ME, because you didn't even know about reformed healthcare, you just knew about socialist healthcare.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hm. Yeah, that's true, I did, I did agree with you. And then you kind of agreed with you know, when I was talking about, about my father and me going down to Tom Perriello's office, and then he brought that up...but yeah, I was like agreeing with him at the time as well, but, yeah and then you, then when you talked, you kind of agreed with him a little bit too.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Right....Well do you have any other questions?

And, um, she Googled your name, and you know, some of the things that the trolls have been saying, I mean, I think they might be true, I mean what is, you know, it's disturbing, and it's making me really uneasy especially since, you know, you've said you think about me to such a degree, and I mean, it's just like...I mean, I know you've talked about the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/ED\" title=\"ED\">ED</a> site before, but I mean, is a lot of that true? Like, uh, why are you doing half those things in those videos? And, I thought you were anti-gay, and you're <a href=\"/cwcki/April_16_Fetish_Vids#Fanta:_Semen_Flavor\" title=\"April 16 Fetish Vids\">drinking your own cum</a>?? It's gross!

Do they make you do that?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uh, no...As for the uh...yeah...I pretty much volunteered myself to be doing that, cause it was like, you know, I considered it like <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Recycling\" title=\"Recycling\">recycling</a>, so it's like, you know, I didn't have to lose it...and plus you know I read on the internet there was like health benefits [unintelligible]\t\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Health benefits of what, of doing that?!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> There's, there's no real health benefits, those are all myths, I mean it doesn't help your hair, it doesn't help your nails, there's not enough protein in it. I mean, is that the whole reason you did it?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Anyway, anyway, I've stopped, anyway, I've stopped doing that months ago.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well that's GOOD, but, I mean, there's no point in doing it. I mean...I...I...I mean especially not if you were so anti-gay. I mean, it's just, I mean most people would see that and go, \"Wow, this guy must be at least bisexual!\"\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>sigh</i>] Yeah, okay yeah, I can definitely see it from your point of view and I understand. [sigh] Yeah, but I take it like... you know...I learn from my mistakes, and...yeah... I've grown to the understanding and whatnot. Um, anyway, mostly other stuff like you know the posts...and the videos, and me drawing, you know, <a href=\"/cwcki/File:CWCsonichuduck.JPG\" title=\"File:CWCsonichuduck.JPG\">drawin' on my dick</a>, and pictures of that, yeah...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Okay well, [<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> \"I was talking!\"] Hey, no, no, let me go! Okay, another thing that really disturbed me is, apparently, you told these trolls that you, uh, that you <a href=\"/cwcki/DIRTY,_CRAPPED_BRIEFS\" title=\"DIRTY, CRAPPED BRIEFS\">shit yourself</a>? I mean, what the hell, Chris?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [in an odd falsetto] Ehh, I prettty much...yeah...I mean, I'm more in control of my bowel movements nowadays, and yeah, I...

If it happened recently those are lies.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Okay, okay but [Chris repeats \"the last time I\" over and over] you've got to see that all this stuff is disturbing to me.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hmm. Yeah I can, I can, I can relate to that. I can understand how you feel. Yeah. I, I would be uneasy too if I was, if I wasn't myself and I was reading that, you know, about myself or...yeah. Hm, oh yeah, most of the information they got on that ED page...[pause] it's like conned out of me, they conned out of me from pretending to be the past women I've talked to like <a href=\"/cwcki/Blanca_Weiss\" title=\"Blanca Weiss\">Blanca... Weiss</a> or uh...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Okay but you can't blame other people.

I mean, this is why your parents are mad at you right now!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, plus I was more gullible back then. And I'm, [<i>sheepish</i>] I've been less gullible for the past few months. And now. [long silence] I've learned from my mistakes. I'm working on these things and I'm moving on from, I'm moving on and trying to put all that behind me. And plus, I've, I've got a responsible detective, uh, up in the FBI to take, to help, to help to towards the down-taking of the website and the downfall of the trolls.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Okay, but still, Chris, I mean, Chris you need to understand this stuff is kind of disturbing, and I mean like, okay look, like, I mean, like stuff you <i>do</i> in real life. Like, if most people touched me as much as you did, I would've gone off with them, but I mean, I'm trying to be polite because I know you have difficulties, and I mean that you, like you say \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Slow-in-the-mind\" title=\"Slow-in-the-mind\">slow-in-the-mind</a>\", but I mean, you've gotta understand you can't keep doing this shit.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I understand that...[<i>pause</i>] I understand that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> And besides, you keep saying that the cops don't care about things. I mean, you've really gotta let some of this stuff <i>go</i>! I mean, I mean don't be slow-in-the-mind with that! I mean, if they don't care they're not, they're never gonna help you, and even just one lone detective isn't gonna be able to do anything!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>long silence</i>] Yeah...Yeah also I did go to Tom Periello a little about that and talk to him about that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, I mean, what exactly is he gonna <i>do</i>?

[pause] And I mean, yeah, I've been relating with that as well, and...it's just one of the things I try not to think, that's just one of the bad pieces, that like you know.

Okay, Jack Thaddeus got hold of my Playstation Network accounts, and uh, then I tried, then I called up, like, called the American Playstation company, and uh, got both of my American accounts back but I was put on a one-month ban because they considered it like, gamesharing, and that was my, my third strike against me on that. And they're like, you know, next time it might be permanent.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Okay, then cut your losses. Is it really worth it?

[<i>sighs</i>] You know, your may contain[?] more about how the accounts are linked, like you know, the PlayStation titles and the titles that go to, that can be copied to the PSP-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> It doesn't matter, it's a video game! You cut your losses and you tell them \"Fine, take it!\" Then, I mean, then, it's not worth it!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I put better than two thousand dollars on my main American account.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Whoa, WHOA! You've spent two thousand dollars on video games!? Why would you EVER spend that much on video games? What did you get?!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Plus, and plus this was over the course of like, two, three years.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [Talking over Chris] I haven't spent that much on video games in two to three years! [laughing]\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, ehh, I didn't have a girlfriend...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Even if it's two years, it's a thousand dollars a year!

And they do nothing!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [long pause before sigh] Anyway, getting back to, anyway, getting back to, getting back on track here. Yeah, I got my American accounts back. I had trouble tryin' to get back my Japan, and my Spain which those are important to me 'cause- [unintelligible]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Why would you, why would you even have that many accounts? Isn't an American account just good enough? And, okay-\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [splutters incoherently as Kacey continues to talk] I like getting, I, you, Kacey, I like getting imports. [stress sigh]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> How would they be able to get all of them? Okay, but why would they be able to get all of them at ONCE? I mean, did you make them all the same password? I mean, all those, okay, you can't have that many accounts, that's like fraud and stuff!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>Sigh</i>] Okay, well-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Just I mean, how did they, how did they get them?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Okay, personally I had like, a multiple number of email addresses, and uh, multip-, uh, different passwords for all of them. Uh, upon the reaching of that for Jack Thaddeus, I sh-, I pretty much, uh, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Kim\" title=\"Kim\">Kim</a>, a-, Kim asked me to uh, share the, uh, for me to share the inf-, share my Playstation information with her, 'cause she has a Playstation 3 and-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>furiously interrupts</i>] Are you blaming Kim?!

But anyway, she had to, I had told her the uh, the uh, information and the, the uh, the usernames and the passwords for the majority, and then she uh-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Okay, Chris, Chris? You know what, okay let's go back to something-\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Instead of my-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Hey, hey. Hey! HEY! CHRIS! [shouts over him to get his attention] Let's go back to something. You said you spent over $2000. Okay. You are on an income, which taxpayers like myself, pay. How much do you spend on video games a WEEK?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>Sigh</i>] I'm not sure.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Okay. You can't even keep track of that. What gives you the right to take that money, and to spend $2000 of it on video games? Where, that, I mean, I can't even buy myself video games, so why should I pay for you to just spend your money on all this?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Most of my income goes, goes towards my family. Uh, paying them a monthly rent of $250, they've gone twice [unintelligible] the bills...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [Talking over him] No, that doesn't matter! That doesn't matter! It doesn't matter what you pay like that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I pay, I, I only get like two, I only get like 200 out my 800 a MONTH.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Then WHY would you spend that much on games? That makes even LESS sense! I mean, okay, with these games that you spent so much money on, how much do you even PLAY them a week? How much do you even play them?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [Long pause] On a near daily basis.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> All of them? [Disbelieving] All 2000 dollars?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [Pause] The majority of it, yes.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Okay, I find that hard to believe. I mean, and even if you were, don't you think maybe, you should be, like, like you were talking about getting a job! Like, how are you gonna be able to do that, and playing all these games at once? You should be, uh, I mean, like have you even done anything MORE besides going to the Social Security office?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [Pause, sigh] Yeah. I was gonna call Mr. Will yesterday and find out more about that working ticket, but unfortunately, uh, yeah- yeah, today is still Friday. I was gonna call him today, but then the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress\" title=\"Stress\">stress</a> happened yesterday, and I had to take the emotional day today. I just didn't feel up to making the call today, and-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Chris! Then how are you ever gonna work? How are you ever gonna work? You can't just have emotional days like that. I mean, you either work or you don't. I mean, you've gotta grow up a little!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I n-, I, I've been growing up! I've been growing up. It's just so mu-, it's just a, a whole lot for me to think about.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, this is why your parents are mad at you! I can <i>see</i> why they're mad at you![Chris sighs deeply] I mean, do they even know you spent that much on video games? And that you just like, I, I, I'd, oh my gosh! [Chris sighs] I mean, I don't, I didn't want to go in to work today, and I went in! I didn't want to go to school today, and I went! And I mean, and I've been having problems with sinuses, and, I mean, come on!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [Sigh] I, I mean, I mean, if I did have a job, and all that, uh, so many complications. I, uh, when I got my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tugboat\" title=\"Tugboat\">Social Security</a> at first, I was, at first I, you know, like, I think it was about-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [talks over him] Chris, Chris, if you-\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [keeps talking] Two thousand two or three-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> -really only get 200 dollars a month, how did you GET all that money for those video games? Did you steal it?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I get 800, for your information, no. For your information, I get 800 dollars a month.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> No, but you said you only get, you just said you only get 200 out of it 'cause your parents TAKE the rest. I mean, so, how did you, I mean, that would have taken you a long time, and, and that's if you've never spent any other money on anything but video games. Where did you get that money?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, well, I-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Be honest.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> It, it, it did come out of the, uh, remaining 200. I spend like 100, 150 out of that per month.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> There's no way you could have mathematically have done that and only spent your 200 on video games. Where did you get the rest of that money, and please be honest with me.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [Sigh] Uh, between credit car-, between credit cards and- [Unintelligible, says something about his mother]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You have credit cards? Are they yours? [Gasps] You took your parents' credit cards for video games?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> No, no, not my parents', they were my own credit cards. I actually applied for those. They had my name on 'em.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Why would you <i>do</i> that? [Long pause] You, you don't have a-\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I'm a gamer!\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> No, that doesn't matter, but you need to be smart about it! You don't have a job! I mean, you've gotta be in so much debt!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [Sigh] Yeah well, you know, but-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Chris, how are you gonna get this family you want if you have all this debt? I mean, and how do you pay off the credit cards?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, fortunately my, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bob\" title=\"Bob\">my father</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Barb\" title=\"Barb\">my mother</a> have decided to help me out there. They're paying my credit card bills and I'm paying them back.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> And you think they're gonna be there forever? You think they're always going to clean up after your mistakes?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> No, no, I know they're not gonna clean up after my mistakes forever. And I, I'm not gonna make those mistakes again.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I don't know, Chris. This has given me a lot to think about.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [Sigh] Well, if you want to talk-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Maybe if you just would've not tried to be so serious, like I asked, I mean just, you know, ba-, but, I, you know, I had to get, I, this whole thing is just so suspicious.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [Sigh] Eh, wait a minute, this whole thing?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Just everything! Everything that I, that I've been getting! In these emails! [Chris tries to talk] Everything my aunt found! [Chris sighs] Come on, don't act like you don't know what we're talking about. [Chris begins talking over her] You know that the trolls have been trolling me.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I d-, I do. I, I, I know, but, I know what we're talking about. I'm just processing it and remembering in my <i>head</i>.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I know but I mean, you said you had a degree, right? So um, why aren't you doing anything with it? Like, when I get mine, I mean, I'm getting my PhD. I'm gonna be getting over $100,000 a year. What're YOU gonna be able to do? You've gotta THINK about that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [Sigh] Look, my father tol-, my father enc-, encouraged me to get the, to go to a, <a href=\"/cwcki/CADD\" title=\"CADD\">computer drafting and design</a> degree, he encouraged me to go to <a href=\"/cwcki/Piedmont_Virginia_Community_College\" title=\"Piedmont Virginia Community College\">college</a> in the first place!\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Then why aren't you using it?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I mean, because I don't know! I don't know how. I, I mean, I don't, I, I, I, I...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You apply for a job that says you need this degree!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I know I have the compu-, a drafting and design degree and certificate, I've been taught that, I'd have to build buildings and whatever on the computer, about that, that-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> So why don't you do that instead of making a resume that has Sonichu and Rosechu on it? I know they're in a very important part of your life, but you could actually go do something.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [Sigh] Because, I just, uh, I just feel more comfortable with drawing the comics and the cartoons, than I do with the, uh, with just the, uh, with just the buildings and the computers and whatnot.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Okay, well you know what? Well I feel a lot better drawing and doing, you know, singing and stuff than I do waitressing, but you know what? I have to be a productive member of society, and I have to go out and do my job every freaking day whether I rather be home talking to my friends, or going shopping, or doing whatever.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [long pause] I see.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I mean, my aunt has done factual independent research, and found out a lot of these things are true that she found out. On her own. [Chris sighs] I mean, you can't-\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [Trying to interrupt] I keep feeling-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> -always blame everything with the trolls and ED.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Okay, yeah, I'll admit that, you know, some of the things in the ED are true, but you know, they just take it and they-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [Talking over Chris] Yes, I know that, I just told you they were!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> -but they warp it around! They sla-, they make it worse. They're rewording it.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> But Chris, she has been able to verify this information in other places. I just said that it wasn't all ED.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [Sigh] I... [unintelligible]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You need to start taking responsibility! I mean, I don't think anyone I know wants to stay in their job the whole time but I mean, I mean don't you wanna be a productive member of society? Don't you want- don't you want to go through your own potential? Maybe Sonichu and Rosechu isn't doing it right now, maybe you need to get your foot in the door first.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I'm working on getting my foot in the door. I'm gonna buy a new co-, I'm gonna buy new a printer/scanner/copier next week, I'm gonna print out-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> For what? How is that gonna help you with your, with your CADD degree? How is that gonna help you utilize something that you went to school for?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I'm going to print out copies of my <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_0\" title=\"Sonichu 0\">number zero book</a> and then some, to send to Marvel, Dark Horse, and Archie comics with my resume, so then Sonichu and Rosechu books could be actually made to get me paper-published, and the merchandise to follow, the video games and all that, so that I could get a (good job) (?) - [Kacey interrupts]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> What if that doesn't work? What's your safety net? What if that doesn't work? [Pause, Chris sighs] Chris, loo-, look at Sonichu. It, it's not bad, but what if they don't like it? I mean, it's nothing like, you know, like any other comic books I've seen, and I mean, you, you hijack your own, your own comic and make it about <i>you</i>.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, that's true. But still, I mean, at least I have a worldwide <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Fanbase\" title=\"Fanbase\">fanbase</a>, I'm very popular! I mean, that's even more than enough for any comic book company to uh, want to, want to accept me, and uh, let me work for them.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, even if you have a fanbase, you know, they have, they, they don't go, they just aren't gonna-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [\"hire you\"] -off of your fanbase. I mean, especially if you don't have factual proof of how many there are. They're going to show it to, um, groups that they have that do this for a <i>living</i>, and what happens if they don't like it? I mean, you need a backup plan. I can't believe you have a degree that's just sitting around gathering dust. You went to college! I mean, if I went to college, and just let my degree just sit there, and never got certified, or licensed...I mean what's the whole point? You, you've gotta do something with it.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [sigh] Yeah, maybe-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Don't you think that would make your parents proud?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, my, I would like to make my parents proud. There's so many things in my life I'd like to do. As a matter of fact, you know, during the whole time, even, even while earning my degree, I never actually <i>had</i> a job game plan, during that, during that time, and even after I got my degree, I just did not know where to go. Just like I, just like the uh- [Kacey interrupts]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> They have career centers at every college for that! [Chris tries to talk, Kacey continues] But then, no, which, you can't even contact now, because you freaking, uh, you got yourself an order where you can't even go there! I mean, they have counselors to help, and you screwed that over, over- this stupid stuff! H-, how, how, why?!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [sigh] <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Mary Lee Walsh</a> got me very mad.

Just to reference.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Look, just because she didn't like how you were trying to get a girlfriend, does not equal you not being able to go on with your life.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [long pause, sigh]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> There are, there, I mean, okay, you, also, like let's, okay, you are on disability.

I mean, the only thing I'm looking at is that you're saying that, I mean, I just don't know. I mean, especially with you wanting to be a househusband, I mean is just, having sex and a girlfriend more important than having a job, than being a MAN?

I mean, come on! Why don't, why don't you research this? You could go to Wikipedia, for God's sakes, and find out what you can do with a CADD degree. [short pause] You just want to sit around and collect your <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tugboat\" title=\"Tugboat\">tugboat</a> for the rest of your life, don't you.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> No, I don't want to just sit around, and collect my tugboat...

I didn't know what to DO.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, you're gonna stay lost until you actually DO something!

Why aren't you going into art or something?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [long sigh] I didn't think of that when I first applied for a degree- (?)\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [interrupting] Why don't you do something now? I mean, I'm only one year younger than you, and I'm going to school now. I changed my major, it's not hard. And, you CAN get help. It's a lot harder for me.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> ...Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Some people have multiple degrees. I mean, look at me.

Just, something tells me you're just not.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I'm going to do something! I just...I'm just...processing all this in my head, so then I can figure out, what to do. I mean, my current plan, is to, try to get myself published at Marvel, DC, or Dark Horse, or even-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You need to, just, yeah, but you need a backup plan. Forget about that. Forget about that. You need to start by getting a job somewhere. I mean, okay. Okay, also, do you know why? Do it for Rosechu and Sonichu. 'Cause seriously, like, are they going to take you seriously when they see you've been out of work for a long time? Even starving artists do something. I mean, seriously, be a fry cook (??) do SOMETHING. Most people in comics have an art degree anyway. [pause, Christian sighs] And besides, I mean, how far are you really going to GO? When you- made a character out of two copyrighted characters. And, your comics are FULL of things that are copyrighted. I mean, I know they're like private jokes and everything-\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [interrupts huffily] It's called, it's called a <a href=\"/cwcki/Parody\" title=\"Parody\">parody</a>.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> It doesn't <i>seem</i> like a parody. [Christian sighs again.] A parody generally makes fun of things. Are you making fun of Sonic?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> No. I just, I'm just...I'm, I'm just accentuating on some of the things that I like!\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Okay, but then, that's, that's a <i>fan</i> comic! That's not a comic, that is fan FICTION. [Chris sighs again] That's like Mary Sue shit!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [uncomprehending] ...What?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You can't sell it! It's just fan fiction!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [long pause, sigh, pause] ...I don't know. But anyway, I'm gonna try, anyway, anyway, uh, Plan A, I'm gonna try for, to get myself paper-published and, uh, all that. But yeah, Plan B I'll, I'll definitely take everything that we talked about into consideration. I, I'll Google Computer Aided Drafting and Design and see what I can get with that degree. Or even, I, because, you know, my family could not, because you know, we can't, my family could not afford to, uh, at this time, to even get me classes, even at <a href=\"/cwcki/University_of_Virginia\" title=\"University of Virginia\">University of Virginia</a>, which is more expensive than <i>Piedmont</i>.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Okay, but you need permission from the original copyright holders to sell this! Like, you try to sell Sonichu and Rosechu, and Nintendo, and Sega and Konami are gonna be on your ass!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [pause, sigh] I tried to get Nintendo to...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I mean, didn't you think about that? You think they're not gonna see that?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I thought, I thought about that, and I tried to- [unintelligible]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [interjecting] Chris. CHRIS. These people have lawyers, and their job is to just go <i>everything</i> on the internet to find something they can sue over. I'm sur-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> -prised that they didn't FIND it already. ...And if they didn't find it already, how famous can Sonichu really be? 'Cause this is their job. Their JOB is to cause lawsuits.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [long pause] Well they, they, if that was their job, they would have sued me <i>years</i> ago.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Then I guess, maybe, Sonichu isn't as big as you thought. I'm not trying to be mean, here. This is <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/White_Knights\" title=\"White Knights\">tough love</a>, Chris. I mean...you've gotta do something. It's reality.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. [pause] I know, I have to do something. I want to do something.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> So, okay, then what are you gonna do? What are you gonna do tomorrow? What are you gonna do tomorrow then.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I'll Google computer-aided drafting and design (?) and, I'll Google CADD, and Charlottesville, and see what jobs are available around here. I, I, I'll leave a message for Mr. Will, and see if I can get a work ticket, on my, on my, degree. On my- [Kacey cuts him off]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Do you know what I want you to do tomorrow? Do you know what I want you to do? [Chris says something unintelligible] I want you to go out, and put out an application or two. Can you do that? Apply for <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Target\" title=\"Target\">Target</a>, apply for <a href=\"/cwcki/McDonald%27s\" title=\"McDonald's\">McDonald's</a>, do something. I want to know, and I want proof, that you are applying for something.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah...I'll, I'll go apply for, I'll go apply, I'll go, I'll go out and apply for, look for some jobs, yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You'd better. I mean, even <a href=\"/cwcki/Mal-Wart\" title=\"Mal-Wart\">WalMart</a> will hire anyone. Do WalMart.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> ...Alright. I'll go for WalMart. [pause] But it, and also, you know, I still don't understand, how many, what my maximum hours a week are I can work for and keep my Social Security, because I know, that makes, I know I'm getting more a month than I could at any job like WalMart.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Okay, well...[pause] You better apply for something, or else I just don't know what I'm gonna do. I, I'm definitely gonna... think on this. I mean, and it doesn't matter, if you don't go over certain hours, they'll do you part-time, and then it won't hurt yer tugboat. And you know what, even if you made less, couldn't, couldn't just the pride of knowing you accomplished something be enough? That's the kind of guy that girls want. Not someone who goes, \"Oh, I could get more just sitting around doing nothing.\" And you could get benefits. I mean, come on, isn't that, isn't that worth it?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> ...Yeah. It is worth it. It, and it takes, it just took somebody, it took, it took somebody like you to, uh, make me realize, about the poten-, about the, all that, and that's what, that's what I should be doing.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I mean, there's tons of disabled people who work. I mean, you like Goodwill a lot, they help out people, and I'm sure they still get their quote-unquote \"tugboats.\" And they're productive.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [pause, sigh] Yeah. I'll go out, I'll go, I'll go, fill out some applications tomorrow, and, uh, like at WalMart and Target, and see if they'll, see if they'll hire me, you know. Even the, even the work, like, a maximum of like, ten hours a week. That's, I mean, I don't know if it's ten or fifteen hours maximum for, you know, not, yeh, I mean, I'll try for ten hours at first.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> ...Okay.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Alright.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> But I mean, if you can, if you can get up to twenty hours without hurting your tugboat, I want you to do the full twenty. I want you to really go gung-ho on this.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> If I can get, if I can get the full twenty I can go, I'll do that. But I'll, I'll start small with ten.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> No. You need to ask for at least twenty. That's still part-time.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hmmm. Yeah. Alright. Well I mean, you know, when I apply with other people, I'll ask, I'll try to go, try to shoot for, like, ten. Just as a, just as a, like-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> No, you put, you put ten to twenty then. At least put ten to twenty. But I want you to do twenty. You can't even just do that for me. That's like, nothing. That's like, even if you work four days a week, that's five hours.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I, I, I'll, I'll do it. I'll, I'll put in ten to twenty hours. And I'll still have, still have to talk to my Social Security people about uh, this as well.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I'm pretty sure you can get anywhere, you know, up to twenty hours. You can probably get that online.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> All right, I'll, I'll look into it online, and I'll, uh, on the application I'll put ten to twenty hours. On the application.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You'd better dress nice too, are you gonna dress nice for this?

I can do that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Don't, don't wear your <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Medallion_of_Fail\" title=\"Medallion of Fail\">medallion</a>.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>softly, defeated</i>] Okay, I'm not gonna wear my medallion.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I know that's a part of you, but that, that's not gonna be allowed.
