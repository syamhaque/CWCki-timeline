Also, Chris claims his debt is completely gone, a statement which may be <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_money\" title=\"Chris and money\">less than accurate</a>.

I apologize for not replying sooner; I had a busy yesterday; I had a doctor's appointment, a meeting with <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Rocky\" title=\"Rocky\">Rocky</a>, and a few other errands; I hadn't a chance to check my e-mail yesterday. I will make time to check my e-mail more daily.\n</p><p>Also, that is very interesting about the Cwcki, \"J.J.\" will have to take them up on their inside-info offer. ;)\n</p><p>Canada is a good place, I hear, especially Toronto. I look forward to seeing the photos from your trip later on.\n</p><p>I went out to Food Lion earlier today for some more <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Cat\" title=\"Cat\">cat</a> food today, then I noticed that the next-door Movie Gallery (been working on clearing themselves out for Going Out of Business); up to 90% Off their stuff. They're on their Last 3 Days from today, so I estimate that their last day will be either Friday or Saturday. I bought a Blu-Ray movie I rented before that was a good one, \"<a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_and_Norah%27s_Infinite_Playlist\" title=\"wikipedia:Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist\">Nick &amp; Norah's Infinite Playlist</a>\", for $2.99. In case you haven't seen it, it's a story of a boy and his crew going on the road in pursuit of a hard-to-find band. The girl at first sides with the boy to pretend he was her boyfriend, then she follows them on their trip on the common goal. Throughout the movie, the boy and girl catch feelings towards each other; it is fun and sweet. :)\n</p><p>I'm not sure, but have we talked before of favorite movies between us? Mine is \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Poppins\" title=\"Mary Poppins\">Mary Poppins</a>\"; I also enjoyed \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Cole_Smithey\" title=\"Cole Smithey\">Toy Story</a>\". I also take in a dash of heavy action, horror and such. I've seen <a href=\"/cwcki/Saw\" title=\"Saw\">all 6 \"Saw\" movies</a>; once you've gotten used to the \"Hollywood Magic\" and understand that the blood and lost parts are all fake, the ONLY response you can look forward to from yourself is purely the surprise and suspense. I also remembered we talked a bit of the XXX porn, but I won't go further into that until you feel cool talking about it.\n</p><p>The doctor's appointment yesterday was just a check-up; I get them every 4 months. The current blood work shows me <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_health\" title=\"Chris and health\">healthy and well</a>. I've been taking a prescription to keep my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress\" title=\"Stress\">stress</a> levels down since my teenage years (felt like almost forever). One month a year or so ago, I went without the paroxitine, because I did not fully grasp the reasons WHY I needed it. On the one hand, I did feel more confident without it, but on the other, I ended up feeling more stress attacks that really got to me. I felt a spot or two of chest pains from that. So I went back onto it after that month. I also take vitamins A, D3, Iron, Zinc and Fish Oil.\n</p><p>I'll wrap it up for now. I will continue to be thinking fondestly of you and counting the days to our meet.\n</p><p>Stay Safe and Sweet.<br/>\nXOXOXOXOXO &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3<br/>\nChristian.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Pink_Flamingos_and_thyroid_conditions\">Pink Flamingos and thyroid conditions</span></h4>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #B48246; padding:5px; background-color:#FCC\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>July 20, 2010 - 8:40pm\n<p>Hey Chris! No problem, I just like hearing from you. Sounds like you had a busy day. I haven't seen Nick and Nora but I heard good things about it. I've seen the first three <a href=\"/cwcki/Saw\" title=\"Saw\">saw</a> movies but not the latter three; I'm not really a huge horror fan. My favorite movie of all time is probably \"<a href=\"/cwcki/DivineTrial\" title=\"DivineTrial\">Pink Flamingoes</a>\", it's a guilty pleasure of mine, you should really check it out.\n</p><p>So you take stress medication? So have you had like a medical condition or something? Like what kind of stress do you have that you need the medication for? I know someone who has a bad thyroid condition and needs medication every day or she could get a potentially fatal hormone imbalance, they actually didn't discover it until she was like 16, and the doctor at the time said her thyroid was all swollen up and she was lucky she hadn't already died from it. What kind of condition is yours? I really wish you could go to <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otakon\" title=\"wikipedia:Otakon\">Otakon</a> like you were planning, a nice trip like that would probably be good for you.\n</p><p>I can't wait to find out what happens when \"J.J.\" does his video! Those fuckers have been around too long, but you can topple them if you get inside. It's gotten me all excited, so keep me appraised as stuff happens ;)\n</p><p>Jackie\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h4><span id=\"Music.2C_paxil.2C_and_setting_up_a_date\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Music,_paxil,_and_setting_up_a_date\">Music, paxil, and setting up a date</span></h4>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>July 21, 2010 - 6:04pm\n<p>\"<a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Flamingos\" title=\"wikipedia:Pink Flamingos\">Pink Flamingoes</a>\"; I will check that out (find a trailer on <a href=\"/cwcki/YouTube\" title=\"YouTube\">YouTube</a>, then add the movie to my <a href=\"/cwcki/Netflix\" title=\"Netflix\">Netflix</a> Queue).\n</p><p>I've just heard the voice of the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_Test_Dummies\" title=\"wikipedia:Crash Test Dummies\">C.T.D.</a>; WOW!

I'll shortly enough get their \"Best Of\" Album CD from Plan9 or somewhere.

I think the only thing you need to worry about right now is getting your foot in the door. Once you're in good with the trolls, you can take your time figuring out how to put them down. It's not like they'll be going anywhere, and besides, the more time you just lurk quietly among them, the more they'll trust you - they might show even more weaknesses to you, or they might reveal something that gives you a perfect idea of what to do on the spot. I think that canine guy said you might get access codes to the website's control, right? So that's one option.\n</p><p>My point is, I think you should just get inside right now. Once you're in, we can think of the next step - I'll help you. Just talk to me about what you find going on in there and we can brainstorm together.
