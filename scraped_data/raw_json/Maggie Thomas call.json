Don't get too excited though, it's not brilliant.\n<p>Some backstory, back in 2009 Chris posted this video: <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://sonichu.com/cwcki/10_September_2009\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://sonichu.com/cwcki/10_September_2009</a> - which was basically my fault. I'd called Chris posing as a freelance journalist writing an article about internet celebrities for a European gaming magazine, because I can't do accents at all and I doubt I'd even be able to fool Chris with my terrible impersonation of an American accent. \n</p><p>I'd left a voice message on his answer phone saying I'd call back at a certain time because they hadn't picked up the phone, I called back at that time, but again they hadn't answered and the video was posted the next day. \n</p><p>When I finally managed to get hold of Chris, we spoke over the phone once and exchanged a few emails. I didn't have a big trolling plan or anything, I just wanted to maybe get a shout out in a video or even better, in the comics, but Chris being Chris, he stopped replying, this may have been because at the time he was still answering <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag\" title=\"Mailbag\">mailbag</a> questions and getting a lot of emails and I wasn't aware of this at the time, as none of us knew until the audio files were released well after the event, but Chris was still talking to <a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey\" title=\"Kacey\">Kacey</a> at the time too, so he was preoccupied with that. \n</p><p>The gist of it is, I spoke to Chris, asked him a few basic questions, was fairly sympathetic and offered condolences about cyber bullies just being jealous of him and the like, he put Bob on the phone and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bob\" title=\"Bob\">Bob</a> asked me questions about England and if I knew the song <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knees_Up_Mother_Brown\" title=\"wikipedia:Knees Up Mother Brown\">Knees up mother brown</a>. Chris was actually quite funny and charming, for Chris, I think it was because he was on his best behaviour. There was a funny exchange between Bob and Chris where Bob said something like \"Can you do that, Christian?\" and Chris said, \"Yes I can, Robert\" and it tickled me. \n</p><p>Chris asked me to send a picture of myself so I sent him a picture of a friend of mine who had no internet presence at all, but I had a bunch of pictures of, he said \"I\" was pretty, I also sent an mp3 of 'Knees up mother brown' for Bob, which he thanked me for.\n</p><p>So this is the audio file of that conversation, however it's pretty messed up. At the time I thought I had a really bad bout of flu, but I actually had swine flu. Bob asked me about it as I'd explained I had the flu, it wasn't until a day or two after this I found out I had full blown swine flu and it was pretty bad. Because my head was swimming with flu, I hadn't set the recording settings properly and you can barely hear Bob and Chris, you would probably be best putting on headphones and turning the volume right up. \n</p><p>I have no idea how to edit audio files, but someone a bit more tech savvy might be able to boost the volume on those parts, but you can kinda hear Chris and Bob a little bit, but mostly it's me being very wheezy and sniffly and breathing heavily. \n</p><p>It's only about 20 minutes long, because of the time difference I'd had to call Chris at like 3am my time and I was incredibly tired and ill. I had tried to arrange a second call, as I'd told him in an email that I had messed up the audio due to being ill, but I never managed to do so due to the lack of replies from Chris. \n</p><p>You can download the audio file here: <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.mediafire.com/?5vmporbjya6qmyq\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.mediafire.com/?5vmporbjya6qmyq</a> I've relistened to it a couple of times, it is hard to make out Chris and Bob, but you can hear some stuff, Bob told me about how and where he met Barb, during the call too.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Audio\">Audio</span></h2>\n<center>\n<table style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa; background-color: #f9f9f9; color: black; margin: .5em auto .5em auto; padding: 0.2em; font-size:89%; width:260px;-moz-border-radius:10px\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFFF00\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size:110%; color:#008080;-moz-border-radius:10px\"><b>Maggie Thomas call</b><br/>\n</td></tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<td colspan=\"2\"><div class=\"thumb embedvideo autoResize\" style=\"width: 328px;\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo autoResize\" style=\"\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideowrap youtube\" style=\"width: 320px\"><div class=\"embedvideo-consent\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo-consent__overlay\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo-consent__message\">Click to load content</div><!--\n--></div><!--\n--></div><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" data-src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AdnDlDlt4Ik\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"180\" loading=\"lazy\" modestbranding=\"1\" width=\"320\"></iframe></div><!--\n--></div><!--\n--></div>\n</td></tr>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#696969\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;-moz-border-radius:5px;color:#ffffff;\"><b>Stardate</b>\n</td>\n<td>September 2009\n</td></tr>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#696969\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;-moz-border-radius:5px;color:#ffffff;\"><b>Featuring</b>\n</td>\n<td><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris\" title=\"Chris\">Chris</a>; <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bob\" title=\"Bob\">Bob</a>; Maggie Thomas\n</td></tr>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#696969\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;-moz-border-radius:5px;color:#ffffff;\"><b>Saga</b>\n</td>\n<td><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PS3\" title=\"PS3\">PS3</a>\n</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n</center>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Transcript\">Transcript</span></h2>\n<p>[<i>heavy breathing, dialing tone</i>]<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF69B4\"><b>Maggie:</b></font> Hello, is this Mr. Chandler?<br/>\n<font color=\"#00AF33\"><b>Bob:</b></font> Yes, this is, uh, Christian's father.<br/>\n<font color=\"#FF69B4\"><b>Maggie:</b></font> Oh, hello, um, I was hoping to speak t- to Christian about doing an interview, possibly, for PlayMag, which is t- the UK PlayStation magazine.<br/>\n<font color=\"#00AF33\"><b>Bob:</b></font> Then you'll have to get him on the line.

Yeah, and then like, um, Because this is like writing off what to expect so it will be, it won't be like next month’s issue it will probably be more like November- December. B- Because we tend to write them, like, a couple of months beforehand to make sure that, like, if there’s any changes that need t- to happen they can- there’s plenty of time.
