I’m here today on this, uh, pleasant day of April 2010 to, uh, discuss autism as it is Autism Awares- Awareness Month. What is Autism? [<i>Reads off clipboard</i>] “Autism is a disorder of neutro- of neurodevelopment characterized by impaired social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior. These signs all begin before a child is three years old. Autism affects information processing in the brain [<i>Points to head</i>], by altering how nerve cells and nerve synapses connect and organize; how this concerned [<i>ed--a misreading of 'occurs' </i>] is not well understood.” And by where I got this information printed out here from, uh, autismspeaks.org and the Wikipedia page for autism. \n</p><p>[<i>Deep breath</i>] “Today, it is estimated that 1 in every 110 children is diagnosed with autism, making it more common than childhood cancer, juvenile diabetes, and pediatric <a href=\"/cwcki/9_October_2009\" title=\"9 October 2009\">AIDS</a> combined. An estimated 1.5 million individuals in the United States and tens of millions worldwide are affected by autism. Studies suggest that boys are a lot more likely than girls to develop autism and receive the diagnosis three to four times more frequently. Current estimates are that in the United States alone, one out of 70 boys is diagnosed with autism.\" \n</p><p>\"As for social symptoms, uh, from the start typically developing infants are social beings. Early in life, they gaze at people, turn toward voices, grasp a finger, and even smile. By contrast, most p-peop- most children with autism seem to have tremendous difficulty learning to engage in the give-and-take of everyday human interactions. Even in the first year of life, many do not interact and avoid eye contact in a nor- normal way. They may seem indifferent to other people, and prefer being alone. They may resist attention or passively accept hugs and cuddling. Children with autism also are slower in learning to interpret what others are thinking and feeling. Subtle social cues — such as a smile, a wave, or a <a href=\"/cwcki/100_2266\" title=\"100 2266\">grimace</a>—may have little rema- little meaning to a child with autism. To a child who misses these cues, such things as 'Come here' may always means the same thing, whether the speaker is smiling and extending her arms for a hug or frowning and planting her fists on her hips. Without the ability to interpret ges-tures and facial expressions, the social world may seem bewildering. To compound the problem, people with autism have difficulty seeing things from other pearson's perspective.\" \n</p><p>[<i>Turns page on clipboard</i>] \"Most 5-year-olds understand that other people have different thoughts, feelings, and goals when they have- than they have. A child with autism may <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Megan\" title=\"Megan\">lack such understanding</a>. This inability leaves them <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">unable to predict or understand other people's actions</a>.\"\n</p><p>\"<i>...predict or understand people’s actions.</i>\"\n</p><p>\"Although not universal, it is common for people with autism to have difficulty regulating their emotions. This can take the form of ‘immature’ behavior such as <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/User:ChrisChanSonichu_profile#Graduation\" title=\"User:ChrisChanSonichu profile\">crying in class</a> or <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sub-Episode_2#Sub-Episode_2:_Christian_Chandler_in_.22The_Rise_.26_Fall_of_My_Heart.22\" title=\"Sub-Episode 2\">verbal outbursts</a> that may seem inappropriate to those around them. Sometimes they may be disruptive and physically aggressive, making social relationships even more difficult. They have a tendency to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_Loses_It\" title=\"Chris Loses It\">'lose control'</a>, particularly when they're in a strange or overwhelming environment, or when <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_anger\" title=\"Chris and anger\">angry</a> and frustrated.\"\n</p><p>\"Communication. By age 3, most children have passed predictable milestones on the path to learning language; one of the earliest is babbling. Babbling. By the first birthday, a typical toddler says a word or two, turns and looks when he hears his name, points when he wants a toy, and when offered something distasteful, makes it clear that the answer is 'no'. [<i>Scratches head</i>] Some children diagnosed with autism <a href=\"/cwcki/Abusive_babysitter\" title=\"Abusive babysitter\">remain mute</a> throughout their lives, although the majority develop spoken language and all eventually learn to communicate in some way. Some infants who later show signs of autism coo and babble during the first few months of their life, but they stop. Others may be delayed, developing language as late as age 5 to 9. Some children may learn to use communication systems such as pictures or sign language, or closed captioning for the hearing impaired. Some speak only single words, while others repeat the same phrase over and over. They may repeat or parrot what they hear, a condition called e-cho-la-lia. Although many children with autism go through a stage where they repeat what they hear, it normally passes by the time they are- they are age 3. Another common difficulty is the inability to understand body language, tone of voice, or “phrases of speech.” For example, someone with autism might interpret a sarcastic expression such as “Oh, that's just great” as meaning it really is great.\" \n</p><p>\"While it can be challenging for others to understand what children with autism are most able to say, their body language may also difficult to understand. <a href=\"/cwcki/Creepy_stare\" title=\"Creepy stare\">Facial expressions</a>, movements, and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Claw_of_fail\" title=\"Claw of fail\">gestures</a> may not match what they are saying. Also, their tone of voice might fail to reflect their feelings. They might use a <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism#Chris's_Symptoms\" title=\"Autism\">high-pitched, sing-song, or flat, robot-like voice.</a> Some children with relatively good language skills speak like little adults, [<i>Turns page</i>] failing to pick up on the kid's speak that is common in their peers. Without meaningful gestures, or the language to ask for things, people with autism are less able to let other know- others know what they are need. As a result, they may simply <a href=\"/cwcki/THAT_IS_MY_HOUSE\" title=\"THAT IS MY HOUSE\">scream</a> or <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Emails,_2005-2006#Don.27t_Kiss_Me.2C_Bro\" title=\"Megan Emails, 2005-2006\">grab</a> for what they want until they are taught. Better ways to express their needs. Children with autism do whatever they can to get through to others. As they grow up, they can become increasingly aware of their difficulties in understanding others and being understood.\"\n</p><p>\"Repetitive behaviors. Although children with autism usually appear physically normal, odd repetitive motions may set them apart from other children. These behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent, or more subtle. Some chi- some children and other individuals repeatedly flap their arms, or walk on their toes, some simply freeze in position. As children, individuals with autism might spend hours lining up their cars or trains in a certain way, rather than using them for pretend play. Someone moves one of the toys, the children m-may be tremendously upset. Many children with autism meed and demand absolute consistency in their environment. A slight change in routine, such as meal time, dressing, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_health#Hygiene\" title=\"Chris and health\">take a bath</a>, or going to school at the same time or by a certain route can be extremely stressful. Unless the child has made apparent that the change is okay and acceptable. Repetitive behavior sometimes takes the form of a <a href=\"/cwcki/China\" title=\"China\">persistent intense preoccupation.</a> These strong interests may be unusual, because their <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">content</a>, or because the <a href=\"/cwcki/Love_Quest\" title=\"Love Quest\">intensity</a> of the interest. Treatment for autism is very intensive, comprehensive undertaking that involves the child's entire family and a team of professionals. Some programs may take place in a child's home with professionals and a trained therapist and may include parental training for the child under supervision of a professional. Some programs are delivered in a specialized center, clu-sumes, or preschool.\" [<i>Puts paper down</i>]\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:SonichuBra.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"234\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/9/9c/SonichuBra.jpg/300px-SonichuBra.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/9/9c/SonichuBra.jpg/450px-SonichuBra.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/9/9c/SonichuBra.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:SonichuBra.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Sonichu, covering his shame in light of Chris's new legislation.</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:CWCFlex.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"421\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/3/3d/CWCFlex.jpg/300px-CWCFlex.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/3/3d/CWCFlex.jpg/450px-CWCFlex.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/3/3d/CWCFlex.jpg/600px-CWCFlex.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:CWCFlex.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div><a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_hypocrisy\" title=\"Chris and hypocrisy\">That would be <b>all</b> men, right?</a></div></div></div>\n<p>Though, as for me though, I highly recommend mainstreaming, lettin' 'em go though <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">normal life</a>.
