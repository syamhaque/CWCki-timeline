He met Leonard Bearstein during Christmas <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/1992\" title=\"1992\">1992</a>.\n</p><p>The boy's father, <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler\" title=\"Bob Chandler\">Robert F. Chandler Jr.</a>, told the story.\n</p><p>\"We were in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Richmond\" title=\"Richmond\">Richmond</a> on a visit last Christmas with our son Christopher, then almost 11,\" Chandler said. \"We lived in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ruckersville\" title=\"Ruckersville\">Ruckersville</a>, about 10 miles north of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Charlottesville\" title=\"Charlottesville\">Charlottesville</a>, at the time.\n</p><p>\"And, as many people from west of Richmond do, we made one of our stops at Regency Square.\"\n</p><p>Christopher is a high-functioning <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">autistic</a> child. While intellectually his age level is 12 or 13, socially he is around age 7 or 8. He has some <a href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Schroeder\" title=\"Megan Schroeder\">behavior problems with his peers</a> and relates better with children a few years younger than him, his father said.\n</p><p>Christopher didn't talk until he was 7 years old. But thanks to his parents' hard work, he talks a <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog\" title=\"Sonic the Hedgehog\">blue streak</a> now.\n</p><p>And while visiting Regency Square during Christmas 1992, he struck up a conversation with Leonard Bearstein.\n</p><p>\"Since this was early in the Christmas season on a Thursday afternoon, the crowd was light,\" Chandler said. \"The conversation between Leonard and Christopher lasted -- on and off, between songs -- about an hour. Christopher was spellbound.\"\n</p><p>Something unusual happened during that conversation. When Leonard Bearstein, in a decidedly British accent, asked Christopher his name, the bear must have misunderstood what the boy replied.\n</p><p>\"Leonard started calling our son Christian. What better name for the Christmas season?\n</p><p>\"And the name stuck like glue. From that time on, for the past year, his name has been Christian Weston Chandler. Christian is very emphatic about that.\"\n</p><p>Good things have happened since Leonard Bearstein changed Christopher's name to Christian more than a year ago.\n</p><p>In September, father and son moved to Chesterfield County. Chandler and his wife, <a href=\"/cwcki/Barbara_Chandler\" title=\"Barbara Chandler\">Barbara</a>, lived there when they married in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/1980\" title=\"1980\">1980</a>, before General Electric Co. transferred him to the Charlottesville area.\n</p><p>Mr. Chandler is retired now and looks after Christian during the week.\n</p><p>Mrs. Chandler works for Virginia Power in Charlottesville and commutes here from Ruckersville, in Greene County, on weekends.\n</p><p>\"The Greene County School system was not equipped to teach an autistic child,\" Mr. Chandler said. \"The Chesterfield County school system has accepted him with open arms.\"\n</p><p>Christian is in sixth grade at Providence Middle School.\n</p><p>This fall, on his own initiative, Christian entered a contest based on a favorite TV cartoon character. He was a winner in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_Watch_%26_Win_Sweepstakes\" title=\"Sonic the Hedgehog Watch &amp; Win Sweepstakes\">\"Sonic the Hedgehog Watch and Win Sweepstakes.\"</a> His prize: a $1,000 shopping spree at Kay-Bee Toys after the first of the year.\n</p><p>And the Chandlers have started the process of legally changing his name.\n</p><p>As it happens, Mr. Chandler said he wanted to name his son Christian when the boy was born. As a sing-along leader at Matt's British Pub in Shockoe Slip in the late 1970s, he was familiar with the name among fellow Anglophiles and English friends.\n</p><p>\"I was chicken,\" he said. \"It took Leonard the bear to name him Christian.\n</p><p>\"Although we live in Chesterfield, closer to Cloverleaf Mall and <a href=\"/cwcki/Post-jail_sightings_(2023)#Spotted_at_Chesterfield_Towne_Center\" title=\"Post-jail sightings (2023)\">Chesterfield Towne Center,</a>\" Mr. Chandler added, <a href=\"/cwcki/Christopher%27s_name_change\" title=\"Christopher's name change\">\"a bear at Regency Square named my son.\"</a>\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Newspaper_Scan\">Newspaper Scan</span></h2>\n<center><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:It_took_a_talking_bear_to_give_the_name_a_young_boy_loves.png\"><img alt=\"It took a talking bear to give the name a young boy loves.png\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"416\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/5/54/It_took_a_talking_bear_to_give_the_name_a_young_boy_loves.png/900px-It_took_a_talking_bear_to_give_the_name_a_young_boy_loves.png\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/5/54/It_took_a_talking_bear_to_give_the_name_a_young_boy_loves.png/1350px-It_took_a_talking_bear_to_give_the_name_a_young_boy_loves.png 1.5x, /w/images/5/54/It_took_a_talking_bear_to_give_the_name_a_young_boy_loves.png 2x\" width=\"900\"/></a></center>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20091113231947/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/timesdispatch/access/615847621.html?dids=615847621:615847621&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Dec+29,+1993&amp;author=Barbara+Green&amp;pub=Richmond+Times+-+Dispatch&amp;desc=IT+TOOK+A+TALKING+BEAR+TO+GIVE+THE+NAME+A+YOUNG+BOY+LOVES&amp;pqatl=google\" rel=\"nofollow\">Archived page</a> (<i>links to an abstract of the article;
