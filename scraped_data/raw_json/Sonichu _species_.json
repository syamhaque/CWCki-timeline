The species came about as the result of Chris not being allowed to Sonic or Pikachu on the cover of a custom CD case for a school project, and his first two creations led to a series of unremitting abominations of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/OCs\" title=\"OCs\">OCs</a> being created as part of Chris's interests (and the interests of the <a href=\"/cwcki/True_and_Loyal_Fanbase\" title=\"True and Loyal Fanbase\">True and Loyal Fanbase</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Unholy_Quintet\" title=\"Unholy Quintet\">among others</a>).\n</p><p>By having an entire species have the same name as a <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(character)\" title=\"Sonichu (character)\">\"unique\" being</a> and giving all of its members the same title (these are not surnames, as Chris has stressed that surnames are largely absent in the names of Electric Hedgehog Pokémon),<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup> Chris has only served to confound his readers, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jamsta_Sonichu\" title=\"Jamsta Sonichu\">mess up continuity</a>, and demonstrate that he's a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress\" title=\"Stress\">lazy</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Things_Chris_has_ripped_off\" title=\"Things Chris has ripped off\">unimaginative</a> bastard.

While the hands are completely articulated with five fingers and opposable thumbs, the feet of a Sonichu are just round stumps. They are seldom seen without a pair of white gloves and shoes (of varying colors), even if they are completely nude otherwise. The shoes may be a necessity, as the nature of bare Sonichu feet may make it impossible for a Sonichu to stand without them.\n</p><p>While a typical Sonichu has <a href=\"/cwcki/Pok%C3%A9mon\" title=\"Pokémon\">yellow fur, brown stripes, and red spots on their cheekbones</a> (if we are to assume that the <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(character)\" title=\"Sonichu (character)\">original Sonichu</a> is the prime specimen), Sonichus can come in a variety of recolors, although a Sonichu's \"shiny\" color is exclusively white.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup> Sometimes, a Sonichu displays other variations, such as <a href=\"/cwcki/Magi-Chan\" title=\"Magi-Chan\">altered ear tips</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Punchy_Sonichu\" title=\"Punchy Sonichu\">epicanthic folds</a>, or a <a href=\"/cwcki/Wild_Sonichu\" title=\"Wild Sonichu\">different tail altogether</a>. The fur color of a Sonichu is susceptible to alteration by chemicals such as <a href=\"/cwcki/Blake\" title=\"Blake\">Cherry Cola</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Behavior\">Behavior</span></h2>\n<p>Though considered to be Pokémon by their creator, Sonichus might be better described as anthropomorphic animals. While not very intelligent, they are sapient and capable of many of the same skills as humans: <a href=\"/cwcki/Pocket_knife\" title=\"Pocket knife\">tool usage</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Speech_impediment\" title=\"Speech impediment\">speech</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">social interaction</a>. \n</p><p>According to Chris, Sonichus are not capable of speech at the moment in which they cease being <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonee_%26_Rosey\" title=\"Sonee &amp; Rosey\">Sonees</a>; they must be taught a spoken language in order to be able to say more than the name of their species.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup> This a far cry from the impression actually given by Chris's comic. In <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_0#Episode_1:_&quot;Sonichu's_Origin&quot;\" title=\"Sonichu 0\">episode 1</a> Sonichu is capable of speech immediately after his transformation. <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Punchy\" title=\"Punchy\">Punchy</a>,  <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Wild\" title=\"Wild\">Wild</a>, and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bubbles\" title=\"Bubbles\">Bubbles</a> are also capable of speech immediately after evolving into Sonichus and Rosechus.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]</a></sup>. In issue 10, Sandy also hatched from her egg and could immediately speak. So far, a Sonichu not capable of speech has never been seen in Chris's comic. It should also be noted that only <a href=\"/cwcki/Angelica\" title=\"Angelica\">Angelica</a> and Punchy were raised by English-speaking owners (that we have seen). The other members of the Chaotic Combo were raised by Pokemon, physically or telepathically, and should not be able to speak English. Heck, Magi-Chan should more than likely be mute and only speak telepathically. \n</p><p>In their <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">natural habitat</a>, Sonichus fill a number of societal roles: <a href=\"/cwcki/Chaotic_Combo\" title=\"Chaotic Combo\">vigilante groups</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jamsta\" title=\"Jamsta\">radio announcers</a>, and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Simonla\" title=\"Simonla\">construction</a> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sandy\" title=\"Sandy\">workers</a>, using whatever supernatural abilities granted to them. They are not above being welfare recipients too.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-7\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">[7]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-8\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">[8]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Sonichus are <a href=\"/cwcki/Love_Quest\" title=\"Love Quest\">constantly searching for a mate</a>, and perhaps with some <a href=\"/cwcki/Dating_education\" title=\"Dating education\">assistance</a> will \"fall in love\" with the first Rosechu they see (<a href=\"/cwcki/Magi-Chan\" title=\"Magi-Chan\">assuming they are heterosexual</a>). The ensuing pair, without exception, will enter into a courtship in poor imitation of humans. However, unlike humans, Sonichu-Rosechu mates <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_writing\" title=\"Chris and writing\">completely lack tension or discord</a>, suggesting that the lifelong bond is purely out of instinct to guarantee that any resulting spawn gets care from two parents (though not guaranteed to be good or even adequate care). Considering the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonee_and_Rosey\" title=\"Sonee and Rosey\">extremely low capabilities of said spawn</a>, this may be a necessity.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sonichus_and_reproduction\">Sonichus and reproduction</span></h2>\n<p>A Sonichu's <a href=\"/cwcki/Penis\" title=\"Penis\">penis</a> and testicles reside entirely within its abdominal cavity. While the testicles are permanently contained behind a \"bone-like structure\" for protection, the <a href=\"/cwcki/Pickle\" title=\"Pickle\">penis</a> can emerge for urination or intercourse when the Sonichu leans forward, causing the erect penis to \"slide out\" purely by gravitational force.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-9\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">[9]</a></sup> This system displays a clear lack of knowledge of biology, as the reason that the testicles are outside the body is because the body's core temperature is not ideal for sperm production, thus, unless Sonichu sperm is much more heat resistant than normal mammalian sperm, Sonichus should be sterile. (<a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_and_Rosechu%27s_children\" title=\"Sonichu and Rosechu's children\">Unfortunately, they are not.</a>). In addition, Chris never explains if the penis always slides out when the Sonichu leans over (although it obviously isn't the case), and he never mentions conscious control over the action. All of this goes to show that <a href=\"/cwcki/Honor_roll\" title=\"Honor roll\">people who have no knowledge of biology</a> should not set out to create detailed organ systems for their fictional creatures.\n</p><p>Sonichus' <a href=\"/cwcki/Semen\" title=\"Semen\">sperm</a> count is extremely low when compared to humans. The number of sperm cells released by a Sonichu per ejaculation stands at a couple of thousands at most and can be as low as mere hundreds. <sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-10\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">[10]</a></sup> In comparison, human sperm count must be at least over 15 million sperm cells per milliliter in order to be considered healthy. <sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-11\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">[11]</a></sup> It should also be noted that the volume of <a href=\"/cwcki/Semen\" title=\"Semen\">semen</a> ejaculated by a Sonichu is also much higher than the amount of the average human male. Whereas human males will ejaculate on average about 0.1 to 10 milliliters of semen,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-12\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">[12]</a></sup> Sonichus' ejaculate numbers 100 - 500 milliliters <sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-13\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">[13]</a></sup> on average, more than the amount ejaculated by both horses and elephants. It may be due to the extremely low sperm count that more semen must be ejaculated to create a balance. It can easily be said that <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Recycling\" title=\"Recycling\">Recycling</a> is unpopular amongst Sonichus, but due to easy access of <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu_(species)\" title=\"Rosechu (species)\">semen recepticles</a> this is not a major issue. \n</p><p>Chris has mentioned that a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonee\" title=\"Sonee\">Sonee</a> is born as the result of intercourse between a Sonichu and a Rosechu, or some combination of the above and a <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ditto_(Pok%C3%A9mon)\" title=\"wikipedia:Ditto (Pokémon)\">Ditto</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Pok%C3%A9mon\" title=\"Pokémon\">Pokémon</a><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-Sonichu_article_14-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Sonichu_article-14\">[14]</a></sup>. Presumably a Ditto would assume the form of an opposite-sex <a href=\"/cwcki/Electric_Hedgehog_Pok%C3%A9mon\" title=\"Electric Hedgehog Pokémon\">Electric Hedgehog Pokémon</a>.\n</p><p>While discussing a sex scene involving <a href=\"/cwcki/Punchy_Sonichu\" title=\"Punchy Sonichu\">Punchy</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Layla\" title=\"Layla\">Layla</a> which was supposed to be included in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_9#Episode_19:_Date_Ed_(Even_Though_the_Idea_Sounds_Dated)\" title=\"Sonichu 9\">Dating Ed episode</a> (it was eventually left out of the final version), Chris and <a href=\"/cwcki/Ivy\" title=\"Ivy\">Ivy</a> failed to agree over which character will bring the condoms, so eventually Chris decided that Layla had the ability to choose when to get pregnant.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-15\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">[15]</a></sup> This statement implies that intercourse between a <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Flaaffy_%28Pok%C3%A9mon%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flaaffy</a> and a Sonichu can result in an offspring, and since two Pokémon of different species must share at least one <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Egg_group\" rel=\"nofollow\">Egg group</a> in order to successfully mate, it can be assumed that Sonichus  belong to either the <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Field_%28Egg_group%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Field egg group</a> and/or the <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Monster_%28Egg_group%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Monster egg group</a>. If Chris had ever given thought to this matter it is more likely that he placed Sonichu in the former group as this is also one of the egg groups to which Pikachu belongs.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Gender\">Gender</span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:FemaleSonichu.jpeg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"400\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/0/0c/FemaleSonichu.jpeg/300px-FemaleSonichu.jpeg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/0/0c/FemaleSonichu.jpeg/450px-FemaleSonichu.jpeg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/0/0c/FemaleSonichu.jpeg/600px-FemaleSonichu.jpeg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:FemaleSonichu.jpeg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Female Sonichu and Male Rosechu</div></div></div>\n<p>In the earlier comics, it was established that all Sonichu’s and Sonee’s were male, and Rosechu’s, and Rosee’s, were their female counterparts, although the gender ratio of Pikachu is at 50/50.
