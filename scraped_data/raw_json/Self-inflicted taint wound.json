The catalyst was alleged by an insider in contact with Chris to have been from Chris being drunk and saddened over lesbians pointing out he didn't have an actual vagina, though Chris had been mulling usage of a knife in the weeks beforehand.\n</p><p>On 24 <a href=\"/cwcki/July_2016\" title=\"July 2016\">July 2016</a>, Chris announced in a Facebook post that he had grown <a href=\"/cwcki/China\" title=\"China\">vaginal labia</a> from his hypnosis regimen. Chris later posted two more messages; first claiming that he had his \"labia area\" examined, and then declaring that it was all a ruse. Of course, these were proven to be blatant <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Lies\" title=\"Lies\">lies</a>. Chris had edited the message about the exam, changing his story as he went on. If that wasn't telling enough, a second picture provided by insiders in contact with Chris displayed the wound from another angle, making it extremely unlikely to be a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Adobe_PhotoDeluxe\" title=\"Adobe PhotoDeluxe\">Photoshop</a> hoax.\n</p><p>Unlike the first picture, in which the \"labia\" was posed for his fanbase on Facebook, the second exhibited how badly Chris was handling what could have evolved into a life-threatening infection: he is shown spreading the wound as if it were a vagina.\n</p><p>Chris initially responded to direct attempts at getting him to see a doctor by replying that he already had and everything was fine – something <i>no</i> trusted doctor would ever say regarding this outrageous situation. He then deleted all related posts in an attempt at damage control.\n</p><p><a href=\"/cwcki/Marvin\" title=\"Marvin\">Marvin</a> confirmed that Chris sought treatment after the posts went public and people hassled him into <i>finally</i> admitting that his \"labia\" was in fact a wound.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Background\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Background</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Chris's_demented_version_of_events\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris's demented version of events</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#First_Facebook_post\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">First Facebook post</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Second_Facebook_post\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Second Facebook post</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Hoax_claim\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Hoax claim</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Continued_delusion\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Continued delusion</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Treatment\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Treatment</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Actual_series_of_events\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Actual series of events</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#Gallery\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Gallery</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Photos_of_the_wound\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Photos of the wound</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#Screenshots_of_all_Facebook_posts\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Screenshots of all Facebook posts</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-13\"><a href=\"#Sources\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Sources</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Background\">Background</span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:PreludeToATaintWound.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"300\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/c/c3/PreludeToATaintWound.jpg/300px-PreludeToATaintWound.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/c/c3/PreludeToATaintWound.jpg/450px-PreludeToATaintWound.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/c/c3/PreludeToATaintWound.jpg/600px-PreludeToATaintWound.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:PreludeToATaintWound.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Prelude to a taint wound.</div></div></div>\n<p><br/>\n<a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_dysphoria\" title=\"wikipedia:Gender dysphoria\">Late-onset gender dysphoria</a> is a psychological disorder describing those who identify with another gender over their own, and can present with the desire to be rid of their primary sex characteristics and prefer those of the other gender.

The source being the Subliminal Frequency Hypnosis Wizards Binaural Beats channel on YouTube. Last March, I've started simple with growing my breasts out with their Breast Growth Hormone track; it worked to my amazement at a full inch outward per week in about two months. I've also listened to change my nipples to teats, as well as begin producing breast milk. Also, related, from a separate track on another channel, I have eased and cured the worst of my autism too. But since last May, I decided to take it a step further and begin my transition from male to female with the penis to vagina tracks, including the individual organ changing tracks, and for a while the Intersex track. And two Fridays ago, July 15, while I slept that night, my labia started splitting open, and I found the initial hole and blood the next morning. And over the few days that followed, the labia opened to its full length, and I've been dealing with the blood that came out. I have been keeping it clean, daily monitoring it, and treating it with rubbing alcohol. I have started the wheels in motion for the full HRT and SRS by Seeing My Doctor last Friday, because I felt like I didn't want to wait much longer to fully become the woman that I should have been born as.\n</p><p>With that, I have uploaded a photo of my labia onto imgur, <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://m.imgur.com/gallery/pb1ovpJ\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://m.imgur.com/gallery/pb1ovpJ</a>, for all 18+ year old individuals to see. BUT, I do not want to be overrun with tabloid and paparazzi attention over this, or have a total big deal made.\n</p><p>As for my own statement to quote, I will state the following: Have belief and faith in what your body can do, and with such binaural beats and frequencies, as well as persistence and patience, what you'd like can happen for you.\n</p><p>And if you'd like to offer your support in my transition as well, I accept financial donations via PayPal to my email address, ChrisChanSonichu@aol.com.\n</p><p>Thank you, and have a good and safe day.\n</p><p><a class=\"external free\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX4JC6NnvfGC9i3kwSFPFIg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX4JC6NnvfGC9i3kwSFPFIg</a>\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>Even Chris's Facebook friends had nothing positive to say about this.

But one night he was drunk and was sad that someone pointed out he didn't have an actual vagina, so he thought he'd help it along.\n<p>In the morning he was very embarrassed and sheepish about it.
