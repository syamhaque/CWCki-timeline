Chris, being a <a href=\"/cwcki/Na%C3%AFve\" title=\"Naïve\">naïve</a> idiot, believed this and made an <a href=\"/cwcki/Secret_Weapon\" title=\"Secret Weapon\">exposé video on Clyde</a>. Additionally, Chris, through some unknown means, had obtained a picture of a man having missionary sex with another man in a Spiderman costume. He would threaten to blackmail Clyde with this picture unless he left him alone, revealing it bit by bit.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Surfshack_Tito\">Surfshack Tito</span></h3>\n<p>Surfshack Tito incurred the wrath of Chris during the <a href=\"/cwcki/Calling_Out\" title=\"Calling Out\">Calling Out</a> saga, as he had stolen Chris's gal-pal (read: shown her how horrible Chris is) and used <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Manipulation\" title=\"Manipulation\">social engineering</a> to access his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PSN\" title=\"PSN\">PSN</a> account. \n</p><p>Chris's demands for Tito were to make apology videos to him, <a href=\"/cwcki/The_Wallflower\" title=\"The Wallflower\">The Wallflower</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Sony\" title=\"Sony\">Sony</a>. He was also told to give $1,000, but Chris later removed this demand, presumably since he realized it would be outright extortion. In response, Tito made an video where he dubbed a voice over of him apologizing to Chris over a video of a fat guy jiggling his belly.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Thorg\">Thorg</span></h3>\n<p>Thorg was the next target of Chris's holy war against the trolls. He was convicted of putting up a billboard calling Chris a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Homo\" title=\"Homo\">homo</a>. His tasks were to put up another billboard in New York calling Chris straight and deleting pages from the CWCki.\n</p><p>Thorg didn't give in to these demands, so Chris revealed his information. Thorg was apparently a man named Jeremy Slonwhite from Vancouver, Canada who worked at a GameStop and doesn't believe in a god. Of course, this dox was inaccurate but Chris believed it to be true, making <a href=\"/cwcki/Wristwatch-SwissWatch_for_Jeremy_%22Thorg%22\" title='Wristwatch-SwissWatch for Jeremy \"Thorg\"'>two</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Victory_Rockout\" title=\"Victory Rockout\">more videos</a> to rub it in Thorg's face.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Alec_Benson_Leary\">Alec Benson Leary</span></h3>\n<p>Even after 2 years, Chris couldn't get over the Asperchu comics, all this pent up rage was used for doxing Alec. He demanded Alec make an apology video and leave the internet before 31 August 2011.\n</p><p>When Alec did not give in, Chris claimed his real name was \"Christopher Paul Whitney\" from San Antonio, Texas, Also known as the YouTuber \"Fatman\" but unluckily the dox wasn't accurate.\nFatman other than having a totally different voice from Alec's, is from Rutland, Vermont. Fatman later acknowledged this video and called Chris a dumbass.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Jack_Thaddeus\">Jack Thaddeus</span></h3>\n<p>Next in line was Jack himself; his criminal record included making Chris <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_humps_his_PS3\" title=\"Chris humps his PS3\">hump</a> his PS3, forcing him to <a href=\"/cwcki/It%27s_UGH!\" title=\"It's UGH!\">sing OK2BGay</a>, and worst of all; adding <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">pro-LGBT</a> ads to his precious <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia\" title=\"CWCipedia\">CWCipedia</a>.\n</p><p>Chris revealed his real name was Ahuviya and that he was a communist transgender. Chris insults him by calling him a homosexual while wearing women's clothes and makeup. In reality, Ahuviya Harel (also known as ADF or Phillip Haskins-DeLici) is an infamous lolcow in his own right.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"BlueSpike\">BlueSpike</span></h3>\n<p>The last person to be threatened before the abrupt end of the saga. Chris wanted to dox BlueSpike for creating the Julaay meme and increasing the percentage of finding clay in Chris's ass to 100%. \n</p><p>Chris revealed his real name was David from California. His demands for David were to apologize to him and leave the internet.\n</p><p>BlueSpike never released a video due to him being busy writing a summary for To Kill a Mockingbird to pass his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/English\" title=\"English\">English</a> class. Chris too never responded after this due to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bob\" title=\"Bob\">Bob</a>'s death marking the end of this saga.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Jeff.2FFrancine_Ouzuo\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Jeff/Francine_Ouzuo\">Jeff/Francine Ouzuo</span></h3>\n<p>Jeff Ouzuo also known by his tomgirl name Francine, was subject to a round of doxing by Chris in 2015 for <a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris\" title=\"Liquid Chris\">impersonating Chris</a> to <a href=\"/cwcki/Un-clit\" title=\"Un-clit\">con lesbians into having sex</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Jimmy_Hill\" title=\"Jimmy Hill\">selling unauthorised Sonichu merch</a> and creating <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler%27s_Adult_Chronicles\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler's Adult Chronicles\">Christian Weston Chandler's Adult Chronicles</a>. \n</p><p>Jeff apparently was a <a href=\"/cwcki/Transgender\" title=\"Transgender\">transgender</a> who wasn't transitioning very well, lived in Seattle, Washington after running away from Pittsburgh<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup> due to being scared away by <a href=\"/cwcki/Niggos\" title=\"Niggos\">black men</a> asking for directions.
