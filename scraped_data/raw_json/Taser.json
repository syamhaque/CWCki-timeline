While they share a similar function to deliver electrical shocks, tasers and stun guns differ in that a taser fires projectiles at a target to deliver the shock, whereas a stun gun uses direct contact with a target. (However, a taser can be used as a stun gun by removing the projectiles.) The two terms have sometimes been used interchangeably to describe Chris or Praetor's alleged plans, in particular from a rumor by <a href=\"/cwcki/Watchmen\" title=\"Watchmen\">Watchmen</a> member <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/MKR\" title=\"MKR\">MKR</a>,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-mkr1_3-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-mkr1-3\">[3]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-mkr2_4-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-mkr2-4\">[4]</a></sup> leading to confusion.

In any event, no evidence has been found of Chris actually using either a stun gun or taser.\n</p><p>Nonetheless, Chris has applied <a href=\"/cwcki/Magical_thinking\" title=\"Magical thinking\">magical thinking</a> to his quartz crystals.
