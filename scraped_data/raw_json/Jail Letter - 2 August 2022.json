Skysoar and Eggman actually worked together and were side-by-side in that event of the encounter with Sonic and Sonichu.\n<p>To Note: Most Sonichus and Rosechus, counting Sonichu (Prime) and Rosey Rosechu (Prime) and the personally chronicled Special Sonichus and Rosechus; they all stand at Three Feet, Five Inches tall (not counting the ears), and Sonic is about Three Feet, Two Inches tall. And when We are in our Sonichu form, we go from 5'11\" to 3'5\" as well. Remember this detail, and a Sonichu's ears are Seven Inches long from base to tip.\n</p><p>The HD Books shall be worked on in collaboration, personally with those amongst ye all with the drawing skills and Heartfelt, Compassionate Care and Chronicling.

On his path, some Team Rocket Grunts had him enlisted and taken to their base in Virginia, south of D.C. Now, Giovanni had already set up his organization by 1998 and went worldwide, and he sometimes takes his personal jet (or teleports with the help of one of the souped-up psychic Pokemon of theirs) to frequent around. Giovanni was impressed with Naitsirch's spunk and took an innate liking to his youthful vengeful soul, and he adopted him (this was back in 1998, and Naitsirch was about 10 years old and a Rookie at the time). Giovanni and his cohorts almost spoiled him, and they set him up to be a Pokemon Trainer and getting his own yeam and badges; he set out in 2000; his Starter?\n<p>Enter his Rival, Kel, as she was starting out, too.

Anyway, the reason why her fated starter was the very Pichu that becomes Rosey Rosechu (Prime); the Pokemon Lab thereabout had the three elemental starters, and two other new trainers took the grass and water ones, and Naitsirch stole the fire one.
