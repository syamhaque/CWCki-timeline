Though, unfortunately, it would seem that once again Chris's begging was ill-meaning since Chris had said on Discord<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-8\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">[8]</a></sup> that he already had organized tickets and accommodations, so the $2,000-$3,000 was actually for toys and video games.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cancellations_and_bans\">Cancellations and bans</span></h2>\n<p>Both the 2020 and 2021 conventions were cancelled. Chris attempted to attend the 2024 convention, but was preemptively banned.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"2020\">2020</span></h3>\n<p>Chris looked forward to attending. He considered purchasing a Meet and Greet session with Brony celebrities <a href=\"/cwcki/DRWolf\" title=\"DRWolf\">DRWolf</a> and <a class=\"new\" href=\"/w/index.php?title=Silver_Quill&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" title=\"Silver Quill (page does not exist)\">Silver Quill</a> for $105, inviting members of <a href=\"/cwcki/The_Place\" title=\"The Place\">The Place</a> to attend with him. Several The Place members tried pointing out to Chris that he need not pay for friendship, but Chris continued to entertain the possibility of DRWolf and Silver Quill taking a liking to him.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-9\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">[9]</a></sup>\n</p><p>However, BABSCon did not take place in 2020, due to the <a href=\"/cwcki/COVID-19\" title=\"COVID-19\">COVID-19</a> pandemic.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-10\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">[10]</a></sup> This somewhat threw Chris's precognition powers into question, as fate was not permitting him to go. Chris was initially very upset about this, and had a rant on Twitter, explaining how the pandemic is actually just a form of C-197 eugenic culling on 1218 before the merge and would be over in one or two weeks, making the cancellation of BABSCon quite silly indeed.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-11\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">[11]</a></sup> Unfortunately, Chris's precognition failed again.\n</p><p>Luckily, just a CWC trip through your nearest portal will take you to BABSCon in C-197. Which went off without a hitch, due to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/COVID\" title=\"COVID\">COVID</a> having been cured already over there. It's a shame they don't share the cure with us, but they're too busy having fun and horsing around at BABSCon 2020. Chris, in fact, spent a while in CWCville to go to BABSCon, during which <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_coping#Roleplaying\" title=\"Chris and coping\">Sonichu inhabited Chris's body</a>. This also had the added benefit of making Chris able to answer and enact our prayers to him since he was in C-197 with his powers.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-12\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">[12]</a></sup>\n</p><p>In 2020 they ran BABSCon Online - an interactive BABSCon experience on Discord, with panels and gaming tournaments, and music concerts all designed to get those bronies around the world to lift their mane-donned heads from mourning and get to \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Freestyle_Dance_With_Me,_For_Our_World!\" title=\"Freestyle Dance With Me, For Our World!\">rump-shaking</a>\". They even had voice actors Claire Corlett, Peter New, Brian Drummond, and Sunni Westbrook hamming up cold-readings of people's comedic submissions.\n</p><p>Chris, was seemingly ungrateful for their effort, pointing out that meeting in person would have been a better idea. With that useful insight, however, he does thank the team, if in a somewhat weak way.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-13\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">[13]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"2021\">2021</span></h3>\n<p>In the wake of the 2020 cancellation, the BABSCon team started preparing for and announcing BABSCon 2021, which was to take place from the 2nd to the 4th of <a href=\"/cwcki/April_2021\" title=\"April 2021\">April 2021</a>.
