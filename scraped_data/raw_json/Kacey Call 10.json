But, I mean, what did she do that is making you so mad?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b> </font>Come on, if you look on her YouTube account, vivi-the-gee, which is for my- which is ahh- oh shi- I have subscribed to that, and I blocked her from my YouTube, mmm, oh maybe I did but-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b> </font>She must have said something really bad. What was it?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uhh, but anyway she made these- she made- behind my back she make these <a href=\"/cwcki/Audiobooks\" title=\"Audiobooks\">audiobook parodies</a> of my <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\">comic pages</a> and that I should- and she did not have my permission on that. She was Clyde- She is- she was <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">Clyde Cash</a>'s cousin and Clyde Cash was a major troll in my life- was really-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oh, well maybe you should make a video concerning that, I mean you know-\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I’m talk- may I finish, anyway-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Whatever.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> -anyway she- anyway aside from that- in addition to all of that she just made a whole bunch of mockery out of me. She just mocked me a whole bunch. And slandered- and slandered along with the <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">trolls</a>. I mean, she was no better than the rest of 'em.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> How did she mock you?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Sh-sh-she. You watch any of her audiobooks and you'll find- and you'll let her- audiobooks and you'll find- or it- yeah, you watch any of her videos and you'll find out. But anyway, als- Oh shoot, I lost my train of thought.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, I mean, it just seemed like that she just gave your comics a voice. I mean, I thought they were pretty good. It's just the comics in audio form. I mean, she didn't change any of your text or anything. Lots of books have audiobooks.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, anyway, I remember what I was talking about. She also wrote this book that she sent me a copy of. I did not read it, and I do not care to. I loaned it to my pastoral counselor <a href=\"/cwcki/Rocky_Shoemaker\" title=\"Rocky Shoemaker\">Rocky Shoemaker</a>, she read some of it, and it was just mostly mockery again- mostly mockery against me and my characte- and my Sonichu characters and all- and all- and my real life [unintelligible] and all that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Did it- did it actually have your name in it?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>pause</i>] I wouldn't know. I have not read it.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well then how do you know?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> It's- she based it- she-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Maybe it's a wonderful book.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> No! It's not that- no, it's not that great a book. She just basically copied-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You didn't know though if you didn't read it?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> She copied my life though. She called it The Girl- I think she titled it, <a href=\"/cwcki/A_Girl_Who_Brought_Down_the_World\" title=\"A Girl Who Brought Down the World\">\"The Girl Who Fought the World,\"</a> something like that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, that doesn't even sound like you. You're not a girl, are you?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I know, but-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I mean, I think you should read it. Give it a chance.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> But, it's like you know, she portrayed the girl being me, or me being a girl.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, I think maybe you're trying to read into it too much. I think you should just read the book.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uh, I might, after I get it back.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Most definitely. I want to read it. That sounds exciting. But, um,\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, but anyway-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> why didn't you want to read it, if it's from your friend?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> She was never a friend, she was a troll, a- and worst off, she was a cousin of a bigger troll.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, maybe you <i>should</i> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Captain%27s_Log,_Stardate_September_4th,_2009\" title=\"Captain's Log, Stardate September 4th, 2009\">make a video about that</a>. You know, like really let your anger and rage out.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah-yeah, I will think about that, and I will do that later. I mean-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>talking over Chris</i>] I mean, if you've never addressed her like that you should.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, anyway, hmm, anyway a- if I may, I'd like to change the subject. [<i>pause</i>] OK. Um. Yeah, but anyway, I, uh- I went- I went out and did my shopping Wednesday, and, uh, I found accessory <a href=\"/cwcki/Muscle_bra\" title=\"Muscle bra\">sports bras</a> for ten dollars at <a href=\"/cwcki/Mal-Wart\" title=\"Mal-Wart\">Wal-Mart</a>.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>pause</i>] Oh!

I went- I went out and, ya know, I told you, I went- I exercised and I worked, you know, in- while wearing the sports bra. But yeah, but, I definitely feel the difference because [<i>machine noise</i>]-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> What colors do you have?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> What?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> What colors do you have?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Oh, OK, hang on, let me- let me get back to that.

[<i>stammering</i>]-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>interrupting</i>] I know, just, you know, normally they're just for sports.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, but-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>talking over Chris</i>] But, I mean, I guess you wouldn't have to worry about getting a real bra, you know, all of the frilly, lacy stuff.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. If- I do play on starting a regimen of exercises daily. You know, goin' out [unintelligible] walking, jogging, and I-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>interrupting</i>] Just remember you've got to get your heart-rate up, or else it's for nothing. You've got to get that cardio in.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>annoyed</i>] Yeah, I'm going to.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Good.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Well, anyway-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> That'll make me very proud.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> OK. Anyway. Anyway, let me go ahead and get this off my mind for a bit. When I went, uh, shopping for a bra, I mean, I was told- like- [unintelligible] I think [<i>stammers</i>] it was either you or Kim, one of y'all - uh, I think it was you though - um, were telling me about like, you know, small, medium, large, extra-large, double-extra-large, triple-extra-large, those sizes, but during those- instead of those letter sizes it was like number sizes. So I had- I had to ask the-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>interrupting</i>] Oh, so they went by bust size?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, so I had to ask the, uh, nearby lady to- to measure my bust size. I turned out I was a forty-three.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oh, a forty-three!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, uh-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>talking over Chris</i>] I bet she was really shocked that you were like, \"Hey, please measure me!\" Ha ha.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I mean I was a little bit- I was a little bit embarrassed at first, but, you know, I can- I felt like, you know, I emotionally prepared myself for it. I mean, I emotionally prepared myself to go shopping for sports bras, so, you know, it definitely is like, you know, it- it pretty much falls in a si- suit [quoi?]. It made it easier for me to-\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> -accept it, so I could measure my bust- so I could ask to get- get my bust size measured. Anyway, so anyway, I got a set of three forty-twos.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK. I mean, as long as they fit.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. They fit great. [<i>pause</i>] They feel awesome.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b> </font>That's good, that's good. As long as you're happy.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, you know what-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>interrupting</i>] So anything else on your mind?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uh, if I was- I was just about to let y'all know about another thought. Like, you know, aba- from- in addition to that, but, yeah, um, you know, it's like, you know, you know, I can see how- how you women feel, like, you know, when your- when your breasts start coming out, and then, it's like, you need the support of a bra to keep them in- to keep them in check and so they don't bounce about. Like, now I understand that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>mystified</i>] What? Um. I guess. I mean- I mean, I don't really have a problem with my structure. I mean, they're- they're- they pretty much can hold themselves up on their own. I mean, I just wear it for other obvious reasons.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> What, you mean like for looks?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, yeah, that, and it's, um, socially acceptable, and, uh, you know, you know, if you get cold you wanna make sure that you have a bra so that your nipples aren't sticking out. Come on. [<i>giggles</i>]\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> He HA HA! Yes. I have heard about that. Mnm, but anyway- anyway, with support and a woman, 'cause like, you know, I relate to- <a href=\"/cwcki/Women%27s_rights\" title=\"Women's rights\">I can relate to women</a> in that sense. It's like, now I understand <i>that</i>.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Yep, show of your feminine side, right? [<i>giggles</i>]\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I mean, like, you know, you, yeah, you should know as well as I do, like, you know, in the chromosomes [pronounces as chromozones] there's an X and a Y in every dude, and yet there are two X's in every woman.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Uh, yes! Yes! That is how genetics work.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, so there- so there you go. If it- if it was like, you know, everybody was total- every guy was totally a guy, they'd be like two Y's. And it don't- they don't-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>interrupting</i>] Um, I don't think genetics quite works like that, but, um-\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>interrupting</i>] Yeah, I don- yeah they don't work that way. That's what I was just sayin'.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I mean. Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>pause</i>] Hmm, but yeah. But, yeah, yeah, I still feel <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Straight\" title=\"Straight\">straight</a>, and it's like, you know. Yeah, you know, when I took the pictures that you just received from Kim, you know, I sent them to Kim first.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Uh huh.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uh, before- before I went and took those pictures, I wanted to think about it further, it's like, you know, so, yeah, I shaved my- I shaved the <a href=\"/cwcki/Hair\" title=\"Hair\">hair</a> on my belly. Yeah, I got hair on me, so yeah, I kept the chest hair and whatnot. Uh, we can talk more 'bout that another- another phone call, or after I finish up my thought here.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Your what?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Anyway, uh-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oh, your thought. OK, OK, got it.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Anyway, yeah, anyway, after I shaved off the belly hair then just I took- I just spent a whole minute just lookin' at myself without my shirt on, and it with- with my bra- with my bra on. J-just lookin' at myself in the mirror for one minute, studying myself. It was like, you know, I mean, you know, at first I didn't know what to think, that's, like you know- that's why I sit in the mirror and look- took a good long- took a good one- took a good long look, there. And then I went to feed my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chandler_cats\" title=\"Chandler cats\">cats</a> and check the mail in the my mailbox, and that was about fifteen minutes later, and then that thought came back-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>interrupting</i>] Wait. Did you- did you go outside in your sports bra?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> No, I put- no, I put my shirt back on.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oh, OK, OK.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> No, I put my shirt back on before I went outside. An- [STATIC] af- I had- the thou- the image from what I saw in the mirror came back to me, and I thought- and then I was like, 'yeah, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tomgirl\" title=\"Tomgirl\">I look pretty good</a>, and I- and I can accept this, I can get used to this,\" and then I- and then I just felt confident, or, when I- when I sit in front of the camera and took the pictures that I later sent to Kim.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oh, well think about how confident you're going to be <i>too</i> when you exercise and <i>work</i> those things off, so that you don't even <i>need</i> a sports bra. I mean, you know, <i>that's</i> going to be awesome!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, that's true. But, then again, you know, I had- I've had these <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Manboobs\" title=\"Manboobs\">manboobs</a> since I was eight years old, about.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, uh, th-that's not really how the way our bodies work. I mean, if you lose weight, you're gonna lose it there too.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Well, we'll- we'll see what happens after I get [<i>stammers</i>] after I-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>interrupts</i>] Chris, who's going to be in the medical profession? C'mon.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> You are. [<i>chuckles</i>]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I mean, yeah, I mean, I mean, I guess, you know, maybe if you were a little chubby back then it would be possible, but, I mean, c'mon. [<i>giggles</i>]\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. [<i>chuckles</i>] OK, you are going to the medical confess- medical profession. I almost said confession-[<i>laughs</i>]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>laughs</i>]\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, it yeah, you're learning-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Freudian slip, there.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> -yeah, you're learning lots of that, it's like, you know, you can currently- you're learning as you go, but yet, you don't know- uh, but it's like, you know as much as you do and I appreciate that. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> No prob.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> And, uh, yeah, I mean, you know, you still got a lot to learn, but I'm- you still got a lot to learn, but yeah, you know a lot for- you know a lot right now. So, yeah, who's going to the medical profession? You are.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Yes. I've been studying this since I, you know, since I knew I wanted to be in the medical profession.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hmm. By the way how- by the way when was that? How old were you when you first decided?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Ten.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Wow. So you started like, uh, some time during middle or high school? [<i>yammers on</i>]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>interrupting</i>] Uh, when I was ten I was in elementary school.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. Elementary. [<i>short pause</i>] Yeah. OK, yes, I'm- okay, I get a little confused, 'cause, you see, I was, uh- oh yeah, uh, [<i>calculating to himself</i>] then I was in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Providence_Middle_School\" title=\"Providence Middle School\">Providence Middle</a>, about uhhhhh- Yeah, I turned thirteen when I was Providence- in Providence Middle, so I guess, yeah, at ten, you would- one would be likely in elementary school still yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Yep.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I just had t-to sort that out in my head just now. OK, so, really, you took classes without- y-you learned some things while you were in elementary school?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, I mean, I just always wanted to be it, and, uh, I've always loved books, so, you know, I'd read on my own. It wasn't necessarily, you know, in the school curriculum.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. Anyway, that's good. Very good. I commend you for it.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Thank you. Um, what did <i>you</i> want to be when you were little?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Ah, yeah, shoot, I never knew what I wanted to be when I- to be when I grew up. I mean the closest thing that I would have ever thought I would have wanted to be when I grew up, was a <b>cowboy</b>.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> A cowboy?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> It was like only for a short- it was like only for a short while during that phase. And, yet, other- other than that every time I was asked, \"Where do you see yourself five years from now?,\" I never have an answer; I always draw a blank.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Hmm, that's not good, you should get some goals, I mean, even if you, uh, don't exactly meet them, as long as you have those goals.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, it's only like, you know, it's like, you know, for a while I could answer my- I could answer that question. \"Oh, yeah, I'm married and I have a daughter named <a href=\"/cwcki/Crystal\" title=\"Crystal\">Crystal</a>.\"\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I don't know, I don't think most guys would think that's something to be proud of, I mean, yeah, family's important and all, but don't you want to make something of yourself? You need to have goals.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, well, I mean, you know, currently I-I am starting to, uh, make some goals, and setting those up for myself. I-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>interrupting</i>] Where did you get the name, uh, Crystal anyway? I mean, it sounds like, you know, like, that champagne that rappers drink, you know, like, like the stripper.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> OK, OK. I had- I had first heard the name Crystal for being my daughter in my early teens, or, even as young as ten years old. Where I was like- I was- I was- I-I think, yeah, this is my first <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Dream\" title=\"Dream\">dream</a> I'm talking about here - my first of many - where I'm leaving the office and I had my daughter there with me. And-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>interrupting</i>] Right, you've told me this.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I'm talk- I'm talking-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> But I just asked where, uh, where you, uh, where you got the name from. I don't need to hear the dream again.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I know, but this is it. In the dream, I called her Crystal. I knew her name was Crystal. That is the first time right there, that dream, in the office, that was going on there. I was like, \"Oh my God, I have to save my daughter <i>Crystal</i>.\"\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Did you ever think that maybe that was just a dream?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I thought it was a lot more than that. It was like, you know, you're- I thought it was like a God- like <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/God\" title=\"God\">God</a> telling me what my future was- what my future was going to be, that I would have a daughter named Crystal.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, I mean, OK, so when do you think you're going to get married, you know, so you can start this family? Like, when do you- when do you want to get married by?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> How would I want to get married by?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Yeah, when do you want to get married by? Like, you know, like age thirty? Age forty?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I would like to get married before I turn thirty.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oh, well, you've got some work to do!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yes I do. And to think I- and I have been working, like, you know, I realized, \"Oh, I should- I should be going out <a href=\"/cwcki/Dating\" title=\"Dating\">dating</a>. I should be dating women.\" I realized that-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>interrupting</i>] Well I mean, it's not even that-\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> -on my twenty-first birthday.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You're-you're gonna have to go get jobs. You're gonna have to, you know, um, get a group of frie- I mean, you're just gonna have to create a whole life really quickly. I mean, a girl's not just going to look at you and go, \"Oh, look, you live with your parents.\" You gonna need a steady job and a place.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, well, at least I'm working on the job front. I'm filling out applications-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>interrupting</i>] Well, I know-\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> -online.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b> </font>if you want to go by thirty, you only have three years, and that stuff takes time. I mean, do you have any savings to do this with?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I have a savings account, yes.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> But i- are there savings <i>in</i> that account?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>long pause</i>] Yes. <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_money\" title=\"Chris and money\">There are a few dollars in there</a>.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> A few <i>dollars</i>? Like, I'm-I'm talking like- like <b>thousands</b> of dollars. [<i>chuckles</i>] Or, do you literally mean like, \"a few dollars.\" [<i>snickers</i>]\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, so it's like, I add into it every month. I mean, I originally had it started at two hundred, and then, in <b>past</b> impulses- past impulses, I've improved on my impulses-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>interrupting</i>] So you don't have any savings-\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I have-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b> </font>-is what you're saying?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b> </font>-I currently have ten dollars, and I'm let- I'm- and I'm lettin' that grow. It's like, you know, if it's- if it's not above- if it's not two hundred and above they charge you four dollars for having a savings account there- four dollars a month. Like, I've got a little bit- I-I've got as much a I can, out of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Monthly_tugboat\" title=\"Monthly tugboat\">monthly tugboat</a>, that I can maybe grow it back up, but then- now that I've learned that I can make as most as nine hundred and eighty dollars, in a month-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Uh-huh.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b> </font>-without it- without it affecting my Social, then it's like, you know, I'm gonna take what I earned- what I've earned- what I earned from my job, and put it directly into my savings account and save it.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK, well then you can't impulse buy then.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. That is the case. [<i>pause</i>] And I'm accept- and I accept that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>pause</i>] Well, I mean, have you bought anything recently from like, um, the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Playstation_3\" title=\"Playstation 3\">Playstation 3</a> store, or any video games?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Not on impulse; it was planned out of my budget. So I still have- I still have like fifty- I still have like fifty dollars in my bank- in my main bank account.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oh, well how long did you have these things planned?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I had it planned for a few weeks.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oh [Chris struggles to interrupt] well, that's almost like impulse.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>massive stress sigh</i>] Anyway, firstly there was <a href=\"/cwcki/Guitar_Hero\" title=\"Guitar Hero\">Guitar Hero</a> 5, I only had to pay forty-eight something out of that after- I had put the five dollars down cash, and then I- then I traded in a few more games. And then I had to go and get a new printer-copier-scanner for sixty-nine dollars. And then I- and then I wanted to catch up on my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Playstation_Network\" title=\"Playstation Network\">Playstation Network</a> account, so, I bought a $50 card. And then, yeah, upon, uh, the recent necessities- upon the realizing that, I also spent ten dollars on necess- [STATIC] -sports bras.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, that's, I mean, look how much you spend on video games. I mean, that- that's a lot in, like, a day or two, that really is, especially, uh, like, if you had bills, you couldn't do that. I mean, how could you have spent that much, even if it was planned, and yet you didn't even get your dad a birthday present?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>frustrated</i>] I forgot about the birthday present. I can get him the- I can get him the Maple Nut- Maple Nut Goodies, and I will.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Still, that's a lot to spend on video games-\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>interrupting</i>] But- but yeah- but- but- but yeah I'm tryin' to- but- but yeah, I'm trying to do not so much impulse buying and I'm trying to <i>save</i>.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, I guess you're going to have to work better on that, 'cause you just spent a ton on video games at once.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>stress sigh</i>] I've- I- I thought we- I thought we've discussed before that all that money on the video games did not happen all at once.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> No, no, no, I'm talking about what you just told me. That's still a lot to drop on video games at once.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>stress sigh</i>] And plus, I only- and plus, at that rate- yeah, [<i>calculates video game costs to himself</i>]-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>interrupts</i>] I mean, I wish I could do that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> And then, I only did fif- and then I only did fifty for the Playstation Network. <b>And</b> I paid fif- and I paid- and I paid seventy dollars for the new printer-scanner-copier that I <i>needed</i>, so I could print the com- so I could print my comics to send out one copy to the <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_copyright\" title=\"Chris and copyright\">copyright office</a>, and then three more amongst- between- from be- for between Marvel, Dark Horse, and Archie.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I-I know. that's- that's still a lot of money just to drop though, like, I mean, I <i>wish</i> I could drop that on stuff I wanted, or even needed.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>stress sigh</i>] Yeah well during th-during the longer time I did not really have any goal-oriented plans. But now-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>interrupting</i>] Well if you want to get married at 30 you better start getting those plans.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah well I mean fortunately with the recent events and talking to you and Kim I am starting to put my plans together.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well you know three years goes by pretty quickly so good luck.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. [<i>pause</i>] Yeah, thank you. [<i>sighs</i>]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I mean have you ever thought of selling your video games for money like the ones you don't play anymore?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah I thought about that and I did not wish to do that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Why not? I mean if you don't use them.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I'd like to h- be able to hold onto them for my daughter to enjoy. Or even my- even <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Reginald_Chandler\" title=\"Reginald Chandler\">my son</a>. My children.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> But by the time you have children there'll be better video games out. I mean stuff improves all the time. But I mean they'll be able to get ROMs of anything.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> They'll be- they'll be able to get ROMs. [<i>pause</i>]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Yeah ROMs are wonderful, I mean it keeps the clutter away 'cause they're all in a nice little y'know megabytes and all that stuff and y'know you can just join GameFly or something like that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>sighs</i>]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [pause] I mean think about just how much room you would save. I mean it would besides maybe your kids won't like video games. Maybe they'll be more into sports.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Well at least for me to enjoy then. I mea- I have- I am a nostalgic type person and I often get nostalgia. And sometimes I don-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [interrupting] Well so do I but even I know that I have to keep up the times. I mean what of your old games have you played recently? Like of the oldest of the old.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Which ones have I played recently?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah well I've played a few levels of Knuckles Chaotix on my 32x.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> And that's it?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I also p- I also played the egg-stopping game on my NES with my PowerPad. But then I- then I put the PowerPad away. Back to where it was.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well I mean why don't you just sell the ones you don't play?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah well that's a lot for me to sort through.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well you gotta do it eventually. I mean if not you're going to be a hoarder or something.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> A what?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> A hoarder? Somebody who-\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I've never heard of that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> It- it's some- it's a packrat. It's somebody who has a psychological problem where they can't give up their stuff and they fill their house with junk. I mean it's somebody who hoards things.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> As if I- as if I have an [unintelligible] establish with that lifestyle because my mother and my father are packrats. I think we've established that in previous conversations.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Um. I don't think you've really talked to me about that. But um this whole- maybe you should set an example for them.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Alright well let me just refresh- let me just refresh you. Yeah well you see my mom and dad bring home stuff. A massive amount though including- like we have these two couches in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris%27s_room\" title=\"Chris's room\">my room</a> that my mom says she's gonna take out the old couches and replace- take out a couple of the old couches [cough] replace them with a new one. But she never did- the two couches are just sitting one on top of the other at the edge of our living room and also the couch in the kitchen which she says she- she said she was gonna put together but she never did. We also got like a couple of pieces of furniture I don't even remember what they are downstairs. Where it's like you can't even get into the music slash computer room downstairs. Anyway we have a computer upstairs in the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris%27s_kitchen\" title=\"Chris's kitchen\">kitchen</a> up here by the way, at least we get that. And also between shelves, filing cabinets, whatever.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well um. Why don't you do it for her? I mean your parents are old, maybe they need the help. Why don't you take out the old furniture and put the new ones in? I bet you could do it I mean you helped out with all that brush in your yard so obviously you're strong.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yes but it's like y'know if I, and I mean I would love to do it for them-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well just do it.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> -But it's like. They have- they have to- I've been waiting for them to make the plans and I do not know where to put everything.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You don't have to make any plans. Just take the old couches out, arrange for a pickup or arrange for Goodwill to come get them. The end. It's so simple.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> It's not as simple as you think plus I have a whole bunch of other clutter.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Just give it away. I mean if they haven't used it - if nobody has used it in a year you don't need it. Just get rid of it you can live without it. You should totally do it for them.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> And then my family s- then my mom would yell at me and definitely would probably throw me out of the house.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> No I think they would be happy that you did something. Maybe you should talk to them then. Be like \"Hey, I wanna clean up the house. I'm gonna get rid of stuff.\"\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I have... I have talked to them. And they- and they- I have talked to them, they're always like \"NO NO NO. NO NO NO! YOU DON'T DO THAT. YOU DO THAT, WE'RE GONNA KICK YOU OUT OF THE HOUSE!\"\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, that's a pretty bad position to be in, because that's unhealthy for you to live in. That's extremely unhealthy.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, tell me about it. [<i>sigh, followed by pause</i>] Whoo, I got a bit of a headache right now.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Yeah I can understand the feeling. So um- but yeah y'know that rage out maybe you should maybe right now you should go make that video. Cause y'know you can put all that anger that you just showed me into it. I mean all that frustration just go and get that video done. It'll make you feel a lot better. I'm pretty sure of it.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, OK.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> So why don't I let you go and I expect the video to be up soon. I'll be excited to see it.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> OK.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Awesome. OK well then I'll call you tomorrow.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Alright you take care, stay safe.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Bye bye.\n</p><p>[Call ends] \n</p><p><br/>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<p><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.4shared.com/mp3/nx7qArgdce/Kacey_Call_10.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">MP3 Phone Call</a>\n</p>\n<table style=\"width: 90%; max-width: 600px; height: 70px; margin: 1em auto 1em auto; border: 0.15em outset #000; background: #eee; vertical-align: centered; color:#000;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"width: 33%; max-width: 200px; text-align: center; color:#000;\">⇐ <a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey_Call_9\" title=\"Kacey Call 9\">Kacey Call 9</a><span style=\"color: #000\"></span>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33%; max-width: 200px; text-align: center; color:#000;\"><span style=\"color: {{{textcolor}}}\"><strong><a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey_calls\" title=\"Kacey calls\">Kacey Phone Calls</a></strong></span>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33%; max-width: 200px; text-align: center; color:#000;\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey_Call_11\" title=\"Kacey Call 11\">Kacey Call 11</a><span style=\"color: #000\"></span> ⇒\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p><br/>\n</p>\n<center><b>    Chats and calls</b></center>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n</p>\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"navbox\" style=\";\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"padding:2px;\">\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"nowraplinks collapsible mw-collapsed mw-collapsible\" style=\"width:100%;background:transparent;color:inherit;;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<th class=\"navbox-title\" colspan=\"2\" style=\";\"><div style=\"float:left; width:6em;text-align:left;\"> <span class=\"noprint plainlinksneverexpand\" style=\"white-space:nowrap; font-weight:normal; font-size:xx-small; ;;border:none;;\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"/w/index.php?title=Template:Classic_Chris_era&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" title=\"Template:Classic Chris era (page does not exist)\"><span style=\";;border:none;;\" title=\"View this template\">v</span></a> <span style=\"font-size:80%;\">•</span> <a class=\"new\" href=\"/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Classic_Chris_era&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" title=\"Template talk:Classic Chris era (page does not exist)\"><span style=\"color:#002bb8;;;border:none;;\" title=\"Discussion about this template\">d</span></a> <span style=\"font-size:80%;\">•</span> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"//sonichu.com/w/index.php?title=Template:Classic_Chris_era&amp;action=edit\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#002bb8;;;border:none;;\" title=\"You can edit this template.
