id=\"Reasons_for_Chris.27s_refusal_to_work\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Reasons_for_Chris's_refusal_to_work\">Reasons for Chris's refusal to work</span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_factors\">External factors</span></h3>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Criminal_record\">Criminal record</span></h4>\n<p>Chris, like many of us, has had at least one run-in with the <a href=\"/cwcki/Jerkop\" title=\"Jerkop\">police</a>. However, not only has Chris managed at least 6 <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_the_law\" title=\"Chris and the law\">run-ins</a> with law enforcement, but at least 2 wobbler felony charges (which got <a href=\"/cwcki/28_October_2011\" title=\"28 October 2011\">downgraded to misdemeanor</a> status or got dismissed due to <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism_disorder_deferred_disposition\" title=\"Autism disorder deferred disposition\">an alternative sentencing program</a>), multiple misdemeanors, an EPO, and <a href=\"/cwcki/Jail_Saga\" title=\"Jail Saga\">a lengthy stay in jail</a> for a charge of <a href=\"/cwcki/Affair_with_Mother\" title=\"Affair with Mother\">incest</a>.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Parental_influence\">Parental influence</span></h4>\n<p>Chris's parents, but more so <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler\" title=\"Bob Chandler\">Bob</a>, had encouraged him to not be employed, believing that his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Monthly_Tugboat\" title=\"Monthly Tugboat\">Social Security Disability Insurance</a> (SSDI) is all he really needs to support himself - a belief that ultimately proved to be false with the advent of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Financhu_Crisis\" title=\"Financhu Crisis\">Financhu Crisis</a>.\n</p><p>Chris claimed that \"taking care\" of his parents is a full-time job in its own right<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup>. Instead of getting a job to support his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Barb\" title=\"Barb\">mother</a>, he slowly started to sell off toys he didn't play with anymore, or begged for donations online (often in the form of videos that Barb also appeared in). This was not a substantial income, and the money Chris did get was wasted in the blink of an eye. He claimed to need money for his mother's doctor's and dentist appointments, but he usually would post a few days later that he had gotten a new toy or a video game, implying that he either lied about how much the appointments cost, or that he used his mother's money just for his own selfish needs.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Negative_experiences_with_workers_and_managers\">Negative experiences with workers and <a href=\"/cwcki/Manajerks\" title=\"Manajerks\">managers</a></span></h4>\n<p>While Chris has not lived a particularly good life unemployed, he also has had some <a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_places_that_have_banned_Chris\" title=\"List of places that have banned Chris\">bad experiences</a> with the employees and managers of several of the places he frequented, which further shows some of Chris's views on what it means to be employed. The way he has treated such people provides insight into Chris's delusional ideas about the role of an employee. It is a manager's duty to take action in difficult situations, like if a customer is loitering or causing a disturbance, two things that Chris has done many times in the past. Chris however, unaware of how he should act in public places, only saw such actions as a form of discrimination, solely to keep him from doing as he pleases, whether it be <a href=\"/cwcki/Love_Quest\" title=\"Love Quest\">soliciting a girlfriend</a>, or <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_Boom\" title=\"Sonic Boom\">vandalizing merchandise or property</a>. These views are also apparent in some of his comics, where he depicts the employees and managers that have given him a hard time as <a href=\"/cwcki/Manajerks\" title=\"Manajerks\">corrupt tyrants</a> abusing their power.\n</p><p>When Chris had his only known job at Wendy's, he didn't get along with the restaurant's staff very well. He claimed his manager had a \"spike on his shoulder\" against him, and stated a female co-worker would repeatedly criticize and \"insult\" him, which in reality might have been her simply giving him constructive criticism. At one point, Chris decided to draw an unflattering picture of an older co-worker as a <a href=\"/cwcki/Pok%C3%A9mon\" title=\"Pokémon\">Pokémon</a> on a napkin, which was allegedly the impetus behind his eventual firing from his job.\n</p><p>Chris also has had negative experiences with <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jerkops\" title=\"Jerkops\">mall security guards</a>. <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_the_law\" title=\"Chris and the law\">Chris's run-ins with the law</a> have never been pleasant, and even though Chris does not exactly view workers and law enforcement in the same light, law enforcers are still technically employed by some organization. On various occasions, Chris has been shown to <a href=\"/cwcki/26_December_2014\" title=\"26 December 2014\">bolt out of a GameStop in fear</a> when security is called, suggesting a fear of security guards, likely stemming from <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_the_law#2011\" title=\"Chris and the law\">previous</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Charlottesville_Fashion_Square#Chris_vs._Fashion_Square\" title=\"Charlottesville Fashion Square\">experiences</a>.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Financial_enablers\">Financial enablers</span></h4>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Enablers\" title=\"Enablers\">Enablers</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>In the wake of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys</a>, Chris's enabling has gone far beyond just his mother. Chris now has admiring fans that are willing to give him loads of money in order to support him. Even after being arrested, fans continued to send him money through his inmate account, as well as donating money to his livestreams when he was released from jail. This first became an issue in early 2014, when their <a href=\"/cwcki/14_Branchland_Court\" title=\"14 Branchland Court\">house</a> burned down and his family had to move into a <a href=\"/cwcki/Rental_House\" title=\"Rental House\">rental home</a> temporarily while it was being renovated. In response to this, followers of Chris began to send him monetary donations as well as care packages. This quickly became something Chris depended on, and he regularly begged for donations for years to come, making this form of enabling commonplace. He would often beg for money to support his family, and then conveniently have new toys visible in his room. However, this stream of income never ceased.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Internal_factors\">Internal factors</span></h3>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Egotism_and_delusions\"><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ego\" title=\"Ego\">Egotism and delusions</a></span></h4>\n<p>Chris, <a href=\"/cwcki/Messiah_complex\" title=\"Messiah complex\">believing he is an omnipotent and omniscient goddess</a>, doesn't have time for such frivolous things as working to make a living. In <a href=\"/cwcki/October_2017\" title=\"October 2017\">October 2017</a>, Chris claimed that he was too busy with <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a> and his <a href=\"/cwcki/Imaginary_friends\" title=\"Imaginary friends\">imaginary friends</a>, in addition to helping Barb and the pets. In <a href=\"/cwcki/June_2019\" title=\"June 2019\">June 2019</a>, Chris claimed that he was already employed by God to oversee the Dimensional Merge. Additionally, ever since Chris's transition,  he feels that finding a job runs the risk of being discriminated against for his <a href=\"/cwcki/Transgender\" title=\"Transgender\">tomgirl gender</a>, despite the fact that discrimination on the basis of gender is illegal, especially as a result of a Supreme Court ruling on 15 June 2020.\n</p><p>In a moment of self-awareness, Chris fears being incompetent at work, and he claimed in <a href=\"/cwcki/May_2018\" title=\"May 2018\">May 2018</a> that he feared that weens and A-logs will harass him at work, similar to how they harassed the management of The End Games and Anytime Fitness into banning him. However, even those <a href=\"/cwcki/Slow-in-the-minds\" title=\"Slow-in-the-minds\">significantly more mentally ill or otherwise disabled</a> can find work, meaning Chris can quickly find easy work if he really wanted to. This shows that Chris will pull any idea out of his ass to avoid having to get off of it and contribute to society.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Lack_of_marketable_skills\">Lack of marketable skills</span></h4>\n<p>As evidenced by his resume and lack of education, Chris lacks any marketable skills or qualifications to get anything beyond a minimum wage job in the retail or fast food industry. Given his aforementioned lofty goals for salary and demanding things like having an assistant, Chris grossly overestimates what kind of a job one can find with <a href=\"/cwcki/CADD\" title=\"CADD\">an outdated Associate's degree</a> and a brief employment at Wendy's.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"General_laziness\">General laziness</span></h4>\n<p>Chris, being as lazy as he is, would find trouble keeping a job for long due to this laziness. This is evidenced by his brief stint as a Wendy's employee, in which he is quoted as taking \"frequent breaks\" and not taking care of his uniform.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup>\n</p><p>When creating <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\">his magnum opus</a>, Chris had no schedule set in stone, only taking time to write and draw pages when he had \"inspiration\". Arguably his most productive period was between <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_7\" title=\"Sonichu 7\">2007</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_10\" title=\"Sonichu 10\">2010</a> when he started to achieve online infamy and constantly fell for trolling schemes. Even then, these volumes took anywhere from several months to over a <i>year</i> before getting completed. Not to mention that Chris pretty much <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_writing#Plot_and_Drama\" title=\"Chris and writing\">wrote every <i>Sonichu</i> issue by the seat of his pants with minimal regard for consistency</a> (and of course, writing is <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_art#Visual_style_and_most_artistic_fundamentals\" title=\"Chris and art\">not the only place where he fails at that</a>), resulting in the self-insert fanfic clusterfuck we've known and loved since the late 2000s.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Past_stance_on_employment\">Past stance on employment</span></h2>\n<p>In the past, Chris showed some degree of interest in pursuing a career, but only for his own personal gain, rather than so that he can move out of his parents' house and obtain a degree of self-sufficiency. For example, although he expressed an interest in becoming a comic book artist, working for either Archie or DC,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup> he also stated, when he completes his Love Quest, that he would stay at home while his wife works, showing that Chris was somewhat hesitant even before then. Other sources point to Chris believing that obtaining a job is only necessary to pick up a girlfriend, which is evident when he decided to take up a job in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Cutco_Cutlery\" title=\"Cutco Cutlery\">Cutco Cutlery</a> at the beginning of his <a href=\"/cwcki/Love_Quest\" title=\"Love Quest\">Love Quest</a>. \n</p><p>Key insight into Chris's attitude towards job hunting is found in his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Resume\" title=\"Resume\">resume</a> from 2009. In it, Chris shows he did not understand what constitutes work experience, let alone its importance. For example, he believes that doing \"volunteer work\" for the <a href=\"/cwcki/Card_games\" title=\"Card games\">Pokémon Leagues</a> at <a href=\"/cwcki/The_GAMe_PLACe\" title=\"The GAMe PLACe\">the GAMe PLACe</a> counts as work experience. In reality, mere \"volunteer work\" does not typically catch the eye of most employers. Also, Chris was not a gym leader as he claimed, but rather was a substitute when the actual Gym Leader was not available. Finally, even if this could be taken into account, what experience he obtained is likely negligible, as he had no authority over the players, and was, in fact, carefully supervised by the staff. In the same résumé, he cites his production of comics as work experience, despite not doing this in a professional setting, and the product itself leaving a lot to be desired. \n</p><p>The résumé also shows that, in his entire adult life, not even a fraction of his time was spent on an actual job, let alone one that was full-time in a professional environment. Counting all of the positions he had that did not involve being a Gym Leader's Assistant or working on his <i>Sonichu</i> comics, his total work experience amounts to a grand total of 5 months, at most. This estimate is generous because, while he claimed to have worked at Wendy's for 2 months on his résumé, he also claimed that he was already fired on <a href=\"/cwcki/Twin_Falling_Towers\" title=\"Twin Falling Towers\">11 September</a> to <a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey\" title=\"Kacey\">Kacey</a>'s father. Please note that this was only across an entire two-year gap between working each of the two positions he held.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"List_of_jobs_on_Dimension_1218\">List of jobs on Dimension 1218</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Wendy.27s\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Wendy's\">Wendy's</span></h3>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Wendy%27s\" title=\"Wendy's\">Wendy's</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>The first place Chris attempted to work at was at his local Wendy's. While there, his primary duties were custodial in nature rather than food preparation or direct customer interaction. Despite painting himself as an employee that \"serves the customers with kind, understanding help\", accounts from employers and customers have shown him to be a rude and difficult employee to work with. Chris was later fired from the restaurant, giving vague and contradictory answers about his dismissal; the motive for his dismissal was either the aforementioned Pokémon caricature incident, or a time he allegedly frightened a kid to tears with his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Donald_Duck_impression\" title=\"Donald Duck impression\">Donald Duck impression</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cutco_Cutlery\">Cutco Cutlery</span></h3>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Cutco\" title=\"Cutco\">Cutco</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>The second and final job that Chris claims to have worked was through Cutco Cutlery, a multi-level marketing company that primarily sells overpriced knives. The company itself is deemed to be a notorious pyramid scheme and borderline scam that generally targets high school students, college students, and gullible idiots like Chris with no work experience. Chris claims to have lost this job after his boss \"left at summer's end\". Chris had obtained this job during the beginning of his Love Quest, which also showcases that Chris believed getting a job is only for people who want to have a girlfriend, even believing that having the job just magically improved his social skills. This job alone, believe it or not, was what made him believe himself to be a \"Natural Salesperson\". After this job, Chris would go out of his way to produce his <a href=\"/cwcki/Attraction_Sign\" title=\"Attraction Sign\">Attraction Signs</a>, and advertise this one quality in it.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Other_employers\">Other employers</span></h3>\n<p>Besides Wendy's and Cutco, Chris has attempted to apply for a handful of other jobs, to no avail, probably due to him complaining about trolls on his resume and believing he had held positions he considered signified employment, but was actually community service at the very most.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Current_stance_on_employment\">Current stance on employment</span></h2>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">Therefore, for all of you Haterade-Chugging “GET A JOB!” spouters out there, I suggest you Shut Up and enjoy your ability to settle in a cozy Office or wherever.

Chris even stated he was fully aware of this in a Facebook post he made on 3 <a href=\"/cwcki/April_2017\" title=\"April 2017\">April 2017</a>. In the same post, however, he also claims that he would still refuse to obtain a job, even without all of the crazy shit that has happened in his life. He claims to fear the possibility of being discriminated against for being autistic, transgender, and having a lesbian soul. In the modern workforce, however, this misgiving is highly unjustified, as any kind of discrimination based on gender, disability or sex is usually frowned upon in the workforce, and leaves the employer liable for legal action or federal/state sanctions/fines. Besides the former two reasons, Chris claimed that gaining employment would be redundant, as he believes taking care of his aging parents actually counts as employment, despite not being paid for it. \n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Job_as_a_Goddess\">Job as a Goddess</span></h3>\n<p>Chris now appears to believe that his true occupation at the moment is being the goddess of an alternate dimension, thanks to the influence of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Jacob_Sockness\" title=\"Jacob Sockness\">Jacob Sockness</a> and several other influences. In the span of two years after the aforementioned Facebook post, Chris would state on at least two occasions that he believes that the ability to support himself financially by working a job is completely useless.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]</a></sup> As a matter of fact, in one of these occasions, he had actually stated that he is far too enlightened and above societal expectations to obtain an actual job, simply due to an absurd comparison he makes between the amount of time the universe will exist for against how much time he would work at a job.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-7\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">[7]</a></sup> As evident in the same post, as well as in a subsequent one, he actually believes that obtaining a job should not be mandatory, and even goes so far as to state that the citizens of <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a> are not required to obtain a job.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Can_Chris_get_a_.28real-life.29_job_now.3F\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Can_Chris_get_a_(real-life)_job_now?\">Can Chris get a (real-life) job now?</span></h3>\n<p>Many observers have admitted that it is too late for Chris to get a job now,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-8\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">[8]</a></sup> and this was long before his <a href=\"/cwcki/Jail_Saga\" title=\"Jail Saga\">arrest</a> for engaging in <a href=\"/cwcki/Affair_with_Mother\" title=\"Affair with Mother\">incestuous acts with his mother</a> permanently crippled his chances.

Even if Chris <i>does</i> manage to miraculously turn his life around and get a legitimate job, there is a very, very significant chance that obsessive <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Weening\" title=\"Weening\">weens</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/A-Logging\" title=\"A-Logging\">A-Logs</a> will harass his employer(s) into terminating him as soon as they get wind of it; similar to how they harassed the management of <a href=\"/cwcki/The_End_Games\" title=\"The End Games\">The End Games</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Anytime_Fitness\" title=\"Anytime Fitness\">Anytime Fitness</a> into <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ban\" title=\"Ban\">banning</a> Chris simply because he was there.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-harassment_11-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-harassment-11\">[11]</a></sup>\n</p><p>In short, Chris's claims that he can never get a job may be valid, albeit for different reasons to what he has in mind.

To him, chores are menial tasks that <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Barb\" title=\"Barb\">Barb</a> forces him to perform for her. Since these chores are the closest thing in Chris's life resembling actual work, and one of the few things taking him away from his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Video_games\" title=\"Video games\">video games</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">going into deep thought about other dimensions</a> and attending <a href=\"/cwcki/BronyCon\" title=\"BronyCon\">BronyCon</a>, they are a frequent source of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress\" title=\"Stress\">stress</a> and complaining for Chris. On the other hand, Chris also sees these chores as nothing more than to prove that he is not lazy, in which case he believes these chores are a good example of what a hard-working, respectable, <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">high-functioning autistic</a> he really is.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris_loves_chores\">Chris loves chores</span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:0720-PattisDoghuseISO.JPG\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"225\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/a/a3/0720-PattisDoghuseISO.JPG/300px-0720-PattisDoghuseISO.JPG\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/a/a3/0720-PattisDoghuseISO.JPG/450px-0720-PattisDoghuseISO.JPG 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/a/a3/0720-PattisDoghuseISO.JPG/600px-0720-PattisDoghuseISO.JPG 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:0720-PattisDoghuseISO.JPG\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>\"That thing had to weigh, like, 5, 10 tons!\"</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:0626-BobbyInGarden.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"202\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/d/dc/0626-BobbyInGarden.jpg/300px-0626-BobbyInGarden.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/d/dc/0626-BobbyInGarden.jpg/450px-0626-BobbyInGarden.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/d/dc/0626-BobbyInGarden.jpg/600px-0626-BobbyInGarden.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:0626-BobbyInGarden.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Bob working alone in the garden, on the verge of a 4th heart attack.</div></div></div>\n<p>Chris's most notorious mention of his chores is in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Father_Call\" title=\"Father Call\">Father Call</a>, where he desperately tries to prove his worthiness to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Matthew_Devoria\" title=\"Matthew Devoria\">Matthew Devoria</a> by listing some of the \"hard work\" he has done around the house, such as sitting on a riding lawnmower, moving chairs and carrying a <a href=\"/cwcki/Patti_Chandler\" title=\"Patti Chandler\">doghouse</a> across the yard. In fact, many of the \"chores\" he whines about are things he only did literally one time. He also compares his pulling weeds in the \"hot, hot sun\" to war veteran Matt's time served in the Gulf War.\n</p><p>Chris does not limit himself to only doing chores in real life. He also enjoys spending hours upon hours performing virtual chores in <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Animal_Crossing_Documentary\" title=\"Animal Crossing Documentary\">Animal Crossing</a></i>. These are his favorite chores to do, because not only is he able to sit on his fat ass all day while tapping at his controller, he is also rewarded for performing these tasks! As fun as this sounds, by his early 30s it seems to just be another part of Chris's daily routine, at one point telling <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Julie\" title=\"Julie\">Julie</a> that he had to take a break from his computer to \"get [his] chores done in ACCityFolk\".<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-12\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">[12]</a></sup> He eventually stopped doing these chores all together after his GameCube disintegrated in the <a href=\"/cwcki/2014\" title=\"2014\">2014</a> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Destruction_Of_Chris%27s_House\" title=\"Destruction Of Chris's House\">fire</a>.\n</p><p>In Chris's other favorite fictional world, <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(character)\" title=\"Sonichu (character)\">Sonichu</a> also does his share of the housework, as Chris elaborately explained in <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://archive.sonichu.com/cwcipedia/index.php?title=Sonichu#C.W.C._Gets_A_Big_Power.21\" rel=\"nofollow\">his CWCipedia bio</a>.

In a chat with <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">Clyde Cash</a>, Clyde questions Chris's ability to take care of himself and his sweetheart. This causes Chris to go on for what seems like an hour, listing all the chores he is capable of performing around the house.

His usual go-to excuse for the state of the house was to call her a \"pack rat\", even having the balls to <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_hypocrisy\" title=\"Chris and hypocrisy\">call her lazy</a> for not cleaning anything up. Barbara apparently left junk lying all over the house, but Chris would rather go days <a href=\"/cwcki/HairDifference\" title=\"HairDifference\">without showering</a> than figure out how to move some of Barbara's junk to another room, claiming he \"doesn't know what to do\" with any of it. His room itself was extremely messy, with it being filled with thousands of <a href=\"/cwcki/Lego\" title=\"Lego\">Legos</a> and toys that he refused to throw out.\n</p><p>Chris's parents also made him pay the family's bills, possibly as an attempt to make him feel like a real adult.

In one of her <a href=\"/cwcki/Mumble_2#People_Love_Poketunes\" title=\"Mumble 2\">rare Mumble appearances</a>, Chris lied to Barbara about paying the bills for that month, at first whining that he was being \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Honest_Content\" title=\"Honest Content\">honest</a>\", but eventually gave in to the fear of being punished by his mother and admitted he did not pay ALL of them.
