The website seems to be analogous to the real life ED, having several articles on existing people, or at least mentioning them<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup> and a huge load of dickgirl images which are uploaded nearly constantly.\n</p><p>Jason's final speech in <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_8\" title=\"Sonichu 8\"><i>Sonichu</i> #8</a>, as well as Chris's ramblings in the Time Void, seem to indicate that any percieved inaccuracies in the articles or images hosted on the site are deliberate attempts to slander Chris and his Sonichus.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup> Why exactly Jason would wish to do this or <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego#Persecution_complex\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">why he has chosen to target Chris</a> is never addressed, but his presence at the <a href=\"/cwcki/Private_Villa_of_Corrupted_Citizens\" title=\"Private Villa of Corrupted Citizens\">PVCC</a> meeting in <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_7\" title=\"Sonichu 7\">Sonichu #7</a> seem to suggest that the company and all of its employees are a part of <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Mary Lee Walsh</a>'s secret trolling cabal.\n</p><p>It is worth noting that this was the only actual <a href=\"/cwcki/Parody\" title=\"Parody\">parody</a> that Chris ever created.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Inspiration\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Inspiration</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Introduction:_Sonichu_#7\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Introduction: <i>Sonichu</i> #7</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Conflict_with_Sonichu_and_Rosechu:_Sonichu_#8\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Conflict with Sonichu and Rosechu: <i>Sonichu</i> #8</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#The_Fall_of_4-cent_garbage:_Sonichu_#10\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The Fall of 4-cent_garbage: <i>Sonichu</i> #10</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#The_4-cent_garbage_building\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The 4-cent_garbage building</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#The_elevator_gags\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The elevator gags</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Business_and_Staff\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Business and Staff</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#External_links\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">External links</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Inspiration\">Inspiration</span></h2>\n<p>4chan is an internet forum with dozens of boards dedicated to both broad and niche topics, from <a href=\"/cwcki/Anime\" title=\"Anime\">anime</a> to the <a href=\"/cwcki/Magical_thinking\" title=\"Magical thinking\">paranormal</a>, to <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_art\" title=\"Chris and art\">art</a> to <a href=\"/cwcki/Nudes\" title=\"Nudes\">pornography</a>. Well known as a platform full of trolls and homos, 4chan's place in Christory is short-lived but highly influential - and some of the first contact Chris ever had with trolls. In late 2007, members of the video games board took notice of Chris's comics and began creating satirical (largely pornographic) artwork based on <i>Sonichu</i>. A collection of this art was sent to Chris by 4chan user Evan, provoking fury and the demand that Rosechu be drawn \"masturbating and squirtin'\", rather than with a massive penis. The email exchanges between Chris and Evan would peter out in the face of Encyclopedia Dramatica.\n</p><p>Encyclopedia Dramatica is a satirical <a href=\"/cwcki/Wikipedia\" title=\"Wikipedia\">Wikipedia</a> with hundreds of articles on internet culture, personalities, and politics- all of which are written to be as offensive as possible. Just like 4chan, it is full of trolls and homos.\n</p><p>In <a href=\"/cwcki/2007\" title=\"2007\">2007</a>, while stoking his <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">ego</a>, Chris discovered <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/ED\" title=\"ED\">ED</a>'s page satirizing him and <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\">his Sonichu comics</a>. What really <a href=\"/cwcki/Family_Guy\" title=\"Family Guy\">grinds his gears</a> about the page was the \"fan art\" of <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu\" title=\"Rosechu\">Rosechu</a> with a <a href=\"/cwcki/Pickle\" title=\"Pickle\">penis</a>. Beginning 10 November 2007, Chris embarked on a quest to <a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_Chris%27s_edits_to_Encyclopedia_Dramatica\" title=\"List of Chris's edits to Encyclopedia Dramatica\">make the website less scathing</a> by uploading hideously drawn <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Rule_34\" title=\"Rule 34\">Rule 34</a> of his little abominations (and <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Slaweel Ryam</a>), along with the infamous <a href=\"/cwcki/ShecameforCWC.JPG\" title=\"ShecameforCWC.JPG\">ShecameforCWC.JPG</a> to his page.   \n</p><p>Evan never mentioned that he was from 4chan, so Chris likely found out about the site through a message sent by a white-knight. An <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/White_knight_e-mails#November_2007_.E2.80.94_ED_alert\" title=\"White knight e-mails\">e-mail</a> on 5 November 2007 attempted to alert him to the ED page, and referred to the article as being created and written by the same people making fun of Chris on 4chan's /v/ board. Whether he paid any attention to the message or not, what is known is that on <a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_Chris%27s_edits_to_Encyclopedia_Dramatica#November_2007\" title=\"List of Chris's edits to Encyclopedia Dramatica\">12 November 2007</a>, Chris first acknowledged 4chan when he made another edit to the \"Chris-chan\" article: \n</p>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">Christian Weston Chandler would like <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/ED\" title=\"ED\">ED</a> and 4chan to know the following: <b>I will continue to Shove The True Facts From My Heart and Soul Down Your Throats, only until you take this WHOLE PAGE Down For Good.</b>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:11px; padding:0 0 0 16px; vertical-align:bottom; width:20px\">”\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>From this, it can be reasonably assumed that Chris discovered 4chan and ED around the same time, and that he considered them to be essentially one and the same. Chris would continue his Sisyphean edit war against ED well into 2008, but ultimately, all he succeeded in doing was alienating <a href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Schroeder\" title=\"Megan Schroeder\">Megan Schroeder</a>.\n</p><p>By <a href=\"/cwcki/2008#August\" title=\"2008\">August 2008</a>, Chris was finishing <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_7\" title=\"Sonichu 7\"><i>Sonichu</i> #7</a>, and he apparently felt the need to address these recent developments in the pages of his comic. Issue #7 opened with Megan as a supporting character in the story, but with the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Emails,_2008#Megan_asks_Chris_to_leave_her_alone_again.2C_attempts_to_talk_sense_into_him\" title=\"Megan Emails, 2008\">real Megan wanting nothing more to do with Chris</a>, he decided to write her out of the story. As for ED and 4chan, Chris would lump these two concepts together and dub them \"4-cent_garbage_Magazine.com.\" The name is a slight mystery, because underscores (_) are not permitted in Internet domain names.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Introduction:_Sonichu_.237\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Introduction:_Sonichu_#7\">Introduction: <i>Sonichu</i> #7</span></h2>\n<p><i>Sonichu</i> #7 was the first issue of the series to be influenced by Chris's interactions with online <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">trolls</a>. While Chris didn't finish the comic until 20 August 2008, the events of the issue are all set in 2 November 2007, one day before the ED article was created. Just as past issues of <i>Sonichu</i> were very loosely based on Chris's real life, he must have wanted to acknowledge the conflict with ED/4chan and his estrangement from Megan in #7. But all of that happened <i>after</i> 2 November 2007.  \n</p><p>Chris's solution was the <a href=\"/cwcki/Time_Void\" title=\"Time Void\">Time Void</a>; a poorly-defined realm where Chris's character would be trapped for the next two issues. While stranded in the Time Void, Chris would somehow experience events going on in his real life while the fictional events in the comics unfolded without him. Upon entering the Time Void, Chris found himself assaulted by \"random...new memories...popping in...my head!\" These were memories of things that happened after 2 November 2007, so Chris was essentially using the Time Void to \"remember\" the future. Along with fictional events like the <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_9\" title=\"Sonichu 9\">Battle of CWCville</a>, Chris also experienced \"memories\" of <a href=\"/cwcki/Joshua_Martinez\" title=\"Joshua Martinez\">Joshua Martinez</a> setting him up with \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Lori_Lopez\" title=\"Lori Lopez\">Lori Lopez</a>\", and Megan \"dumping\" him via <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Emails,_2008#Megan_is_scarred_by_ShecameforCWC.JPG\" title=\"Megan Emails, 2008\">e-mail</a>.  \n</p>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">Dumping me?

(Note Chris's inability to differentiate between <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation#Slander\" title=\"wikipedia:Defamation\">slander</a> and <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation#Libel\" title=\"wikipedia:Defamation\">libel</a>, the former of which requires spoken words or real-life gestures, impossible for a website or magazine to do.) Rosechu discovers the site on 3 November 2007, which just happens to be the date that <a href=\"/cwcki/Jason_Kendrick_Howell\" title=\"Jason Kendrick Howell\">Jason Kendrick Howell</a> created the \"Chris-chan\" article on ED. The site's content includes a page that slanders Sonichu, Chris, and her, along with \"lifelike\" drawings of Rosechu with a <a href=\"/cwcki/Pickle\" title=\"Pickle\">pickle</a>. While Sonichu is overcome with the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress\" title=\"Stress\">stress</a> of seeing his mate depicted with a penis, Rosechu decides to fight fire with fire by editing the site, just as Chris had tried in real life. She crawls into her <a href=\"/cwcki/April_16_Fetish_Vids\" title=\"April 16 Fetish Vids\">dirty, mildew-laden bathroom</a> and takes pictures of herself in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Nudes\" title=\"Nudes\">nude</a>, and then uploads them onto the 4-cent website. However 4-cent_garbage simply adds more dickgirl pictures, and she realizes that her plan will never work.  \n</p><p>Instead, she travels with <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(character)\" title=\"Sonichu (character)\">Sonichu</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Wild\" title=\"Wild\">Wild</a> to 4-cent_garbage's headquarters in <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarksville,_Tennessee\" title=\"wikipedia:Clarksville, Tennessee\">Clarksville, Tennessee</a>, to confront the leader of the organization. While Wild sneaks into the building in search of one of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_Balls\" title=\"Sonichu Balls\">Sonichu Balls</a>, Sonichu and Rosechu take the elevator to the top floor, and meet <a href=\"/cwcki/Jason_Kendrick_Howell\" title=\"Jason Kendrick Howell\">Jason Kendrick Howell</a> and his 17-year old \"womanslave\" <a href=\"/cwcki/Kathleen\" title=\"Kathleen\">Kathleen</a>, who had previously cameoed in issue #7. The meeting is civil at first, but when Jason refuses to take down the \"Chris-chan\" page, Sonichu tries to fight him, and loses.

Inside, Jason converts his throne into an escape pod, and flees with Kathleen, leaving the others behind.

The location of the building is probably intended to refer to where the real Jason lives, or at least where Chris <i>thinks</i> he lives.    \n</p><p>The 4-cent_garbage building is 72 stories tall (66+6, as described by <a href=\"/cwcki/Beel\" title=\"Beel\">Beel</a>), and the interior is painted bright red to resemble <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">Hell</a>. On the ground floor, Beel sits at the receptionist desk and directs visitors to an elevator on the far side of the atrium. Employees are seen on several higher floors drinking an alcoholic beverage called \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Reeb\" title=\"Reeb\">Reeb</a>\", and passing out on the floor when their shift is over.

Why Sonichu and Rosechu would stop at so many different floors to look around at whatever's going on is never explained, but they clearly react to whatever is depicted, meaning that they must have pressed all the buttons on the elevator controls for no good reason. \n</p><p>This appears to have been one of Chris's attempts to employ some of his trademark <a href=\"/cwcki/Random-access_humor\" title=\"Random-access humor\">random-access humor</a>, by showing wacky stuff on each floor. Much of the material featured in these pages were images lifted directly from <a href=\"/cwcki/Encyclopedia_Dramatica\" title=\"Encyclopedia Dramatica\">Encyclopedia Dramatica</a>, whether Chris understood their context or not.

When one of them recovers from his hangover and gets up, he relieves the only other conscious employee of his shift and takes over. The relieved guard then drinks a can of \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Alcohol\" title=\"Alcohol\">Reeb</a>\" and passes out on the floor like the others, while Sonichu and Rosechu look on from the elevator and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sigh\" title=\"Sigh\">sigh</a>.</li>\n<li>3rd floor: <a href=\"/cwcki/Pedofork\" title=\"Pedofork\">Pedobear</a> in a bathtub with the Powerpuff Girls.

Rosechu angrily leaves the elevator to punch him in the face, shouting \"I have a vagina, uterus, and ovaries, you freak!!!\"</li>\n<li>8th floor: Sonichu spin dashes a 4-cent_garbage.com employee working on a picture of <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Mary Lee Walsh</a>, nude and leading Sonichu by a leash.</li>\n<li>9th floor: Sonichu and Rosechu electrocute an employee as he works on a picture of Sonichu sucking Rosechu's penis.</li>\n<li>10th floor: Chris emerges from the <a href=\"/cwcki/Time_Void\" title=\"Time Void\">Time Void</a> to attack an employee working on a picture of Chris using the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Oversized_Drinking_Straw_of_Fail\" title=\"Oversized Drinking Straw of Fail\">Oversized Drinking Straw of Fail</a>. Sonichu and Rosechu cheer him on in unison.</li>\n<li>11th floor: Troll parody of artwork by <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://encyclopediadramatica.online/Branca\" rel=\"nofollow\">Branca</a>, a batshit insane fan of the animated band <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorillaz\" title=\"wikipedia:Gorillaz\">Gorillaz</a>. Sonichu considers it to be sad.</li>\n<li>12th floor: Fanart of Knuckles as a gangster, surrounded by sexualized versions of female \"Sonic\" characters. Sonichu <a href=\"/cwcki/Na%C3%AFve\" title=\"Naïve\">naïvely</a> wonders when he became so popular.</li>\n<li>13th floor: Female versions of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonic\" title=\"Sonic\">Sonic</a>, Tails, and Knuckles.

ED has a copy of the image which has been edited with captions to reference the \"Branca\" article on ED.</li>\n<li>22nd floor: <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Yu-Gi-Oh!\" title=\"Yu-Gi-Oh!\">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></i> Rule 34, from the ED article. Sonichu innocently considers it an impressive dark magic attack.</li>\n<li>23rd floor: An anthropomorphized Charmeleon with her arms handcuffed behind her back spreads her asscheeks, as if for sexual activity. More Rule 34 from ED's <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Pok%C3%A9mon\" title=\"Pokémon\">Pokémon</a></i> article. Sonichu ignores the sexualized content, and boasts that he could easily defeat the Charmeleon. Well, duh, it's handcuffed.</li>\n<li>24th floor: Hate art of Snapesnogger's hermaphrodite naga character drawn by Zeriara.</li>\n<li>33rd floor: Rule 34 Art from ED's <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Transformers\" title=\"Transformers\">Transformers</a></i> page.</li>\n<li>34th floor: Sonic/Amy Rose Rule 34. Sonichu cheers on his \"pal\" as they watch him have sex in a position suspiciously similar to the \"missionary cowgirl\" used by Sonichu earlier in the issue.</li>\n<li>35th floor: Nude artwork of Amy Rose, Rouge the Bat, and Cream the Rabbit <a href=\"/cwcki/Pedofork\" title=\"Pedofork\">(who is 6 years old.)</a> Sonichu and Rosechu shout \"Holy Crap!\" in unison.</li>\n<li>36th floor: Strip poker game featuring various female characters from <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog\" title=\"Sonic the Hedgehog\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></i>. The image has been adapted into a parody of a <i>Magic: The Gathering</i> Card.</li>\n<li>51st floor: The entire White House, with John McCain, Sarah Palin, and Hillary Clinton, looking on while <a href=\"/cwcki/Barack_Obama\" title=\"Barack Obama\">Barack Obama</a> paints the walls black. <a href=\"/cwcki/George_W._Bush\" title=\"George W. Bush\">George W. Bush</a> cheerfully knocks his eventual successor off his ladder. Sonichu and Rosechu offer no discernible reaction. Chris notes that his father <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler\" title=\"Bob Chandler\">Bob Chandler</a> came up with this \"joke.\" Recall that this story is set in the fall of <i><a href=\"/cwcki/2007\" title=\"2007\">2007</a></i>, so the joke really makes no sense for that year.</li>\n<li>61st floor: Erotic artwork of Dot Warner, from <i>Animaniacs</i>. <b>NOTE:</b> In the cartoon <i>Animaniacs</i> the character Dot Warner is 9 years old.</li>\n<li>62nd floor: Erotic artwork of Lois Griffin, from <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Family_Guy\" title=\"Family Guy\">Family Guy</a></i>.</li>\n<li>63rd floor: Erotic artwork of Marge Simpson, from <i><a href=\"/cwcki/The_Simpsons\" title=\"The Simpsons\">The Simpsons</a></i>.</li>\n<li>64th floor: Rule 34 of Misty and a Starmie, from <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Pok%C3%A9mon\" title=\"Pokémon\">Pokémon</a></i>. Sonichu and Rosechu make out during this and the preceding three floors.</li>\n<li>69th floor: Image of \"XBOX 360-ko\", an anime-style character patterned after design elements of the Xbox 360. As the following floor features an Xbox 360 console being destroyed, Chris includes a disclaimer, stating that his hatred of the <a href=\"/cwcki/HEXBox\" title=\"HEXBox\">HEXBox</a> should not be connected to any lingering resentment of women. This was later changed to a ramble about the purpose of the building and about the trolls in general.</li>\n<li>70th floor: Drawing by Chris of an Xbox 360 console being chopped in half with a meat cleaver. Sonichu and Rosechu applaud the instrument's destruction. The imagery is a clear indication that Chris secretly desires to murder women. This was later changed to a drawing of a sad troll admitting that Chris is right about the previous floor.</li>\n<li>71st floor: <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PS3\" title=\"PS3\">PS3</a> message congratulating whoever murdered the HEXBox. It states that you may \"now play your PlayStation 3 or Nintendo Wii in peace\", as though the existence of a single Xbox somehow interfered with such activity. This was later changed to an achievement for exposing all the trolls.</li></ul>\n<p>Note that it is never addressed whether or not the images such as the Rule 34 depicted here are really just drawings on a computer or poster in the building, or if they have a physical presence. However, the fact that Sonichu cheers on Sonic as he has sex with Amy Rose suggests that they are really there.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Business_and_Staff\">Business and Staff</span></h3>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">I am a troll with no such beliefs, I know that we are born, then we die.

While this may seem like an oversight on Chris's part, it may well be a genuine commentary on the pointlessness of 4chan and ED's activities. While most people would consider them to be entertainment sites, with no other purpose than to provide humor or diversion, Chris obviously doesn't find them funny, and so he depicted 4-cent_garbage as a tower of bullies, mass-producing cruelty for its own sake. In the comic, Jason says his only goal in life is to hurt as many people as he can before he dies. While he may have only been speaking for himself, this seems to be the <i>raison d'être</i> for everyone else who works there.\n</p><p>In <i>Sonichu</i> #10, Beel explains that \"this trolling gig is my hell\", suggesting that he has been condemned to work there, possibly because he had once been \"main assistant to <a href=\"/cwcki/Nazis\" title=\"Nazis\">Adolf Hitler</a>\". Unable to die, Beel would simply be damned to serve yet another villain, <a href=\"/cwcki/Count_Graduon\" title=\"Count Graduon\">Count Graduon</a>, once the 4-cent_garbage building was destroyed.  \n</p><p>While <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">Clyde Cash</a> had been previously depicted in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_Special_1\" title=\"Sonichu Special 1\"><i>Sonichu Special</i> #1</a> as an agent of <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Mary Lee Walsh</a>, he also appears in <i>Sonichu</i> #10 supporting 4-cent_garbage. Though confusing in some respects, especially concerning the canonicity of the Sonichu Specials, this dual role may not be a complete contradiction, as the exact relationship between 4-cent_garbage and <a href=\"/cwcki/PVCC\" title=\"PVCC\">PVCC</a> is never explained.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://archive.sonichu.com/cwcipedia/index.php?title=Issue_8/Page_30\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://archive.sonichu.com/cwcipedia/index.php?title=Issue_8/Page_30</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://archive.sonichu.com/cwcipedia/index.php?title=Issue_8/Page_31\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://archive.sonichu.com/cwcipedia/index.php?title=Issue_8/Page_31</a></span>\n</li>\n</ol></div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:A_concert_that_brings_the_house_down-min.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"414\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/9/95/A_concert_that_brings_the_house_down-min.jpg/300px-A_concert_that_brings_the_house_down-min.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/9/95/A_concert_that_brings_the_house_down-min.jpg/450px-A_concert_that_brings_the_house_down-min.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/9/95/A_concert_that_brings_the_house_down-min.jpg/600px-A_concert_that_brings_the_house_down-min.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:A_concert_that_brings_the_house_down-min.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>The episode depicted in a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/TSSSF\" title=\"TSSSF\">TSSSF</a> card</div></div></div>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/cwcki/4chan_posts_(Bella)\" title=\"4chan posts (Bella)\">4chan posts (Bella)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_7\" title=\"Sonichu 7\"><i>Sonichu</i> #7</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_8\" title=\"Sonichu 8\"><i>Sonichu</i> #8</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_10\" title=\"Sonichu 10\"><i>Sonichu</i> #10</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Jason_Kendrick_Howell\" title=\"Jason Kendrick Howell\">Jason Kendrick Howell</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Kathleen\" title=\"Kathleen\">Kathleen</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Beel\" title=\"Beel\">Beel</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">Clyde Cash</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Jack_Thaddeus\" title=\"Jack Thaddeus\">Jack Thaddeus</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/The_Incredible_Lioness\" title=\"The Incredible Lioness\">The Incredible Lioness</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Revive_Zordon\" title=\"Revive Zordon\">Revive Zordon</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Twin_Falling_Towers\" title=\"Twin Falling Towers\">Twin Falling Towers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_death\" title=\"Chris and death\">Chris and death</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Jail_Letter_-_21_October_2021\" title=\"Jail Letter - 21 October 2021\">Jail Letter - 21 October 2021</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.4chan.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">4chan</a> - A *chan imageboard and inspiration behind 4-cent_garbage's name.</li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://encyclopediadramatica.online/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Encyclopedia Dramatica</a> - An internet satire wiki and inspiration behind 4-cent_garbage's role in the comics.
