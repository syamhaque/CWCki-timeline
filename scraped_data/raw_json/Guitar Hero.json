While <i>DDR</i> and many <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Wii_Remote_of_Fail\" title=\"Wii Remote of Fail\">Wii</a> games involve actual movement, sometimes to the point of players breaking a sweat, <i>Guitar Hero</i> remains the only game which Chris has mentioned using for exercise, even though <i>DDR</i> has an exercise mode and the Wii has numerous actual exercise titles. Specifically, Chris has stated several times that <i>Guitar Hero</i> is good for his health, because he has to stand up to play it, \"and move a bit for fun and movement.\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup> Chris's reasoning either comes from his autistic mind believing that any muscle movement at all is exercise, or him being so <a href=\"/cwcki/Obesity\" title=\"Obesity\">fat</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_health\" title=\"Chris and health\">lazy</a> that standing up actually takes effort. Because standing still and pressing buttons on a plastic guitar is far less strenuous than moving your feet on a dance pad, Chris has favored <i>Guitar Hero</i> more, and has made references to it several times throughout his many works.\n</p><p>Data from his <a href=\"/cwcki/PlayStation_Network\" title=\"PlayStation Network\">PlayStation Network</a> account reveals that Chris spent nearly <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_money\" title=\"Chris and money\">$500</a> downloading new songs to play in various <i>Guitar Hero</i> games. By comparison, he spent a little more than $50 on downloads for its closest rival in the music game market, <i>Rock Band</i>.\n</p><p>Chris has appeared to show some decent skill level in <i>Guitar Hero</i> games. Even when <a href=\"/cwcki/Asperchu\" title=\"Asperchu\">rivals</a> poke fun at conspiracies behind mysterious orange notes (if you catch their drift), Chris has been able to survive songs on hard difficulty, as shown in some of his videos. Sneakily enough, he just says the expert difficulty \"is good\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup> – we have never known if he <i>routinely</i> plays on expert or not.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Delusion\">Delusion</span></h2>\n<p>Actual guitarists have said that <i>Guitar Hero</i> doesn't help you learn to play guitar, and have themselves struggled playing the game--they said they needed to first forget everything about how to play guitar. Even those who enjoy the game are aware that mashing buttons on a plastic guitar neither looks or functions like a real guitar fretboard. The controller has little in common with instruments that actually <i>do</i> feature buttons, such as the keyboard or trumpet. There's also no consistency between the ingame buttons and the actual notes being played. \n</p><p>Chris, however, seems to believe that playing <i>Guitar Hero</i> is a feat on par with playing a genuine guitar. For example, in <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_10\" title=\"Sonichu 10\"><i>Sonichu</i> #10</a>, Chris takes his PS3 and Gitar of Fail with him on his band tour. During <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_8\" title=\"Sonichu 8\"><i>Sonichu</i> #8</a>, he also explains that <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Blanca\" title=\"Blanca\">Blanca</a> plays the <i>Guitar Hero</i> for <a href=\"/cwcki/Jiggliami\" title=\"Jiggliami\">Jiggliami</a>'s band, which implies that the band only performs covers of songs from the games. In the <i>SingStar</i> Challenge, Chris specifically forbade the use of real instruments as well as <i>Guitar Hero</i> guitars. In what may be the most mind-blowing example yet, Chris dismissed a real, actual, non-video-game-controller guitar as a \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Katie_Bay_E-mails_3#31_July\" title=\"Katie Bay E-mails 3\">Wooden Nickel</a>\".\n</p><p>Because Chris thinks he's talented in every respect, he also loves to pretend he's a musical <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Geinus\" title=\"Geinus\">geinus</a>, evident with his virtual band <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_and_the_Hedgehog_Boys\" title=\"Christian and the Hedgehog Boys\">Christian and the Hedgehog Boys</a> wherein he tunelessly wails over low-quality recordings of popular pop songs. However, because he doesn't know how to play an instrument, he feels the need to justify himself by claiming <i>Guitar Hero</i> gives him musical ability. We can only wonder what <i>exactly</i> was going through his head when he shredded with mad apathy in the notorious \"<a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_Music_Video_Holding_Out_For_a_Hero\" title=\"CWC Music Video Holding Out For a Hero\">Holding Out for a Hero</a>\" music video (the song itself has no guitars), and wonder whether he can tell his \"guitar\" doesn't make any sounds besides plastic clacking in his cover of \"<a href=\"/cwcki/100_2266\" title=\"100 2266\">Don't Laugh at Me</a>\".\n</p><p>The <i>Guitar Hero</i> games, later entries in particular, base themselves around the idea that rock music can do anything, as seen in classic rock videos and album covers. Chris has seemingly taken inspiration from this for his comics, such as <i>Sonichu</i> #10, where he uses the Power of Rock to demolish the <a href=\"/cwcki/4-cent_garbage.com\" title=\"4-cent garbage.com\">4-cent_garbage.com</a> building.\n</p><p>Chris has also developed a <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">completely groundless belief</a> that standing on one leg and moving a little while playing <i>Guitar Hero</i> amounts to <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_health\" title=\"Chris and health\">tremendous physical exercise</a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"GameStop_Be_A_Star_Sweepstakes\">GameStop Be A Star Sweepstakes</span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:CWCGUITARHERO.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"225\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/0/0e/CWCGUITARHERO.jpg/300px-CWCGUITARHERO.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/0/0e/CWCGUITARHERO.jpg/450px-CWCGUITARHERO.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/0/0e/CWCGUITARHERO.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:CWCGUITARHERO.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>This image was apparently worth $400.</div></div></div>\n<p>The <i>GameStop \"Be a Star\" Sweepstakes</i> was a competition run by the video game retailer <a href=\"/cwcki/GameStop\" title=\"GameStop\">GameStop</a> to promote <i>Guitar Hero: World Tour</i>, which Chris entered around October <a href=\"/cwcki/2008\" title=\"2008\">2008</a>. The competition required the entrants to send in a photograph of themselves in a \"guitar hero pose\", and people would vote in a poll to determine the best one, with the winner receiving a $400 GameStop gift certificate. \n</p><p>Rumors also circulated that the winner would star in the game. Several <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">trolls</a> caught sight of Chris's entry and encouraged people to vote for him by posting on <a href=\"/cwcki/4-cent_garbage.com\" title=\"4-cent garbage.com\">/b/</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Encyclopedia_Dramatica\" title=\"Encyclopedia Dramatica\">ED</a>, in hopes that gamers everywhere would help permanently mar Guitar Hero's legacy with Chris's fat autistic presence. These rumors however, proved to be incorrect.\n</p><p>Despite some disputes between trolls as well as some warnings to GameStop's management about what was transpiring, Chris went on to win the competition.\n</p><p>In his <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_Update_28_December_2008\" title=\"CWC Update 28 December 2008\">28 December 2008 update</a> he thanked his fans for voting for him, and announced that the $400 gift card would be shared with the congregation of his church. Chris ended up spending a little less than half on his congregation, buying them a copy of <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Animal_Crossing\" title=\"Animal Crossing\">Animal Crossing</a> City Folk</i> ($50), plus two copies of <i>Wii Music</i> ($100) with a Wii Speak accessory ($30) for a grand total of $180. The remaining $220 went to himself.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Although his victory is largely considered a major failure in trolling efforts, it did have the unintended side effect of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_Ego\" title=\"Chris and his Ego\">reaffirming</a> Chris's <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">belief</a> that he has a huge thriving <a href=\"/cwcki/True_and_Loyal_Fanbase\" title=\"True and Loyal Fanbase\">True and Loyal Fanbase</a>. This made trolling somewhat easier, as Chris was even more inclined to open up to his supposed legions of fans. Some trolls have used his victory in the contest as leverage to guilt him into doing things like giving interviews or drawing more <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Comic\" title=\"Comic\">comics</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sonichu_and_Chris-chan_in_Guitar_Hero_World_Tour\">Sonichu and Chris-chan in <i>Guitar Hero World Tour</i></span></h2>\n<p>On 27 October <a href=\"/cwcki/2008\" title=\"2008\">2008</a>, Chris uploaded <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_%26_Chris_Chan_in_Guitar_Hero_World_Tour\" title=\"Sonichu &amp; Chris Chan in Guitar Hero World Tour\">a video</a> showing off the custom <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a></i> crap that he added to the game. As in his <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\">comics</a>, he portrays himself as thin and fit. While this is partly because that game doesn't have an \"unpleasant, fat\" character model, it would still be possible for Chris to give his in-game self some degree of huskiness if he had any sense of his personal appearance.\n</p><p><br/>\n</p>\n<center>\n<div style=\"clear:none; max-width:50em;\"><div style=\"margin: 0 10%;\">\n<table style=\"border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"overflow:hidden; margin: 0 0 1em 0; color:silver; font-size:1.7em; font-family:serif; font-weight:bold; text-align:left;\" valign=\"top\"><span style=\"line-height:0.4em;\"> </span><br/>“\n</td>\n<td style=\"overflow:hidden; padding:0 1em; text-align:left; font-size:1.15em;\" valign=\"middle\"> <br/><i>I've created the Sonichu Band Icon from scratch, as well as my Character and Guitar.
