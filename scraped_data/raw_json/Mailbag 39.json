He got halfway through before quitting in order to <a href=\"/cwcki/12_January_2010#Part_2\" title=\"12 January 2010\">scream into his camera</a> and (presumably) crash into slumber. He answered the rest on the 15th.\n</p><p>Chris's habit of deleting emails without saving backups hit a fever pitch in this one.\n</p><p>It should be noted that Chris replied to a question about whether he would have sex with a <a href=\"/cwcki/Mia_Hamm\" title=\"Mia Hamm\">prostitute</a> with \"no comment.\" In one of the previous Mailbags, Chris stated that he wanted his first time to be True and Honest. It's odd that he didn't have a similar answer this time. This might have been the early signs of Chris eventually becoming desperate enough to lose his virginity to a whore.\n</p><p>Chris also seemed desperate to erase from reality the Family Guy storyline in which Meg gets a sex change.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\"

it. The other day we had a kid sent to time out because she called stupid. When asked why she said that, she said that <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_religion\" title=\"Chris and religion\">god</a> told Chris and <a href=\"/cwcki/Ivy\" title=\"Ivy\">Ivy</a> that they were destined to be together, but then never met up in the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Comic\" title=\"Comic\">comic</a>, and then she died (in a very gross manner). then she said that God spent so much energy on that and not on turning <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Silvana\" title=\"Silvana\">Silvana</a> to normal, which would've turned her good and probably spare a few lives. She then asked why God did that? \n</p><p>She has a good point, Mr. Chandler. Why do you have God do such stupid things? And why did you have god bind the two together if Chris would later mary some woman named <a href=\"/cwcki/Lovely_Weather\" title=\"Lovely Weather\">Lovely Weather</a> and then cheat on her with Meg? And then, as a Christian man you shot a person and killed thousands by making a building crumble. \n</p><p>Tomorrow we are having a vote in the next few days on what to do: A. We stay with your comic B. We abandon the fan club C. We begin following <a href=\"/cwcki/Asperchu\" title=\"Asperchu\">Asperchu</a>. \n</p><p>Some of us think he's original, some of us believe that he is a <a href=\"/cwcki/Parody\" title=\"Parody\">parody</a>, but we all agree his comic is well written and focused more on a kind and Christian character. \n</p><p>Do you have anything to say before we vote (my recommendation is you ignore Asperchu and focus on why you seem to make a mockery of god) \n</p><p>Yours in God \n</p><p>Nick\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Firstly, that me and Ivy thing, it was REAL for a time, but THEN SHE DID DIE FOR REAL.

I am an <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/English\" title=\"English\">English</a> teacher at a small junior high school in Middle Tennessee, and I sponsor the school's chapter of the Gay/Straight Alliance. Over the winter break, I had a student make mention of your comic in an email as a topic for future discussion once class resumes. Upon review of your comic, I have found it to be most worthy of discussion. Your portrayal of transsexuals and hermaphrodites is very interesting. The character <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu\" title=\"Rosechu\">Rosechu</a>, for instance, fascinates me. Despite the labeling of being a female Raichu, I have gleamed from my research that she was actually a male Raichu, based on the pointedness of her tail. Then s/he was struck by a rainbow, transforming him/her into a lovely feminine being. This metaphor delights me! It is a very sensitive and positive portrayal of the struggle that transpeople endure when trying to determine and claim their identity. It is wonderful that you have allowed this character to find love and acceptance with a man, which is so often difficult in the real world. I have students who know the pain of being born into the body, and I am sure this will hearten them greatly. In addition, the character <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Magi-chan\" title=\"Magi-chan\">Magi-chan</a> warms my heart in his obvious attraction to the character Silvana, even though she possessed the \"wrong\" genitalia at the time. The fact that he could see past the outer shell and to the person within is very sweet.\n</p><p>I must say though, that I object to Rosechu's characterization. She is a very stereotypical portrait of a transwoman, obsessed with maintaining her femininity to the point of ridiculousness. It is a tired cliche and an insult to all woman that their lives revolve around solely around their family and their vanity. In the future, I would like to see Rosechu develop interests outside her home and maxing out her credit card and become a better role model for young people struggling with their identities.\n</p><p>With deepest respect,\n</p><p>Ms. Veronica Henderson\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>LISTEN!!!
