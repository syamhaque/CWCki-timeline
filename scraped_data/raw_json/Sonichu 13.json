It features a story on how one of their fictional troll characters, John Yamada, came to influence Chris, and covers an incoherent series of plot threads involving pieces of lore the Idea Guys had <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Brainwashed\" title=\"Brainwashed\">brainwashed</a> into Chris.\n</p><p>Due to the secretive nature of the saga, the comic pages were initially not uploaded by Chris; however, in-progress photos were leaked by various people whom Idea Guy Joshua Wise had shared them with. After the Idea Guys were ousted, Chris resumed production on the comic in May 2018, when he posted previews for a backup story about the <a href=\"/cwcki/Polyamorous_marriage\" title=\"Polyamorous marriage\">polyamorous marriage</a>, acting against the advice of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Guard_Dogs\" title=\"Guard Dogs\">Guard Dogs</a>, who attempted to distance Chris from the concepts introduced by the Idea Guys. The comic was officially published in Autumn 2018, albeit rough and mostly uncolored, and was directly mailed to his backers to avoid violating <a href=\"/cwcki/Patreon\" title=\"Patreon\">Patreon</a>'s Terms of Service.\n</p><p>This \"comic\" is unusual (even by <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_writing#Exposition\" title=\"Chris and writing\">Chris's standards</a>) in consisting mostly of huge blocks of expository text, with illustrations running in narrow columns – or even relegated to the margins – on most pages. Indeed, the approach more closely resembles a <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/light_novel\" title=\"wikipedia:light novel\">light novel</a> than a traditional webcomic; it also bears an odd (likely coincidental) resemblance to the notorious and short-lived Marvel comic <i><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marville_(comic)\" title=\"wikipedia:Marville (comic)\">Marville</a></i>, which took the form of a printed comic script accompanied by occasional illustrations. The writing-heavy style does not go well with the rough <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC-isms#H\" title=\"CWC-isms\">hand-drawn</a> lettering, or Chris's usual difficulties with run-on sentences and paragraphs, making the issue rather irritating to read through. This would mark a lasting shift in the <i>Sonichu</i> series; <i>Sonichu #14</i> would similarly be dominated by walls of text, with occasional imagery.\n</p><p>Despite being aware that the Idea Guys turned out to be trolls, Chris still believes the abnormally bizarre events depicted in this comic are canon and happened, evidenced when he wrote the epilogue, <i>The Awakening of a CPU</i>, several months later, and when Chris's <a href=\"/cwcki/Magi-Chan\" title=\"Magi-Chan\">Magi-Chan</a> sockpuppet on Twitter referred to the events as 'true fact',<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup> and gave the book a proper number after being ripped out of the <i>Sonichu</i> series in <a href=\"/cwcki/April_2019\" title=\"April 2019\">April 2019</a> as the Idea Guy corruptions that they were.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Plot\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Plot</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#CPU_come_to_Cwcville\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">CPU come to Cwcville</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#CWCville_vs_Russia\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">CWCville vs Russia</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Changes_at_Home\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Changes at Home</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#CWCville_vs_Australatina\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">CWCville vs Australatina</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#CWCville_vs_Nazis\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">CWCville vs Nazis</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Tearing_down_the_Rosechu_Rape_Camps\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Tearing down the Rosechu Rape Camps</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Coming_out_as_Bisexual\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Coming out as Bisexual</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#Chris_and_Sonichu_rape_each_other\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris and Sonichu rape each other</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Final_Notes\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.9</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Final Notes</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#Our_Wedding_special\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Our Wedding special</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#Still_canon\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Still canon</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-13\"><a href=\"#Epilogue\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Epilogue</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-14\"><a href=\"#Transcript\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Transcript</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-15\"><a href=\"#Analysis\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Analysis</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-16\"><a href=\"#Comic_pages\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Comic pages</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-17\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Plot\">Plot</span></h2>\n<table style=\"background:#FFF; border:1px solid #DEA743; border-top:8px solid #DEA743; color:#000; width:100%; max-width:618px; margin:0 auto 16px;\">\n<tbody><tr style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<td style=\"padding:5px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Protip.jpg\"><img alt=\"Protip.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"90\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/6/6a/Protip.jpg/90px-Protip.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/6/6a/Protip.jpg/135px-Protip.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/6/6a/Protip.jpg 2x\" width=\"90\"/></a>\n</td>\n<td style=\"padding:0 5px 0 1px; width:100%;\"><div style=\"font-size:1.25em; margin:0\"><b>PROTIP:</b></div>\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:0\"><b>The following is an incoherent mess that has little to no continuity with the previous comics, due to it consisting of troll concepts Idea Guy had planted into the comic.

Regardless she is doing well as a CPU goddess on the island of Krasna. \n</p><p>The Sailor Senshi and Twilight Sparkle aid Chris is learning how to use his powers.\nAkan had annexed the High School in which the Sailor Scouts studied and it is now a training ground for his troops. \n</p><p>John and Chris travel back in time to meet past-Chris and smack him with a baseball bat to prevent the abolishment of <a href=\"/cwcki/Women%27s_rights\" title=\"Women's rights\">women's rights</a> and because Present Chris was disgusted with him. This gives Sonichu amnesia.\n</p><p>Chris backtracks to tell us that whilst developing his powers, he and his new friends were on the hunt for E115 material, said to be very rare and powerful (Presumably this is element 115, <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moscovium\" title=\"wikipedia:moscovium\">moscovium</a>, which features in several science fiction stories). The American Sailor Scouts from the infamous <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor_Moon_(1994_TV_pilot)\" title=\"wikipedia:Sailor Moon (1994 TV pilot)\">Saban Moon</a> (which failed to even launch) had knowledge of where to get it as they were apparently all female soldiers (at fifteen years old...) who had been exposed to it, and its exposure is how Chris explains how Saban Mercury was paraplegic (<i>note that Saban Mercury intended to be representation to disabled preteen girls, showing they could be heroes too, opposed to Chris' twisted version.)</i>  Most of the Saban scouts wound up passing away due to the exposure, including Mercury, who Chris claims to have personally met, and discloses that her name was Hilda. Hilda, rather than passing away, chose to commit suicide. Before passing, the Saban Scouts all praise Chris and pass on their powers to him. \n</p><p>Whilst attempting to clone Chris so he could dump the responsibility of caring for Barb on it, Chris' Pony OC <a href=\"/cwcki/Night_Star\" title=\"Night Star\">Night Star</a> took a sample of DNA from Chris that had been laying around since the year 2000, leaving a horrifying question as to just how unwashed his home is. She accidentally clones multiple sexually aggressive Chris-chans to the point where the Ponys must evacuate to Cwcville for their own safety. \n</p><p>John meanwhile has gathered enough E115 to fashion three brand new <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_medallions\" title=\"Sonichu medallions\">Sonichu medallions</a> that allow Chris to become Chris-Chan Sonichu. Chris time travels to the year <a href=\"/cwcki/2000\" title=\"2000\">2000</a> to find he has been possessed by <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Satan\" title=\"Satan\">Satan</a> and become a Nazi and has kept <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Hitler\" title=\"Hitler\">Hitler</a> alive using his own Sonichu medallion. Horrified at the monster he is in this timeline, Chris kills his Nazi alter-ego, and claims the Medallion, turning Hitler into dust.\n</p><p>Going back in time again. John finds Chris has been taken to \"Islam\" to have the lustful urges exorcised and such was done by shoving the medallion into his anus.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Changes_at_Home\">Changes at Home</span></h3>\n<p>Whilst attempting to return that medallion to Chris, it is intercepted and obtained by North Koreans.\nChris discovers terrible things about Cwcville, including him and his Father being real <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(species)\" title=\"Sonichu (species)\">Sonichu</a> born from eggs and the <a href=\"/cwcki/Anchuent_Prophecy\" title=\"Anchuent Prophecy\">Anchuent Prophecy</a> being real. \nChris laments that while Cwcville is currently predominantly Christian, it used to be mostly Athiest or Satanic.\nAngelica turned away from Christianity and became a Muslim, then converted once more into a Satanist.\nBlake idolized Osama Bin Laden and became an extremist implied to have ties to ISIS.\nWild became a drug peddler who grew weed (which Chris is okay with) and produced Meth in his lab (which Chris is not okay with).\n<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bubbles\" title=\"Bubbles\">Bubbles</a> decided she identified as a muscle-bound black man, which Chris seems to equate to being a \"Knuckle-Head\" and drew her with the body of Knuckles as depicted in his loathed Sonic Boom series.\n<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Punchy\" title=\"Punchy\">Punchy</a>, instead of a dojo, hatched in an insane asylum and was detained in a straight jacket, developing an irrational hatred of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Obesity\" title=\"Obesity\">obese.</a> \nChris tells us he is ashamed of his Chaotic Combo.\n</p><p>On 5 December 2017, Rosechu informs Chris she had been born as a male Pichu and had retained her penis and testes post-transformation until she received surgery in Cwcville .\nChris is devastated as he had created Rosechu and <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu_(species)\" title=\"Rosechu (species)\">her species</a> to be female-only Pokémon and listened to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Britney\" title=\"Britney\">Britney</a>'s \"I'm Not a Girl\" on repeat as he drew and colored the page. Nevertheless, he stands by her as a transwoman.\nHe goes on to inform us that Sonichu and Rosechu shared their first kiss, not under fireworks, but in sewage and in the process of sharing the virginity, role-played as ice hockey players.\n</p><p>Chris tells us that after he vented about Rosechu being a transwoman on <a href=\"/cwcki/Facebook\" title=\"Facebook\">Facebook</a>, it had upset Rosechu and Uzumi angrily confronted Chris about shaming her.\n</p><p>Chris goes on to create <a href=\"/cwcki/Battery-Charge_Heart\" title=\"Battery-Charge Heart\">Battery-Charge Heart</a>/Miss Anirbas Saffron Chandler who represented the Smach Z handheld console. Due to Chris' misunderstanding of when the Smach Z was released, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Blanc\" title=\"Blanc\">Blanc</a> and <a class=\"new\" href=\"/w/index.php?title=Noire&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" title=\"Noire (page does not exist)\">Noire</a> turn their backs on him.\n</p><p>To restore Silvana by rewriting her story and failing, Chris concludes that only Monika can bring her back.\n</p><p>In the meantime, Chris is distressed by John's massive libido and his being married to five wives and impregnating a lesbian couple, and admits in his frustrations he lashed out at people more than once, and that he is not fond of sex at the given moment. \n</p><p>Whilst role-playing a date with Blanc, instead of discussing how the date was, Chris being Chris immediately jumps into how he'd fuck her, and Blanc is not amused. She gives him another chance and they discuss authors and politics.\nShe asks him why he is so against <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Trump\" title=\"Trump\">Trump</a>, why he favored Hillary and why he is currently not working, similarly to the <a href=\"/cwcki/Father_Call\" title=\"Father Call\">Father Call</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"CWCville_vs_Australatina\">CWCville vs Australatina</span></h3>\n<p>Meanwhile, a CWC Defense Soldier shits on the border between Cwcville and <a href=\"/cwcki/Australatina\" title=\"Australatina\">Australatina</a> and is killed in retaliation.

Chris doesn't believe it, despite overwhelming evidence. He is found not guilty and the citizens, outraged by this miscarriage of justice, start to riot. \n</p><p>Australatina is beating the everloving piss out of Cwcville and their Russian allies (weren't they the enemy?) and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Simonla\" title=\"Simonla\">Simonla</a> &amp; <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Wild\" title=\"Wild\">Wild</a>'s home is destroyed. All of the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Autobots\" title=\"Autobots\">Autobots</a> are destroyed, including Optimus and Bumblebee - except for the severed head of <a href=\"/cwcki/Son-Chu\" title=\"Son-Chu\">Son-Chu</a>. It's implied that <a href=\"/cwcki/My_Car_is_Heating_Up_Worse;_PLEASE_BUY_from_my_eBay_and_HELP\" title=\"My Car is Heating Up Worse; PLEASE BUY from my eBay and HELP\">the destruction of Chris's IRL car</a> impacted this choice of plot.\n</p><p>Australatina is the victor in the battle, and the swastika on the page implies they enforce a Nazi regime (contrary to their real-life <a href=\"/cwcki/Jack_Thaddeus\" title=\"Jack Thaddeus\">equivalent</a>). Chris grabs all of his level 100 Pokémon from his various Pokémon games to try and counter them. He refrains from using the Electric Hedgehogs because the Nazis will kill them. He also attempts to create a portal to reach his <a href=\"/cwcki/Skylanders\" title=\"Skylanders\">Skylanders</a> for aid. It is noted that the Nazis shoot to kill Skylanders, but Inuyasha (his <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaziken\" title=\"wikipedia:Blaziken\">Blaziken</a>) and Arial (his <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popplio,_Brionne,_and_Primarina\" title=\"wikipedia:Popplio, Brionne, and Primarina\">Primarina</a>) have escaped. It's noted that all wild Pokemon in the area have been gunned down. \n</p><p>Though Silvana has been \"deleted\", <a href=\"/cwcki/Magi-Chan\" title=\"Magi-Chan\">Magi-Chan</a> sheds hardly a tear for his beloved and decides to get his bone on with his father figure, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Mewtwo\" title=\"Mewtwo\">Mewtwo</a> and marries him. \n</p><p>Battery-Charge Heart, instead of defending against Australatina, goes impulse shopping and <a href=\"/cwcki/Love_Quest\" title=\"Love Quest\">boyfriend hunting</a>. Chris is upset considering she was designed to be bright, loyal and <a href=\"/cwcki/Honor_roll\" title=\"Honor roll\">intelligent.</a>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"CWCville_vs_Nazis\">CWCville vs Nazis</span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:252px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Hitlerchu.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"288\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/e/e0/Hitlerchu.jpg/250px-Hitlerchu.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/e/e0/Hitlerchu.jpg 1.5x\" width=\"250\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Hitlerchu.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Adolf Hitlerchu.</div></div></div>\n<p>The Nazis abduct the <a href=\"/cwcki/The_69_Destined_Sonichus_and_Rosechus\" title=\"The 69 Destined Sonichus and Rosechus\">71 special Sonichus and Rosechus</a> and the CPUs try to bargain for their release. Simonla is freed but has come down with a terrible syndrome. The Nazis attempt to immolate her, but Chris throws himself in front of their flamethrowers, using his powers to withstand the heat. \n</p><p>Chris admits that in the past (referring to his past self as though he were a separate character) he was a sex-obsessed lunatic and his lustful sins were bringing Cwcville down. It's implied his sins are contagious and are infecting the survivors of Cwcville including the Sonichus and Rosechus. \nMagi-Chan confirms that Akan has been passing himself off as God and Jesus to mess with people.\n</p><p>In <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">\"Sound Mind\"</a> he proclaims he no longer believes in God and Jesus in favor of the \"Console Patron\" - essentially saying that he will live and die by a subpar Japanese game/anime franchise.\n</p><p>John has been funding Cwcville through heists in the video game Payday 2, by way of Magi-Chan converting his winnings into real money.\n</p><p>In Equestria, the sexually aggressive Chris Clones have mutated to become slimy and bulbous and chant \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Julay\" title=\"Julay\">JULAAAAAY</a>\". John, Megan, and Neptune lure them away from Equestria and destroy them with napalm and the ponies return to their homes. \n</p><p>The CPUs beat the Nazis out of Cwcville as the war officially comes to an end on the 21st. \n</p><p>However, the Sonichus and Rosechus are still in enemy custody. \nChris reveals that when an <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Electric_Hedgehog\" title=\"Electric Hedgehog\">Electric Hedgehog</a> dies, they do not pass into an afterlife, instead, their soul slips into an egg that appears where they had initially hatched, and upon hatching, are born with the same personality and memories of their previous selves - like the Chao in <i><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonic\" title=\"Sonic\">Sonic Adventure 2</a></i>. \nThis means the Electric Hedgehog Pokémon are immortal and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Death\" title=\"Death\">death</a> is, at worst, an inconvenience. \n<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Silvana\" title=\"Silvana\">Silvana</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler\" title=\"Bob Chandler\">Bob Chandler</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Simonla\" title=\"Simonla\">Simonla</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Zapina\" title=\"Zapina\">Zapina</a> rehatch and assert their intention to find their families and continue their fight. \n</p><p>As a favor to Blanc, Chris reads \"The Man in the High Castle\" by Phillip K Dick.\n</p><p>John and his friends are ambushed by the Nazis. They survive, but Chris is pissed off. Doktor Herr Wilhelm Strasse interrupts a conversation Chris is having with the CPU Vert to mess with him, Chris again is pissed off and swears he will kill every living Nazi. He notes that Monika is also working with Nazis. \nChris announces that he can be in multiple places at once, and every time a Nazi misgenders him in German, Chris sprays them with his blood which apparently melts them.\n</p><p>The Nazis occupy Equestria and the Mirror pools lose their ability to clone. \n</p><p>Chris pens a handwritten letter to Discord to appeal for aid, and is told \"No\". Chris shows up to bully him into helping them and is still met with refusal until he decides to turn Discord into stone until he complies by killing every single Nazi with fatal heart attacks and disposing of their corpses before finally destroying the portals they used to enter Equestria.\n</p><p>Remember when Chris sprayed all the transphobic Nazis to melt them with his blood? It didn't actually work, instead it just \"dirtied\" their <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_race\" title=\"Chris and race\">\"pure white\"</a> blood and became sub-human Electric Hedgehog Pokemon so Chris can point and laugh. Ashamed, the Nazis leave Cwcville. \nThey regroup in Germany where it's revealed that all historical Nazis have retroactively become Electric Hedgehog Pokemon too. Regardless, Blanc orders them to disband and they pretty much just do as she says. \n</p><p>Chris informs us about the Pokedex numbers of his breeds of Electric Hedgehogs and tells us regular Sonichu and Rosechu age every two years, whilst those with a connection to Chris (i.e. any of them that have had any kind of role in the comic) age every five years, as do their descendants. \n</p><p>Chris tells us he stopped aging at 21 (as did all of his dimensional counterparts) and repeats what he said before about Sonichu and Rosechu being reborn and retaining their appearances, personalities, and memories. \n</p><p>On 18 January 2018, Night Star cries about how her family are being imprisoned in Equestria, and she had been tortured, her tail removed. Chris reminds her she can open portals and must always stand up for what's right, and heals her. Night Star's tail grows back and she becomes a hideous abomination of hedgehog and horse.\nFast forwarding to 19 November 2019, Night Star opens a portal, and sends Sonichu and John Yamada through to slaughter all of the Nazis; it is not specified whether time travel is involved, as the next scene takes place back in January 2018.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Tearing_down_the_Rosechu_Rape_Camps\">Tearing down the Rosechu Rape Camps</span></h3>\n<p>Meanwhile, on 19 January, in the prison where the Electric Hedgehogs are being detained, it appears the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Rosechus\" title=\"Rosechus\">Rosechus</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Roberta\" title=\"Roberta\">Roberta</a> have been <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Rape\" title=\"Rape\">raped</a> for repopulation. Christine and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Cerah\" title=\"Cerah\">Cerah</a> bide their time, praying to the CPU and reserving their strength whilst Rosechu and Roberta appear heavily pregnant. \nJohn and his crew storm the prison and decapitate the Warden, drawn in gruesome detail. The prison guards are massacred, mostly by Sonichu who angrily states as he slices them to ribbons that this is vengeance for his family, and that Electric Hedgehogs are not inferior beings. \nThe women are released, and in a disturbing vision, the underage Zapina is shown to have been one of the prisoners, and in a small line from Christine Rosechu, it is implied that <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Barb\" title=\"Barb\">Barb</a> was also being held in the rape camp. \nSonichu reunites with his wife and daughters, and the girls refer to Chris as their \"MeMaw\" and thank her for rescuing them even though he was not involved. \nRoberta is implied to have done something wrong as there is talk about her having learned her lesson about Chris - but the text is cut off and we have so little context that we don't know what she did.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:202px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:BobBundySonichu13.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"209\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/4/4e/BobBundySonichu13.jpg/200px-BobBundySonichu13.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/4/4e/BobBundySonichu13.jpg/300px-BobBundySonichu13.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/4/4e/BobBundySonichu13.jpg/400px-BobBundySonichu13.jpg 2x\" width=\"200\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:BobBundySonichu13.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>How Chris saw this scene in his mind.</div></div></div>\n<p>In California, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bob\" title=\"Bob\">Bob</a> shows up and is teleported to Cwcville where he tells everyone about himself. He then shows himself to Sonichu and co. in his check-Sonichu form and everybody in tears talks about how much they missed him.\nIt is explained that both Bob and serial killer <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ted_Bundy\" title=\"Ted Bundy\">Ted Bundy</a> was reborn as Sonichu and Ted defends Cwcville.\n</p><p>Meanwhile, back in West Cwcville, something drastic happened to the now transformed Nazis while Adolf Hitler was making a speech. All but 100 Nazis around the world permanently transform into Electric Hedgehog Pokémon, rendering their genes and ideology moot. Not only that, their war effort was destroyed as they are unable to use their superweapons and produce supersoldiers. With the surviving Nazis being low-rank or not fully trained, the Nazi Reich dies out.\n</p><p>On 22 January, Rosechu lays three eggs. Roberta follows four days later. The eggs would hatch into three male Rosechus and three female Sonichus respectively. They were promptly kept safe, educated, and battle-trained.\n</p><p>Chris then tells of seven statues of himself around Cwcville and one in the center of the city. Whenever these statues appear, they bless, protect, and power up to every Sonichu species around the world (except the now transformed Nazis). Chris then tells the readers he will travel back in time to rewrite history. \n</p><p>The plan succeeds, Cwcville and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Equestria\" title=\"Equestria\">Equestria</a> are now back to normal and the Nazis are banished to another timeline. However, after 30 plus years of scanning <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">Homos</a> and surveying the city like Big Brother, <a href=\"/cwcki/Magi-Chan\" title=\"Magi-Chan\">Magi-Chan</a> suffered a mental breakdown and causing a tear in the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere\" title=\"wikipedia:Noosphere\">noosphere</a>, causing psionic storms to form above Cwcville. It is made worse with Chris's attempt to seal it.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Coming_out_as_Bisexual\">Coming out as Bisexual</span></h3>\n<p>Magi-Chan declares his bisexuality by announcing is marriage to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Silvana_Rosechu\" title=\"Silvana Rosechu\">Silvana Rosechu</a> and Mewtwo. He then states that after the tear is sealed, he will marry Chris.\n</p><p>Fast forward to 19 March, the tear continues to worsen. Chris, blaming himself for causing it, activates every power in his hands and transforms into his \"Super Angelic Mega Evolved Form\". With his Mary Sue powers, he closes the tear like a zipper in four minutes. Exhausted, he softly landed street, telling the Sonichus and Rosechus that <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Random_Access_Humor\" title=\"Random Access Humor\">he is not drowning</a> and needs to rest.\n</p><p>In an especially long text wall, Chris mentioned that due to Magi-Chan's psionic breakdown, he put <a href=\"/cwcki/Lovely_Weather\" title=\"Lovely Weather\">Lovely Weather</a> into a coma. As a result, Magi-Chan was partially lobotomized to add robotic bits to limit his psychic powers. Afterward, they tracked down <a href=\"/cwcki/Doctor_Robotnik\" title=\"Doctor Robotnik\">Dr. Robotnik</a>, who was altering the <a href=\"/cwcki/Anchuent_Prophecy\" title=\"Anchuent Prophecy\">Anchuent Prophecy</a>. Chris and Magi-Chan then travel back in time to stop Robotnik but realized he was not the first vandal. Afterward, they transcribed the original text and destroyed the wall afterward. \n</p><p>Afterward, Chris scolded Magi-Chan in a long, winding rant for endangering their loved ones. Continuing, he blamed Magi-Chan for being the Patient Zero of a Gray Death pandemic, which spread across Cwcville and its surrounding dimensions, killing Larry the Alakazam in the end. Chris then continues how Magi-Chan brought his <a href=\"/cwcki/Heart_level\" title=\"Heart level\">heart level</a> down to zero for putting 5pg into a coma and erasing her memories and destroying the Anchuent Prophecy, which rendered Chris unable to transform for a year and come to Cwcville for two years.\n</p><p>Then, in another text wall, Chris apologizes to Magi-Chan for being a homophobe and forcing him to scan for them, siting he was stupid and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Naive\" title=\"Naive\">naive</a> for believing he was able to take up the task. Then, he proposes to Magi-Chan to marry him and then kiss him. \n</p><p>Posing with <a href=\"/cwcki/Cryzel_Rosechu\" title=\"Cryzel Rosechu\">Cryzel Rosechu</a>, Chris declares his marriage with her and Magi-Chan and as a bisexual transwoman. He then tells a story of how he stopped Sonichu's crusade against the CPUs.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris_and_Sonichu_rape_each_other\">Chris and Sonichu rape each other</span></h3>\n<p>On 24 March, Sonichu is seen shooting up the Cwcville shopping center, declaring his anti-CPU extremism. His rampage was interrupted when Chris arrived. In yet another textwall, Chris stated how CPUs didn't brainwash him as Sonichu believed. Rather, they taught him tolerance and embracing his Sonichu and CPU sides. As a proof, the two linked minds so Sonichu can see for himself. Afterward, Chris apologized to Sonichu for neglecting him and plead to him to end his war against the CPUs.        \n</p><p>Sonichu listens, distressed as Chris explains that the CPUs did not brainwash him, but highlighted all of the problems Cwcville was facing. Chris also admits to the heinous crime of purchasing and playing a <a class=\"new\" href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hexbox_One&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" title=\"Hexbox One (page does not exist)\">Hexbox One</a> with his very own Gamertag and set of achievements. \nHe goes on to explain that unlike the Chris here, he is not a sex-addict and has been embracing his Sonichu half, and wet his bed and slept in the urine for what that pointless anecdote is worth. He urges Sonichu to open his mind and accept things for how they are and fills Sonichu's mind with his own experiences with the CPUs and his relationships with Magi-Chan and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Cryzel\" title=\"Cryzel\">Cryzel</a>.\n</p><p>He asks Sonichu if he understands that the CPUs are not pulling Chris away from him. They are coaching him to become a better person for Sonichu and Cwcville. He implies that Sonichu's random bout of the recent violence is due to his loneliness from Chris's neglect of him in favor of the CPUs and the War. He finishes by imploring him to stop hating the CPU and start loving, referring to him as his son.\nHe pleads with Sonichu to come back to the light, and stop being hateful and violent and finishes declaring his love by pressing a sexual and (by Chris' admission) incestuous kiss on Sonichu.\n</p><p>He promises that he will have sex with Sonichu later, but for now, they have mistakes to undo and makes an attempt to leave, but Sonichu stands his ground and angrily announces that whilst he accepts all that he has just been told, the kiss has given him a hard-on and he wants sex now and in a very out of character demand, orders Chris to come here and \"let him come in.\"\n</p><p>Chris implies that Sonichu has become infected by his own \"past sins of lust\" and tries to talk him down, but Sonichu instead pushes Chris to the ground and forces his penis inside Chris' vagina. The small end in the corner of the panel indicates that this was at one point intended to end with Sonichu successfully raping him. \n</p><p>Chris gains the upper hand with a Double Team to confuse Sonichu and manages to knock him to his knees. Chris takes the opportunity to force his hand inside Sonichu's rectum and clenches around the prostate, forcing Sonichu to ejaculate on the floor. Chris lifts Sonichu (hand still inside him) like a sock puppet, restrains him with electrical chains, and announces that he will be punished.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Final_Notes\">Final Notes</span></h3>\n<p>He explains to the reader that Paxton Fettel (the main villain of the game <i>F.E.A.R.</i>) still saw fit to wage war on Cwcville, so Chris went back in time to prevent Fettel's entry to Cwcville in the first place. The butterfly effect also resulted in the Soviet Union never dissolving. \nTo solve THAT problem, he went back in time again to ensure that the union broke in 1991 to ensure freedom in the USA. All chronological combats that took place afterward did so. A few nations including Yugoslavia also dissolved. \n</p><p>On 26 March 2018, Chris gathered his Sonichus and Rosechus and began a restoration of Cwcville and work towards the betterment of the two species.\n</p><p>A footnote claims Cwcville's Anthem is <a href=\"/cwcki/Slow-in-the-minds\" title=\"Slow-in-the-minds\">\"Think\"</a> by Aretha Franklin.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"

Mrs. Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu/Blue Heart\n</p><p><b>DISCLAIMER:</b> This book, albiet [<i>sic</i>] every single event was true and did happen as such; it IS full of offensive items and situations against my will for the latter.\nSo, if you read through this book, and find yourself offended by one or multiple things in it; You Have Been Warned.\n<b>Read At Your Own Risk</b>\n</p><p>Fast forward to August, 2018...\n</p><p>Sonichu: Whooo! Lots to have experienced, learned, done, did; wow!\n</p><p>Okay, so to resume, or start, rather, the events of November, 2017 to mid-April, 2018; Johnson Wiles, AKA John Yamada, is our sister dimension's counterpart of this world (Earth 1218)'s Idea Guy, AKA Joshua Wise; They were royally messing with me, as well as, literally, screwing up the Earth, Equestria, and even the CPU Goddesses, themselves destructively. Fortunately, my hubby, Magi-Chan Sonichu, informed me of the powers I have in the stone of my class ring ans in myself and my link to the stone from any distance. With Magi-Chan's guidance, I healed and restored CWCville and its word, and I released the CPUs from Wises's control and wretched hold. Apparently Wise has his own link and grasp of out world there. \n</p><p>Not only that, but Wise, and his associate, Stephen Boyd, extorted $6,000 out of me in Steam and Amazon cards and other toys. They WILL pay me back that $6,000, with interest! *Deep breath*\n</p><p>Regardless, the joke is on Wise, because his slanderous, destructive efforts only strengthened my own psychic links with our world, there. And the CPU goddesses and I became allies. And everything that was destined, prophecised [sic] and fated of me, and the link between these earths and dimensions, came full-circle, deja vu, and all that. And we are still continuing on as such. Also, I am awakened, and I am still learning of my powers and everything. And, I connected with my <a href=\"/cwcki/Commodore_64\" title=\"Commodore 64\">Commodore 64</a> console, as I has with my Dreamcast; I found, and I was bestowed with, the memories and soul of the CPU of the Commodore consoles, and the Nation of Comma: Scarlet/Blue Heart.\n</p><p>I had lived a long, trying and mentally and emotionally enduring life, made my own progress, recovery and whatnot. Me! A half-Sonichu individual of this Earth 1218; destined to be a console patron unit! I has a number of my own powers that I am still learning about. Come June: I hook up my Commodore 64 console to the Commodore monitor and all; Put my hands on the console, absorb that share of energy; Scarlet enters my life and memories! It was, wow! I saw these flashes from her life; she spoke to me; we talked. I accepted her memories and responsibilities. Now, I am CPU Blue Heart of Comma AND CWCville. I still am Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu; I continue to treat others with kindness, and being chill and good to talk with and be around.\n</p><p>But I digress.\n</p><p>There is also an incoming danger to this world. Rei Ryghts is plotting something heinous, and it has to do with the Atari VCU. Ryghts is likely to attempt a takeover of this world with her powers, or something. I do not know, fully, yet. The Commodore company needs to make their modern console to counter; their Commodore CW, and they need to put just about everything into it. Also, in due time, only I, along with our allies between both dimensions, are capable of stopping Ryghts and her dimensional dominance. I ask everyone to lend your support, including prayer in your respective religions, and simple kindness, regardless. And to urge Commodore to do their best and full testing to perfect the Commodore CW.\n</p><p>Thank you all.\n</p><p>Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu/ Blue Heart.\n</p><p><br/>\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Analysis\">Analysis</span></h3>\n<p>The writing demonstrates the level of Chris's cognitive dissonance on the Idea Guys, understanding that they extorted him and twisted his fantasy world, however, the irony is that Chris dives even further into the lore the Idea Guys had established, such as the CPU Goddesses and his <a href=\"/cwcki/Polyamorous_marriage\" title=\"Polyamorous marriage\">polyamorous marriage</a>, because he still believes their changes to have actually occurred in his fantasy world.\n</p><p>Additionally, he begs Commodore International to build a new console to combat the incoming threats of Rei Ryghts, CPU of the Atari system. Keep in mind that the company behind it has been defunct since 1994. Also worth noting is how he credit <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Magi-chan\" title=\"Magi-chan\">Magi-chan</a> for thwarting the Idea Guys, rather than attributing to the efforts of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Guard_Dogs\" title=\"Guard Dogs\">Guard Dogs</a>. Overall, it only seems that Chris only rejected the changes he didn't like and cemented his failing sense of <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">reality</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Comic_pages\">Comic pages</span></h2>\n<p>Chris has an unusual numbering system for the pages, adding in subpages and separate sections.
