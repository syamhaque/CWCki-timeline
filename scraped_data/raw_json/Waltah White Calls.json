Look it up in like, the maps that's been chronicled like within the comic books, TV shows, or whatever. That part of Jersey, that's where it's going to be. It's going to fade in and, uh, just nope. Nobody's gonna die unless they actually destined to die, you know, or like, you know, they committed so much, uh, toxicity and badness from, you know, where they reside on 1218 half or C-197 half, I mentioned this before. And Spider-Man, he is living in New York presently as opposed to previous times when he had- when he was in Jersey, it's like- it's like a little back and forth going on.

Alright, so, hit me with your questions.\n</p><p><b>Walt:</b> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, um, I was wonderin', uh, since- are the Pixar cars gonna be anywhere in the, uh, <a href=\"/cwcki/Dimensional_Merge\" title=\"Dimensional Merge\">Dimensional Merge</a>?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Mm. Mm. The Pi- the, uh, cars that are- that are sentient like that, they live in an alternate dimension. They are not on the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/C-197\" title=\"C-197\">C-197</a> half of the Earth.\n</p><p><b>Walt:</b> Okay. Alright, alright. Um. Also, I, uh, have a question. What about Pikmin? They in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Cwcville\" title=\"Cwcville\">Cwcville</a>?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Mm. The Pikmin... they live on another planet, so-\n</p><p><b>Walt:</b> Okay. Alright, alright. So they're in their universe, they just don't live at Cwcville.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> They're- they're- they're elsewhere- they're elsewhere in this universe, in this timeline.\n</p><p><b>Walt:</b> Okay. Alright, alright. That's- that's pretty cool. Um, uh, also, another thing, you said that, uh, Gotham City was gonna replace all of New Jersey... in the merge?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uh, Gotham City is one part of New Jersey, New Jersey is part of, eh, of multiple cities in it, so it's just, uh, Gotham City is one city in New Jersey.\n</p><p><b>Walt:</b> Okay, alright. Um, so, uh, where in New Jersey would that be? Like northern New Jersey or southern New Jersey?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Mm. Well, if you look up any, uh, Batman comic book or, uh, anything that was chronicled online with like, you know, specific locations of where Gotham City is... in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/America\" title=\"America\">America</a>, in New Jersey, there's your pinpoint right there.\n</p><p><b>Walt:</b> Alright, alright. I was- I was just wonderin', cuz I heard that, I've got a lot of friends in New Jersey, and I didn't want them to be, uh, completely crushed by the merge.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Mm. No, essentially it'd be like a fade-in when the, uh, when the thi- when the place is actually transitioned in. So, if the people will still be- the people will still be around, the ones that, uh, surviving the merge. It's just, uh, not everybody, especially like, uh, those that have- that have been proven bad or toxic and- in the, um, eyes of not only the gods and goddesses-\n</p><p><b>Walt:</b> Okay.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> but also, just as they're, uh, destined to be.\n</p><p><b>Walt:</b> Alright, alright. Sweet. Um, also, about railroads in Cwcville, does Cwcville have its own railroad or does it get, um, served by different railroads?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hmm. Well, there is a- there is, uh, there is like a metro that goes from, uh, Cwcville to nearby Sydney.\n</p><p><b>Walt:</b> Okay. Alright. Alright, um.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Something metro... But mainly- it mainly exists in the, uh, northeast part of the city.\n</p><p><b>Walt:</b> Alright, and you said previously that Spider-Man's gonna be in New York City, correct?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Oh yeah, he's been living in New York City the entire time with, uh, Dr. Strange and all of them.\n</p><p><b>Walt:</b> Alright, um... So i- so in theory, could he go over to Jersey and see Gotham City, since New York's right on the New Jersey border?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Mm, yes.\n</p><p><b>Walt:</b> Alright. And you said <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Equestria\" title=\"Equestria\">Equestria</a>'s gonna be <a href=\"/cwcki/BronyCon\" title=\"BronyCon\">Maryland</a>, right?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uh, the portal to Equestria is in Maryland.\n</p><p><b>Walt:</b> Okay.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> That's where, uh, Canterlot High School is.\n</p><p><b>Walt:</b> Alright, I was- I was- I was wonderin'.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>mic craps out</i>] that, uh, island that had the portal that went straight into, uh, Canterlot.\n</p><p><b>Walt:</b> Alright, uh... and I got like, two or three more questions if that's alright.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Alright.\n</p><p><b>Walt:</b> Uh, I saw in your <a href=\"/cwcki/Bluesky\" title=\"Bluesky\">Bluesky</a> a while ago, that your, uh, <a href=\"/cwcki/November_2024_social_media_posts#Lynchburg_P.O._box_closed\" title=\"November 2024 social media posts\">PO box is, um, not- is no longer your PO box</a>, and to send stuff to <a href=\"/cwcki/14_Branchland_Court\" title=\"14 Branchland Court\">14 Branchland</a>.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><b>Walt:</b> Are you still living there?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Mm. Well, I'm not living- I'm not living in, uh, Branchland. I'm not living in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ruckersville\" title=\"Ruckersville\">Ruckersville</a> right now...\n</p><p><b>Walt:</b> Okay.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> But, uh, but mail is to be sent to that address until, uh, whenever-\n</p><p><b>Walt:</b> Alright, so you like, go there like on a monthly basis and pick stuff up?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Or just, uh, when I feel like it.\n</p><p><b>Walt:</b> Alright, alright. Sweet. Um...\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, but- but likely maybe we'll set up- we may- we may consider, uh, opening up my new address at some point, or we'll open up a new PO box. But that's still to be confirmed.\n</p><p><b>Walt:</b> Okay, um, and my last question: Who is <a href=\"/cwcki/Flutter\" title=\"Flutter\">Flutter</a> and why are you going to <a href=\"/cwcki/Finland\" title=\"Finland\">Finland</a>?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> <i>That remains absolutely with no comment!</i>\n</p><p><b>Walt:</b> Well, then you're not getting your fifty bucks then.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Mm.

Uh, does Flutter have a name <i>other</i> than Flutter?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Mm.
