He claims to not remember most of it, despite it happening just hours ago.</li>\n<li>Chris uses his time spent playing at the Pokemon League as job experience in his interview.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey\" title=\"Kacey\">Kacey</a> asks about his \"photographic and audio memory,\" and Chris claims that doesn't work when he tries to remember things \"spur of the moment,\" as if he didn't expect to be asked about the interview that happened <i>that day.</i></li>\n<li>Chris claims to have not worn his medallion to the job interview. He also admits that he complimented the female interviewers on their appearance. Kacey points out that you aren't supposed to hit on your interviewer - Chris disregards this and says it's fine because the compliment was \"informal.\"</li>\n<li>Despite claiming his memory doesn't work \"spur of the moment,\" he is able to immediately remember word for word what he said to troll phone calls. He was called gay by trolls.</li>\n<li>Kacey suggests simply ignoring troll phone calls - this goes completely over his head, and he immediately changes the subject.</li>\n<li>Kacey asks if he thinks he got the job. Chris says yes because \"they smiled at me.\"</li>\n<li>Chris's logic kicks in full force. After failing to remember what his password was several times, he is locked out of his copyright management account for \"multiple failed login attempts.\" Rather than figuring that <i>his own failed log in attempts</i> caused this, he believes it is the work of a troll.</li>\n<li>Chris believes that not only is it possible to steal the Sonichu <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Copyright\" title=\"Copyright\">copyright</a>, but that all you need to do is have the copyright mailed to you and it's legally yours, disregarding the legal name on it. This further proves that Chris has <i>no idea</i> what the copyright actually is.</li>\n<li>Kacey asks Chris to film himself jogging so she can make sure he is doing it right. He says he \"will consider it.\"</li>\n<li>Chris says that he will get to work on putting essays on <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia\" title=\"CWCipedia\">CWCipedia</a>.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Video\">Video</span></h2>\n<center>\n<table style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa; background-color: #f9f9f9; color: black; margin: .5em auto .5em auto; padding: 0.2em; font-size:89%; width:260px;-moz-border-radius:10px\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFFF00\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size:110%; color:#008080;-moz-border-radius:10px\"><b>Kacey Call 21</b><br/>\n</td></tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<td colspan=\"2\"><div class=\"thumb embedvideo autoResize\" style=\"width: 328px;\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo autoResize\" style=\"\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideowrap youtube\" style=\"width: 320px\"><div class=\"embedvideo-consent\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo-consent__overlay\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo-consent__message\">Click to load content</div><!--\n--></div><!--\n--></div><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" data-src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/T36jd-X9aGM\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"180\" loading=\"lazy\" modestbranding=\"1\" width=\"320\"></iframe></div><!--\n--></div><!--\n--></div>\n</td></tr>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#696969\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;-moz-border-radius:5px;color:#ffffff;\"><b>Stardate</b>\n</td>\n<td><a href=\"/cwcki/September_2009\" title=\"September 2009\">September 2009</a> (day unknown)\n</td></tr>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#696969\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;-moz-border-radius:5px;color:#ffffff;\"><b>Featuring</b>\n</td>\n<td><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris\" title=\"Chris\">Chris</a>; <a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey\" title=\"Kacey\">Kacey</a>\n</td></tr>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#696969\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;-moz-border-radius:5px;color:#ffffff;\"><b>Saga</b>\n</td>\n<td><span style=\"display:none\">Liquid</span><a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris\" title=\"Liquid\"><img alt=\"Liquid\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"32\" src=\"/w/images/8/85/Liquid_saga.png\" width=\"32\"/></a> Liquid Saga\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" style=\"background-color:#FFFF00; color:#008080; color:#008080;-moz-border-radius:10px; font-size:120%; padding:0.25em; text-align:center;\">Audio Recordings\n</td></tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%;\" valign=\"top\">\n<td><b>previous</b> <br/><a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey_Call_20\" title=\"Kacey Call 20\">Kacey Call 20</a>\n</td>\n<td><b>next</b> <br/><a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey_Call_22\" title=\"Kacey Call 22\">Kacey Call 22</a>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n</center>\n<p><br/>\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b> </font>[high pitched, worried sounding] Hello?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Hey Chris, it's Kacey! What's up?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hey Kacey. I'm doin' OK, how are you?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I'm good! So... how did the interview go today? I want to hear everything about it.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah... I'll say as much as I can remember, anyway. It was, it went good. I had, uh... two supervising fema-, two supervisor women interview me over there. And, uh... and they, you know, I kept my voice at a pleasant tone and I, uh, I ca-, I was, ah, I kept good on the friendly smile and uh, and I maintained eye contact and, uh... answered the questions honestly and uh...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [interrupting] What kind of questions did they ask you?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, you know, like, uh... questions about my, about my past job, yeah, we took kind of length[?] to talk about my, it's, they talked about my past job at <a href=\"/cwcki/Wendy%27s\" title=\"Wendy's\">Wendy's</a>, and also about brought in, like, you know, uh, also like, find some, find some I, uh, experience at the, over a-, when I volunteered for the Pokemon League. [pause] Yeah, um... and they also gave me a lot of hypothetical situations so I can't remember those, can't remember that right of the ba-, remember that right off the top of my head right now.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oh, but it just happened today, how could you not remember? I mean, was it like, angry customers or was iiiit... like were you having a problem with another employee? [pause] I mean, I thought you had this photographic and audio memory.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [sigh, pause] I guess I, uh... I guess I, I, I guess it's something I c-, yeah. I wo-, I mean, yeah, I used to-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [interrupting] Are you sure you're OK? You sound distressed.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [pause, sigh]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> What happened? What's wrong?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I... when I have to remember something and then I, when I'm pressed trying to remember, as much detail, it's just, I get frustrated when I can't remember, can't remem-, can't recall it. I mean, you can't just like... spur of the moment.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well...it sounded like you were stressed when you picked up, so are you sure there's not something that happened today?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I, yeah, well, I did, I mean, while I was waiting for you I did pick up, uh, did pick up a few, uh, calls from some trolls, and...[pause, sigh] There's another rumor going around and... I got calls with claims from people, um call me, like, you know, saying like, yeah, [mockingly] \"Oooh, yeah, I'm glad you finally came out of the closet and you're such a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Homo\" title=\"Homo\">homo</a>,\" and then like I told them, like, told them, \"I'm straight.\" I told them I'm straight and then hung up on them. <i>[sigh]</i> I just had to deal with, had to deal with a bunch of those.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [interrupting] That's awful! I'm so sorry that my class ran late, but it sounds like somebody needs to grow up.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, a LOT of somebodies.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Haha, yeah. I mean, don't they have anything BETTER to do?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> But I mean, I guess it could be worse. I mean, it's just a phone call. You could just ignore them.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. Anyway, like I was explaining, anyways, still, I think I left a, ah, good impression at like, and I did dress nice I work like, I wor-, I wore a nice, uh, blue dress shirt that, a like, nice blue striped dress shirt that I had and uh, black slacks and uh, blazer, and I did <i>not</i> wear my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Medallion\" title=\"Medallion\">medallion</a>. And I sat appropriately with my hands in my lap and my shoulders straight and sitting up posture and-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [interrupting] That's good!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I... yeah. And I, you know, I even them a good handshakes and uh, a compliment on how they looked and uh, I think they like so I'll hear b-, I'll hear, I'll find out for sure in a couple of days.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, I hope you weren't too forward with the complimenting them. Normally you don't do that on an interview.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I mean, no, no, it was like, informal, it was like, you know, while were waiting for the uh, for the, the, conference room to be free 'cause there was another interview goin' on and I complimented one of the two, one, one of the two women on how they looked. They looked good. And uh, also had uh, a jeweled hair piece and had pony tails. But it was like, you know, the jewel covered up the rubber band. And I, uh, complimented on that, you know, it looked good. It looked good on that person.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oh. So did they have you fill out any kind of paperwork or say if they would be setting up a second interview, or... um, basically, what did they say?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Mm... well, I did have to uh, did have to sign a form where they talked about my, you know, uh... my schedule, availability of which I filled out when I applied on the online application. Talked to me about that. Verifying that. Uh... other than that, it was a Q-and-A, uh... and they pretty much wrote that down themselves.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, did they tell you that they would be calling you, or anything else?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, they said that they would call me back.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Did they give you a time frame?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [annoyed] Yeah, in a couple of days. [pause] Or if you're talking a time frame in hours, no they did not give me that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oh, no no no, just... a time frame.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, in a couple of days.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, I mean... do you think you got the job?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Mm. [pause] I'm hoping I did. I'm praying I did.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, I mean, did they say anything that would make you... <i>think</i> that?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> They smiled back at me.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> That's their job, they're supposed to smile back.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, but I mean, ah...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Did they say anything about paperwork, orientation... anything like that?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Mm... they, ahhh... they never said anything about orientations yet.\n</p><p>[pause]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Mmkay. Well, did anything else happen today?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Well... I didn't have much else planned, so after I got home, after I got back home, I, uh... had something to eat, then I took my tai-, walk... jog. And then after I got home I spent some time playing Final Fantasy 7.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oh. That's an old game! So, uh... how about your <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Copyright\" title=\"Copyright\">copyright</a> papers? How's that coming along?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I think I already told you that, uh... that I re-registered...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> But, I mean, have you checked on it online to make sure it went through?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I... Yeah, I tried checking it online, but unfortunately, uh... yeah, I hadn't changed my password and I forgot... I'm not sure what the password is. I think it's... it's suppo-, supposed to be... it's supposed to have the word \"nutmeg\" in it.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [typing heard in the background]\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Or, and, it's like... \"gemtun\" or something... which is a palindrome of nutmeg.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Hmm.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Spelled back... spelled backward. That's what palindrome means.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Awesome!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. Hey, w-... yeah. I think I told you that I like to do that. You know, <a href=\"/cwcki/U8C43P2A37A8_y_U8C1N023V0L\" title=\"U8C43P2A37A8 y U8C1N023V0L\">spell words backwards and then say them like that</a>.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Right!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. Anyway, uh... I also have that. I think it was like, either \"02241982\" but it... apparently, those weren't right. And uh, I guess... I mean, like, it also said like, I tried logging in and it gave me like... it said, like, you know, account has been deactivated because of multiple failed login attempts.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oooh.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> So, I don't know, maybe one of the tro-... <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">Clyde</a> or... <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Gregg_Mays\" title=\"Gregg Mays\">Gregg</a>. Clyde, that guy, tried to log in. And tried to... psh, mess everything up there.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well... who knows?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [trying to interrupt] B-b-but y-yeah, but yeah...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Because if he did, I mean, what would you do? I mean, if he did that, then HE would have the copyright, wouldn't he?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [sigh] Well, yeah, well, I mean, I don't know. Mm. It would depend on if he actually has an address for them to send the, uh, for them to send that, uh, piece of paper to or not.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [talking over Chris] Well...you should work on it and find out.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> 'Cause, I mean, if you think he did, he probably did, because that sounds like him.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I, I, well, yeah, I'm trying.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, you should try harder, because I mean isn't that...important to you?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, it is important.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> So, you should...probably get on it.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I have been on that. I was on that, I was on it earlier when I was checkin' my e-mail as well. Also, yeah, I checked my e-mail also before, uh, after I got back from my walk...and before I went to Final Fantasy 7 I checked my e-mail.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, how long did you walk?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [sigh] The usual... usual, 'bout... actually, nowadays, with the way I'm walking... I'm walking, jogging a little faster. I get home in 15 to 30 minutes now. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [interrupting] OK, so you... so you jogged for 15 minutes, or you walked for 15 minutes?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [pause] Yeah, I jogged for like... five minutes out of the total time.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [long pause] OK. Well. [sucks teeth] Do you ever think that... maybe you should...\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [tries to interrupt]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> ...try to film yourself jogging so that maybe I could see your form and give you a few pointers?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hm. Yeah, well, I don't know if it would be that easy for me to... well, I mean, it's not like I can actually... hold the camera while I'm jogging. It's like a habit of mine, swinging my arms while I jog. If I had it in my hands while I was filming, I mean... it'd be like, constant motion.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, you're not supposed to let your arms swing down when you're jogging. You're supposed to keep them right by you. You know, like, you can either have your elbows bent a little bit, or keep them by your side.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [tries to interrupt] Yeah... I-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I mean, just to, just set it stationary and jog in front of it for a little bit.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [pause] OK, well, I'll think about... OK, I'll consider it. I'll think about it.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> <i>[typing]</i> OK, but don't just be saying that to blow me off.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I'm not saying that to blow you off. I will seriously consider... doing that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK. Well, I just wanted to make sure that you know you're working on stuff. Um... so, um, also, I mean, you know, you haven't done a lot of things that you said you would. Like, there's no old essays on the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia\" title=\"CWCipedia\">CWCipedia</a>, anything like that, or, um... a song. ...anything. I mean, maybe you should just do a little bit at a time. Because, I'm <i>really</i> trying to help you out here, but you've got to help too for you.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. Yep. Okay. Yeah. Yep. Yeah, just, I'm still...yes. So many things and...so many things. Yep. But yeah. I'll get... I'll get some old essays up on the CWCipedia.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK. Well, that's good, um...\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, let me let you go ahead and get to that and I will try to talk to you tomorrow. And definitely check up on that copyright, you don't want someone to steal it right from under your nose.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. Yeah. I... I... yeah. I'll get right on that. I am right on that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK. Alright. Bye.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I'll talk to you later.
