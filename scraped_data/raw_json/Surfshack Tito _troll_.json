The nickname \"Surfshack Tito\" is a reference to the <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://rocketpower.fandom.com/wiki/Tito_Makani\" rel=\"nofollow\">corpulent surf-shop owner</a> from the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickelodeon\" title=\"wikipedia:Nickelodeon\">Nickelodeon</a> kids' cartoon <i><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_Power\" title=\"wikipedia:Rocket Power\">Rocket Power</a></i>. During the exchanges with Chris, most of them from Tito ended with a Tito-styled word of wisdom. An infamous copypasta about Tito most likely inspired the choice to go with the name.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[note 1]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Tito gained notoriety in <a href=\"/cwcki/March_2010\" title=\"March 2010\">March 2010</a> when he took credit for the end of Chris's relationship with <a href=\"/cwcki/The_Wallflower\" title=\"The Wallflower\">The Wallflower</a>, causing Chris to make <a href=\"/cwcki/Tito_Got_No_Luck_Against_We_Brits,_Irish_and_Scots!\" title=\"Tito Got No Luck Against We Brits, Irish and Scots!\">multiple</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_Drops_the_N-Bomb\" title=\"Chris Drops the N-Bomb\">videos</a> openly raging at him, including one where he said the <a href=\"/cwcki/Niggos\" title=\"Niggos\">N-word</a>. Judging by Chris's initial responses to Tito, it is safe to say that he initially <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">thought</a> that the <i>actual</i> Tito from Rocket Power was trolling him, before eventually realizing at some point that he was just a character played by a troll. For the next year and a half, Tito continued trolling, his troll plots including <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Trollin%27_Train\" title=\"Trollin' Train\">tricking Chris into smashing his PS3</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Tomgirl_Pictures\" title=\"Tomgirl Pictures\">leaking photos of Chris crossdressing</a>. He was eventually <a href=\"/cwcki/Calling_Out\" title=\"Calling Out\">called out</a> by Chris, leading to him making an apology video, before abandoning trolling due to him being busy with high school.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#PSN_Hacking\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">PSN Hacking</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#The_Wallflower_Incident\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The Wallflower Incident</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#PS3_Destruction\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">PS3 Destruction</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Tomgirl_Pictures\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Tomgirl Pictures</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Called_Out\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Called Out</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Tito's_Apology\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Tito's Apology</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1\"><a href=\"#Notes\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Notes</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"PSN_Hacking\">PSN Hacking</span></h2>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Surfshack_Tito_(video)\" title=\"Surfshack Tito (video)\">Surfshack Tito (video)</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>On 24 <a href=\"/cwcki/February_2010\" title=\"February 2010\">February 2010</a>, Tito first appeared by hacking into Chris's <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PSN\" title=\"PSN\">PSN</a> account.

Using this information, Surfshack Tito and some other trolls managed to find out The Wallflower's real name. Tito then created a <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCki\" title=\"CWCki\">CWCki</a> page about Wallflower, which involved all of this real information. Finally, he sent a link to the page to Wallflower, leaving her horrified by all the personal information on the site, and leading her to cut of all ties with Chris.\n</p><p>Tito started emailing Chris, taunting him over the loss of The Wallflower, leading Chris to make <a href=\"/cwcki/Tito_Got_No_Luck_Against_We_Brits,_Irish_and_Scots!\" title=\"Tito Got No Luck Against We Brits, Irish and Scots!\">Tito Got No Luck Against We Brits, Irish and Scots!</a>, his second and most bizarre video addressed to Tito, threatening him with a pocket knife while wearing a Scottish kilt and repeatedly saying Wallflower's real name.  \n</p><p>Tito began riling up Chris even more by suggesting that he was dating and having regular sex with The Wallflower, sending Chris a photoshopped image of a big black man (Tito) standing with The Wallflower. Chris bought this narrative, repeatedly asking The Wallflower to leave Tito in <a href=\"/cwcki/%22Damian_Antaria%22,_PLEASE,_Don%27t_Leave_Me_-_I_NEED_YOU!!!\" title=\"&quot;Damian Antaria&quot;, PLEASE, Don't Leave Me - I NEED YOU!!!\">a video</a> addressed to her. The Wallflower, in an attempt to get Chris off her back, actually played into this narrative by calling Tito her boyfriend. These events happened shortly before the <a href=\"/cwcki/Happy_Sonichu_Day\" title=\"Happy Sonichu Day\">10th anniversary of Sonichu</a>.\n</p><p>Chris, at peak anger, began emailing Tito, calling him a \"nigger\" three times, and threatening to track him down and murder him. Chris reiterated this sentiment in <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_Drops_the_N-Bomb\" title=\"Chris Drops the N-Bomb\">the most iconic video</a> from this Saga, threatening to murder Tito multiple times before finally calling him a \"trolling stupid pickle suited nigger\" and ending the video. This Saga rattled Chris so much that around a week later he <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/C-Ya_Later\" title=\"C-Ya Later\">claimed that he would leave the Internet forever</a>, starting the \"First Exile\", where Chris repeatedly tried (and failed) to leave the Internet.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"PS3_Destruction\">PS3 Destruction</span></h2>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_and_Tito_PS3_E-mails\" title=\"Clyde and Tito PS3 E-mails\">Clyde and Tito PS3 E-mails</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>Tito was a frequent poster on <a href=\"/cwcki/Trollin_Train\" title=\"Trollin Train\">Trollin Train</a>, along with <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">Clyde Cash</a>. After Clyde and Tito put up a $9001 dollar bounty for destroying Chris's <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PS3\" title=\"PS3\">PS3</a>, Chris would claim it himself by <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/MovingForward\" title=\"MovingForward\">destroying his own PS3</a>. After he e-mailed Clyde a few times, Clyde forwarded him to Tito, who managed his money.\n</p><p>Tito was not as lenient as Clyde, rattling off a list of reasons why Chris was unable to claim the bounty. Clyde intervened with this, saying he enjoyed the video of Chris destroying his PS3, and to give Chris the money. Tito told Chris that they could meet up at <a href=\"/cwcki/The_GAMe_PLACe\" title=\"The GAMe PLACe\">The GAMe PLACe</a>, and telling him to come or he would spend the money on hookers. Chris refused to go there, and they rescheduled to a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chick-fil-A\" title=\"Chick-fil-A\">Chick-fil-A</a> in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Fashion_Square_Mall\" title=\"Fashion Square Mall\">Fashion Square Mall</a>, however one of Clyde's Asian technicians told Tito the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PS3\" title=\"PS3\">PS3</a> was still intact. To prove it was completely broken, Chris had to <a href=\"/cwcki/ItIsFinished.MOV\" title=\"ItIsFinished.MOV\">run over all the separate pieces of his PS3</a>, which finally convinced Tito. \n</p><p>Tito told him to meet up at <a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_restaurants#Starbucks\" title=\"List of restaurants\">Starbucks</a> in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Fashion_Square\" title=\"Fashion Square\">Fashion Square</a>, where he would be approached by a female agent with a <a href=\"/cwcki/Pickle\" title=\"Pickle\">pickle</a> tattoo on her breast. He was <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_and_Tito_PS3_E-mails#Waiting_for_$9001\" title=\"Clyde and Tito PS3 E-mails\">videotaped</a> sitting at a chair in fashion square, creepily staring at women, possibly trying to spot a pickle tattoo. No agents would walk up and give him the money, leading to Chris writing an angry e-mail to Tito. Tito responded stating that he had already given the money to <a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris\" title=\"Liquid Chris\">a man who said he was Christian Weston Chandler, with a Sonichu medallion, high school ring, and brown shirt</a>, leaving Chris without any money.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Tomgirl_Pictures\">Tomgirl Pictures</span></h2>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Tomgirl_Pictures\" title=\"Tomgirl Pictures\">Tomgirl Pictures</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>Tito was the one to the leak the <a href=\"/cwcki/Tomgirl_Pictures\" title=\"Tomgirl Pictures\">Tomgirl Pictures</a> on 28 <a href=\"/cwcki/April_2011\" title=\"April 2011\">April 2011</a>, along with supplying his own commentary on them.\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#F2CECE; border:1px dotted #BFA3A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Chris decided that being a <a href=\"/cwcki/JERKS\" title=\"JERKS\">man</a> was too much work.

The manchild felt that he could identify being a lady seeing that he has had vast experience of hanging out with girls in the cafeteria. Chris decided that being in touch with the femine side would be the truth key in his quest. \n</p><p>But wait! Does that make him gay? \n</p><p>Not in Chris' lifetime it doesn't. Thanks to 3 months of dry spell and constant hours of TV have deluded him. Based on the archetype you would see on movies and video games, you would learn of the \"Tomboy\", The girl with boyish next to dykish features would allow her to be swarmed by the opposite sex with her short hair and her appreciation of the Dresdon Dolls. \n</p><p>\"If a girl could do it, So can a boy\", Chris thought.
