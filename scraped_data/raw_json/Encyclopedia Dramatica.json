The site is known for making use of shock value and featuring utterly scathing language used to mock the subjects of its articles.\n</p><p>ED was the home to the <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler\">Chris-Chan</a> page that introduced Chris to the world at large in <a href=\"/cwcki/2007\" title=\"2007\">2007</a>, following <a href=\"/cwcki/4-cent_garbage.com\" title=\"4-cent garbage.com\">4chan</a> and <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Something_Awful\" title=\"wikipedia:Something Awful\">Something Awful</a>'s discovery of the lolcow, which made him a popular target for <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">trolling</a>. Upon learning of ED, Chris began campaigning for the removal of the article for smearing his name, and particularly took offense to various pieces of \"fan art\" depicting <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu\" title=\"Rosechu\">Rosechu</a> with a <a href=\"/cwcki/Pickle\" title=\"Pickle\">penis</a>. Naturally, this just led to the trolls adding more content to the page as he shared a series of written and recorded rants about the article.\n</p><p>In attempted retaliation for the page, Chris added <a href=\"/cwcki/Honest_Content\" title=\"Honest Content\">lots of embarrassing personal information</a> to their article on him, including <a href=\"/cwcki/ShecameforCWC.JPG\" title=\"ShecameforCWC.JPG\">an infamous drawing</a> depicting a sex act between himself and <a href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Schroeder\" title=\"Megan Schroeder\">a real-life friend</a>. Instead of the \"information overload\" overwhelming the admins into taking the page down, like Chris believed it would, it gave a substantial amount of oxygen to the organized trolling effort while also destroying the aforementioned friendship. The sheer abundance of shenanigans with Chris eventually led to the creation of the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCki\" title=\"CWCki\">CWCki</a>, since the ED page became too long and unwieldy for a single article, which has succeeded ED as the best resource for information on Chris's life.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#ED_discovers_Chris\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">ED discovers Chris</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Chris_discovers_ED\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris discovers ED</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Chris-Chan_(forum)\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris-Chan (forum)</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Later_developments\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Later developments</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Sources\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Sources</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#External_links\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">External links</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"ED_discovers_Chris\">ED discovers Chris</span></h2>\n<p>In late October 2007, Chris drew the attention of the folks in a forum at <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Something_Awful\" title=\"wikipedia:Something Awful\">Something Awful</a>, a comedy website. Shortly thereafter, the people at <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/4chan\" title=\"4chan\">4chan</a> also trained their lasers on Chris. Topics of discussion included his <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\"><i>Sonichu</i> comic</a>, his <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC%27s_Sonichu_Site!\" title=\"CWC's Sonichu Site!\">website</a>, and his <a href=\"/cwcki/MySpace\" title=\"MySpace\">MySpace</a> page. <a href=\"/cwcki/Anna_McLerran\" title=\"Anna McLerran\">Anna</a>'s blog story, \"<a href=\"/cwcki/The_Tale_Of_The_Crazy_Pacer\" title=\"The Tale Of The Crazy Pacer\">The Tale Of The Crazy Pacer</a>\", was also uncovered. The wealth of information and its lulzworthiness prompted the Anon, later identified as <a href=\"/cwcki/Jason_Kendrick_Howell\" title=\"Jason Kendrick Howell\">Jason Kendrick Howell</a>, to create the original Chris-chan page on Encyclopedia Dramatica, on 3 November 2007. Within two years, it underwent over 5,000 revisions and became arguably the most popular page on the site.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris_discovers_ED\">Chris discovers ED</span></h2>\n<p>Almost immediately, Chris discovered his ED page, during what he called \"the worst weekend of my life\".<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-anna_3-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-anna-3\">[3]</a></sup> He was horrified by the explicit fan art, which he would later call \"Dark Parodic Shit\".<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup> He was especially enraged by the inclusion of a recent photo of himself, surreptitiously taken at <a href=\"/cwcki/The_GAMe_PLACe\" title=\"The GAMe PLACe\">The GAMe PLACe</a> by <a href=\"/cwcki/Daniel_Mimms\" title=\"Daniel Mimms\">Mimms</a> and uploaded to 4chan by <a href=\"/cwcki/Lucas\" title=\"Lucas\">Lucas</a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup> \"A hacking terrorist group, Anonymous, and 4Chan are somehow involved in that page as well\", he intoned.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-anna_3-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-anna-3\">[3]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Chris's initial response to this character assassination was civil.

He also tried to create a page on ED for his \"CCWC's Fanart of Horrors\" (see: <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Troll\" title=\"Troll\">troll</a> art), but a sysop immediately caught it and redirected it to an anti-Semitic template.\n</p><p>Chris's meddling with ED was a key reason for the destruction of his relationship with <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Megan\" title=\"Megan\">Megan</a>. On 11 <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/November_2007\" title=\"November 2007\">November 2007</a>, in an attempt to \"shove so much information down their throats and drown them into taking the page down,\" Chris uploaded five pornographic drawings to his ED page, including the infamous <a href=\"/cwcki/ShecameforCWC.JPG\" title=\"ShecameforCWC.JPG\">ShecameforCWC.JPG</a>. When Megan found out about the drawing in <a href=\"/cwcki/March_2008\" title=\"March 2008\">March 2008</a> and realized she was a part of it, it was the final straw. Chris made more furious efforts to scrub the images from ED, but to no avail. Of course, Chris <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC%27s_Second_Message\" title=\"CWC's Second Message\">blamed ED for all of this</a>.\n</p><p>By late summer <a href=\"/cwcki/2008\" title=\"2008\">2008</a>, Chris had largely given up on direct involvement with ED.

ED also experienced problems with misinformation on Chris, occasionally removing false or exaggerated rumors such as the claim that Chris attempted to <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_sex#Bestiality\" title=\"Chris and sex\">molest</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Patti_Chandler\" title=\"Patti Chandler\">Patti</a>, or that <a href=\"/cwcki/Ivy\" title=\"Ivy\">Ivy</a> was just a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sex_dolls\" title=\"Sex dolls\">blow-up doll</a>.\n</p><p>On 25 <a href=\"/cwcki/January_2009\" title=\"January 2009\">January 2009</a>, five days after one of Chris’s <a href=\"/cwcki/DIRTY,_CRAPPED_BRIEFS\" title=\"DIRTY, CRAPPED BRIEFS\">biggest revelations</a>, the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCki\" title=\"CWCki\">CWCki</a> came into existence: those interested in Chris’s antics quickly found the CWCki to be more accurate and less biased or exaggerated than ED, with TV Tropes once describing the CWCki to be \"more accurate and slightly more SFW\" than ED.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Chris-chan_ED_April_Fools%27_2009.PNG\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"138\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/9/96/Chris-chan_ED_April_Fools%27_2009.PNG/300px-Chris-chan_ED_April_Fools%27_2009.PNG\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/9/96/Chris-chan_ED_April_Fools%27_2009.PNG/450px-Chris-chan_ED_April_Fools%27_2009.PNG 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/9/96/Chris-chan_ED_April_Fools%27_2009.PNG/600px-Chris-chan_ED_April_Fools%27_2009.PNG 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Chris-chan_ED_April_Fools%27_2009.PNG\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>April Fool's article.</div></div></div>\n<p>On April Fools' Day 2009, ED finally bent to Chris's will and removed all his personal information from the site, and replaced the article with an apology. Unsurprisingly, though, Chris's ED page was back up on April 2.\n</p><p>ED’s coverage of Chris continued to get updates until <a href=\"/cwcki/April_2011\" title=\"April 2011\">April 2011</a>, when ED relaunched as <i>Oh Internet</i>: an attempt to raise the revenue required to stay online by removing controversial content that would deter advertisers. However, the move also reduced coverage of Chris to a single page, and left out much of the crucial content that defined Chris, such as <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-10\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">[10]</a></sup>\n</p><p>In <a href=\"/cwcki/October_2013\" title=\"October 2013\">October 2013</a>, <i>Oh Internet</i> quietly went offline following internal disputes and divisions over the 2011 relaunch, and work began on rebuilding Encyclopedia Dramatica by scraping articles and images from archived websites: ED then struggled to stay online through numerous domains over the years. As of 2025, ED and their coverage of Chris and <i>Sonichu</i> barely cling on to life, with most of the information long superseded by <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCki\" title=\"CWCki\">this very wiki</a>. In a sense, Chris has sort of triumphed over ED by means of outlasting them in terms of overall relevancy, but at a great cost to himself and the people associated with him.\n</p><p>As for Chris himself, the ED page bothered him for years, and presumably still does, but he rarely mentions it anymore. An <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_chan_(CWCipedia)\" title=\"Chris chan (CWCipedia)\">entire page</a> of Chris's website, established in <a href=\"/cwcki/December_2009\" title=\"December 2009\">December 2009</a>, was dedicated to \"correcting\" the evil ED article with his own True and Honest take on the situation. Naturally, it was all about how Chris isn't remotely responsible for anything he has done wrong, and how it's all the fault of his <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">autism</a> or those DANG DIRTY TROLLS. However, Chris's worsening grasp on <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Reality\" title=\"Reality\">reality</a>, and changing priorities on <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC%27s_Hallmark_Negative_Life_Events\" title=\"CWC's Hallmark Negative Life Events\">other enemies</a>, caused his rage against ED to decline to a point where he only made occasional references.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-11\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">[11]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Chris has apparently never seriously contemplated the fact that his one-man crusade against ED was probably one of the biggest unforced errors of his life, and certainly one of the most defining. Had he simply ignored the page, he would likely have faded into relative obscurity as people moved on to the next attention-grabbing weird loser, much like what happened with countless other lolcows who have come and gone before and since. Instead, he fed the trolls by touching the poop, drawing more attention to himself and proving that trolling him would be guaranteed to get a reaction out of him. To say nothing about all the ammunition he gave them for free, along with revealing some of his most unsavory traits, which allowed many people to justify trolling him. The ED debacle shows that, at the end of the day, Chris is his own worst enemy.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sources\">Sources</span></h2>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap mw-references-columns\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Megan_emails,_2008\" title=\"Megan emails, 2008\">Megan emails, 2008</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Jason_Kendrick_Howell_interview\" title=\"Jason Kendrick Howell interview\">Jason Kendrick Howell interview</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-anna-3\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\">↑ <sup><a href=\"#cite_ref-anna_3-0\">3.0</a></sup> <sup><a href=\"#cite_ref-anna_3-1\">3.1</a></sup></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_emails_2007#November\" title=\"Chris emails 2007\">Chris emails 2007#November</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-4\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-4\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"/cwcki/June_2012_Facebook_posts#Dark_parodic_shit\" title=\"June 2012 Facebook posts\">June 2012 Facebook posts#Dark parodic shit</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-5\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-5\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Mimms_and_Lucas_Q%26A\" title=\"Mimms and Lucas Q&amp;A\">Mimms and Lucas Q&amp;A</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-6\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-6\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20080227084345/http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Chris-chan&amp;oldid=1997409947\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://web.archive.org/web/20080227084345/http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Chris-chan&amp;oldid=1997409947</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-7\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-7\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_dispels_videogame_rumors\" title=\"Chris dispels videogame rumors\">Chris dispels videogame rumors</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-8\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-8\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Jason_Kendrick_Howell_interview\" title=\"Jason Kendrick Howell interview\">Jason Kendrick Howell interview</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-9\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-9\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">\"MINE: What this talkpage is.
