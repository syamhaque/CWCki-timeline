And I will send you \nthe financial information soon as well, with the starting balance after \nmy next piece of income comes in, which considering the 3rd of the \nmonth (<a href=\"/cwcki/January_2010\" title=\"January 2010\">January, 2010</a>) falls on a Sunday, and there is the holiday of \nNew Year's Day the Friday before, I should get it in as early as next \nTursday. After it comes in, I will print the page of the current \nstatus and starting January amount, mark out the bank numbers, scan it \nin and e-mail it to you. And I will let you know of the planned \nspendings and such then.\n</p><p>I'll TTYL,<br/>\nMerry Christmas and Stay Safe,<br/>\nChristian.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"24_December\">24 December</span></h3>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>As you may have noticed, <a href=\"/cwcki/Jack_Thaddeus\" title=\"Jack Thaddeus\">Jack Thaddius</a> has been donating to the Cwcipedia and abusing his rights to place ads in the adspace with the God-Damn <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">homosexual</a> ads. At first, it was light, the pic of Peter Griffin with the message of Seth McFarline approving of it, then he touched a nerve with the <a href=\"/cwcki/Aspergers\" title=\"Aspergers\">Aspergers</a> = <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">Autism</a> ad (AT LEAST IT HAD A WOMAN IN THAT IMAGE). Then he adds 4 more offensive homo ads, and tonight he monopolizes the space with TWO EXPLICIT ADS THAT WOULD ONLY BE SHOWN IN AN adam&amp;eve catalog! GOD DAMN!!! I try to cope with the nuisance with F5, and even covering that portion of the screen with removable taped paper. But it's ads like that S.O.B. has on there right now that make me want to cry in shame that my stuff is being dragged down the drain with those WORSE THAN SHITTY, GOD DAMN, HELLHOLE AD IMAGES!!!!!\n<p>*sigh*\n</p><p>I miss the days when the ONLY ad on there was the ad for your Audiobooks, but even that is long-gone. Please, Vivian, regain control of the Ad Space and remove those ads; AS LONG AS IT IS NOT A <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">HOMOSEXUAL</a> AD, or has an Image that is Offensive to a majority of the worldwide population, I do not care of what is advertised there. You even have my permission to place an ad for a website that is making Sonichu Merchandise; I even made the statement that such merchandise, excluding bootleg DVDs and Comic Books, are Official and Approved By Me.\n</p><p>I wish for Peace Of Mind and Comfort when I update and view the Cwcipedia. Please help me, Vivian. Do this for me, and I will give \nyou my full trust and faith.\n</p><p>In any case, I'm tired from shoveling more snow earlier today, and mostly getting the snow off the other cars. On the brighter side, I managed to make a few heavy avalanches (biggest clumps of snow sliding off any side of the vehicle). But at least I got the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_Day\" title=\"Sonichu Day\">Sonichu Day</a> video created and uploaded, and I did two more pages and got them uploaded. I'll do another pair of pages tomorrow, maybe four.
