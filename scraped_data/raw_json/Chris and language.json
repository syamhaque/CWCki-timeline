Given his intensely sheltered life in addition to his <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">autism</a>, Chris has yet to learn how to communicate effectively.\n</p><p>Having lived in the U.S. his entire life, Chris uses English as his primary language in both writing and discourse. He also learned <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_Spanish\" title=\"Chris and Spanish\">Spanish</a> as a second language, although his grasp of it is poor, to say the least. He has also used some phrases and words from other languages, and has shown interest in learning Japanese.\n</p><p>Chris makes many mistakes in both writing and speaking, for a variety of reasons. Chris stopped speaking at the <a href=\"/cwcki/Abusive_babysitter\" title=\"Abusive babysitter\">age of 1</a>, and he didn't start again until he was 7 years old. Chris does not interact with others offline on a regular basis. His autism and literal thinking also contributes to this problem; he takes sentences at face value, not thinking of any implication or hidden meanings in the sentence.\n</p><p>Chris is somewhat better at writing than speaking, since Chris writes more often than he speaks, and writing allows him to read over what he says before he presses <i>send</i>. Still, Chris's writing is riddled with grammatical, semantic, and literary flaws.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Common_problems\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Common problems</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#CWC-isms\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">CWC-isms</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Writing\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Writing</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Penmanship_and_font_choices\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Penmanship and font choices</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Oration\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Oration</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#English\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">English</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Writing_2\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Writing</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Speaking\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Speaking</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#Spanish\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Spanish</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Others\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Others</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#Japanese\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Japanese</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#German\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">German</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-13\"><a href=\"#French\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">French</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-14\"><a href=\"#Finnish\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Finnish</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-15\"><a href=\"#Hebrew\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Hebrew</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-16\"><a href=\"#Swedish\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4.6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Swedish</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-17\"><a href=\"#Fictional_languages\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Fictional languages</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-18\"><a href=\"#Akashic\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Akashic</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-19\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Common_problems\">Common problems</span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"CWC-isms\">CWC-isms</span></h3>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC-isms\" title=\"CWC-isms\">CWC-isms</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>Chris has a habit of creating new words and using them without explaining what they mean in conversations. The CWC-ism \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tugboat\" title=\"Tugboat\">Tugboat</a>\" was used by Chris in an <a href=\"/cwcki/Cole_Smithey_E-mails\" title=\"Cole Smithey E-mails\">E-mail to Cole</a> without telling him what it means. Other words include \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Noviophobia\" title=\"Noviophobia\">Noviophobia</a>\", \"<a href=\"/cwcki/China\" title=\"China\">China</a>\" and \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Duck\" title=\"Duck\">Ducks</a>\".\n</p><p>In the wider study of ASD (Autistic Spectrum Disorder) these made up words are called neologisms, and are found to be common in the language of autistic individuals.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup> It is hard to pin down and define the effects that these neologisms have on people with ASD across the board, but one of Chris's methods of creating these new words is using a <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portmanteau\" title=\"wikipedia:portmanteau\">portmanteau</a> to create it. For instance the usage of Jerkop and noviophobia, jerkop sounding juvenile and slanderous, whereas noviophobia, a mix of boyfriend in Spanish (novio) and fear in Greek (phobos), is meant to validate Chris's fear of the infinitely high boyfriend factor. \n</p><p>Another form of Cwc-ism is that of an uncommon and completely original <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/euphemism\" title=\"wikipedia:euphemism\">euphemism</a>, such as duck or china. Chris's somewhat irrational fear of using the words that these cwc-isms replace is somewhat unusual at his age, but can be conducive to the sheltered type of parenting Chris has received. People with high functioning autism and Aspergers tend not to be able to understand idioms as easily as neuro-typical people (this is not dependant on IQ, either),<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup> so it is very interesting and unique to see how often Chris uses them.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Writing\">Writing</span></h3>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_writing\" title=\"Chris and writing\">Chris and writing</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>In all languages, Chris's writing suffers from a lack of vocabulary, and using long words to attempt to sound intelligent, but often using them incorrectly, having the opposite effect.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup> His unnecessary detailing and staggered flow can make reading his literary works cumbersome.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Penmanship_and_font_choices\">Penmanship and font choices</span></h4>\n<p>In contrast to the formless nature of his artwork, Chris has halfway-decent penmanship. Still, he often writes the wrong letter and ends up having to either scribble over it or \"fudge\" it into another letter. \n</p><p>This has caused him to replace the handwriting in the comic with Comic Sans lettering in order to make it more legible. While this font is legible and popular, it is often condemned as childish, cliche, unprofessional, and ugly, and most graphic designers only use it as a last resort when a better handwritten font isn't available (or can't be installed). Since issue 12-9, he has switched to Proxima Nova.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Oration\">Oration</span></h3>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_oratory\" title=\"Chris and oratory\">Chris and oratory</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>In all languages, Chris has a lack of vocabulary knowledge, and a stutter, that cause it to be rather difficult to understand him oftentimes. His body language sometimes says a completely different thing than what he is actually saying, making the communication lose its potency instead of assisting it.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup> His rhetoric is often very lacklustre, featuring very few solid arguments, and very many logical fallacies. Some examples of these issues include:\n</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_oratory#Threats\" title=\"Chris and oratory\">Threats</a> (including the occasional death threat)</li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_oratory#Bias_and_one-sided_arguments\" title=\"Chris and oratory\">Bias and one-sided arguments</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_oratory#Ad_Hominems\" title=\"Chris and oratory\"> Ad hominems</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_oratory#Strawman_arguments\" title=\"Chris and oratory\">Strawman arguments</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_oratory#Moving_the_goalposts\" title=\"Chris and oratory\">Moving the goalposts</a></li></ul>\n<p>All of these things usually make Chris's speeches very alienating, polarising and unconvincing, they also indicate a level of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Narcissism\" title=\"Narcissism\">narcissism</a> that is present in some of his works, and that leads to him being somewhat unlikable, which really damages his chances of being a powerful speaker.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"English\">English</span></h2>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_English\" title=\"Chris and English\">Chris and English</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>English is the most widely spoken language on Earth and Chris living in the USA should have been a master at it. Sadly, Chris's grasp on English is tenuous at best. His communication skills have suffered from a lack of vocabulary and heavy speech impediments including stuttering. Whilst singing and muttering prove as large obstacles to understanding Chris's speech, that's the least of the problems when it comes to Chris's communication skills.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Writing_2\">Writing</span></h3>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_writing\" title=\"Chris and writing\">Chris and writing</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>His writing is riddled with wrong spellings, bad grammar, unnecessarily capitalised words, wrong syntaxes and non-existant words. He also sometimes reverses words, to exemplify some kind of significance, such as Pmurt, which is just Trump backwards, because he didn't like the United States President at the time.\n</p><p>His fondness of big words and semicolons despite his childlike writing style causes some of his writings to be very difficult to understand. He also has a poor concept of flow in his writing, often over-detailing things that lack significance, leading one to lose their place in the story; Even in action sequences, Chris will sometimes explain something in excruciating detail, even though brevity and verbs are essential to keep the flow of the action going. \n</p><p>He also has problems with foreshadowing, as he can often foreshadow things which are irrelevant to the plot, or never following up, missing the point of the writing device in the first place. This causes his literary works such as the Sonichu comics to be very difficult to follow. Chris also has difficulty implementing exposition, often exposing unnecessary details and doing so in a very unsubtle manner.\n</p><p>His difficulty interacting with <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Reality\" title=\"Reality\">reality</a> also causes Chris to conclude that his characters are real, making it ethical for them to never experience any difficulty or hardship, not realising that this can produce boring and tedious plots, with absolutely no conflict whatsoever.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Speaking\">Speaking</span></h3>\n<dl><dd><i>Main articles: <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_oratory\" title=\"Chris and oratory\">Chris and oratory</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Speech_impediment\" title=\"Speech impediment\">Speech impediment</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>Unfortunately, Chris usually has a hard time speaking, whether it's due to his nervousness or a speech impediment, it all stems from his <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">autism</a>. However, he also has inherited some regional dialect, such as the use of 'em and y'all, and omits the letter \"t\" when it is too much effort to pronounce, a common trait of American English. \n</p><p>The other problems have may originate from high-frequency hearing loss that Chris experienced as a young child, or perhaps he simply has <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluttering\" title=\"wikipedia:Cluttering\">tachyphemia</a>, which seems to explain a lot of the symptoms.\n</p><p>The main problems Chris has outside of dialect are:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Frequent sighing and ums and uhs.</li>\n<li>Stuttering.</li>\n<li>Speaking too quickly and slurring words, this behaviour is characteristic of children.</li>\n<li>Occasional <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spoonerism\" title=\"wikipedia:spoonerism\">spoonerism</a>.</li>\n<li>Trouble pronouncing post-vocalic Ls, resulting in examples such as medal being pronounced \"meadow\".</li>\n<li>Trouble pronouncing the letter \"X\" (/ks/ or /gz/), as well as related consonantal digraphs (/sk/, /st/), pronouncing it either as an \"/s/\" sound (elision) or as a \"/t͡s/\" sound (fronting).

Chris probably began the course because of his <a href=\"/cwcki/Messiah_complex\" title=\"Messiah complex\">Messiah complex</a> but quickly burned out when it proved too difficult.\n</p><p>The Hebrew taught in Duolingo is <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Hebrew\" title=\"wikipedia:Modern Hebrew\">Modern Israeli Hebrew</a>, not the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_Hebrew\" title=\"wikipedia:Biblical Hebrew\">Biblical Hebrew</a> of the Bible.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Swedish\">Swedish</span></h3>\n<p>It is generous to say that Chris has a very poor grasp of Swedish. He has no idea how to pronounce Swedish YouTuber <a href=\"/cwcki/PewDiePie\" title=\"PewDiePie\">PewDiePie</a>'s last name (Kjellberg), saying \"Kuh-zhellberg\", \"Kilj-berg\", and \"Kill-berg\", instead of the correct pronunciation, which can be approximated in English as \"Shell-berg\".<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-13\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">[13]</a></sup>\n</p><p>In <a href=\"/cwcki/January_2018\" title=\"January 2018\">January 2018</a>, while under the control of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys</a>, Chris wrote \"Hej kiwi lantgård.

As no such language exists, he instead spoke in gibberish.
