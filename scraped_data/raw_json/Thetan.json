He was just this awkward, slightly-odd, shy kid back then. A lot of the Special Ed kids got picked on but, for some reason, Christian seemed to get it much worse than the others. _____ and _____ I let Christian hang out with us mainly because we felt sorry for him. He sort of latched onto us, like he expected us to protect him. He was like a lost little boy. Sometimes I think he saw us as sort of mother figures, which seems <a href=\"/cwcki/Affair_with_Mother\" title=\"Affair with Mother\">a little creepy now</a>, but Christian seemed harmless enough back then, and we didn't mind him hanging out with us. As far as socializing goes, we didn't really hang with him outside of school, except for the time we went to his 18th birthday party.\n<p>_____ and _____ weren't so much friends of Christian's, as they were his protectors. Some kids used to mess with him and steal his stuff. These kids were constantly teasing Christian and picking on him, doing whatever they could to get some kind of reaction out of him. Mostly Christian just cried or ran away. I don't think I can remember a time where he tried to stand up to the bullies. He seemed to prefer to have other people do that for him.\n</p><p>No, I don't really follow Christian's activity on Facebook. I'm actually not on his friends list, for reasons I'd rather not discuss with someone I don't really know that well (no offense). I know a lot of the people that are on his friends list, and they mostly ignore him. He's basically background noise. The only time they really notice his posts is when he tags them. Some of the stuff he posts is kind of bizarre and disturbing, which is the main reason why I decided I didn't want to have any contact with him.\n</p><p>I'm also really creeped out that he's still obsessed with _____ and he's actively looking for her. She is well aware of this and she's taken steps to make sure that she's VERY hard, if not impossible, to find. Yes, I've been in touch with her, but I don't feel that I have her permission to pass along her contact information. I'll pass along your email address though, if that's OK. That way, she can contact you if she wants to.\n</p><p>A lot of people became friends with Christian because of the reunion and also, because a lot of them still felt sorry for him. Some people are having second thoughts though, after seeing that awful picture he drew of his friend. A lot of people stopped feeling sorry for him and started ignoring him after they saw that. I was shocked that he could draw something so gross and depraved. The \"thumbs up\" sign really pissed me off for some reason. The whole thing was very sexist, disrespectful, and, above all - damn creepy.\n</p><p>I have my suspicions about who may have leaked Christian's Facebook posts, but I'd rather not say, because I don't want to be involved in this. Christian accused this person of \"leaking\" the full list of classmates from our graduating class. Christian contacted some of his MHS friends and tried to make trouble. He told them to give this guy a hard time for what he did. His friends weren't amused. Anyway, I don't think Christian has anything to worry about.

Rebeckah acts more kindly to Chris than Thetan's other personas, giving him advice on relationships and life in general, which he would respond to with anger and sadness, due to his mental state at the time.

And just what exactly does he think Ashley or Brandi could do to change our minds (as if they'd get involved with this nonsense in the first place). This would almost be funny if it weren't so pathetic.\n<p>Also, the fact that Christian thinks that anyone can somehow force Tiffany and I to be friends with him clearly shows that he has no respect for our right to choose our own friends. Despite what Christian may think, nobody wants friends forced on them. (The arrangement that Tiffany and I made in high school was a unique circumstance. We willingly chose to enter into the agreement.) This is yet another reason why so many people have a problem with him. Christian isn't entitled to friends - nobody is. Friendship is something you have to work at. Christian isn't willing to put even the minimal effort into this. He doesn't want friends, he wants people to kiss his ass.\n</p><p>Christian's idea of a friend is someone who will always be there to coddle him feed his ego in order to make him feel better about himself. Based on his remarks about Brandi and Ashley, it's also quite obvious that Christian sees his \"friends\" as some sort of personal army. Honestly Rebeckah, do you blame Tiffany and I for not wanting anything to do with Christian? Do you really want a \"friend\" like that?\n</p><p>I'm really puzzled as to why Christian wants us to be friends with Tiffany and I again after he found out that our high school friendship was arranged. He ranted about it on Facebook, and it was obvious that he was very angry and upset. He even tried to paint me as some kind of villain, and claimed that I'd shattered his heart, ruined his life, blah... blah.... blah... Does Chris somehow expect Ashley and Brandi to arrange another pity friendship and, if so, just what kind of benefit does he expect to gain from it?\n</p><p>If I were you Rebeckah, I'd seriously reconsider having anything to do with Christian.
