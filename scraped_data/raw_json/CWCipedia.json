This led into Chris describing his supposed gym at length, what Pokémon he had in his team, and his collection of Pokémon in the game (in addition to their level and how he had leveled them). This somehow led to an idea for a <i>Pokémon</i> game system that was basically just the \"Solid Vision\" holographic projector system from <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Yu-Gi-Oh!\" title=\"Yu-Gi-Oh!\">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></i>, except with Pokémon. After all of that tangential nonsense, he got back to talking about Sonichu again.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"CWCipedia_advertisements\">CWCipedia advertisements</span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:102px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Untitled.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"262\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/a/a1/Untitled.png/100px-Untitled.png\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/a/a1/Untitled.png/150px-Untitled.png 1.5x, /w/images/a/a1/Untitled.png 2x\" width=\"100\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Untitled.png\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Ensuring that Chris sees them EVERY TIME he visits.</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:NewCWCipediaFrontpage.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"281\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/d/d0/NewCWCipediaFrontpage.jpg/300px-NewCWCipediaFrontpage.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/d/d0/NewCWCipediaFrontpage.jpg/450px-NewCWCipediaFrontpage.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/d/d0/NewCWCipediaFrontpage.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:NewCWCipediaFrontpage.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Chris's revised frontpage.</div></div></div>\n<p>As 2009 came to a close, CWCipedia's operators ran into financial trouble keeping the site in the black, given the many hits it received on a daily basis and the profusion of large files that were held on its servers. To help keep the site up and running for its <a href=\"/cwcki/True_and_Loyal_Fanbase\" title=\"True and Loyal Fanbase\">True and Loyal Fanbase</a>, the Sysop that maintained the website for Chris turned to selling advertising space on the site. Due to the somewhat complicated laws of the jurisdiction in which the servers resided, ads could only be purchased from within the European Union. Chris made no money from advertisement revenue; all of it went towards keeping the CWCipedia up and running. \n</p><p>These ads were all randomly generated by metadata from Chris and the people browsing the site, not special hand-crafted ads made by <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">trolls</a>, but because of the occasional troll with gay porn in their cookies the odd homoerotic ad appeared, and Chris was not pleased. Chris responded to these ads with a few complaints to the admin and <a href=\"/cwcki/Jack_Thaddeus\" title=\"Jack Thaddeus\">Jack Thaddeus</a>, who was the only donor who delivered over €1,000 (then US$1,482), qualifying him to create <b>custom</b> advertisements on the site. <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_Blog#7_December_2009\" title=\"CWC Blog\">In a blog post</a>, Chris hoped that <i>someone</i> within the EU would be able to step up and donate so much money that they'd not only qualify for custom ads, as Jack had, but help to <i>remove</i> the <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">homoerotic</a> ads that appeared on the site (even though most online advertisers give <i>no</i> such heavy-handed preferential treatment to premium advertisers, and indeed, no such stated policy existed with CWCipedia either). Shockingly, none of his European fans felt like donating thousands of Euros so that Chris didn't have to occasionally glimpse a <a href=\"/cwcki/Brassieres_For_Males\" title=\"Brassieres For Males\">shirtless man</a>.\n</p><p>On 27 December 2009, the ad space, previously at the very bottom of CWCipedia's navbar on the left side of the page, was moved to the very top of the navbar. Another ad appeared on Chris's main page beside the logo. On 28 December, Chris flipped out and replaced it with an ad for his beloved <a href=\"/cwcki/My_Coke_Rewards\" title=\"My Coke Rewards\">My Coke Rewards</a> program. The sysop reverted it and reprimanded Chris, informing him that he (Chris) had no control over the ad placement.\n</p><p>On 30 December 2009, Chris, unable to change the now-protected main page, lashed out the only way he could, by adding a block of text to the bottom of his (already hideously ugly and cluttered) front page image, declaring that no ads were allowed on that page. Furthermore, it said that he would not remove this block of text until the offending ads were removed from the main page. In other words, Chris defaced <i>his own website</i> in an attempt to get <i>someone else</i> to stop advertising on it. This, obviously, did not work.\n</p><p>On 2 January 2010, Chris began cluttering the website with his ads again, shilling for <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_Cola\" title=\"CWC Cola\">Coca-Cola</a>, <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Wild_Sonichu\" title=\"Wild Sonichu\">Avatar</a></i>, and <a href=\"/cwcki/It%27s_UGH!\" title=\"It's UGH!\">Proposition 8</a>.

In desperation, Chris began placing ads of his own that didn't inspire uncomfortable questions about his sexuality. Again, the Sysop ordered Chris to cease his insubordination.\n</p><p>On 2 January 2010, the CWCipedia was served a cease and desist notice by the Coca-Cola Company for its unauthorized use of their logo on the site. Thus, the Sysop was forced to close the website for a few days until the matter could be resolved. Having gotten a little first-hand lesson regarding what <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_copyright\" title=\"Chris and copyright\">copyright law</a> is all about, Chris issued an <a href=\"/cwcki/This_was_my_fault\" title=\"This was my fault\">apology</a> on YouTube. In the video, he claimed that he thought Coke would appreciate the free advertisement, naturally unaware that Coke probably don't want their products advertised on a quasi-literate homophobe's shrine to his own Sonic recolors.\n</p><p>Within a few days, all depictions of the logo were removed and the site was up and running.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Closed_.28again.29_due_to_theft\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Closed_(again)_due_to_theft\">Closed (again) due to theft</span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Cwcipedia_closed_again.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"125\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/7/74/Cwcipedia_closed_again.jpg/300px-Cwcipedia_closed_again.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/7/74/Cwcipedia_closed_again.jpg/450px-Cwcipedia_closed_again.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/7/74/Cwcipedia_closed_again.jpg/600px-Cwcipedia_closed_again.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Cwcipedia_closed_again.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>The CWCipedia's source page as of 2/6/10.</div></div></div>\n<p>In the early morning of 6 February 2010, the CWCipedia was closed down again, this time thanks to a <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act\" title=\"wikipedia:Digital Millennium Copyright Act\">DMCA</a> request from representatives of <a href=\"/cwcki/Evan\" title=\"Evan\">Evan George</a>. According to the request, Chris's use of the character <a href=\"/cwcki/Simonla_Rosechu\" title=\"Simonla Rosechu\">Simonla Rosechu</a> on his website and in his comics infringed upon Evan's intellectual property, as Simonla was clearly derivative of Evan's character <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Simonchu\" title=\"Simonchu\">Simonchu</a>. This was most likely triggered by Chris's announcement, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/5_February_2010\" title=\"5 February 2010\">in a video from 5 February</a>, that he agreed to do away with Simonla and stop featuring her in his comics, but only at an unspecified \"later\" time.\n</p><p>Three days after the CWCipedia was locked to edits, it was wiped from the Internet entirely. In its place appeared a redirect link to Asperpedia; however, due to a bug, it redirected to an online role-playing game, <i>Dogs of the Seas</i>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"CWCipedia_lives_on\">CWCipedia lives on</span></h3>\n<p>On 12 February 2010, the CWCipedia was revived to a certain extent. Although it was still locked to edits and only a \"login required\" screen was accessible, it was functional enough for Alec Benson Leary to display the first two pages of <a href=\"/cwcki/Asperchu#Sonichu_Revolution\" title=\"Asperchu\"><i>Sonichu Revolution</i></a>. The next day, Chris fulfilled <a href=\"/cwcki/Evan\" title=\"Evan\">Evan</a>'s request and the CWCipedia was restored for all people to see. <i>Sonichu Revolution</i> continued onward from there, prominently featured at the top of every page of the CWCipedia.\n</p><p>On 24 February 2010, a new set of ads appeared on the CWCipedia, calling Chris out on his <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Love_Day_(video)\" title=\"Christian Love Day (video)\">unwarranted self-importance</a> on his birthday, with a message from Sean imploring fans to give gifts to victims in Haiti instead. For a few days after this, visitors were treated to the sight of a series of animated ads featuring gigantic ejaculating cocks, revenge from Jack Thaddeus in response to Chris's execution of the Asperpedia Four at the end of <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_10\" title=\"Sonichu 10\"><i>Sonichu</i> #10</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Closed_due_to_parody\">Closed due to parody</span></h3>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">Also, you might want to take a look at your site before you go around advertising it...

He neglected updating the Mailbag and stopped uploading new comic pages. His only additions to the site in the first three weeks of March were a series of rants directed at trolls and his fans, where he accused them of breaking up his pursuit of <a href=\"/cwcki/The_Wallflower\" title=\"The Wallflower\">The Wallflower</a> and complained that the demand for new <i>Sonichu</i> comics was ruining his life.\n</p><p>On 18 March 2010, CWCipedia was taken down and replaced with a redirect to a <a href=\"/cwcki/Parody\" title=\"Parody\">parody</a> version of the website run by <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Mao\" title=\"Mao\">Mao</a>. The Sysop had decided to allow Mao to buy a permanent redirect for $100. Since Chris was the Captain, he decided to sail the S.S. <i>CWCipedia</i> into an iceberg and let it sink, making Jack pull all his funding and forcing the Sysop to shut the site down for good.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"CWCipedia_opened_for_everybody\">CWCipedia opened for everybody</span></h3>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia_vandalism\" title=\"CWCipedia vandalism\">CWCipedia vandalism</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">STOP THIS!!!

At the same time, Mao was given sysop, bureaucrat, and oversight powers on the site, suggesting the arrival of a new \"captain\" on deck. The result was much good vandalism, most notably on the main page itself, by \"Kine\", \"SEANBOTMK2\", \"ALECBOTMK2\", \"EVANBOTMK2\", and \"Metal Asperchu\". Soon, account creation was enabled for all and the website was vandalised beyond recognition in a glorious blizzard of <a href=\"/cwcki/Pickle\" title=\"Pickle\">pickles</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/DIRTY,_CRAPPED_BRIEFS\" title=\"DIRTY, CRAPPED BRIEFS\">unflattering internal links</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"CWCipedia_death_and_resurrection\">CWCipedia death and resurrection</span></h3>\n<p>Early on 22 March, the Sysop returned to the site after being busy on other projects and quickly reversed everything back to the pre-Mao state of the site. However, much of the vandalism continued to remain in the history of many of the pages, and several pages were not changed back, either due to her skipping over them or simply not caring.\n</p><p>During the early hours of 31 March, the front page of the CWCipedia <a href=\"/cwcki/Patti_Chandler\" title=\"Patti Chandler\">decomposed</a> into HTML code.

Two days later, Chris discovered the vandalism and replaced all of the images with a disclaimer that work on <i>Sonichu</i> #11 was ongoing. He then called out on the Sysop's \"traitorous mutiny\", but was willing to forgive her, probably by virtue of <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_gender\" title=\"Chris and gender\">her gender</a>.
