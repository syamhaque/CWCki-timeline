Highlights of this chat are <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris\" title=\"Chris\">Chris</a> recollecting a story about getting punched in the face by a <a href=\"/cwcki/Niggos\" title=\"Niggos\">niggo</a> and crying on the way home on the school bus, then discussing <a href=\"/cwcki/DIRTY,_CRAPPED_BRIEFS\" title=\"DIRTY, CRAPPED BRIEFS\">DIRTY, CRAPPED BRIEFS</a>, and proceeding to actually shit himself during the conversation. He thinks that it signifies a <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_religion\" title=\"Chris and religion\">psychic link</a> between him and <a href=\"/cwcki/Jackie\" title=\"Jackie\">Jackie</a>. Unsurprisingly, Chris believes soiling himself to be a romantic gesture of <a href=\"/cwcki/Love_Quest\" title=\"Love Quest\">love</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Summary\">Summary</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Chris is terrible with <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Computer\" title=\"Computer\">computer</a> care, turning his computer on and off for hours before it's in working order.</li>\n<li>Jackie grills Chris about his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/List_of_Chris%27s_games\" title=\"List of Chris's games\">library of games</a>. Unsurprisingly, he hasn't played many of them, yet won't part with them no matter what.</li>\n<li>Chris and Jackie have a long conversation about <a href=\"/cwcki/EBay\" title=\"EBay\">eBay</a> and Craigslist. Chris refuses to budge on selling details, much to Jackie's chagrin.</li>\n<li>The two speak about bullying. According to Chris, his experience with <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">bullies</a> amounts to people saying \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonic\" title=\"Sonic\">Sonic</a>'s dead\", getting coins thrown at him for him to pick up, and getting slapped on his butt a few times.</li>\n<li>Chris goes into detail about the incident that led to him being moved to the <a href=\"/cwcki/Slow-in-the-minds\" title=\"Slow-in-the-minds\">short bus</a>. He and a fellow <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Black\" title=\"Black\">black</a> student frequently competed to be the first one off the school bus, and one day, Chris got punched by him on the way out. (He says his glasses got broken and he didn't punch back, though in other accounts, his glasses didn't break,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup> and he did try fighting back.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup>)</li>\n<li>Chris describes his traumatic time on the short bus, saying one of the disabled kids would frequently hit him on the back of his head.</li>\n<li>Jackie spoke with <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/God\" title=\"God\">God</a> last night, revealing God never spoke to Chris at all about the <a href=\"/cwcki/Monthly_tugboat\" title=\"Monthly tugboat\">monthly tugboat</a>.</li>\n<li>As the conversation switches to jobs, Chris makes excuses blaming his shitty computer for him not being able to go get one. Chris stubbornly remains jobless.</li>\n<li>Jackie asks Chris about his DIRTY, CRAPPED BRIEFS. Chris, in all his <a href=\"/cwcki/Honest_Content\" title=\"Honest Content\">honesty</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ego#Surrendering_Information\" title=\"Ego\">goes at length about the subject</a>, revealing to her that he has a <i>psychic connection</i> regarding his shit. Chris apparently crapped himself when it was brought up in conversation.</li>\n<li>Chris leaves the chat to clean himself up; the conversation ends on a creepy note.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_chat_with_Jackie\">The chat with Jackie</span></h2>\n<p><font color=\"#0033FF\">[7:20 pm] <b>CWC:</b></font>\nHey-Hey. :) h<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\">[7:20 pm] <b>CWC:</b></font>\nCWC (ChrisChanSonichu) is offline 7:20 pm<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\">[7:20 pm] <b>CWC:</b></font>\nIMs are delivered when the buddy signs in.
