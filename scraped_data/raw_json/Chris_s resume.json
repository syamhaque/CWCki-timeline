href=\"/cwcki/Slow-in-the-minds\" title=\"Slow-in-the-minds\">no discernible skills</a> and extremely limited work experience, the résumé is less than impressive. No fewer than three times, Chris pads his résumé by claiming his \"volunteer work\" for Pokémon league events at <a href=\"/cwcki/The_GAMe_PLACe\" title=\"The GAMe PLACe\">The GAMe PLACe</a> and other locations as actual work experience (when in reality he had no authority, and in fact was himself closely monitored by the actual employees).\n</p><p>Chris's résumé includes a few points where he talks about his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_the_industry\" title=\"Chris and the industry\">desire to work for a comics publisher</a>, such as DC or Archie. However, it's unlikely that Chris has sent any work or a résumé to either company, likely simply uploading it to Monster and waiting for others to contact him (not unlike his <a href=\"/cwcki/Attraction_Sign\" title=\"Attraction Sign\">Attraction Sign</a>). He is seemingly unaware or unwilling to accept that the industry standard for a professional graphic designer (working for DC or Archie) is not only a well-organized portfolio demonstrating samples of his work but also a bachelor's degree in Graphic Design and demonstrated proficiency in accepted design software such as the Adobe Creative Suite. Non-art work experience is rarely considered unless it is mentioned as an essential part of the job description.\n</p><p>His cover letter can be described as a Sonichu-driven ego rub. Even at a quick glance, one can see that three entire paragraphs are dedicated towards describing Sonichu and Rosechu and how they've made him \"internet famous,\" instead of what it should be about <i>(reasons why it would be a good idea to hire him.)</i> In typical Chris-Chan fashion, he seems to think that he's in complete control of what <i>(Sonichu-related)</i> responsibilities he should be given in the organization, and makes a serious no-no by mentioning that the job should have \"good pay,\" which is usually a turn-off to serious employers.\n</p><p>His \"quick construction skills from scratch\" (especially considering that he's referring to constructing decks in a children's card game) would mean nothing in interviewing for the very job he seeks to obtain. Indeed, it would be of no interest to any potential employer, for that matter. Furthermore, according to two people who actually had a chance to play card games with Chris, his deck construction skills <a href=\"/cwcki/Mimms_and_Lucas_Q%26A#Follow-up\" title=\"Mimms and Lucas Q&amp;A\">are severely lacking</a>.\n</p><p>The resume also has a number of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/CWCism\" title=\"CWCism\">CWC-style butcheries of well known idioms</a>, such as the particularly grating phrase \"Elbow-greased strength,\" which only serve to make it more nonsensical.\n</p><p>Furthermore, while the field for \"job objectives\" offers three lines for a succinct answer, Chris, typical of his <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia\" title=\"CWCipedia\">rambling style</a>, attaches three extra <i>pages</i> of useless junk, thus ensuring that any potential employer will not make any efforts to read the entire résumé.\n</p><p>Also included is a hand-written \"Resume Writing Worksheet,\" a presumably earlier draft with slightly different wording and a greater emphasis on the dang, dirty trolls. As is the nature of resumes, this material is rather repetitive.\n</p>\n<h1><span id=\"Chris.27s_cover_letter\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris's_cover_letter\">Chris's cover letter</span></h1>\n<p>8/16/2009\n</p><p>Dear Hiring Manager:\n</p><p>I, Christian Weston Chandler, Birth name: Christopher, born on February 24, 1982 in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Charlottesville\" title=\"Charlottesville\">Charlottesville</a>, Virginia, am an artist with vast experiences in multiple art classes with multiple media throughout my whole lifetime from <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris%27s_education#Greene_County_Primary_School\" title=\"Chris's education\">Green County Primary School</a> to <a href=\"/cwcki/Piedmont_Virginia_Community_College\" title=\"Piedmont Virginia Community College\">Piedmont Virginia Community Collge</a>, with a diploma from <a href=\"/cwcki/Manchester_High_School\" title=\"Manchester High School\">Manchester High School</a> and a degree and certificate in Computer Aided Drafting and Design (<a href=\"/cwcki/CADD\" title=\"CADD\">CADD</a>) from PVCC.\n</p><p>Since the inspiration and conception of Sonichu, the Electric-Hedgehog Pokemon on March 17, 2000, I have grown further in his stories, plots and adventures in a series of hand-drawn and computer-edited comic books. I also have had and passed two HTML classes, and created from notepad scratch, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/CWC%27s_PokeSite_2!\" title=\"CWC's PokeSite 2!\">CWC's PokeSite 2!</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC%27s_Pok%C3%A9site_2#Now_in_Spanish\" title=\"CWC's Pokésite 2\">El PokeSite de R.W.C.</a> (Ricardo Weston Chandler was my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Spanish\" title=\"Spanish\">Spanish</a> nickname given to me during my two years of Spanish in Manchester High), and most importantly, the First and Original website dedicated to Sonichu, Rosechu and their adventures, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/CWC%27s_Sonichu_Site\" title=\"CWC's Sonichu Site\">CWC's Sonichu Site</a>.\n</p><p>I was also noted twice later in the periodicals of Nintendo Power magazine and PVCC's The Forum for being the original creator of Sonichu and all. (See Periodical References below).\n</p><p>With the Sonichu Stie originally located at http://sonichuchandler.tripod.com/cwcson.htm, it stayed online from about 2000 until early 2009, whereas my Sonichu and Rosechu fanbase has grown massively over the years; there were also internet bullies and trolls. And the trolls hacked into and compromised my original Tripod webhosting account. I've had to pull the plug on the Tripod account and move on to another webhosting site. The second webhosting account suffered the same fate as the first, and then I moved to GoDaddy. It got hacked too, and so I pulled the plug on all my websites late May, 2009. I stayed off for about two months, then a gal-pal of mine about that time set up for me a start of what is now the New Original CWC's Sonichu and Rosechu Site; the wikipedia-styled <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Cwcipedia\" title=\"Cwcipedia\">Cwcipedia</a> at http://cogsdev.110mb.com/cwcipedia/index.php/Main_Page. As I have done on the previous site, I have re-uploaded my Sonichu comic pages, and I am steadily expanding further with more stories and character bio pages.\n</p><p>I would like to be paper-published with a comic book company like Archie, Marvel, DC or Dark Horse comics, complete with Official Sonichu and Rosechu Merchandise I can personally sign-off on to follow for my Worldwide Fanbase.\n</p><p>Accept no imposturous substitutes who claim to be me or have any rights on my Sonichu and Rosechu stuff; I stand strong with my continued use of the Copyright © symbol on each of all my books and original singular art pieces and the date of creation of March 17, 2000. I have eye-witnesses at Manchester High of Sonichu's conception and creation on that date. It also bothers me that the trolls are even selling bootleg copies of my Life DVD, <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler...Yep,_I%27m_on_TV_:)\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler...Yep, I'm on TV :)\">Christian Weston Chandler. Yep...I'm On T.V.</a>, which was originally intent solely for family and close friend distribution. Trust one of the trolls to snag a copy and rip the vieos from the six-hour DVD-R.\n</p><p>I became famous without having to leave my house or go out-of-state or city.\n</p><p>After recent realization, on about July 17, 2009, of what I want to do, I wish to make it all official; get me paper-published with a comic book company like Archie, Marvel, DC or Dark Horse comics, with continuing work as a comic book artist and story creator/editor, good pay, eventual official Sonichu and Rosechu merchandise that I can personally and officially sign-off on and further enforce my nine-year-old copyright with a more peaceful future.\n</p><p>I feel that my Sonichu and Rosechu and self adventure stories would be an asset for the Comic Book, and all associated, industries.\n</p><p>Thank you for your time and consideration. I hope to have the opportunity to discuss the opening with you in person.\n</p><p>Sincerely\n</p><p><br/>\nChristian Weston Chandler\n</p><p><br/>\nPeriodical References\n</p><p><i>Nintendo Power</i>, Volume 179, May, 2004, Page 89: \"Sonichu's Cwcville Documentary\"\n</p><p><i>Piedmont Virginia Community College's The Forum</i>, Volume 1, No. 13, April 26, 2004: \"Meet Sonichu: Student Featured in Nintendo Power,\" By Kari Mitchell, The Forum Assistant Editor.\n</p>\n<h1><span id=\"The_r.C3.A9sum.C3.A9\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_résumé\">The résumé</span></h1>\n<p>The following is Chris's complete résumé, as it was posted on the popular résumé website <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster.com\" title=\"wikipedia:Monster.com\">Monster.com</a>, with only minor edits for wiki styling.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Contact_Info\">Contact Info</span></h2>\n<p>\"<a href=\"/cwcki/Christopher%27s_name_change\" title=\"Christopher's name change\">Christopher</a>\" <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler\">Christian Weston Chandler</a><br/>\n<a href=\"/cwcki/14_Branchland_Court\" title=\"14 Branchland Court\">14 Branchland Ct.</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Ruckersville,_VA\" title=\"Ruckersville, VA\">Ruckersville, VA</a> 22968-9545<br/>\nHome: 434-990-0198\nCell: 434-760-0848<br/>\n<a href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia\" title=\"CWCipedia\">Cwcipedia</a>/CWC’s Sonichu and Rosechu Site!<br/>\n[http://cogsdev.110mb.com/cwcipedia/index.php/Main_Page http://cogsdev.110mb.com/cwcipedia/index.php/Main_Page]\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Objectives\">Objectives</span></h2>\n<p>I wish to make my <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu\" title=\"Rosechu\">Rosechu</a> franchise Official, with getting me paper published at <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie_Comics\" title=\"wikipedia:Archie Comics\">Archie</a>, <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics\" title=\"wikipedia:Marvel Comics\">Marvel</a>, <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Comics\" title=\"wikipedia:DC Comics\">DC</a> or <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Horse_Comics\" title=\"wikipedia:Dark Horse Comics\">Dark Horse Comics</a>, with continuing work as Comic Book Artist and Story Creator/Editor, good pay, eventual Official Sonichu and Rosechu Merchandise that I, personally, can officially sign-off on and further enforce my nine-year-old copyright with a more peaceful future.

And the trolls hacked into and compromised my original Tripod webhosting account. I’ve had to pull the plug on the Tripod account and move on to another webhosting site. The second webhosting account suffered the same fate as the first, and then I moved to GoDaddy. It got hacked too, and so I pulled the plug on all my websites late May, 2009. I stayed off for about two months, then a gal-pal of mine about that time set up for me a start of what is now the New Original CWC’s Sonichu and Rosechu Site; the wikipedia-styled <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Cwcipedia\" title=\"Cwcipedia\">Cwcipedia</a> at http://cogsdev.110mb.com/cwcipedia/index.php/Main_Page. As I have done on the previous site, I have re-uploaded my Sonichu comic pages, and I am steadily expanding further with more stories and character bio pages.\n</p><p>I would like to be paper-published with a comic book company like Archie, Marvel, DC or Dark Horse comics, complete with Official Sonichu and Rosechu Merchandise I can personally sign-off on to follow for my Worldwide <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Fanbase\" title=\"Fanbase\">Fanbase</a>.\n</p><p>Accept no imposturous substitutes who claim to be me or have any rights on my Sonichu and Rosechu stuff; I stand strong with my continued use of the Copyright © symbol on each of all my books and original singular art pieces and the date of creation of March 17, 2000. I have eye-witnesses at Manchester High of Sonichu’s conception and creation on that date. It also bothers me that the trolls are even selling bootleg copies of my Life DVD, <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler...Yep,_I%27m_on_TV_:)\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler...Yep, I'm on TV :)\">Christian Weston Chandler. Yep…I’m On T.V.</a>, which was originally intent solely for family and close friend distribution.

Since March 17, 2000, I have started inspiration with my Electric-Hedgehog Pokemon creations, <i>Sonichu &amp; Rosechu</i>, and grew further in their life's Stories and Plots in a series of Hand-Drawn and Computer-Edited Comic Books. I also have had and passed Two HTML classes, and created from Notepad Scratch CWC's PokeSite 2, El PokeSite De R.W.C. (Ricardo Weston Chandler; my Spanish Nickname from my taking of Two Years of Spanish at Manchester High), and more importantly, THE Original and First Sonichu Site, CWC's Sonichu Site @ http://sonichuchandler.tripod.com/cwcson.htm. Sadly, after years had passed, in early 2009, my webhosting account was compromised by Hackers + Internet Trolls/Bullies. I've had to go from webhost to webhost Twice to keep my Original Sites Up. Sadly, the Trolls got into them as well. I had pulled the plug and keep my sites offline for Two Months. <s>And recently</s> from Late May, 2009 at GoDaddy.com. And Now, a close real-life friend of mine put together for me the start of what is NOW My Official Sonichu Site, A.K.A., Cwcipedia. As with my past on CWC's Sonichu Site, I have reuploaded my Sonichu Comic Pages and started further expanding in Stories + Bio Pages.\n</p><p>I would like to be Paper-Published with a Comic Book Company like Archie<s>s</s>, Marvel, DC or Darkhorse, complete with Official Merchandise to follow for my Worldwide Fanbase.\n</p><p>Unfortunately, I have heard of impostors trying to claim my Sonichu &amp; Rosechu Franchise (is a good word I think), but I Stand Strong with my continued Legal Use of the copyright © symbol, and the Date of March 17, 2000. I have eye-witnesses at M.H.S. of Sonichu's conception and creation on That Day. And even worse, making money selling Fake Merchandise and Bootleg copies of my Life to 25-YEAR-OLD D.V.D, \"Christian Weston Chandler...Yep...I'm on T.V.,\" which was Originally distributed solely to Family and Close Friends. Trust the Trolls to pose as my Primary School Girlfriend Crush and con a copy out of me late 2008.\n</p><p>I became famous, and I never had to leave my house or go out-of-state or city.\n</p><p>Anyway, I want to MAKE IT ALL OFFICIAL, get me Paper-Published with continuing work, a good, reasonable amount of money, <s>and mak</s> further Enforce my Nine-YEAR-OLD Copyright, and make my future more peaceful.
