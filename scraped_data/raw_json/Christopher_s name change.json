The Leonard Bearstein Symphony Orchestra is still in operation to this day, albeit running shows in only in Kannapolis, North Carolina during its annual Celebration of Lights festival as of 2022, with prior shows in Virginia and elsewhere during the Christmas season. The Leonard character is designed to be fully interactive and engage in conversations with the audience via a human operator behind the scenes.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup> During a shopping trip to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Richmond\" title=\"Richmond\">Richmond</a> in late 1992, the Chandler family encountered the Bearstein show at the Regency Square shopping mall (now <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regency_Mall_(Richmond,_Virginia)\" title=\"wikipedia:Regency Mall (Richmond, Virginia)\">Regency Mall</a>). Chris was evidently fascinated by the spectacle, and due to the light turnout that day, he received considerable attention from the interactive bear. The performer operating Leonard asked Chris his name, and misheard \"Christopher\" as \"Christian.\" Chris and his family seem to attribute this error to Leonard's English accent, rather than the fact that a <a href=\"/cwcki/Speech_impediment\" title=\"Speech impediment\">mumbling</a> kid was slurring to a man over a microphone built into a robotic bear. (While the name \"Christian\" was uncommon outside the UK until the late 80s, \"Christopher\" is a very common name on both sides of the Atlantic, and that's ignoring the fact that Bearstein could be faking his accent.) <sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-a_4-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-a-4\">[4]</a></sup>\n</p><p>For reasons understood only by him, Chris adopted the new name and insisted upon being called by it.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/1993\" title=\"1993\">On 29 December 1993</a>, the <i><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond_Times-Dispatch\" title=\"wikipedia:Richmond Times-Dispatch\">Richmond Times-Dispatch</a></i> ran <a href=\"/cwcki/It_took_a_talking_bear_to_give_the_name_a_young_boy_loves\" title=\"It took a talking bear to give the name a young boy loves\">a fluff piece</a> on the incident.

Now you know.</div></div></div>\n<p>As even a cursory examination will reveal, Chris is fixated on his own name and events from his childhood. Thus an event which resulted in him having <i>two</i> names to obsess over is of supreme importance to him, even after almost twenty years. However, Chris routinely glosses over key details in the story – at times he will simply refer to \"Christopher\" or discuss being renamed by \"a conducting Bear\" as if no further context is required.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-8\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">[8]</a></sup> For example, the <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">trolls</a>' first real insight into the event comes from this brief note in Chris's <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/DVD\" title=\"DVD\">DVD</a> slideshow:\n</p>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">Before moving from Ruckersville to Richmond, in December of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/1989\" title=\"1989\">1989</a>, my family and I were watching the Regency Square Bear Band perform.

In his struggle to affirm his uniqueness in the universe, Chris reluctantly conceded that Liquid might truly share the name \"Christian Weston Chandler\", but clung to the idea that he and he alone was <i>born</i> Christopher Weston Chandler and later <i>became</i> Christian Weston Chandler. (This, of course, missed the point that <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/CChanSonichuCWC\" title=\"CChanSonichuCWC\">CChanSonichuCWC</a> was not merely taking credit for Chris's accomplishments but was claiming to <i>be</i> the true and honest Christian, name change and all.) This became a recurring theme in Chris's videos at the time, as he would repeatedly cite his name change as something that the impostor could not possibly claim as his own.  \n</p><p>Since Liquid and others were constantly accusing Chris of being an impostor named \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Ian_Brandon_Anderson\" title=\"Ian Brandon Anderson\">Ian Brandon Anderson</a>\", Chris frequently asserted the authenticity of his name. However, the name change clouds the matter, and Chris could not even use a phrase like \"my God-given name\" without qualifiers:\n</p>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">I am CHRISTIAN...WESTON...CHANDLER!
