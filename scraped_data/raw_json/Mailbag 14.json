It's been about forty years since I've seen such a powerful and possibly lucrative franchising opportunity.... Sonichu could be huge! I've had a lot of questions that I've wanted to ask you since I discovered your fantastic series about three years ago. Here are some of them:\n</p><p>1. I know that you're a big fan of <a href=\"/cwcki/Britney_Spears\" title=\"Britney Spears\">Britney Spears</a>, but what did you think of Michael Jackson? I loved his music (RIP!), but I certainly thought he was a weird person. Do you think it's weird how he always tried to be a child even though he was over twenty years old?\n</p><p>2. My youngest son, who is 17 years old has a strange connection to my wife. He hates everything about me, but has an unnatural bond to his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Mother\" title=\"Mother\">mother</a>... I've even caught him sleeping in the same bed with her! I've tried talking to him about this, but just won't listen. Is this normal? What should I do?\n</p><p>3. What's going to happen in <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_10\" title=\"Sonichu 10\">Book 10</a>? The action and story in <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_9\" title=\"Sonichu 9\">Book 9</a> was second to none... you gripped me from page one until the end!\n</p><p>4. Like yourself, I'm a very devout person, so I was surprised when I was told that you were kicked out of your old church! What happened? I'm still in shock that something like that would happen!\n</p><p>Thank you so much for taking the time to answer these questions...

I am not totally surprised on him trying to be a child at an adult age; obviously there was a piece of childhood or so that he missed out on the first time around, and maybe he was trying to locate that and feel like he hasn't missed a valuable piece of life. Your Son Needs A Girlfriend. Seriously, though, he should have developed the space between him and his mother by this age. I highly recommend finding a girl about his age and encourage the two to hang out together as much as reasonably possible (sub-suggestion: try finding a girl who Looks and maybe Acts like the boy's mother). You'll have to wait and see. The pastor did a background check on me, and found images of women in bikinis on my Facebook; he was offended.\n<p>You all have a Merry Christmas too. --<a href=\"/cwcki/User:ChrisChanSonichu\" title=\"User:ChrisChanSonichu\">ChrisChanSonichu</a> 06:14, 11 December 2009 (CET)\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris_sez:_Smile_at_bullies\">Chris sez: <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/I%27LL_BREAK_YOU_DEAD\" title=\"I'LL BREAK YOU DEAD\">Smile at bullies</a></span></h3>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #B48246; padding:5px; background-color:#FCC\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>From: <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Whitman\" title=\"wikipedia:Charles Whitman\">Charles Whitman</a> &lt;belltower66@gmail.com&gt;\n<p>Chris,\n</p><p>You've given great advice to high school kids before, and I was wondering if you could help me. I'm emailing you because I'm having a real problem with bullying at my school. It started my freshman year with teasing and name-calling, and maybe getting pushed around a bit. I'm a junior now and the problem has continued, and it's getting worse and worse. It's escalated to death threats, the occasional beating, and the bullies will throw things at me from their cars with increasing accuracy. I've tried telling my parents, my teachers, and the principal and no one is willing to believe me or help.\n</p><p>Were you ever bullied in school? If so, what did they do? How did you deal with this? I know you have problems with <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">trolls</a> now, but what were things like at <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Manchester_High\" title=\"Manchester High\">Manchester High</a>? You make out your high school days to be pretty great and it makes me wonder if there's stuff you're not letting on. I could see a lot of people being jealous of your artistic abilities and your wide circle of female friends.\n</p><p>What advice do you have on dealing with bullies?

Although, I was beat up a bit in 4th grade by a couple of teachers, an aide and a guidance counselor. I told my parents about that; they ended up fighting the school system, and we had to move so I could go to the better schools there.\n<p>My best advice is to ignore their plights upon you and count your blessings. Also, if you are objecting to their beatings and whatnot, I would advise you try Being Nice to them; when they threaten you, you Smile and tell them \"Stay safe and have a good day.\" And when they beat you up, you Smile and tell them, \"Thank you for the massage, I feel much better now.\" And depending on what they throw at you, Smile and say \"Thank you, I (was hungry/thirsty) (wanted this (item) for a while) (think this will look great in my collection). The point is to make their bullying look more like a pleasantry to you, because that is the response bullies are NOT looking for. In any case, eventually the bullies will tire from it and give up; this will speed that up a bit.\n</p><p>--<a href=\"/cwcki/User:ChrisChanSonichu\" title=\"User:ChrisChanSonichu\">ChrisChanSonichu</a> 06:14, 11 December 2009 (CET)\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_pedoglasses_stay\">The pedoglasses stay</span></h3>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #B48246; padding:5px; background-color:#FCC\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>From: Johnny Marcus &lt;johnny2day67@yahoo.com&gt;\n<p>Hello Chris, I like your comics a lot, but I noticed your <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Glasses\" title=\"Glasses\">glasses</a> in a lot of your videos are pretty unstylish, and I was curious as to why you wear those frames when there lots of different styles out there.

Your comic \"Sonichu\" was recently brought to my attention by an intern at my company and I viewed your recent videos on <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Youtube\" title=\"Youtube\">Youtube</a> pitching the concept to \"business people.\" As someone with years of experience in dealing with copyrighted characters, I feel like I need to let you know of some problems I see with you trying to sell your Sonichu character.\n</p><p>Sonichu's creation, in the comics you present, involves two characters who are owned by other companies: Pikachu and <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog\" title=\"Sonic the Hedgehog\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> are owned by <a href=\"/cwcki/Nintendo\" title=\"Nintendo\">Nintendo</a> and Sega, respectively. Do you have the full written consent of Nintendo and Sega to use their characters? I understand you believe Sonichu himself is an original character, but the fact that a key part of his story infringes on other companies' copyrights makes it virtually IMPOSSIBLE for anyone to get in business with you. I suggest you change Sonichu's origin story to not involve characters you do not have the rights to. \n</p><p>That you continue to refer to him as a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Pokemon\" title=\"Pokemon\">Pokemon</a> also presents a problem. Referencing Pokemon and using characters from that franchise in your own Sonichu franchise is an INFRINGEMENT ON NINTENDO'S POKEMON COPYRIGHT. As just a fan product, this is fine, but your efforts to sell Sonichu into other forms of media and make money off it puts you and anyone who would do business with you at legal risk. As I have come to understand Sonichu, I have to tell you that Sonichu can NEVER BE USED FOR PROFIT under current copyright law. You are pulling in too many characters and concepts from other franchises (Sonic the Hedgehog, Power Rangers, <a href=\"/cwcki/Transformers\" title=\"Transformers\">Transformers</a>, Pokemon, to name just a few) to claim your series is fully original.\n</p><p>I am sorry if this news disappoints you. I see a lot of young artists who are naive about copyright law make the same mistakes. Hopefully, you will learn from them and develop a new concept that you will be able to make money on some day. You have a lot of talent for a special needs child and I look forward to seeing the kind of art you produce when you grow up and become an adult. Good luck!\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<div style=\"clear:right; background:#ffffbb; width:300px; padding:3px; border:2px solid #99aaee; float:right; font-size:90%\">\n<div class=\"floatleft\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:CWCipedia_logo.png\"><img alt=\"CWCipedia logo.png\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"60\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/5/54/CWCipedia_logo.png/60px-CWCipedia_logo.png\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/5/54/CWCipedia_logo.png/90px-CWCipedia_logo.png 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/5/54/CWCipedia_logo.png/120px-CWCipedia_logo.png 2x\" width=\"60\"/></a></div>\nFor <a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_Chris%27s_lies\" title=\"List of Chris's lies\">Truth</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Honest_Content\" title=\"Honest Content\">Honesty</a>, see the archived <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia\" title=\"CWCipedia\">CWCipedia</a> page on <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160301/http://archive.sonichu.com/cwcipedia/index.php?title=Mailbag_14\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mailbag 14</a></div>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n</p>\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"navbox\" style=\";\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"padding:2px;\">\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"nowraplinks collapsible mw-collapsed mw-collapsible\" style=\"width:100%;background:transparent;color:inherit;;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<th class=\"navbox-title\" colspan=\"2\" style=\";\"><div style=\"float:left; width:6em;text-align:left;\"> <span class=\"noprint plainlinksneverexpand\" style=\"white-space:nowrap; font-weight:normal; font-size:xx-small; ;;border:none;;\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Template:Emails\" title=\"Template:Emails\"><span style=\";;border:none;;\" title=\"View this template\">v</span></a> <span style=\"font-size:80%;\">•</span> <a href=\"/cwcki/Template_talk:Emails\" title=\"Template talk:Emails\"><span style=\"color:#002bb8;;;border:none;;\" title=\"Discussion about this template\">d</span></a> <span style=\"font-size:80%;\">•</span> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"//sonichu.com/w/index.php?title=Template:Emails&amp;action=edit\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#002bb8;;;border:none;;\" title=\"You can edit this template.
