He prefaced its release by uploading six older videos of his accomplishments to his YouTube channel during the few days previous, in the hope that they might better frame his plea for understanding. Christian assumes that the ED contributors have simply misunderstood him and his work, and, consequently, attempts to re-introduce himself in order to start over on the right foot. Oddly, Chris loudly inhales between his sentences a lot in this video.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Description\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Description</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Video\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Video</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Transcript\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Transcript</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Notes\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Notes</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Description\">Description</span></h2>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>I've heard about those who have defiled my character.

My name is Christian Weston Chandler… from <a href=\"/cwcki/Ruckersville,_VA\" title=\"Ruckersville, VA\">Ruckersville, Vir<i>gin</i>ia</a>. [<i>puts on <a href=\"/cwcki/Pedo-Glasses\" title=\"Pedo-Glasses\">glasses</a></i>]\n</p><p>It has come to my attention that I have a lot... more fans of my electronk—<a href=\"/cwcki/Electric_Hedgehog_Pok%C3%A9mon\" title=\"Electric Hedgehog Pokémon\">Electric Hedgehog Pokémon</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(character)\" title=\"Sonichu (character)\">Sonichu</a> than I had originally thought, and I thank each and every one of you for your support. And I will draw more <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\">comics</a>, uh, when I get some positive inspiration, or, uh, when I feel like it. After all, everybody else—everybody has a life; so do I; I have a life. [<i>inhales sharply</i>]\n</p><p>Anyway, it has also come to my attention that I have a lot of people who may have picked up on the wrong theories of my person. [<i>inhales sharply</i>] I will not quote any hate sites, but I would like to humbly apologize for appearing to be some kind of sleaze, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Troll\" title=\"Troll\">troll</a>, badass, or whatever adjectives, good or explicit, you may feel about me. [<i>inhales sharply</i>]\n</p><p>Please understand: I am a 25 year-old, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/High-functioning_autism\" title=\"High-functioning autism\">high-functioning autistic</a> male… with a simple, <i>peaceful</i> dream… of becoming a <i>father</i>… of a sweet, little, pretty girl, who I will dub…ly name <a href=\"/cwcki/Crystal_Weston_Chandler_(daughter)\" title=\"Crystal Weston Chandler (daughter)\">“<i>Crystal</i> Weston Chandler”</a>. “Crystal”: a name that sounds similar to mine, but it has a nice ring to it. And it’s also similar to the illustrious <a href=\"/cwcki/Honor_roll\" title=\"Honor roll\">metal</a> that is mined from the Earth’s ground. “Weston”: my <a href=\"/cwcki/Barbara_Chandler\" title=\"Barbara Chandler\">mother’s</a> maiden name, and a proper English name from royal descent. As a matter of fact, among my, uh, mother’s side in the, uh, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_English\" title=\"Chris and English\">ancestrial</a> traits [<i>inhales sharply</i>] we have, uh, we have been traced down to <a href=\"/cwcki/Daniel_Weston\" title=\"Daniel Weston\">Daniel Weston</a>, who was on the main Mayflower voyage. And, uh, beyond him, <a href=\"/cwcki/Anne_Boleyn\" title=\"Anne Boleyn\">Anne Boleyn</a>, who was the, uh, one of H—Henry VIII's… <i>King</i> Henry VIII's wives, who gave birth to, uh, Queen Elizabeth I, and “Chandler”: the, uh, name—the family name my father had. And, uh, from his, uh, line, uh, we have, uh, from his side of the family, we have the, uh, <a href=\"/cwcki/Cherokian_Clan\" title=\"Cherokian Clan\">Cherokee blood</a>. I'm one-sixteenth. [<i>inhales sharply</i>] And from among us Cherokees, there are very few of us left, because we were big in number, but then came along the, uh, forced march on the Trail of Tears, where some of us went into hiding…. Yeah, short line there: <i>Cherokees</i>. We're a respected tribe. We <i>should</i> be respected. Anyway… even though we were forced onto the Trail of Tears, but that's another—that's another—whole 'nother story. You can go read—you can learn about in your local libraries.\n</p><p>Ahem. My mother and <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler\" title=\"Bob Chandler\">my father</a> are both really nice, old-fashioned-type people who not only gave the birth—<a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_sex\" title=\"Chris and sex\">gave me birth</a> at their ages… which my mother is 66, currently, and my father is currently 80. They both just turned that way in the last couple of months. And, uh, I was born in <a href=\"/cwcki/1980s#1982\" title=\"1980s\">1982</a>. They gave me the birth… then, and, uh, anyway, it was so nice of—for them to give me the, uh, birth during the early 1980s.\n</p><p>I was diagnosed with high-functional autism, and I lived a, uh, somewhat rough life. I've had an <a href=\"/cwcki/Abusive_babysitter\" title=\"Abusive babysitter\">abusive babysitter</a> at one time, [<i>inhales sharply</i>] and some of the teachers and principals of <a href=\"/cwcki/Nathanael_Greene_Elementary_School\" title=\"Nathanael Greene Elementary School\">Nathanael Greene Elementary School</a>… that I was attending in later years (about, uh, late 1980s, early <a href=\"/cwcki/1990s\" title=\"1990s\">1990s</a>) [<i>inhales sharply</i>] They abused me—<a href=\"/cwcki/Kick_the_Autistic\" title=\"Kick the Autistic\">they abused me by pinning me to the ground</a> with, uh, their ha—with, uh, holding my wrists and my ankles, pinning me down to the ground and—and audio-taping my cries and shouts. But, anyway, my mother and my father, they both fought the court system, the Greene County court system, which, uh, they were not a very nice bunch of people, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_English\" title=\"Chris and English\">very not</a>. Hands down. But, anyway, we eventually moved to Chesterfield County for a nice, better school system. And one teacher in particular, of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Providence_Middle_School\" title=\"Providence Middle School\">Providence Middle School</a>, who I would like to give much kudos to, who w—who was—who, uh, let—who not—who not only, uh, let me—who was a good—good, uh, person to go by dur—uh, during my mainstreaming, and she was also the, uh, also a good leader in my learning to cope. I wish to give kudos to <a href=\"/cwcki/Virginia_Jeanine_Sanford\" title=\"Virginia Jeanine Sanford\">Mrs. Virginia Jeanine Sanford</a>, of Providence Middle School, in Chesterfield County, whose picture is, uh, in the trailer of my <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler...Yep,_I%27m_on_TV_:)\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler...Yep, I'm on TV :)\">\"CWC on TV\" DVD</a>, which is also on the—the <a href=\"/cwcki/YouTube\" title=\"YouTube\">YouTube</a>.\n</p><p>And, after being on <a href=\"/cwcki/Honor_roll\" title=\"Honor roll\">honor roll</a> throughout, uh, Providence Middle and Manchester High, Sonichu was first thought up in my senior year at Ma— [<i>jump cut</i>] …along with a nice bunch of teachers backing me up, and my circle of <a href=\"/cwcki/Gal_pal\" title=\"Gal pal\">gal pals</a> (I mostly had gal—mostly had that circle during my high school years), anyway, after all that, I graduated. I graduated. Then, we moved back to, uh, our old home in Ruckersville, where I attended <a href=\"/cwcki/Piedmont_Virginia_Community_College\" title=\"Piedmont Virginia Community College\">Piedmont Virginia Community College</a>, and, eventually, I graduated from there, too, with a degree in Computer-Aided Drafting and Design, also known as \"CAD/CAM\".\n</p><p>And, uh, during my high school years, I was used to being surrounded by… girls… in my circle, and after having to, uh, leave them I felt <i>ever so lonesome</i>. And, after the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress\" title=\"Stress\">stress</a> from some of the people—people at <a href=\"/cwcki/Private_Villa_of_Corrupted_Citizens\" title=\"Private Villa of Corrupted Citizens\">PVCC</a>, as well as my mental block [<i>mimes punching himself in the head</i>] of autism, it became hard from me to approach gir—approach the girls like I used to. And I would like to point out right now, at this—at, uh—during my—ever since I—ever—during the whole—my whole <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart_Search\" title=\"Sweetheart Search\">Sweetheart Search</a> has started, when I turned 21 on February 24, 2002. Anyway, beyond that date, I <i>never have stalked anybody</i>. <i>Never have stalked</i>. I'm telling you right—I'm telling you right now. All I did was sit around, with a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sign\" title=\"Sign\">sign</a> by my side that said I was looking for a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Boyfriend-Free_Girl\" title=\"Boyfriend-Free Girl\">Boyfriend-Free Girl</a>, 18-25, yadda yadda yadda, all tha— [abrupt jump cut] …page. And I did all that, because I had feared rejection, and the <a href=\"/cwcki/Infinitely-High_Boyfriend-Factor\" title=\"Infinitely-High Boyfriend-Factor\">Infinitely-High Boyfriend-Factor</a>, because you cannot tell which ladies are paired up, and which are not. And wedding rings, that's just a whole different story, 'cause they're married, because y—it's not like you give every women a ring who's already paired up. [<i>long pause</i>] Well, that's just one perspective. [<i>inhales sharply</i>] But, anyway, uh, I did not move from my seat… at all, unless <a href=\"/cwcki/DIRTY,_CRAPPED_BRIEFS\" title=\"DIRTY, CRAPPED BRIEFS\">I needed to go use the restroom</a>. That's it. Okay? I never moved from my seat while I'm sitting around waiting for the girl to come to me. ‘Cause that's all I'm doing there; I'm just waiting for a girl to come talk to me, 'cause... [<i>inhales sharply</i>] like I said, I'm afraid to approach them… at that point.\n</p><p>So please understand: <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_is_Angry\" title=\"CWC is Angry\">I am not a violent person</a>. <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Saga\" title=\"Megan Saga\">I'm decent</a>.

[abrupt jump cut] I'm sorry for reflecting any negative feelings towards each of you that have felt them, including those who have had such feelings they have created, uh, demeaning web pages. <i>All I ask</i>—<i>all I ask</i> are those people who are watching this right now, is just… take them down? Please? I'm asking as an innocent victim of misunderstanding, just take down your web pages, or edit them to <i>positively</i> better reflect my feelings as an individual, as a person… as a man who has suffered, like most everybody in this world that we all live in. [<i>sighs</i>]\n</p><p>Thank you very much for li—for your time, and listening, and please remember: I'm a innocent person.
