There were a few emails carefully designed to gently bring up topics that Chris was in serious denial about, such as his <a href=\"/cwcki/Obesity\" title=\"Obesity\">obesity</a>. There were also a few weird ones, like a Muslim boy's life being put in jeopardy by his love of <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a>, and some wacko promoting 2D love.\n</p><p>Chris was scheduled to answer them all on the 29th, but he didn't actually get around to it until 1 <a href=\"/cwcki/December_2009\" title=\"December 2009\">December</a>. His responses were more pompous and condescending than ever. The irony in lecturing about employment and cleaning seemed to be completely lost on him. He responded to the second letter in the mailbag by explaining why he was fully justified in closing his mind to the idea of <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">autism</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Asperger%27s_Syndrome\" title=\"Asperger's Syndrome\">Asperger's Syndrome</a> being similar; then in the very next letter, he berated someone for following a closed-minded religion. Presumably, Chris wanted her to open her mind and her <a href=\"/cwcki/China\" title=\"China\">vagina</a>. Other highlights included Chris desperately trying to come up with ways the Rosechus are different, and claiming that Albert Einstein was autistic.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Answered\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Answered</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Good_housekeeping\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Good housekeeping</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Oh_shit_another_Asperger's_email\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Oh shit another Asperger's email</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Grrrlpowaanow_2:_the_Christianing\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Grrrlpowaanow 2: the Christianing</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#An_inkling_that_this_is_a_joke_letter\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">An inkling that this is a joke letter</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#The_Rosechus_are_totally_diverse_and_stuff\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The Rosechus are totally diverse and stuff</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Strict_on_homosexuality\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Strict on homosexuality</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Yes_you_can_sail_the_seven_seas\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Yes you can sail the seven seas</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#Like_a_pimp\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Like a pimp</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Hexbox_economics\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.9</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Hexbox economics</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#Michael_Parker's_last_stand\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.10</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Michael Parker's last stand</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#In_which_Chris_destroys_an_Iranian_family\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.11</span> <span class=\"toctext\">In which Chris destroys an Iranian family</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-13\"><a href=\"#Love_in_two_dimensions\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.12</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Love in two dimensions</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-14\"><a href=\"#GET_A_JOB,_DUDE\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.13</span> <span class=\"toctext\">GET A JOB, DUDE</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-15\"><a href=\"#Harry_Potter:_total_spaz\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.14</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Harry Potter: total spaz</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-16\"><a href=\"#In_which_Chris_acts_unreasonable_while_calling_everybody_else_unreasonable\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.15</span> <span class=\"toctext\">In which Chris acts unreasonable while calling everybody else unreasonable</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-17\"><a href=\"#Rejected_Mailbag\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Rejected Mailbag</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-18\"><a href=\"#Chris_doesn't_want_to_talk_about_incontinence\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris doesn't want to talk about incontinence</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Answered\">Answered</span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Good_housekeeping\">Good housekeeping</span></h3>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #B48246; padding:5px; background-color:#FCC\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>From: <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\" title=\"wikipedia:\">Jeffrey Dahmer</a> &lt;youreinvitedfordinner@yahoo.com&gt;\n<p>Chris,\n</p><p>First, thank you for taking the time to answer all these fan letters!\n</p><p>Anyway, my apartment is a HUGE MESS right now, and I just can't seem to get motivated to start cleaning, or even where to start for that matter.

I would ask that you read the entire message before responding.\n</p><p>I've got a little question for you. As you're no doubt aware, plenty of other people sending you mail have asked questions regarding your stance on Asperger's Syndrome. You, of course, have responded that your mind is closed to discussion. I'd like to ask you a question about this: how can you honestly doubt, with absolute surety, the statements of medical professionals? I noticed that at least one poster here on the mailbag has stated that he is in medical school. Have you ever attended medical school, Mr. Chandler? No, you have not. You have no understanding of psychology whatsoever, so how can you be so certain that Asperger's is \"TOTALLY DIFFERENT\" from autism?\n</p><p>A closed mind is a credulous mind, Mr. Chandler, and everyone is wrong once in a while.\n</p><p>(Incidentally, I have some experience in psychology and have acted as an orderly in special education schools, so a great deal of this comes from personal experience.)\n</p><p>Yours,\nArizona Bay.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Well, I have read your whole message, and you have the right to your own opinion, as did the other people who asked about the subject. I state my opinion on the subject as it is my right as well to my own opinion. Aspergers is MORE classified to those who come down with it LATER in life during their ADULT years. Autism happens from nearly the start. With that being a MAJOR difference between the two among other differences, I again rest my case. --<a href=\"/cwcki/User:ChrisChanSonichu\" title=\"User:ChrisChanSonichu\">ChrisChanSonichu</a> 04:05, 2 December 2009 (CET)\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Grrrlpowaanow_2:_the_Christianing\">Grrrlpowaanow 2: the Christianing</span></h3>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #B48246; padding:5px; background-color:#FCC\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>From: grrrlpowaanow@aol.com\n<p>I am writing this in response to your response to my email.\n</p><p>First, I am disappointed that you \"rejected\" my email. It wasn't offensive or mislabeling. It was honest content from my true heart and, like you said, you should be a man and take criticism. My criticism of your comic is that it goes against God and the Bible, and it does in the instances I've mentioned.\n</p><p>Second, it does not matter if either nun was or wasn't a lesbian. The Bible says every child deserves one mother and one father. Not two mommies, like the <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">homosexuals</a> do, because that confuses the child's gender. I'm greatly disappointed that you would promote anti-Christian ideals like girls having two moms.\n</p><p>Third, sex is meant to be done for procreation only. Anything else is sin, plain and simple. Sex done in public is also a sin. Read the Bible. It is very specific that sex is meant to be done between one man and one woman, and that's it. Not an audience, and not \"for fun.\" God hates hanky-panky, and Hell is full of perverts who enjoy looking at pornographic material.\n</p><p>Fourth, \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu\" title=\"Rosechu\">Rosechu</a> became a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Wild\" title=\"Wild\">wild</a> beast\" is no excuse. In fact, it's even worse that you would insinuate that women can't control their emotions and just fly off the hinges like they animals and not even human. Is that what you think of women? That they're animals and not people? You're awful.\n</p><p>I brought your Sonichu comics up with my Bible studies class and they all agree that your comic goes against God and the Bible, and they all agreed that I should stop reading it. I don't understand how you could be so naive as to think that God would even tolerate \"recreational\" sexual relations, especially when you know that God hates the homosexuals. After all, why do you think He hates the homosexuals? It's because the sex they have is only for \"recreation\" and therefore goes against God. <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Hanky-panky\" title=\"Hanky-panky\">Hanky-panky</a> goes against God. Premarital sex (which you've depicted with your other characters, most recently Angelica and Reginald Sneasel) goes against God. Quit spitting on the God Almighty with your Sonichu comics and reconsider the changes I've suggested, if not for the sake of the comic, then at least for the sake of your immortal soul.\n</p><p>May God have mercy on you.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>In response to your first paragraph, obviously you have not opened your mind to all things in life, and your religion is a closed-minded one. Second, a lot of people have gone to <a href=\"/cwcki/Angelica\" title=\"Angelica\">Angelica</a>'s church; male volunteers have shared with Angelica their views and opinions on all things as well, so she was Not Without a male role-model. Third, Sex Is Natural; regardless of it being for procreation or for fun, and I agree you that sex should ONLY be truly enjoyed between Man and Woman; not between homos. Fourth, I have had MY OWN <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Anger\" title=\"Anger\">fly-off emotional moments</a> too on rare occasions; you are no different I'm sure.

I've read a lot of you and your real life adventures and found your struggle of getting a woman to be heart-breaking. No man should ever feel as lonely as you most likely do. That's why I come to you with a suggestion. Why <a href=\"/cwcki/Polyamorous_marriage\" title=\"Polyamorous marriage\">not marry a 2D</a> anime or video game character? With a little imagination (I'm sure you have a lot of it), they're about as good as a real girl. Trust me on this one. After trying and failing to find the woman that was right for me, I moved on to 2D love. IT'S AMAZING. 2D women will never betray you, never demand lavish gifts for sex, and never steal all of your shit when they inevitably divorce you. 2D women can't necessarily love you back, but your love for them should be enough to get by. Unless, of course, you're a selfish womanizer who always demands things in return. But, hey, with advances in artificial intelligence, she might just be able to!\n</p><p>So think it over, pick out your ideal 2D lover, and enjoy your new life of happiness!\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>That, my friend, is False Love, and NO True Love and Compassion will ever come out of that.
