Scabies, if left untreated, can be very serious business. It can spread to you, even your dogs. If your dogs end up getting scabies, it could cost you hundreds of dollars to get them treated at the vet.\n</p><p>I am especially concerned about your mom. Older folks can be especially susceptible to secondary infections caused by the open sores made in the skin by the mites. You need to go and see a doctor as soon as possible. if you catch this early enough, the treatment is fairly simple. You're going to have to do some work though to make sure you remove all traces of the mites from your home.\n</p><p>An infected person can transmit scabies indirectly by shedding mites that can contaminate clothing, bedding, and furniture. After you've been to the doctor, you're going to need to thoroughly clean your house. You'll have to wash all of your clothing and bedding in very hot water as well. The furniture is going to be harder. Your best bet there may be to hire a professional exterminator. Some people say that those portable steam cleaners work well too; killing the mites and their eggs. That might be another option for you, depending on how bad your situation is.\n</p><p>Please don't ignore this. If you get this treated quickly, you'll be back to normal in almost no time. If you wait to get treatment, things could get a lot worse. Your health insurance should cover any treatment you need.\n</p><p>Here's an article from the CDC about scabies. You might want to read it.

Her suffering from countless hours of picking and treating is mainly one thing that her going on and on and on about is bothering me a Lot.

My Two more successful relationships, post <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/High_school\" title=\"High school\">MHS</a> graduation, were a lot better, but one turned on me, and the other caught the Trolls' attention and dumped me after being bothered (plus, she didn't fancy my fantasy of moving the relationship forward from friendship).\n</p><p>**Groan and Sigh**\n</p><p>How about you; what's your story?

I thought you were talking about scabies; they're mites, not flies. Did you check out the link to the CDC article I sent you? It has a lot of good information. I'm not sure how you would kill either flies or mites with ice packs or frozen peas. The only real reliable way to get rid of those kinds of pests is to hire an exterminator, which, unfortunately, can be very expensive. \n</p><p>Please have your mom be careful with the picking. This is what I was talking about in my other email. If she has any open sores she may be susceptible to infection. This could create a serious health problem. The doctors you mentioned wouldn't be able to do anything about getting rid of the source of the bugs, but I'm surprised that they weren't able to prescribe a medicated cream or powder that would help with the bites.\n</p><p>I don't want to intrude on your personal business, but have you tried communicating with your brother recently? Perhaps if you explained to him what was going on in your life, especially regarding the health of your mother, he might soften up a bit. From the sound of it, you two really do need to talk more. Why is he distancing himself from you? Did you or your mother have a falling out with him at some point? If that's the case, I hope that you find some way to work out your differences with each other. Family needs to stick together, especially during difficult times.\n</p><p>My relationship situation is, to say the least, complicated. It's something I may share with you at another time. I'm sorry to hear about your awful experiences with online dating. Maybe you should try my idea with the taking the dogs for a walk. It's a lot less risky, and you'll be able to actually see and interact with real women, not people hiding behind keyboards.\n</p><p>I hope things start getting better for you soon.\n</p><p>Rebeckah\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris_has_scabies_too\">Chris has scabies too</span></h4>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#F2CECE; border:1px dotted #BFA3A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>18 October 2013\n<p><b>Re: Thank you</b>\n</p><p>She has a prescribed ointment, and she has been using it with band aids.

Have you thought about maybe joining some sort of support group for people who have similar issues? It might help you develop enough confidence to feel more comfortable in social situations. There are a lot of self-help books and videos available as well, but I'm not sure how much these would help you. Still, it might be worth a try if you don't have any other options.\n</p><p>I have to say, I'm a little curious about the requirements you mentioned for a girlfriend. Those are some pretty high standards! Why is it so important to you that a potential girlfriend by \"hot\" and rich. That's a tall order! Believe me, there are a lot of guys that would love to meet a hot, rich woman. You're going to find yourself with a lot of competition.\n</p><p>The other problem with \"hot\", rich women is that a lot of them are very stuck up and shallow people. They don't care about having a real loving, caring relationship with someone; they're looking for someone who will support them in the lifestyle they've become accustomed to and buy them lots of material things. If you're not a rich man, you probably don't have a chance with one of these women.\n</p><p>Sorry if I sound like I'm being judgmental or critical. I just don't understand why these particular qualities are so important to you. There are plenty of wonderful women out there who aren't super model hot or rich, but they're good, caring people. I would hate to see you pass up a chance to have a rich and rewarding relationship with someone because you insist on holding out for the perfect woman.\n</p><p>It's really a shame that things didn't work out with the reunion. I know how much you were looking forward to it, and you seemed really happy when you were helping Ashley with getting things organized. The same thing happened with the 10 year reunion. It's a shame that people are so apathetic and disinterested. It would have been fun to get everyone together.\n</p><p>Rebeckah\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Dead_end_of_a_life\">Dead end of a life</span></h4>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#F2CECE; border:1px dotted #BFA3A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>16 December 2013\n<p>I have tried a social group before, but that was not much help to me.

I'm on a TLDR (too long, didn't read) mindset, because unless I have the energy to really concentrate, I can't really grasp it.

I just finished an advanced study class, \"City of Weirdos\". Improv comedy is a LOT of fun but it's also a LOT of work and can get pricey with the different classes, coaching, etc. Being a comedian sounds like a fun job, but it's a lot harder than people think. For now, I'm planning on keeping my day job.\n</p><p>I'm also part of Team Hightower, a group of other aspiring stand up comics. My team competed in a \"Cage Match\" last Saturday. The cage matches are friendly competitions between local improv teams. Each team gets 15 minutes to perform before a panel of judges and receives feedback/criticism afterwards. The audience participates in the judging as well. Hightower didn't win the last one, but it was still a blast. Drinks and hanging out with the other teams and friends at the end of the show is always the best part.\n</p><p>My job at USA Today isn't all that interesting. I'm in Marketing and I'm basically responsible for managing a number of large accounts. It's my job to convince my clients to spend mega bucks on ad space. That's pretty much it in a nutshell.\n</p><p>I like Jerry Seinfeld, but he's not my favorite. There are a lot of comedians I like, but at the top of my list are George Carlin, Bill Hicks, Dennis Leary, Steven Wright, and Louis CK. I also enjoy political comedians. Bill Maher, Jon Stewart, and Stephen Colbert are my favorites.\n</p><p>I absolutely love classic comedy. Red Skelton was a wonderful old school comedian. I love his two seagulls, \"Gertrude\" and \"Heathcliff\" bit. Lucille Ball is another favorite. It's funny, if you were to ask most people their favorite I Love Lucy episode, they'll always say the candy factory one. My favorite episode is the one where Lucy gets Ricky's loving cup stuck on her head and has to ride the subway to get it to Ricky. The one where she and Ethel dress up as Martial girls as part of a promotional stunt is a good one too. Of course I love the Three Stooges - who doesn't? Like most people, Curly is my favorite. Just don't get me started on Three Stooges trivia....Did you know that Lucille Ball starred in a Three Stooges short called \"Little Pigskins\"?\n</p><p>As far a British Comedy, I have a lot of favorites. At the top of that list is, of course \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\", followed by \"Fawlty Towers\", \"Absolutely Fabulous\", \"Red Dwarf\", \"Are You Being Served\", and \"The Young Ones\".\n</p><p>Anyway, that's enough typing for me!

I've only watched a couple of episodes. I thought they were OK, but I never really became a fan. I'm obviously in the minority here though, since the show is such a monster hit, even now, in syndication. When I've got some time, maybe I'll start watching it from the beginning.\n</p><p>I really like some of the \"classic\" sitcoms such as \"WKRP in Cincinatti\", \"Taxi\", \"Night Court\", and \"Barney Miller\". The writing and performances are amazing. I absolutely love Harry Anderson (Night Court). He's quite a character in real life as well. \"Latka\", \"Louis\", and \"Reverend Jim\" from Taxi are favorite characters as well. About the only modern sitcom I watch now with any regularity is \"The Big Bang Theory\". I was hooked after a friend showed me a couple of episodes. I LOVE Sheldon. He reminds me of one of my best friends.\n</p><p>If you're looking for something a little different, comedy-wise, I highly recommend \"Soap\". It's a parody of daytime soap operas that ran from the late 70s to the early 80s. It's comedy gold. The writing and performances, especially Richard Mulligan's portrayal of Bert Campbell and Katherine Helmond's performance as Jessica Tate are amazing. Soap was very controversial and way ahead of its time. They covered everything from demon possessed babies to alien abductions. Mary Hartman Mary Hartman is another older, highly controversial and incredibly well written and funny series. If you can find them, do yourself a favor and watch them.\n</p><p>I've been on a real comedy nostalgia kick lately. I've been watching The Gong Show. It's interesting to me because it's \"raw\", spontaneous comedy. Most of the people performing aren't professional comics and probably haven't ever taken a class. A lot of them seem like they're just naturally funny, and I like that. The Gong Show has always been a guilty pleasure.\n</p><p>I love doing improv and I love living so close to one of the most exciting cities in the world. There is always so much to see and do, and I have a lot of great friends. Tomorrow night I'm going to the 15th Annual Glam Awards. I can hardly wait! I just need to find the perfect outfit.

You know that I was at the GLAM awards last night, which is a major gay event in NYC. It's a fantastic event and a lot of fun. Lots of people. LGBT and heterosexual go every year. It's one of the biggest parties of the year. <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://blogs.villagevoice.com/dailymusto/2012/11/i_won_another_g.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blogs.villagevoice.com/dailymusto/2012/11/i_won_another_g.php</a>\n</p><p>I'm sorry if I sound like I'm coming down on you hard for what you said. Your remarks caught me off-balance, leaving me a little shocked and disappointed, as I said earlier. I'm trying very hard not to judge you on this since you did say that you lost your train of thought; so maybe I'm misunderstanding you. Maybe you didn't mean to phrase your remarks the way you did and you didn't realize how nasty and hateful they'd sound to someone else reading them. You never struck me as being the kind of person who would harbor these kinds of bigoted attitudes. This kind of hatred is absolutely toxic to me, and I don't want to be anywhere around it. I broke up with my last boyfriend because he turned out to be a bigot. He would make sick cruel remarks about LGBT folks in general, even going as far as to insult some of my friends right to their faces. That was the last straw for me. I ended our relationship because I just couldn't stand to be around him anymore.\n</p><p>I was just wondering, do you have any gay or lesbian friends? A lot of people are uncomfortable around LGBT folk because they've never had any personal experience with them and the don't really know how to relate to them as people. I think that if you had a LGBT friend, your attitude would change. That's one of the things I love about living in the NYC area. People are a lot more cultured, tolerant, and accepting of alternative lifestyles. Ever day presents an opportunity to meet people from different ethnic and cultural backgrounds, as well as sexual preferences. I feel that I've really broadened my horizons and grown as a person since I moved out here.\n</p><p>Anyway, I'm not going to talk about this anymore. I need to give your remarks further thought so that I can sort out my feelings about them. I'm still a bit hurt and it's going to take me some time to work through it. If I misunderstood you, that's great. I hope you'll be able to clarify what you were trying to say. If I came on a bit strong, it's because you touched a nerve. This is something I'm quite passionate about, being a big supporter of the LGBT community.\n</p><p>I'm sorry that the improv comedy workshop won't work out for you. It looks like it's really well put together class and it would be fun. It's structured very much like my Upright Citizens Brigade classes and workshops. If you were able to do it, I think you'd make a lot of friends, boost your confidence, and have a great time. Maybe this is something you can do later on when your finances improve. It looks like this group does workshops throughout the year.\n</p><p>Rebeckah\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris_is_the_real_victim\">Chris is the real victim</span></h4>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#F2CECE; border:1px dotted #BFA3A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>23 December 2013\n<p><b>Re: Improv Comedy Workshop in Charlottesville, VA</b>\n</p><p>Firstly, I felt shock myself in reading your response, and I most sincerely apologize for offending and hurting you. For the most part, that is how I feel about the gay males, but as long as they do not get too close or offend me personally, I am most able to cope being around them. Blame the damn bunch of Trolls for their shoving their label onto me as a grave mislabel, sending me lewd and obscene content, images and shit in email, US mail, what they left behind when they hacked into and destroyed my past <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC%27s_Sonichu_Site!\" title=\"CWC's Sonichu Site!\">Sonichu.net</a> website, leaving behind most obscene and offensive gay porn images, and the very loud audio file of \"Hey, everyone, U'm looking at gay porn\", all over my html work. I later took down the whole website shortly afterwards. UGH!!! Just totally offended, majorly grossed, scared the shit, and made me feel most like throwing up all over and dying. I REALLY hate having to think about that travesty and nightmare all over again.\n</p><p>I have no personal offense or beef against Lesbians, Bisexuals or Transgenders. If you consider <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tomgirl\" title=\"Tomgirl\">cross-dressing</a> a tranny act, then I guess you may count me as one there. Seriously, if I could do it more often, I would; my mother hates seeing me in a skirt a LOT, and I have a LOT of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress\" title=\"Stress\">stress</a> and emotional devastation as it is. But after consideration, with the gender-change operations, I would never want to date or anything like that with any of those trannys. Anna McLerran, my friend; she is a lesbian.\n</p><p>Since after <a href=\"/cwcki/Count_Graduon\" title=\"Count Graduon\">Graduation</a>, I had been emotionally falling downhill for YEARS, and the trollings and cyber-bullyings against me since November, 2007 just took the whole freaking cake, and now, when I was feeling better after last August, October 29, Sarah Bevel just totally redestroyed me, after <a href=\"/cwcki/Daniel_Mimms\" title=\"Daniel Mimms\">Daniel Mimms</a>, the most bastard devil I have ever had the displeasure of knowing in person, the individual who planted the first Photographic seed AGAINST me Anywhere online, that a week later, just started the domino effect that would have me overreacting to everything THEY have stated against me... Sarah redestroyed me with what she said in her email, which I will forward to you shortly; if I had already forwarded it to you, you don't have to read it again. Just the whole ripped my <a href=\"/cwcki/Heart_level\" title=\"Heart level\">heart</a> out, tossed it against a wall, bolted a steel plate on the flat side of my heart, leaving bleeding emotions... It still constantly hurts, and I find it even more difficult to smile or enjoy much towards even a remote emotional recovery. I also really miss my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bob\" title=\"Bob\">father</a>; he died September 6, 2011; two midnights and fifteen minutes after his 84th birthday.\n</p><p>After Graduation, I lost most to all of my ability to socialize, and it gradually worsened as the years passed. And all throughout, I lacked total self-esteem, self-confidence and whatnot. The only times I even found remote emotional recovery was when I was in love and relationships with <a href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Schroeder\" title=\"Megan Schroeder\">Megan Schroeder</a>, until the night I saw her making out with another dude, which was the same night afterwards when Mimms took that infamous photograph of me, and [<a href=\"/cwcki/The_Wallflower\" title=\"The Wallflower\">REDACTED</a>]<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[note 1]</a></sup> up until when she broke up with me. And I was neutral between the in and out theoretical relationships on the internet. So my heart was volleying back and forth with LOTS of heartbreaks and heartaches for a few years, with all of the most offensive videos that I was tricked, conned, blackmailed, etc. into doing since November, 2007 until a few years ago.\n</p><p>And when you take into account being constantly ignored and considered background art by EVERYONE in Public, and most of our classmates now, I feel like a ghost with pain, heartache, misery, loneliness, and mild appreciation for my family, being the only emotions I have left. It hurts me a lot of the time. *sigh* And even worse with me and my mother being poor and just getting by; it all weighs heavily on my conscious daily.\n</p><p>I need real, sincere help from real friends who can actually be HERE for me, in person, instead of scattered miles away every which way.\n</p><p>Stay Safe and Well,\n</p><p>Christian W.

I can assure you that I don't plan on using mine to do any hacking, cyber bullying, or trolling. I just want to have some fun playing Call of Duty with my brother. I don't know where you got the idea that the XBox One console or Bill Gates somehow promotes trolling. Does simply owning an XBox One somehow make me and my brother troll supporters, or even trolls ourselves? That makes no sense to me. If you prefer Playstation, that's great! Your free to purchase whatever gaming system you wish. I just don't think it's a good idea to demonize other people (like myself) who may own or prefer another console.\n</p><p>I honestly have no opinion on the whole console thing. As I said in my earlier email, I've never really been a gamer. I'm usually busy with work, my friends, or my improv comedy workshops. I would never have purchased a gaming console on my own.

You do what you personally want with yours; it doesn't matter.\n</p><p>I tend to get emotionally carried away, especially on the hottest topic of all time, the damn Trolls and Cyber-Bullies, and worse off what they have done to me.

I was just trying to help you by pointing out that dredging up all of this stuf is only causing you unnecessary stress and hurting you. I'm not denying that what these people did to your was wrong, or that you've had a difficult past; I'm just saying that you'd probably feel better if you put all of this aside and moved on. You're beating yourself up over this and it can't be doing you any good. That kind of stress can seriously impact your overall health.\n</p><p>I don't think you're as invisible as you think you are. You just need to build up your self-confidence. Did you take a look at that link I sent you for the free improv comedy workshop near you? You can check it out here: http://www.pvcc.edu/performingarts/theatre.php\n</p><p>Yeah, I know that I'm biased, given that I'm such as big improv enthusiast, but I think that this is something you'd enjoy - and it's FREE! From our email conversations, it's obvious that you have a love of comedy. I'm sure that there would be people taking the workshop that share your interests and would love to talk to you about them. You already have plenty of material to use as a conversation opener. You just have to go for it. Honestly, what do you have to lose?\n</p><p>In a workshop setting, you'll find yourself teamed with other people. You eventually bond with team members as you work on your routines and material. Your team members encourage and support you, giving you honest feedback on your delivery and material in order to help you fine tune your comedic skills. I met a lot of my current friends this way. This could be a great opportunity for you to make friends as well.\n</p><p>I think you're being way too hard on yourself. You shouldn't be giving up so easily and giving up on having friends and a social life without giving something new a try. I think that if you put yourself out there you may be pleasantly surprised. Just be yourself and talk about the things that interest you. There's nothing wrong with you. You're not some kind of social pariah - trust me. Just have a little faith in yourself.\n</p><p>If you're not interested in doing the comedy workshop, there are other opportunities to meet people. Have you ever considered volunteering in the community, at an animal shelter, soup kitchen, or veteran's shelter. Again, this is a great way to bond with people while doing something good for the community.\n</p><p>OK, I've lectured you enough.

And just what exactly does he think Ashley or Brandi could do to change our minds (as if they'd get involved with this nonsense in the first place). This would almost be funny if it weren't so pathetic.\n</p><p>Also, the fact that Christian thinks that anyone can somehow force Tiffany and I to be friends with him clearly shows that he has no respect for <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Women%27s_Rights\" title=\"Women's Rights\">our right</a> to choose our own friends. Despite what Christian may think, nobody wants friends <i>forced</i> on them. (The arrangement that Tiffany and I made in high school was a unique circumstance. We <i><b>willingly</b></i> chose to enter into the agreement.) This is yet another reason why so many people have a problem with him. Christian isn't entitled to friends - nobody is. Friendship is something you have to work at. Christian isn't willing to put even the minimal effort into this. He doesn't want friends, he wants people to kiss his ass.\n</p><p>Christian's idea of a friend is someone who will always be there to <a href=\"/cwcki/Borb\" title=\"Borb\">coddle him</a> feed his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ego\" title=\"Ego\">ego</a> in order to make him feel better about himself. Based on his remarks about Brandi and Ashley, it's also quite obvious that Christian sees his \"friends\" as some sort of personal army. Honestly Rebeckah, do you blame Tiffany and I for not wanting anything to do with Christian? Do you really want a \"friend\" like that?\n</p><p>I'm really puzzled as to why Christian wants us to be friends with Tiffany and I again after he found out that our high school friendship was arranged. He ranted about it on Facebook, and it was obvious that he was very angry and upset. He even tried to paint me as some kind of villain, and claimed that I'd shattered his heart, ruined his life, blah... blah.... blah... Does Chris somehow expect Ashley and Brandi to arrange another pity friendship and, if so, just what kind of benefit does he expect to gain from it?\n</p><p>If I were you Rebeckah, I'd seriously reconsider having anything to do with Christian. Do you really want to Google your name one day, only to find out that you've become the inspiration for Christian's latest rape fantasy porn drawing? Seriously, as a friend, I'm telling you to run, don't walk away from this.\n</p><p>Sarah\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Mimms_chimes_in\">Mimms chimes in</span></h4>\n<p>Rebeckah forwarded to Chris an email written by herself pretending to be <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Mimms\" title=\"Mimms\">Mimms</a>:<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[1]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>10 January 2014\n<p>From: Daniel Mimms\n</p><p>To: [redacted]\n</p><p>Sent: Fri, Jan 10, 2014 9:04 pm\n</p><p>Subject: Fwd: <b>We are surviving</b>\n</p><p>Rebeckah,\n</p><p>Most of the so called \"bad people\" are very sympathetic to Christian and his current plight. Most of the people of the \"<a href=\"/cwcki/CWCki_Forums\" title=\"CWCki Forums\">troll forums</a>\" are pretty decent and didn't wish this on him. There is a very small majority of people who genuinely seem to wish him harm. These people are looked down on, and generally aren't welcome on any of the forums that discuss Christian. They are typically called \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/A-Logging\" title=\"A-Logging\">A-logs</a>\" and even the notorious <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/4-cent_garbage\" title=\"4-cent garbage\">4Chan</a> has no love for them.\n</p><p>People follow and talk about Christian because of his goofy oddball antics. He's often interesting and entertaining. Christian made himself an Internet celebrity and, as a result, has a lot of people talking and blogging about him. What he's experiencing is no different than what any other celebrity experiences, except on a smaller scale. The difference is, that most celebrities handle their fame a lot better than Christian.\n</p><p>I don't know if you'll pass my message along to Christian, since you've made it pretty clear that you trust me, and I suspect that you don't like me much either, based on what Christian has told you about me. Should you decide to pass this along, I want Christian to know that the so called \"bad people\" are, at this moment, discussing ways they can help out Christian and his mom, through donations of food, clothing, and store gift cards.\n</p><p>Yes, we do have the occasional laugh over Christian's antics, but we're not the monsters he's built us up to be. Our sympathies are with Christian and his mom, even though we find the whole coffee maker story a bit unbelievable. Christian's mom is a hoarder, and their house was stuffed floor to ceiling with junk. If the house had been cleaner, they would have been able to plug their coffee maker into a kitchen outlet, instead of the more dangerous bathroom outlet, and the fire wouldn't have spread nearly as fast. This isn't to say that Christian and his mom deserved what happened to them, just that something like this was bound to happen eventually, given their living conditions.\n</p><p>Here are some recent videos to give you an idea of the condition of the inside of Christian's house.\n</p><p>These were shot a few years ago.\n</p><p>Part 1:\n</p><p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDT3zm45YaA\n</p><p>Part 2 (some of the stuff from part 1, plus shots of the outside:\n</p><p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9Lc8jLVpMY\n</p><p>Recent video taken back in the early fall:\n</p><p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrTBH_VYVD0\n</p><p>It's obvious from the videos, that Christian's house is run down and neglected, as well as being horribly and dangerously cluttered. It's likely that the house has faulty wiring, which probably caused the fire, rather than the coffee maker.\n</p><p>I'm glad that Christian, his mom, and their pets got out alive. They may have lost some personal belongings with sentimental value, but what they lost the most of was a lot of useless crap. Maybe this will be a chance for them to make a fresh start in a clean home.\n</p><p>Daniel Mimms\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Post-fire_assessment\">Post-<a href=\"/cwcki/2014_house_fire\" title=\"2014 house fire\">fire</a> assessment</span></h4>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#F2CECE; border:1px dotted #BFA3A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>11 January 2014\n<p>From: Christian Weston Chandler\n</p><p>To: [redacted]\n</p><p>Sent: Sat, Jan 11, 2014 10:29 pm\n</p><p>Subject: Re: <b>Donated Items</b>\n</p><p>I have posted a public update on my Facebook earlier with our clothing needs and suggested Gift Card sources, including the copy/paste of the \"Anyone who wishes to help\" paragraph above that.
