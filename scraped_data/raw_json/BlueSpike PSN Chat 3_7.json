Oh yeah, I see. Cuz the thing is, I- I quit a while ago, Chris, because i-i-it just- I don't know why, people doubt Molvanîa so much. It's...\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Oh, I was listening- alright- she was listening on my earpiece, dad. \n</p><p><font color=\"#00AF33\"><b>Bob (matter-of-factly):</b></font> I see.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Just to let you know.\n</p><p><font color=\"#00AF33\"><b>Bob:</b></font> Well, it's the... All the countries keep changing. I keep telling Christian, I've been around for 81 years and I've seen this world change a lot and it's hard to keep track of which countries are what countries anymore or what they were earlier. \n</p><p><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Yes, I underst-\n</p><p><font color=\"#00AF33\"><b>Bob:</b></font> Also a lot of people, very few people, really, seem to care what, uh, uh, where the countries of the world are, they don't even know. I happen to know a lot of 'em because I collected stamps back in 1930s. \n</p><p><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Ah, that's interesting.\n</p><p><font color=\"#00AF33\"><b>Bob:</b></font> And, uh, I got my first stamp, actually... first foreign stamp I got... was a stamp from Romania...\n</p><p><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Hm.\n</p><p><font color=\"#00AF33\"><b>Bob:</b></font> and it shows the former child-king of Romania riding on a white horse, and I guess that was about 1935, '36, somewhere in there, so, um... and I've still got that stamp, as a matter of fact.\n</p><p><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Ah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#00AF33\"><b>Bob:</b></font> But very few people really, particularly in this country, really understand the makeup of the world. I have been very interested in the world since I was 10 years old, and that was 70 years ago and then, the, uh... I'm very fond of and I really truly believe in the United Nations, but you won't find anybody else in my countryside or around here, I think, that does. [<i>chuckling</i>] But anyway, I'm very world conscious. \n</p><p><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#00AF33\"><b>Bob:</b></font> And I've tried to train Christian in being conscious of the world, but it's awful hard for him to understand because he- he knows about <a href=\"/cwcki/Charlottesville,_VA\" title=\"Charlottesville, VA\">Charlottesville</a> and he knows about our little county here in <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greene_County,_Virginia\" title=\"wikipedia:Greene County, Virginia\">Greene</a>. And he knows about places that are fifty, a hundred miles away, but he doesn't really comprehend a thing. Countries or cities or anything that's- that's really farther away. Like I don't think he really comprehends <a href=\"/cwcki/Finland\" title=\"Finland\">Europe</a> or... or Asia or anywhere like that and, uh, I think it hard that... to have... most people think about that or comprehend that. Cuz I'm- I'm kind of a loner, and I worked for General Electric while I was working as an engineer and I traveled all over the world and all over the country, which is fortunate because Christian was telling me you're up in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Ohio_trip\" title=\"Ohio trip\">Cleveland area</a> and some of my favorite eating spots are in the Cleveland area.\n</p><p><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Ah, that's interesting.\n</p><p><font color=\"#00AF33\"><b>Bob:</b></font> In fact, uh, I used to go visit a... engineering company called Western Engineering over in the, uh... um... I guess here in the west end of Cleveland and, uh, around the corner from Western Engineering was a little, uh, spaghetti place and hot dog place and we used to get hot dogs and beans and hot dogs and sauerkraut there every day for lunch when I went up there. And so, and out at the airport, when I used to fly into the airport I used to get there at 10 or 12 o'clock at night. I used to go to the motel there and in the motel at the airport they had a little restaurant that had the- the best... uh, um, split-pea soup you've ever seen in your life. I spent a lot of time in Cleveland and, ah, I got a lot of controls around there. \n</p><p><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Huh.\n</p><p><font color=\"#00AF33\"><b>Bob:</b></font> Automation of different types of industries. Like I worked a lot with Goodrich and Goodyear down in <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akron,_Ohio\" title=\"wikipedia:Akron, Ohio\">Akron</a> and at <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent,_Ohio\" title=\"wikipedia:Kent, Ohio\">Kent</a>, down in <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_State_University\" title=\"wikipedia:Kent State University\">Kent University</a>. And I have a whole bunch of controls for GE down in a little town called <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravenna,_Ohio\" title=\"wikipedia:Ravenna, Ohio\">Ravenna</a>. \n</p><p><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Huh.\n</p><p><font color=\"#00AF33\"><b>Bob:</b></font> Now you may have heard of Ravenna.\n</p><p><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Yeah, I have.\n</p><p><font color=\"#00AF33\"><b>Bob:</b></font> Because they have a big German population, I guess, in Ravenna. And, uh, I've got a whole bunch of controls there, too. It was an int-interesting life I had. But I'm still- I'm still much more world conscious than, uh, I think most of the people in this country, anyway. At least, I think so. Most people you ask them where a country is and they could say 'Is that on this planet?' \n</p><p><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Hmm.\n</p><p><font color=\"#00AF33\"><b>Bob:</b></font> They don't even know about it. At least I know about most of 'em. But some of 'em change. And Christian got all upset cuz I didn't know where your country is. \n</p><p><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Huh.\n</p><p><font color=\"#00AF33\"><b>Bob:</b></font> But then I guess your country was part of the Soviet Union at one time, wasn't it?\n</p><p><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> I suppose it was, yes.\n</p><p><font color=\"#00AF33\"><b>Bob:</b></font> So [<i>garbled</i>] all those states I've always wondered, I know there was 14 or 15 different states that comprised the USSR and I always wondered when they broke up back, what, 10, 12, 15 years ago, how many of those states became independent, independent countries. 'Cause I know that Ukraine was one of 'em and I know Belarus was one of them. \n</p><p><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Huh.\n</p><p><font color=\"#00AF33\"><b>Bob:</b></font> And because that's where all the famous gymnasts come from. \n</p><p><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Hmm.\n</p><p><font color=\"#00AF33\"><b>Bob:</b></font> But, uh, I haven't heard of yours. \n</p><p><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Uh...\n</p><p><font color=\"#00AF33\"><b>Bob:</b></font> Your country, but it's sandwiched in there between Romania and Bulgaria, I guess and, uh, do you have an outlet to the Black Sea there?\n</p><p><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Huh?\n</p><p><font color=\"#00AF33\"><b>Bob:</b></font> I was looking at the Black Sea area on the map, and I don't think that your country actually- you don't have an outlet to the Black Sea, I guess.\n</p><p><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Uh. Um. [<i>pregnant pause</i>] I dunno. [<i>long garbled section, something about schools teaching cooking, I think?</i>]\n</p><p><font color=\"#00AF33\"><b>Bob:</b></font> Yeah, that's the way the schools are here. They don't teach ya about all these other places, and other countries, and... and things like that. That's why I think you'll find I think I'm kinda unusual. \n</p><p><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#00AF33\"><b>Bob:</b></font> You won't find many people like me around... cuz I'm a firm believer in the United Nations and, uh, I always have been and I collect the United Nations stamps also. I'm- I'm, uh, since I've retired, which has been after 20 years I guess, I really haven't had much contact with people so I don't get to talk about all this much.\n</p><p><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#00AF33\"><b>Bob:</b></font> I've tried to teach Christian and whether he's, uh, got any comprehension of the world or not, uh, I dunno. He had a tough time with Australia a few months back before he finally got it through his head where Australia was. But I- I- I love the- all the foreign countries and foreign music 'cause I love music, and I've got maybe 15 to 20,000 long play records of, uh, classical music and, uh, some are classical music, jazz, and blues, and <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/big_band\" title=\"wikipedia:big band\">big band</a> and... everything all the way to Dixielands, all the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boogie-woogie\" title=\"wikipedia:boogie-woogie\">boogie-woogie</a>, all the stuff back to the... '20s. I love music, and I love foreign countries' musics too.\n</p><p><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> It's more interesting, huh?\n</p><p><font color=\"#00AF33\"><b>Bob:</b></font> Most people, uh, they wouldn't, uh... particularly the young people, they don't- they seem to be disinterested in what's around them. I don't really understand that. I was always... when I grew up, I was always somehow conscious of the world rather than where I was here. I never quite understood that, but that's the way I was.\n</p><p><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Huh. Hm, I understand, sir-\n</p><p><font color=\"#00AF33\"><b>Bob:</b></font> [<i>indistinct</i>] I wish Christian [<i>indistinct</i>] interested in the world, but he's not.\n</p><p><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#00AF33\"><b>Bob:</b></font> Well, he hadn't been, I've tried to teach him. Maybe you could teach him some.\n</p><p><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Heh, I hope so.\n</p><p><font color=\"#00AF33\"><b>Bob:</b></font> But do they have any, uh, I- I know one of my favorite cities, music-wise, is Vienna...\n</p><p><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Hm.\n</p><p><font color=\"#00AF33\"><b>Bob:</b></font> i-in Austria. And you know all the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viennese_waltz\" title=\"wikipedia:Viennese waltz\">Viennese waltzes</a>, uhh, all the stuff that comes out of Austria- [<i>veria???</i>] there, and all that area. And, uh, I've got a lot on record. What- what kind of folk music do they have in, uh- in where- where you- where you come from? Is- another one of my favorite composers is <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tchaikovsky\" title=\"wikipedia:Tchaikovsky\">Tchaikovsky</a>.\n</p><p><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Hm.\n</p><p><font color=\"#00AF33\"><b>Bob:</b></font> Which I knew came from just north up there in- in <a href=\"/cwcki/Russia\" title=\"Russia\">Russia</a>.\n</p><p><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Well, actually, we have very limited selection of music in Molvanîa, wasn't really- it wasn't really a very well connected country, if you know what I mean?\n</p><p><font color=\"#00AF33\"><b>Bob:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Mm.\n</p><p><font color=\"#00AF33\"><b>Bob:</b></font> Yeah, you probably were- you were under the Soviet rule and they probably put you under their thumb for a lot of years.\n</p><p><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#00AF33\"><b>Bob:</b></font> And, uh... it- it's- We've had the advantage here of being basically free, or independent. And- as you've found out, and everybody does their own thing and thinks their own way and... and [<i>chuckle</i>] fortunately I, uh... some of my best friends have always been people from the foreign countries.\n</p><p><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Hm!\n</p><p><font color=\"#00AF33\"><b>Bob:</b></font> Like my best friend while I was working in, um... one [<i>???</i>], about 15 years, was all the way from Turkey. He was a Turkish engineer and, uh, he came over here and, uh, ended up being a doctorate in engineering but, uh, my- my- [<i>audio cut?</i>] -was his name.\n</p><p><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Hm.\n</p><p><font color=\"#00AF33\"><b>Bob:</b></font> I had a tough time learning how to tell s- even say his name. [<i>chuckling</i>] Anyway, he was one of my best friends... and he had a friend called Dr. [<i>???</i>] who was a doctor, a medical doctor, that worked at the, uh, DA hospital, in uh- [<i>audio cut?</i>] But some of my best friends people from the- from the foreign countries.
