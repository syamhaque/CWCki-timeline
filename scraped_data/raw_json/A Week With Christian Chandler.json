Chandler (A Self-Documentary)</b>\", more commonly known as \"<b>A Week With Christian Chandler</b>\", was a school report that <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler\">Chris</a> wrote to document one week in his <a href=\"/cwcki/Manchester_High_School\" title=\"Manchester High School\">high school</a> life. The week documented was 29 April through 5 May <a href=\"/cwcki/2000\" title=\"2000\">2000</a>, when Chris was <a href=\"/cwcki/My_big_18th_party\" title=\"My big 18th party\">18</a> (although Chris gave the report a <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_copyright\" title=\"Chris and copyright\">copyright</a> date of 24 April 2000). Many events were covered during these seven short days, but the most significant among them must be the creation of the cover for <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Christian%27s_Favorite_Hits!\" title=\"Christian's Favorite Hits!\">Christian's Favorite Hits!</a></i>, on which <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(character)\" title=\"Sonichu (character)\">Sonichu</a> made his first-ever appearance.\n</p><p>The information contained within Chris's report provides valuable insight into his early years, chronicling the development of some of his current hobbies and habits. As just one example, he <a href=\"/cwcki/Honest_Content\" title=\"Honest Content\">openly admits to</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Honor_roll\" title=\"Honor roll\">falling asleep during his classes</a> on a regular basis, foreshadowing his future inactivity and overall laziness post-<a href=\"/cwcki/Piedmont_Virginia_Community_College\" title=\"Piedmont Virginia Community College\">college</a>. Chris seems to have been enrolled in basic behavioral-adjustment classes, including a \"coping class/study hall\", but he evidently spent all of his time in these classes reading <a href=\"/cwcki/R.L._Stine\" title=\"R.L. Stine\">R.L. Stine</a> books instead of paying attention. Also, Chris refers to some of the other students on his school bus as \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Slow-in-the-minds\" title=\"Slow-in-the-minds\">slow-in-the-minds</a>\".\n</p><p>This account of his high school days is nowhere near as idyllic as he would later portray them to be, suggesting that he has <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">romanticized</a> them.\n</p>\n<div

href=\"/cwcki/Card_games\" title=\"Card games\">Pokémon Trading Card Game</a> League at <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Books-A-Million\" title=\"Books-A-Million\">Books-A-Million</a>. All ready to go, Christian and his mother leave for the League. On the way, they stop at B.P. gas station, so Christian could fill his sports bottle with some refreshing <a href=\"/cwcki/Obesity\" title=\"Obesity\">soda pop</a>. After Christian enters Books-A-Million for the League, he sees someone with a rare, holographic \"Team Rocket\" Dark Raichu card. So he offers all his tradable holo rare cards and non-holo rare cards, but the boy did not want to trade his Dark Raichu card. After signing in with Marc, the Gym Leader, he trades a few cards, then he plays many card games. Much later, because of the release of the Team Rocket cards, now available in stores, a party was held with games and prizes. We watched as League members played a Musical Poke Ball game. A costume contest was also held; 5 people came dressed as Team Rocket members. But Christian was wearing his Ash get-up, like he usually wears every Saturday; it was originally a Halloween costume, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_fashion\" title=\"Chris and fashion\">but he thought of it as also a formal item to wear for the League</a>. So, he entered and won 1st prize, a cool T-shirt. After receiving the T-shirt, he left for home so he could get to Ruckersville before dark.\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Page_3\">Page 3</span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:409-CWCWeekP3.jpg\"><img alt=\"409-CWCWeekP3.jpg\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"357\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/e/e3/409-CWCWeekP3.jpg/300px-409-CWCWeekP3.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/e/e3/409-CWCWeekP3.jpg/450px-409-CWCWeekP3.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/e/e3/409-CWCWeekP3.jpg/600px-409-CWCWeekP3.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:409-CWCWeekP3.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div></div></div></div>\n<p>[Photo: Chris, seated on his bed, holds up a number of Pokémon trading cards.

He helped his <a href=\"/cwcki/Barbara_Chandler\" title=\"Barbara Chandler\">mother</a> by moving <a href=\"/cwcki/11042009_51_50\" title=\"11042009 51 50\">heavy and light boxes</a>, furniture and stuff from the van to the house, and house to workshop. Afterwards, they loaded the van, got ready to leave and left for Richmond. On the way, they stopped at <a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_restaurants#Country_Cookin\" title=\"List of restaurants\">Country Cooking</a> restaurant in Orange County for lunch. Later, they returned to Richmond, and re-unloaded their van. But, even though they worked hard today, putting and taking, there is still a lot to move back to Ruckersville.\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Page_5\">Page 5</span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:411-CWCWeekP5.jpg\"><img alt=\"411-CWCWeekP5.jpg\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"354\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/b/b8/411-CWCWeekP5.jpg/300px-411-CWCWeekP5.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/b/b8/411-CWCWeekP5.jpg/450px-411-CWCWeekP5.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/b/b8/411-CWCWeekP5.jpg/600px-411-CWCWeekP5.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:411-CWCWeekP5.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div></div></div></div>\n<p>[Photo: Chris's bedroom appears cluttered, yet cleaner than it's been ever since.

The 1st class he went to was his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/English\" title=\"English\">English</a> class with Mr. Goss.

Today, Mrs. Tortorella talked about eggs and microwaves, and from the eggs, I'm hungry.

But instead, we will observe the daily activities the he does at home. He likes to play his video games (i.e. <a href=\"/cwcki/Pok%C3%A9mon\" title=\"Pokémon\">Pokemon</a> [sic], <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog\" title=\"Sonic the Hedgehog\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>, etc....).

He also likes to sort and look through his book of Pokemon \"Trading Card Game\" cards and his decks. And he also likes to express himself in his art. Then later, he brushes his teeth, takes a shower, say [sic] \"good night\" to his parents, watch a little <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/TV\" title=\"TV\">TV</a>, then he goes to bed with music to relax to.\n</p><p>[Photo: Chris is sitting in his bedroom, playing Pokémon.

Christian came to school wearing a dress shirt and pants, a tie, and his cap and gown were in the bag. He went to English class, and took a vocabulary quiz. After the quiz, Christian signed the Senior Memory Book of his friend, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Miranda_Joyce_Mitchell\" title=\"Miranda Joyce Mitchell\">Miranda Mitchell</a>. During Trigonometry class, he took notes on SSA triangles and the Sine formula. Then in Computer Graphics class, he sketched an idea for a self portrait, and it suited the requirements. But, he'll have to wait till next class, because he needs a couple of his \"home files\" to start him off. In Spanish 2, he started on a test, but he did not finish it, because he had to go for the Senior Group Photo. Christian had to walk down a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Reality\" title=\"Reality\">mile-long</a> hill to the football stadium, and when he got there, he put his stuff down in the entrance, put on his cap and gown, and went to join the group of seniors. After the long wait for the pictures to be taken, being crowded like a sardine surrounded by <a href=\"/cwcki/JERKS\" title=\"JERKS\">immature teenage boys</a>, and having the hot, hot sun shining down on him and everyone else, he went back to the shady entrance. He got his stuff, and on the way back up the hill, his bus driver drove down to tell him that she called his father and told him about Christian and the photo shoot taking so long. So Christian walked back up the hill, he became tired and sweaty. After he entered the school building, he rested in the open commons for a few minutes. Then he buzzed for his father to pick him up, got ready to go, chilled out, and got picked up by his dad. And that concludes our week-long documentary of...A Week With Christian W. Chandler, the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Autistic\" title=\"Autistic\">autistic</a> boy that has made it this far. :)\n</p><p>[Photo: Miranda is seated at a desk.
