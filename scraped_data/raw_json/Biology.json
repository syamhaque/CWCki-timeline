Chris believed that the male reproductive system has a limited amount of sperm cells that decreases every time he <a href=\"/cwcki/Mass_debating\" title=\"Mass debating\">nuts</a>. To counteract this supposed decrease, he drank his own semen to make sure he can get potential <a href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart\" title=\"Sweetheart\">sweethearts</a> (and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Julie\" title=\"Julie\">13 year old boys</a>) pregnant. Although he has given up this act in more recent years, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris%27s_Specimen_Sample\" title=\"Chris's Specimen Sample\">a video from 27 February 2016</a> shows that he now believes keeping semen inside his refrigerator will keep it viable not knowing that is actually kills the cells. Ultimately, the only thing this will do is give him ice cubes to use in his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Fanta\" title=\"Fanta\">Fanta</a>.\n</p><p>Chris also supported a claim that transgender women can get periods<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup>, <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_sense\" title=\"wikipedia:Common sense\">which is false</a>. Abdominal cramps are common for biological women during periods; for MTF women, this is impossible due the lack of a uterus. Feeling under the weather is also a common symptom of periods caused due to changes in hormones released by the female brain and uterus since Chris lacks both a uterus and common sense he is imagining his symptoms. While <i>it is</i> in theory possible to experience a form of sympathetic pain (pain felt by directly witnessing or viewing someone else in pain) related to periods, given Chris's <a href=\"/cwcki/My_Little_Pony\" title=\"My Little Pony\">preferred</a> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Video_games\" title=\"Video games\">viewing</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Anime\" title=\"Anime\">habits</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_mental_healthcare\" title=\"Chris and mental healthcare\">general apathy</a>, it is unlikely this is the source of what he claims to feel.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Penis\">Penis</span></h3>\n<p>Chris has been known to have a few misconceptions about male genitalia, one of the many problems Chris consistently suffers from with his is Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs), due to his <a href=\"/cwcki/DIRTY,_CRAPPED_BRIEFS\" title=\"DIRTY, CRAPPED BRIEFS\">issues</a> with <a href=\"/cwcki/SingStar_Challenge_Round_5\" title=\"SingStar Challenge Round 5\">sanitation</a>, brought on by <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_work\" title=\"Chris and work\">sloth</a> and poor <a href=\"/cwcki/Barbara_Chandler\" title=\"Barbara Chandler\">parental</a> influence. He also once believed the product <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExtenZe\" title=\"wikipedia:ExtenZe\">ExtenZe</a> was capable of enlarging the penis outside of puberty, which proved to be untrue, due to lack of results, and so Chris stopped using it fairly quickly. Chris also seems to be under a very strong impression that the size of the genitalia has a large bearing on one's social status,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup> or pleasure in sex, since he has often vastly over-estimated its size. He readily claims it to be 6 inches,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup> however, most visual evidence suggests that it is perhaps from 3 to 5 inches, which is below average.\n</p><p>Chris also seems to think that the penis is an outwardly grown clitoris.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup> This of course is inaccurate, due to their vast functional differences, and could be a misinterpretation of the way fetuses form their genitalia in the womb.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sexual_Reassignment\">Sexual Reassignment</span></h3>\n<p>Chris has been known to have a <a href=\"/cwcki/Un-clit#September_18th_Facebook_Status\" title=\"Un-clit\">negative opinion</a> of <a href=\"/cwcki/Duck\" title=\"Duck\">male genitalia</a>, so when he officially became a trans-woman he saw fit to exchange his pickle for some <a href=\"/cwcki/China\" title=\"China\">china</a>. However, surgery is notoriously expensive in the USA, and unfortunately no current health insurance plans cover delusions and <a href=\"/cwcki/Magical_thinking\" title=\"Magical thinking\">magical thinking</a>, so Chris had to do it the old fashioned way: <a href=\"/cwcki/Subliminal_Frequency_Hypnosis\" title=\"Subliminal Frequency Hypnosis\">Subliminal Frequency Hypnosis</a>. Despite the apparent ineffectiveness of the Aural treatment at first, Chris could feel the vagina growing inside of him, so he freed it by <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Self-inflicted_taint_wound\" title=\"Self-inflicted taint wound\">cutting open his taint with a kitchen knife</a></i>. Unfortunately, this still did not provide results that Chris was happy with, having only his pickle and a wound on his taint to show for his very careful meditations and precise surgical project. Chris has not tried to conduct any sexual reassignment that we know of since.\n</p><p>If he does eventually want to complete his sexual reassignment surgery, it is recommended that he should seek the guidance a healthcare professional. However, it is uncertain if there is a possibility of Chris ever being in a <a href=\"/cwcki/Debt\" title=\"Debt\">financial position</a> to pay for the surgery.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Vagina\">Vagina</span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:MaryWantsIt.JPG\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"333\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/0/0c/MaryWantsIt.JPG/300px-MaryWantsIt.JPG\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/0/0c/MaryWantsIt.JPG/450px-MaryWantsIt.JPG 1.5x, /w/images/0/0c/MaryWantsIt.JPG 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:MaryWantsIt.JPG\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Mary Lee Walsh's china seems oddly positioned.</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:ShecameforCWC_(200803).JPG\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"232\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/6/6c/ShecameforCWC_%28200803%29.JPG/300px-ShecameforCWC_%28200803%29.JPG\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/6/6c/ShecameforCWC_%28200803%29.JPG/450px-ShecameforCWC_%28200803%29.JPG 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/6/6c/ShecameforCWC_%28200803%29.JPG/600px-ShecameforCWC_%28200803%29.JPG 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:ShecameforCWC_(200803).JPG\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>How to ruin a friendship in the most thorough of ways.</div></div></div>\n<p>Having been a <a href=\"/cwcki/Virgin_with_rage\" title=\"Virgin with rage\">virgin with rage</a> in the past, Chris's constant involvement with <a href=\"/cwcki/Kimmi\" title=\"Kimmi\">sex dolls</a> and piles upon piles of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Porn\" title=\"Porn\">porn</a> have warped his perception of what a vagina truly is. Having used sex dolls, Chris often locates the vagina as higher than it should be (i.e; below the belly button), indicating that he thinks that vaginas are located on a woman in the same place that a penis is on a man. One of the photos that Chris uploaded in his <a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_Chris%27s_edits_to_Encyclopedia_Dramatica\" title=\"List of Chris's edits to Encyclopedia Dramatica\">edit war against Encyclopedia Dramatica</a> features <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Mary Lee Walsh</a>. Walsh is depicted stroking her genitalia, wanting a <a href=\"/cwcki/Jerkop\" title=\"Jerkop\">Jerkop</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Niggos\" title=\"Niggos\">slave</a> to lick her pussy. Her vagina is clearly deformed, having the ability to stretch as much as Chris depicted, opening at the diameter of a normal person's hand-span, something that can only be achieved through years of fisting, meaning <a href=\"/cwcki/Count_Graduon\" title=\"Count Graduon\">Count Graduon</a> has been of more use to her than once implied.\n</p><p>Another instance of Chris proving his ignorance of basic female anatomy is the infamous ShecameforCWC.JPG image. Not only is <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Megan\" title=\"Megan\">Megan</a>'s torso completely straight and has no waist, but once again Chris makes the vaginal opening far too large and uses blue lines to depict <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Masturbating_and_squirtin%27\" title=\"Masturbating and squirtin'\">her squirtin'</a>, causing it to look like she has blue pubic hair or her vagina is glowing.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Neuroscience\">Neuroscience</span></h2>\n<p><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_mental_healthcare\" title=\"Chris and mental healthcare\">Chris and mental healthcare</a></i>\n</p><p>Chris rejects the notion that <a href=\"/cwcki/Asperger_syndrome\" title=\"Asperger syndrome\">Asperger's syndrome</a> is equal to <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">autism</a>, though it is a well proven fact in the scientific community. He thinks that people with Asperger's steal the limelight from people with autism, though this doesn't make any sense since not only are both of them on the same spectrum, but (as of 2013) Asperger's is considered the same as the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/High-functioning_autism\" title=\"High-functioning autism\">high-functioning autism</a> that Chris is quick to call himself.\n</p><p>Chris believes that the mind and body are separate entities where the mind can move between different bodies I.e the body is nothing more than a vessel for his mind. This has never been proved and most research points to different inter-neuronal connections being the reason for different personalities.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Health_and_Disease\">Health and Disease</span></h2>\n<p><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_health\" title=\"Chris and health\">Chris and health</a>.</i>\n</p><p>Chris relationship with health and disease is hit or miss that is, he is hit with diseases and misses health.\n</p><p>During the <a href=\"/cwcki/COVID-19\" title=\"COVID-19\">COVID-19</a> pandemic, Chris refused to learn about the symptoms of the virus, saying it will make him more prone to being infected. He also watched the anime <i>Cells at Work</i>, a series featuring anthropomorphic blood cells taking care of a human body and claimed it would boost his immune system. Possibly thinking being worried about the disease will weaken his immune system and being happy will increase his immunity.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a class=\"external free\" href=\"https://twitter.com/cwcsonichu/status/1016786884192808962\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://twitter.com/cwcsonichu/status/1016786884192808962</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey_Call_11\" title=\"Kacey Call 11\">Kacey Call 11</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-3\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-3\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_humps_his_PS3\" title=\"Chris humps his PS3\">Chris humps his PS3</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-4\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-4\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"/cwcki/March_2017_Facebook_Posts#Transgenders_in_locker_rooms\" title=\"March 2017 Facebook Posts\">March 2017 Facebook Posts#Transgenders in locker rooms</a></span>\n</li>\n</ol></div>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n</p>\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"navbox\" style=\";\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"padding:2px;\">\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"nowraplinks collapsible autocollapse\" style=\"width:100%;background:transparent;color:inherit;;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<th class=\"navbox-title\" colspan=\"2\" style=\";\"><div style=\"float:left; width:6em;text-align:left;\"> <span class=\"noprint plainlinksneverexpand\" style=\"white-space:nowrap; font-weight:normal; font-size:xx-small; ;;border:none;;\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Template:Education\" title=\"Template:Education\"><span style=\";;border:none;;\" title=\"View this template\">v</span></a> <span style=\"font-size:80%;\">•</span> <a class=\"new\" href=\"/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Education&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" title=\"Template talk:Education (page does not exist)\"><span style=\"color:#002bb8;;;border:none;;\" title=\"Discussion about this template\">d</span></a> <span style=\"font-size:80%;\">•</span> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"//sonichu.com/w/index.php?title=Template:Education&amp;action=edit\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#002bb8;;;border:none;;\" title=\"You can edit this template.
