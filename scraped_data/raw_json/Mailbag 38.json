In the old days villains got a Curse-Ye-Ha-Me-Ha or beaten up but they weren't killed.\n</p><p>There are way too many characters, it seems like you added so many that you frequently forget they even exist and there are a lot of plot lines you brought up but haven't reso lved.

No one wants to see porn of hedgehogs in a children's comic, even if you like porn, hedgehog sex is still really gross.\n</p><p>The only way I can see you fixing the franchise now is to throw out everything and start fresh. Go back to the birth of Sonichu and go from there. You don't have to worry about characters you no longer care about or plots you don't care to resolve. You can bring back all the good stuff about Sonichu and get rid of the bad. Most successful franchises have done this.

It only drives people away, and adds to the ranks of the trolls.\n</p><p>Recently you've begun hating on a perfectly good webcomic (Asperchu) simply because it's a parody.

Why are you so immature and spiteful? Did someone molest you as a child?\n</p><p>You recently tried to justify your hatred by saying \"I pray to God for forgiveness\". You can't keep doing that; praying to God for forgiveness means that you are legitimately sorry for your sins and that you promise to never repeat them, yet here you are, shouting death threats at people once again. You spit in the face of your own God; I'm an atheist and I know that's fucking wrong. You're going straight to hell for lying to God.\n</p><p>- Von Riffenstein\n</p><p>P.S.
