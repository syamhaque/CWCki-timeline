I hope my \"straight to the point, here are our\nquestions\" format is acceptable.\n</p><p>1.) You mentioned year zero? I understand this is some sort of satanic thing based on the\nlyrics to the song Year Zero, by the Swedish black metal band Ghost/Ghost BCO Were\nyou battling demons like Asmodeus (the wicked half demon brother of Solomon) Lucifer\n(the devil/samael/satan) behemoth and belial (the father of all nosferatu)\n</p><p>2.) I'm something of a lonely head, will things be different after the dimensional merge? Is\nthere any chance you could introduce me to psylocke/kwannon, cammy white, jean grey,\npoison ivy/pamela isley, starlight/annie january, tifa lockheart,bloodrayne, scarlett/shanna\no'hara, lucy heafflla, d va, widowmaker and or nami? My second nephew jeremy is\nbeing teased in middle school for not having a girlfriend could you maybe introduce him\nto Aska Langty soriyu, sailor mars, rikku or sailor mercury?\n</p><p>3.) You keep talking in letters made public about how we shouldnt believe fanfiction? Are\nyou saying the whole phone call where you admitted to having sex with barbera weston\nchandler ▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇ confirming the same thing didnt\nhappen? That the whole you banging your mom was some kind of fanfiction that was\nwarped into existing in reality? Are you saying it was retconned and didn't happen?\n</p><p>4.) What is the cost of paper, stamps, envelope, pens, and pencils in jail? Also are we\nallowed to send in blank paper and or blank envelopes inside letters?\n</p><p>5.) Since you are the literal reincamation of Jesus, what do you think of the situation in\nIsrael/the west bank/gaza strip? Do you think the Israelis are treating the Palastinians\nfairly? Since this is your homeland I was wondering what you'd have to say. I know a lot\nof people think that the Palestinians were wrongfully removed from their homeland by\nthe Israelis and they are trying to force all of them out.\n</p><p>6.) I was wondering if you had anything to say regarding george mcfloyd the black man who\nwas kneed on the neck to death by police while he was in custody? His son %rtin is\nheart broken :(\n</p><p>7.) What was your take on the insurrection of january 6th 2021 , where Donald Trump's\nsupporters tried to take over America after the former president's ungracious loss.\n</p><p>8.) Kyle Rittenhouse the guy who went to a counter protest of black lives matter after a\nblack man who was a wife beater was gunned down by the police was acquitted of killing\n2 protestors who attacked him with guns, skateboards and a charging attack. Do you\nthink this was justified? Kyle illegally possessed a gun without a permit, traveled into a\nstate where his gun wasn't legal, fled the scene of an accident and was out after curfew.\nHe was acquitted of all his wrong doings? What's your opinion on his conviction or lack\nthereof?\n</p><p>9.) What do you think of the covid-19 pandemic? A Lot of people think the coronavirus isnt\nreal and is just a conspiracy? That it's no more dangerous than the flu. Many people\nwish to \"reopen america!\" More troubling is that many people (including close friends and\nfamily members of mine) think that the vaccine is dangerous as it was supposedly\n\"rushed out without enough testing, and not FDA approved\" they have refused to get exist.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#F2CECE; border:1px dotted #BFA3A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Other conspiracies keep circulating such as the vaccine IEing the mark of the\n<p>beast from the of revelations, the vaccine sterilizes young wornen, the vaccine\ncauses autism and the vaccine kills you in 5 years. What do you think of covid-19 and\nthe vaccine? A few family ræmbers of mine refuse to get vaccinated because the church\nthey belong to hasn't sanctioned the vacane. They are extreme devout trump supporters\nthat followed trumps doctrine to the letter and keep insisting the pandemic is one big\nhoax and made up by the liberal media in soæ kind of 4D chess scheme so that the\ndemocrats can eize power and take their guns and abortion rights away.\n</p><p>10.) Senator Majory Taylor Green has declared that the 9/11 terrorist attacks never\nactually happened and the world trade center still stands? I found these comments\nto say fre least? But could this be connected to the dimensional merge? Was 9/11\nretconned into not happening like the sex with barb? Does that mean the people who\ndied that day are alive and people can go back to their jobs for the world trade\norganization?\n</p><p>11.) Internet infarnous person jessca yaniv is suing a nail salon for refusing to wax her\ntestides. She is faking trans in an attempt to make a frivolous \nlawsuit and hurting the trans community. Do you have an opinion on this?\n</p><p>12.) Former nickelodeon producer dan schiender and nusician marilyn manson were\nrecently charged with sex against minors? What do you think should happn to\nthem?\n</p><p>The jail you're in seems to have had its website shut down for fre last several weeks. It doesnt\nlook like we can donate to you online. I would have sent some money but wasnt sure of the\nprocedure of donating via sending to you directly and if it was legal or not. Some slanderous\ntrolls accused your mentioning of \"meditating\" being code for \"masterbating\" something you\nshould be aware of, you may need to address in the future. Are you aware of a third person\nwho failed their test? There was a youtuber, whom you admitted to •soul bonding\" with. They\nmessaged you and you asked them not to share the admission of guilt and they shared it with\nthe internet. It was not Null, nor was it Bella. It was someone who makes youtube videos that\nyou were in contact with? Do you know who Ürn talking about?\n</p><p>Sincerely,\n</p>\n<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>\n<p>I was getting rid of some old books and was wondering if you wanted any of them I could mai\nthem to you. They are as follows: The Book of Mormon by Joseph Smith, The Lesser Key of\nSolomon by Unknown Author, The Testament of Solomon by Unknown Author, The Simon\nNecronomicon also by Unknown Author (101 people really dont know who wrote these), the\nTalmud (Jewish equivalent of the bible, similar to the torah or old testarnent but contains\nomitted material) and the Book of the Law by Aleister Crowley.
