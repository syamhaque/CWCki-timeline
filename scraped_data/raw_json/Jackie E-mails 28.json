Chris shares more of his adventures as a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tomgirl\" title=\"Tomgirl\">tomgirl</a>, including public harassment, <a href=\"/cwcki/Tomboys_And_Tomgirls_of_Virginia\" title=\"Tomboys And Tomgirls of Virginia\">online socialization</a>, and body <a href=\"/cwcki/Hair\" title=\"Hair\">hair</a> removal. He is already imagining himself as a <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos#Chris_the_lesbian\" title=\"Homos\">lesbian</a>, three years before he would publicly come out as one. He is far more engrossed in ideas about makeup and navel piercings than getting a job or <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Robert_Chandler\" title=\"Robert Chandler\">his father</a>'s declining health. Chris continually reminds Jackie that he wants to meet her. Finally she relents and they begin to make plans to get together in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Charlottesville\" title=\"Charlottesville\">Charlottesville</a> for the Fourth of July.\n</p><p><br/>\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #B48246; padding:5px; background-color:#FCC\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>June 3, 2011 10:35pm\n<p>Hey Chris!\n</p><p>Sorry I haven't written back sooner, hectic couple of days. \n</p><p>I really like the purse! You have such an <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_Fashion\" title=\"Chris and Fashion\">eclectic design milieux</a>, I love seeing the stuff that you make. Don't worry about being cautious with this picture - I understand\nyou being a bit wary, what with my email account being hacked and whatnot in the past. I saved a copy of the picture so I could keep it but deleted the email right after.\nYour cool designs are safe with me. ;)\n</p><p>Anyway, thanks for your kind words regarding my mother's bad past. She has had a hard life, many trials and hardships have awaited her. She has a happy life now but it still\npains her if these sore subjects are brought up so my family likes to just focus on the good times.\n</p><p>Thanks for asking about Blueberry! Would you believe it, he flew over to my friend's house when he left? Right through her window! My friend had a hell of a time getting\nBlueberry into a corner where she could capture him and keep him safe, but eventually she did and called me, and I was able to go retrieve him. (My friend lives right down\nthe street but still, I think it's damn lucky he wound up there.) Anyway, he's safe and sound, and I'm glad to have him back.\n</p><p>So what else is going on with you? How are your parents? Are they still giving you any guff over <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tomgirl_Saga\" title=\"Tomgirl Saga\">your lifestyle</a>? I feel like I'm aching to hear about what's been going on\nwith you because I haven't been able to talk to you in a couple days.\n</p><p>Jackie\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>June 4, 2011 10:10am\n<p>I am happy to hear about Blueberry's safe return to your care. :)  \nThank you for your compliment of my purse's front compiliation. The Squinkies are optional for hooking onto such a size ring with a bracelet hook followed by placing any Squinkie on the peg. I am looking into other craft ideas involving Squinkies (without damaging them, and without gluing them); as an avid collector, I feel better in allowing my craft using decorative collectables to be optionally removable. I mean, it is soo stylish and super cute, but conditions may wear on them between weather, and newspaper ink (I think).\n</p><p><a href=\"/cwcki/Barbara_Chandler\" title=\"Barbara Chandler\">Mom</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Robert_Chandler\" title=\"Robert Chandler\">Dad</a> still give me grief on being <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tomgirl_Saga\" title=\"Tomgirl Saga\">Tomgirlly</a> sometimes, but not as much due to not wearing my skirts and high heels in front of them.  \nI will still wager that if I have a pretty and smart woman like you by my side, and in mutual true love, appreciate me in fullest makeup and dress in front of them a number of times, they will more likely back off. Or otherwise Positive Verbal or Hand-Written Feedback on me and my feminine attire from women. The other night, I went out to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sheetz\" title=\"Sheetz\">Sheetzfor</a> my mother to get her two hot dogs for a dollar; some male sees me in one of my tanks and jeans; fucking asks me \"Are you <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Gay\" title=\"Gay\">gay</a>?\" \"No, I AM a Tomgirl\", I replied. I felt pissed off to be asked that. I:(  \nEspecially after ALL of the shit I got from the <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">Trolls</a> and Cyber-Bullies with their Mislabeling me and shit.\n</p><p>Hell, if anything, I would feel a LOT better <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos#Chris_and_transgender_topics\" title=\"Homos\">being mistaken for a woman</a> or even better and more accurate, a <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos#Chris_the_lesbian\" title=\"Homos\">Lesbian</a>. :) Upon self-reflection, I feel that all things considered... Between not caring much for <a href=\"/cwcki/JERKS\" title=\"JERKS\">the Majority of the male population</a>, coping and socializing more easily and being best attracted to women, me being a Tomgirl and being most comfortable in skirt, heels, sexy/cute top or full dress, long, curled <a href=\"/cwcki/Hair\" title=\"Hair\">hair</a> and makeup... I would Best fit in at an <a href=\"/cwcki/Impulse_Gay_Social_Club\" title=\"Impulse Gay Social Club\">All-Woman (Lesbian) Bar</a>. :)\n</p><p>Have you checked out the <a href=\"/cwcki/Tomboys_And_Tomgirls_of_Virginia\" title=\"Tomboys And Tomgirls of Virginia\">Tomboy/Tomgirl Forum</a> yet? I wrote among my posts the story of me starting and feeling comfort in using the ladies' restroom. I prefer to squat over standing. ;) In case I have not mentioned it before, my avatar on that forum is an image of Applejack from the new \"Friendship is Magic\" generation of <a href=\"/cwcki/My_Little_Pony\" title=\"My Little Pony\">My Little Pony</a>. I would have gone with Rainbow Dash, but someone else on there has \nalready chosen her for their avatar, and I did not want to come off as an avatar copycat. And with my sense of picking choice designs and fashion sense, I feel more like Rarity. I am very complex. I wish I could afford the prices to have my <a href=\"/cwcki/Hair#Body_hair\" title=\"Hair\">face, legs, arms and torso waxed</a> in a nail salon or spa, so I wouldn't have to worry about shaving. Yes, I do go Brazillian too. ;)\n</p><p>On another topic, the pastor of <a href=\"/cwcki/Wesley_Memorial_United_Methodist_Church\" title=\"Wesley Memorial United Methodist Church\">my church</a> will be moving in a few weeks, and I have drawn a cute drawing of her baptizing a cow (she really likes cows; she has a collection of cow figures; so cute). And I felt inspiration to write an elaborate, sweet <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_writing#Chris_as_a_poet_and_lyricist\" title=\"Chris and writing\">poem</a> on there as well.  \nI will share the drawing and poem with you after the image-sharing check. I am also going to frame the original drawing (keeping a photocopy for myself) and attach a double set of Squinkies to the edge. \nI was hoping to find a cow Squinkie, but after checking online AND in the stores, a cow has not yet been designed. Otherwise, I would have like 4 or 6 cows on the frame. Also, with the drawing, I think it is one that <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_race#Asians\" title=\"Chris and race\">even the people of India would appreciate</a>; they <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle_in_religion\" title=\"wikipedia:Cattle in religion\">worship the cow</a> there. :)\n</p><p>That's all for now.

It's always nice to see you make use of your creative talents because you have such a deep well of ideas. And it's also practical to make sure that you don't let any of it become damaged or worn more than necessary. You should keep it up!\n</p><p>I have taken quite a look at <a href=\"/cwcki/Tomboys_And_Tomgirls_of_Virginia\" title=\"Tomboys And Tomgirls of Virginia\">the tomgirl forum</a>. It looks really cool! It looks like you've found some pretty intelligent and friendly folks there to make friends with. But I notice, you only have about 7 posts, and you haven't been back there in a few days. Are you losing interest? I don't think you should, these are people who share a lot in common with you and you should try to participate more and become friends with them. Especially because it looks like they do regular meet-ups, so you can hang out with some new friends in real life. I found a thread about it here: http://tomboytomgirls.44.forumer.com/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=27&amp;sid=94131f2d5ebcf6bee8c1caf474493af3\nSo you should try to get to know these people some more, I think you'll be glad you did.\n</p><p>Anyway, I look forward to seeing your cow drawings, please show me as soon as you feel comfortable. I'll talk to you more later!\n</p><p>Jackie\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>June 6, 2011 11:00am\n<p>Well, I have also been busy here and there with family times and dramas (also getting in on the freebies from the reopened <a href=\"/cwcki/PlayStation\" title=\"PlayStation\">PlayStation</a> Store).  \nI still feel uneasy in online socializing, I am skeptical with getting too close with people online, and I have to be cautious of any possible \ncyber-bullies. It is one thing to tell true stories while remaining under a cloak of anonimity and screen name; it is entirely something else in pouring one's heart out and risk being found out who he/she is in real life, followed by risk of being made fun, blackmail and all that shit. Not to mention my discomfort with trying to cope with other males. ...Pretty much, I am in constant observation-only mindset when it comes with the other Tomgirls to verify and further learn the ins and outs of being one myself.\n</p><p>What else is going on with you, Jackie? And I still long for meeting you in person. I would most definitely feel more comfortable and likely to lift up all of my emotional walls upon meeting you in person and hanging out for a while.

But Chris, you have to consider that I am not a tomgirl. I can be sympathetic and all, but I don't know what it's like to be a tomgirl, and I just can't give you all the support you need. But these people at this forum are just like you - they can offer the advice, emotional support, and strategies you need to make yourself the best tomgirl you can be.

That's just the way life works out sometimes - I'm a girl through and through. Being a girl is not the same thing as being a tomgirl any more than being a boy is the same as being a tomboy.\n</p><p>Well, I probably won't take a look at the forum again; it's your place of sanctuary and support, and I don't want to intrude on it.

And being tomboys and tomgirls, I'm sure they've dealt with persecution the same as you have, so the people who run that forum are probably wise to it and know how to sniff it out.
