I am working on the first episode of comics now, and I'll send you the link to my art page when I've finally gotten them up and out there. I really appreciate the name Jiggliami. It has a nice ring to it. You can totally use my character! I would love to see what kind of role, though small, you give her.\n</p><p>A short essay about my Singing <a href=\"/cwcki/Jiggliami\" title=\"Jiggliami\">Jiggliami</a>:<br/>\nName: Jiggliami<br/>\nAge: 17<br/>\n</p><p>Jiggliami was once just a wild Jigglypuff who liked to sing for her friends, but the problem was her friends would fall asleep because of her <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Pokemon\" title=\"Pokemon\">Pokemon</a> powers! So, Jigglypuff looked to the stars and wished on the <a href=\"/cwcki/Rainbow\" title=\"Rainbow\">Rainbow</a> Star to be able to share her voice with the world. The Rainbow Star fell to the earth and granted her her wish by changing her form and making the sleeping effects of her voice optional. Now named Jiggliami, she wanders the world as a famous popstar in search of a trainer and maybe true <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Love\" title=\"Love\">love</a>.\n</p><p>Just to further ask permission: I was thinking the comic with <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a> could be a one-shot where he\nrescues her, and she falls in love with him, but he tells her he cannot be with her, because he is madly in love with <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Rosey\" title=\"Rosey\">Rosey</a>. You can let me know if that is too much to use Sonichu for.\n</p><p>Thank you soooo much for the help &lt;3\n</p><p>Blanca W.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>\n<p><b>Re: Hey there, KawaiiKitsune123 from ytube</b> from Chris to Blanca on Tue 8/19/08 2:09 AM\n</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Wow!

It's like I've fallen for the character (you know, like a '<a href=\"/cwcki/Britney_Spears\" title=\"Britney Spears\">Britney Spears</a>' crush), but if I got to know the woman behind her, I would likely love her honestly and truly.

And I would like to see a photo of yourself.\n</p><p>I've attached the best photo .jpg of myself to this e-mail.\nWell, I'll start by telling about myself a bit. Well, if you've read my Author Bio on the Official Sonichu Site \n(<a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://sonichuchandler.tripod.com/cwcson.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://sonichuchandler.tripod.com/cwcson.htm</a>), as well as my <a href=\"/cwcki/MySpace\" title=\"MySpace\">MySpace</a> or <a href=\"/cwcki/Facebook\" title=\"Facebook\">Facebook</a> Profiles, you would already know a great <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Honest\" title=\"Honest\">honest</a> chunk about me. But in case you haven't, my intro paragraph states,...\n</p><p>'I am young at heart, because I enjoy the seemingly child-like things I do like playing with <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog\" title=\"Sonic the Hedgehog\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Yu-Gi-Oh\" title=\"Yu-Gi-Oh\">Yu-Gi-Oh</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Pokemon\" title=\"Pokemon\">Pokemon</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Lego\" title=\"Lego\">Legos</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/My_Little_Pony\" title=\"My Little Pony\">My Little Pony</a>, and drawing cartoonishly. I am also creator of my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Electric-Hedgehog_Pokemon\" title=\"Electric-Hedgehog Pokemon\">Electric-Hedgehog Pokemon</a>, Sonichu. I have been drawing and writing comic books, and I've drawn/written quite a few issues so far. I have graduated from <a href=\"/cwcki/Manchester_High_School\" title=\"Manchester High School\">Manchester High School</a> on the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Honor_Roll\" title=\"Honor Roll\">Honor Roll</a>, and I have graduated from PVCC with two <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Computer_Aided_Drafting_%26_Design\" title=\"Computer Aided Drafting &amp; Design\">Computer Aided Drafting &amp; Design</a> Degrees May, 2006. I am shy, but I would really enjoy the company of a pretty girl who likes some of the things I do, with a few opposite traits (excluding <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tobacky\" title=\"Tobacky\">smokers</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Alcohol\" title=\"Alcohol\">drunks</a>). I also like to have fun when I can, and I don't like to be alone. I would prefer Person-to-person encounters/chats instead of over the internet.'\n</p><p>By The Way, so we're clear in this scenario, I will make an exception for you in the over-the-internet chat... through e-mails at least for the moment. And I am willing to tolerate a drinker.\n</p><p>Like I've stated in my previous <a href=\"/cwcki/YouTube\" title=\"YouTube\">YouTube</a> videos, I do live in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ruckersville\" title=\"Ruckersville\">Ruckersville</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Virginia\" title=\"Virginia\">Virginia</a>. My favorite color is Blue (Crayola's 'Battery Blue' in a specific shade). My favorite movie of ALL TIME is '<a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Poppins\" title=\"Mary Poppins\">Mary Poppins</a>'. Both my eyes WERE Blue, but then I had <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Pink_eye\" title=\"Pink eye\">Pink Eye</a> in my right eye during High School, was prescribed an eye-drop, and the chemical turned it green. My left eye is still true blue. I was constantly playing <a href=\"/cwcki/Guitar_Hero\" title=\"Guitar Hero\">Guitar Hero</a> on my <a href=\"/cwcki/PSEye\" title=\"PSEye\">Playstation Eye</a>-enabled <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Playstation_3\" title=\"Playstation 3\">Playstation 3</a> system, until I've recently been remotivated to get back to drawing the comic book I was only a quarter finished drawing, with big plans to draw more after completion and uploading. I currently live with both my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Mother\" title=\"Mother\">mother</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Father\" title=\"Father\">father</a> who are both retired; my mother worked mostly in secretarial work, while my father was a technical engineer with General Electric; he also served as a technical dude in WWII (he's been to Korea before it split into two nations). My father was also the designer of the controls for Plastic Molding machines; without his help, you wouldn't have the plastic surrounding your computer's monitor, tower or keyboard, or even as simple as a plastic funnel.

I was kicked out when I\nwas 16 by my mother, and I was forced to quit school and get a job. Currently, I've been given the\nchance to go to college (I got my G.E.D. at the very least and I got perfect scores), so I am riding on a\nfull ride to a certain college. I do have a job as a waitress, though. I'm also young at heart. I still play on\nmy <a href=\"/cwcki/Nintendo\" title=\"Nintendo\">Nintendo</a> DS and Wii, but because of school, I have no time to really invest in the newer games.

Nasty habits. I'm glad you feel the same about that as I do.\n</p><p>I'm finding my ambition through my drawings, and I am trying to get in touch with Nintendo and SEGA of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/America\" title=\"America\">America</a> to make Sonichu and <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu\" title=\"Rosechu\">Rosechu</a> (and maybe me too) into video game legends, with Official and self-Approved merchandise. I just got a reply to the letter I sent to them informing about the Hype I've managed to generate since their previous letter I got in April, <a href=\"/cwcki/2005\" title=\"2005\">2005</a> with the suggestion to Generate Hype. I've just photocopied their April, 2005 reply letter to further prove myself their worth-while.

It's a \"Just gettin' started\" kinda situation. So she's excited about her single's \"June Release\", and for being on her first Radio Show. Then she continues to talk about her single, \"I sing lead vocals with Blanca at Lead Guitar Hero.\" You add, \"Yeah, while Jiggliami sang on SingStar, I would play my Ax on the Wii. Getting the high scores scored better real-play for my benefit. Jiggliami continues, \"I can't help but appreciate her excellent skills. After being discovered playing at her family's business, we were in!\" \"Oh my God!\" you add. Jiggliami replies, \"I know, right? i just couldn't believe it. But now, we're gigged at max's Kansas City. if we get lucky like Joe, we'll have a \"No Surprize\" contract.\" (an Aerosmith reference in that joke). then simultaneously, you both say, \"Hello, Joke!\" \"Jynx!,\" and you both have a laugh.

It was not as nice as I thought it was at\nfirst; upon first look, it looks fantastic; the best I've seen up to\nnow. But after a few seconds, it transformed into an ugly art. :(P\nAnyhoo, I downloaded the .gif (which is the default format for short,\nrepetitive animation pics), and I've captured its Better Half alone\ninto a .jpg (attached is the .jpg) I've had to fix his shoes, because\nthey were originally with a white stripe in the middle.

Honestly, and confidentially\nbetween you and me, I see the \"official\" videos from companies such as\nAdam&amp;Eve, not solely as a turn-on, but as a good education of what may\nbe done during the act. I also appreciate it more as a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Virgin\" title=\"Virgin\">virgin</a>, because\nit allows me to create a better idea for when I actually do it for my\nfirst time. And obviously I have seen a fair share in my adult years.\nI would rather be well-advised about it and the practices of safe-sex\nthan be dumb on anything on the topic. But if you do not feel\ncomfortable with seeing pornographic videos, I will not ask anymore\nbeyond this paragraph. If I've made you feel uncomfortable, I humbly\napologize. But I feel it a good idea to check with you about the\nsubject, because I care about your feelings as my gal-pal with a\ngrowing friendship.\n</p><p>On another issue, I've recently received a reply letter from Nintendo\nof America; it was basically a static repeat of two of the paragraphs\nfrom the reply letter I've received back on <a href=\"/cwcki/2005#April\" title=\"2005\">April, 2005</a>.

You are a creative woman, I feel certain that you\ncan paint a good picture of your time there. :)\n</p><p>Currently, in the comic, I am working on the pages where Sonichu and\nRosechu are going up in the elevator of the 4-Cent_Garbage building to\nsee Jason. But I should fill you in on that story, so here it is\ncopied and pasted, the \"sneak peak\" at the first episode of <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_8\" title=\"Sonichu 8\">Comic #8</a>,\nas told to Sonichufan1985 weeks ago.\n</p><p>So, with that, here's the preview for beginning episode of Comic #8.\nSonichu and Rosechu had just finished making love after their date; the\ntwo are Living together, Rosechu goes on the internet, after learning\nfrom <a href=\"/cwcki/Kellie_Andes\" title=\"Kellie Andes\">Kellie Andes</a> (my old High School Sweetheart among the graduating\nclass of <a href=\"/cwcki/2000\" title=\"2000\">Y2K</a>), who I give the honor of finding the ED site in the\ncomic. But instead of calling it Encyclopedia Dramatica, I call it\n\"4-Cent Garbage.\" So with the matching page details down to the last\nletter, Rosechu is examining the \"Chris-chan\" page in shock. Enter\nSonichu, who just got out of their shared bed. Rosie shows Sonichu the\nshocking page; Sonichu goes into shock of the typed details. He is\nsurprised to find the hand-drawings I made up, which to him look like\nphotographs (especially the one with him and Rosie doin' their thang).\n</p><p>And finally, he throws up after seeing the crude drawings of Rosechu\nwith a dick. He goes on to even exclaim that last time he check, she\nHAD both her Ovaries. And even brings up a planned parody of Playboy\nmagizine, \"Pok'eBoy\", with centerfolds of Rosechu, that were done under\nSonichu's supervision; she is on the cover as well (but in a\ntwo-piece). And after exausting a gasp from the stress, Rosie escorts\nhim to the bed to rest, and suggests later to go to the 4-Cent Garbage\nbuilding to try to reason with them.\n</p><p>Then, DELETED SCENE, Rosie goes back to the computer, realizing that\nshe can change the pics on the page, she goes into another room and\ntakes nudie pics of herself. :D With a few self-crotch-shots. Then she\nreturns with SD Memory card in hand, thinking she has enough pics,\nuploads and replaces most of the dick-<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Imposter\" title=\"Imposter\">imposters</a>. Then she realizes\nthere were more imposters then she had her own nudie pics for. Then she\ngets the idea to ask Bubbles and Angelica to help.\n</p><p>BTW, when I say DELETED SCENE, I mean that I will draw the pages as\nPage #+A for myself, but I would not upload the pages to be scene in\nthe final print. So, I'm letting you in on some really juicy stuff\nhere; Please keep it under your hat, I am trusting you, Robert Simmons.\n</p><p>Anyway, later, Sonichu and Rosechu find the 72-Story tall 4-Cent\nGarbage Publications building. They get there with help from <a href=\"/cwcki/Magi-Chan\" title=\"Magi-Chan\">Magi-Chan</a>\nwith teleportation. So they enter the building, and speak to the\nreceptionist (<a href=\"/cwcki/Beel\" title=\"Beel\">a red devil</a>), who at the moment is getting himself\ndiscreetly horny, with his chair back facing our heroes. Sonichu says\nto him, \"Excuse me, we have a 2-O-Clock appointment with the head of\nyour company. And without turning around, the devil replies, \"Yeah,\nsure, go to the opposite side of the column in front of me, and take\nthe elevator to Floor 66+6\". \"Wouldn't that be 72?\" Sonichu replies.\n\"Yeah, sure, if you want to be technical. Get goin', I'm busy here,\"\nthe devil replies harshly without eye-contact. Then our heroes start\ntheir way to go around the column; Sonichu says as he passes the devil,\n\"Gee, Thanks,\" sarcastically. After Rosechu presses the elevator\nbutton, Sonichu says to her, \"Can you believe how RUDE that guy was?!!\nHe wouldn't even turn himself around even for a second.\" Rosie replies,\n\"Sonichu... forgiveness.\" \"Eh...Alright,\" Sonichu replies, \"It just\nreally grinds my gears.\" As they take the elevator up, Sonichu says,\n\"If the first floor has a jerk like that, I can only imagine what else\ncould be among the other stories here.\"\n</p><p>And, we see on the second floor a multiple number of computers, all but\none with passed-out drunks in front of them. And the nerd to his left\njust recovers from his hangover, and the still sober guy says, \"You\nready to go, pal?\" \"Yeah\", he replies. Then the first guy says, \"Great.\nI'm gonna pass out now,\" drinks a can of beer in one gulp, falls back\nand collapses into his slumber. <a href=\"/cwcki/Random-access_humor\" title=\"Random-access humor\">Ugh... A good joke...</a> to represent the\nexpert HTML <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jerks\" title=\"Jerks\">jerks</a> behind ED.\n</p><p>And a few random floors up, with a relative joke on each floor.\n</p><p>Then, our heroes get up to the 72nd floor, exits the elevator, and are\ngreeted by Jason (yes, <a href=\"/cwcki/Jason_Kendrick_Howell\" title=\"Jason Kendrick Howell\">Jason Kendrick Howell</a>, but for the comic, just\nJason) in a booming voice, with his woman slave, dressed like a\nsadistic mistress or S&amp;M queen, on a leash, <a href=\"/cwcki/Kathleen\" title=\"Kathleen\">Kathleen</a> (his real 17-year\nold girlfriend, Kathleen [redacted]) \"behaving\" and staying silent.\n</p><p>(Can you believe the world with such cruel people like him for real?)\nSonichu steps forward and complains about the slanderous webpage about\nme, and after taking a deep sigh after releasing his stress upon his\nexplanation, calms down and humbly asks Jason to remove it from their\nwebsite. Obviously, Jason says no. Then Sonichu gets really angry, and\nshoots a Thunderbolt upon him; he deflects it with a parody of the Dark\nForce. Then Sonichu runs towards Jason to \"Mach Punch\" him, but he\nstops Sonichu, within an inch before impact, dead in his tracks,\nlevitates him and tosses him back, to be caught by Rosie. Rosie then\ncomforts him, and tells him, \"There's no reasoning with him, Sweet\nBolt; let's just go now.\" \"But...\" Sonichu replies. \"Forgiveness...\njust like Jacob taught us,\" Rosie affirms. And with a final angry\nglance, Sonichu staggers back to the elevator door with Rosechu helping\nhim with arm around him.\n</p><p>And, DELETED SCENE, Jason tells Rosechu, \"That's right go. Go, and play\nwith your Pickle.\" Then he chucks a Real Vegetable Pickle, and it hits\nRosie on the head, as she carries Sonichu. She pauses, Sonichu stands\nstill next to her on his own, she picks up the pickle on the floor,\nquivers a moment, then becomes enrage with fires of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Rage\" title=\"Rage\">fury</a>. She turns\naround, takes a few steps towards Jason, pauses, bends down to unzip\nher boots, looks back to Sonichu and tells him to get ready (for her\nquick striptease). She jumps high out of her boots, goes into an aerial\nspin jump, undoes her skirt, tosses that to Sonichu, he catches it.\nThen her shirt. Then she lands five feet in front of her boots, in\nnothing but her C-Cup <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bra\" title=\"Bra\">Bra</a> and panties. She shouts to Jason, \"I've got\nthree shocking bits for you, Jerk!\" She undoes her bra from the front,\nreveals her left breast, then her right and tosses the bra back to\nSonichu. She jumps, ninja warrior stance in mid-air, drops her panties\nto the floor under her... pounces onto Jason's face, her vagina opening\nlanding on his nose, her legs wrapped tight around his head. She\nsqueezes his head with her legs, rubbing her pussy in his face with\nfury. After half-a-minute, jumps off him, lands between her panties and\nher boots on floor, her naked butt and back, facing Jason, who is\nalive, but fainted, his hood is down, revealing his face, with dizzy\nspiral in his eye. She turns her head and looks at him, like a bull\nafter taking down its opponent. Then she collects her panties and\nboots; walks victoriously with Sonichu holding the rest of her clothes\nback to the elevator. She would clothe herself on the way down with her\nSweet Bolt in awe of her, and turned on.\n</p><p>No naughty bits, or tits, would be drawn in exposure, but as sure as\nthe American Flag is Red, White and Blue, Rosechu is ALL WOMAN.\n</p><p>I hope you've enjoyed that, and I look forward to hearing about your\nthoughts from your job. Don't forget that you can call me when you\nfeel up to it.\n</p><p>TTYL,CP<br/>\nChristian C.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"
