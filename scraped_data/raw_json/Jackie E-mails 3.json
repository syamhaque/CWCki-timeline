I've ended up taking down the whole <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Cwcipedia\" title=\"Cwcipedia\">Cwcipedia</a>, because of the Trolls' influences and trouble-makings. So, currently, the ONLY things on the internet about me Actually from me are my <a href=\"/cwcki/YouTube\" title=\"YouTube\">YouTube</a>, and my <a href=\"/cwcki/Twitter\" title=\"Twitter\">Twitter</a> (when I update it). I have been trying to find peace away from the trolls. I've taken a hiatus on the comics until I find again the peace from the trolls and the inspiration. I've been more focused on real life trying to meet new people and make new friends. Recently, I've made a few new friendly acquaintances after a drink at TGIF in Forest Lakes. But before then, it's been same-old, same-old; lonely and crestfallen, leaning on my video games for comfort. I was going to go to the Otakon <a href=\"/cwcki/Anime\" title=\"Anime\">Anime</a> Convention this month, but finances recently went terribly askew within the past week or two. I ended up with disappointed parents, and I was disappointed in myself.\n</p><p>More often, I have been doing good on the self-control and less spending, yet sometimes my impulses hit me while I am feeling emotionally weak. And on the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/FlipNote_Hatena\" title=\"FlipNote Hatena\">FlipNote Hatena</a>, the Trolls Falsely Reported my FlipNotes with Three False Descriptions each. I ended up suspended from Posting new FlipNotes onto the Hatena for a week, even to access it from my DSi's FlipNote Studio App. After the week was over, and I was able to again access the Hatena from my DSi, I had previously unlinked my DSi from my past account and relinked it to a New account with a different name. Thank God the Trolls nor anyone else have found my new account or reposted F.N.s in the Practice Channel; they appear as Spin-Offs from my original account, even though those same Original F.N.s are mostly Still Locked from remixing and spin-offing.\n</p><p>I have also been working in <a href=\"/cwcki/ModNation_Racers\" title=\"ModNation Racers\">ModNation Racers</a>, unlocking EVERY Tool to best recreate my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Cwcville\" title=\"Cwcville\">Cwcville</a> Track I had created originally in the limited-time Beta, along with a 2.0 Version of the Track. I will be creating a Final, BEST version of the Track, where it will be like you're actually driving from the Mall, through the Suburbs, and the City and Back again. Followed by a set of tracks for Around Cwcville, including a Race through the Park, Cwcville Forest, the Mountains, and the Beach (with probably a drive through <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bubbles\" title=\"Bubbles\">Bubbles</a>' Undersea Area if I can swing it). I also have created Official Sonichu and <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu\" title=\"Rosechu\">Rosechu</a> Mods/Karts, along with recreated favored <a href=\"/cwcki/Hot_Wheels\" title=\"Hot Wheels\">Hot Wheels</a> cars from my collection, my favorite Childhood Playskool First Transformer Race Carcomplete with eyes-only driver, and an inspired Carriage that states that I enjoy Pretty <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Toys\" title=\"Toys\">Toys</a> and Femenine Things like Tea parties, yet \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">IAM STILL A TOUGH, HETEROSEXUAL MAN, DAMMIT!</a>\" I got the idea from another MNR player, who I added later as a friend, who created a <a href=\"/cwcki/Rainbow\" title=\"Rainbow\">rainbow</a>-colored van that states, \"I'M NOT GAY, I JUST ENJOY RAINBOWS(and UNICORNS)\". He and I also shared a conversation in which he was a great listener; I later thanked him for being a good friend to me by sending him an extra <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PSN\" title=\"PSN\">PSN</a> Code for the Kratos and Gopher Mods/Karts Ihad got for free. :)\n</p><p>Going back to the Trolls, they still come after me in real life, looking to snap photographs of me wherever I am away from my house if they're there at the same time; looking for some \"juicy footage\" they can misinterpret and misdetail in their own sick ways.

I did see the video they made where you're dancing to the music though, looks kind of cute :) But you weren't kidding when you said they're following you around everywhere - I saw they have an article on the \"coffee place\", the picture shows it's a Burger King. That is the one you go to! I can't believe they could sneak in so close to you and do that! Do you know who might have taken that picture?\n</p><p>I don't suppose you have an account there, do you?

It really sucks if you can't go to Otakon, I've heard that's a fun place. Are you sure you can't go? I think it'd be a really fun experience for you. I'd love to hear about it if you did.\n</p><p>Like I said, I've spent the summer driving state to state visiting friends, I'm in Michigan right now.

Long-story short, there was a bitchey employee giving me and my father a hard time that day, as well as a few other times on previous other days and times (on an estimated 3/10 ratio). My father was really ticked off at her, Literally Told me to Troll her, while I was also angry at her, so I took that picture with my DSi's inner camera and started that page as \"<a href=\"/cwcki/JenkinsJinkies\" title=\"JenkinsJinkies\">JenkinsJinkies</a>\". I also thought the page would lure the Trolls out there, so I can catch them in the act and take their photos, lecture them and/or kick their ass(es). Obviously they did not come out there, but the \"14-year old Middle Child of Boston with Grandparents in South Virginia\" earned <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">Clyde Cash</a>'s Trust and Support. I later consulted with <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Rocky\" title=\"Rocky\">Rocky</a> (the Pastoral Counsoler of my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Church\" title=\"Church\">church</a>); both of which see no point of taking their picture back for a) even provided to the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Police\" title=\"Police\">Police</a>, they would not be able to nail them for Legally Taking Photographs. And b) even in a blackmail attempt, NONE of the Trolls would give a rat's ass on what each of their own kind looks like in real life. And Rocky insisted I wait for Police Instruction to go Undercover and lure them out.\n</p><p>I am trusting you with this Confidential Information of \"JenkinsJinkies\"; please do not tell anyone else about it.\n</p><p>Also, to remove content in huge chunks would be too obvious, and then at least Clyde would be like, \"Oh, HE is Obviously Chrissy; BLOCK HIM. I am sorry for ever trusting him.\" And at the moment, I am short on ideas, and I'd just assume ignore them; stuff is being deleted for lack of new information anyway. I lured out one last Friday at the Pavillion <i>[sic]</i>, obviously. I SHOULD have gone after him in pursuit, but the only plan I had programmed in my head in response is take their picture with my DSi. I have reprogrammed my mind to pursue after lure, yell for a policeman, and have him arrested for Taking Photographs at the Pavillion <i>[sic]</i> during Fridays After 5. On their Triangular, Red Column, they have a rules list, which includes, \"No Cameras or Videotaping are Permitted\". I am positive I'll lure out the same guy from Last Friday; I only got a brief look at his face, but I am positive <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Blanca\" title=\"Blanca\">I'd recognize him</a> on future sight.\n</p><p>Something else I haven't told you yet, I have been collecting the State Quarters after my <a href=\"/cwcki/Minor_Family_Members#Aunt_Harriet_and_Uncle_Tom\" title=\"Minor Family Members\">Aunt Herriet</a> sent me a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/USA\" title=\"USA\">USA</a> Quarter Map, with slots for each of the 50 quarters, for a present years ago.

More than just that, you can get access to their plans. You know if you could get that stuff, you could probably nuke their whole website, without that the trolls would have nowhere to go.\n</p><p>Some guy named \"canine\" (who names themselves after a dog? How dumb) said that they want you to make a secret video for them, but since \"JenkinsJinkies\" says he is afraid of your wrath, they'll let you wear a mask, so you can conceal your identity!I kind of think that's the best way to go, because like I say even if the cops bust one troll there are a million more around the corner, but if you mess up their base of operations they'll all lose power.\n</p><p>I'll stay safe on my trip, don't worry :) I'm leaving Michigan tomorrow, going to drive through Canada for a little bit actually, go to Toronto. But I still get email on my phone so we can still talk.
