Whilst portraying <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a> as a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Homo\" title=\"Homo\">homo</a> was bad enough for Chris, apparently tarring the <a href=\"/cwcki/Chaotic_Combo\" title=\"Chaotic Combo\">Chaotic Combo</a> with the same brush, and killing them off, was a step too far for him.\n</p><p>Chris's solution was to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Retcon\" title=\"Retcon\">retcon</a> the events of <i>Asperchu</i> in his own comic such that all instances of his characters appearing in <i>Asperchu</i> were really just other <a href=\"/cwcki/Electric_Hedgehog_Pok%C3%A9mon\" title=\"Electric Hedgehog Pokémon\">Electric Hedgehog Pokémon</a> being forced to to play the characters by Alec. In a <a href=\"/cwcki/Alec_Benson_Leary_Phone_Call_2\" title=\"Alec Benson Leary Phone Call 2\">phone conversation</a> with Alec, Chris revealed that he did this because he believes cartoon characters <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">all really exist in some parallel universe</a>, citing <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Framed_Roger_Rabbit\" title=\"wikipedia:Who Framed Roger Rabbit\"><i>Who Framed Roger Rabbit</i></a> as a template for this idea, and explaining that by making a work featuring the characters from his comic, he was therefore changing that parallel world into one in which they were homos, which his characters would allegedly resent. Of course, attempting to change the canon of another author's comics without permission was nowhere near insulting enough for Chris to be satisfied, so he also placed Alec himself in the story and portrayed him as a kidnapper and implied <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Rape\" title=\"Rape\">rapist</a>, as well as stealing <a href=\"/cwcki/Asperchu/Background#Supporting_characters\" title=\"Asperchu/Background\">several characters</a> original to <i>Asperchu</i>.

They are given much better characterization than Chris originally gave them, and Alec made <a href=\"/cwcki/Wild_Sonichu\" title=\"Wild Sonichu\">Wild Sonichu</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Magi-chan\" title=\"Magi-chan\">Magi-chan</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">gay</a> to play off their obvious homosexual inclinations in <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\"><i>Sonichu</i></a>. Wild is seen to be in a relationship with <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Simonchu\" title=\"Simonchu\">Simonchu</a> as a parody of his relationship with his sub-par knockoff <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Simonla\" title=\"Simonla\">Simonla</a> in the main comics, and after Wild dies he also dates <a href=\"/cwcki/Magi-Chan\" title=\"Magi-Chan\">Magi-Chan</a>. Over the course of the comic, the entire Combo is eventually wiped out, with Wild, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Punchy\" title=\"Punchy\">Punchy</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Angelica\" title=\"Angelica\">Angelica</a> being murdered by Metal Asperchu to establish his status as a threatening villain, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bubbles\" title=\"Bubbles\">Bubbles</a> covertly assassinated by <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Silvana_Rosechu\" title=\"Silvana Rosechu\">Silvana Rosechu</a> in an infiltration mission, and Magi-Chan later killed in the battle for <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a>, also by Silvana. Sonichu survived these events, and later went on to become a villain himself - the monstrous <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris-Chan_Sonichu\" title=\"Chris-Chan Sonichu\">Chris-Chan Sonichu</a>.\n</p><p>In <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_10\" title=\"Sonichu 10\"><i>Sonichu</i> #10</a>, Chris responded to <i>Asperchu</i> by retconning it in his own comic. After destroying the <a href=\"/cwcki/4-cent_garbage.com\" title=\"4-cent garbage.com\">4-cent_garbage.com</a> building, Chris and <a href=\"/cwcki/Ultra_Sonichu\" title=\"Ultra Sonichu\">Ultra Sonichu</a> flew away to Minnesota where the <i>Asperchu</i> comics took place and encountered the actors who portrayed the Sonichu characters in Asperchu. Chris established that they were in fact <i>different</i> Electric Hedgehogs, with different names and identities, who just so happened to look exactly like the characters in <i>Sonichu</i> canon. They explain that they were really natives of Minnesota, and that <a href=\"/cwcki/Alec_Benson_Leary\" title=\"Alec Benson Leary\">Alec Benson Leary</a> had captured them and was forcing them against their will to pretend to be the Chaotic Combo, pretend to die, and even \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_religion\" title=\"Chris and religion\">make a false god out of</a>\" <a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris\" title=\"Liquid Chris\">Liquid Chris</a> among other things,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup> for reasons that will only ever make sense in Chris's <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">autism</a>-riddled mind. The fake Sonichu says they had \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">prayed for forgiveness from the real Christian</a>\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup> for these heinous crimes.\n</p><p>In addition to this, they claim to have been \"cursed\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup> with <a href=\"/cwcki/Asperger_syndrome\" title=\"Asperger syndrome\">Asperger's syndrome</a> by Alec, following Chris's belief that Asperger's syndrome is both completely different from the supposedly harmless high-functioning <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">autism</a> that he has and is a literal disease that can be \"caught\" or \"cured\". Chris gives this as the reason why the characters seemed to have personalities in <i>Asperchu</i> but were all cardboard cutouts in his comic; the Asperger's syndrome gave them all social problems and made them act weird, like they did in the <i>Asperchu</i> comic when they had personalities. In Chris's mind, <i>normal</i> people act like Saturday morning cartoon characters, like they do in his comic. Note also that, in the actual <i>Asperchu</i> comic, only Asperchu had Asperger's (and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bubbles\" title=\"Bubbles\">Bubbles</a> was <a href=\"/cwcki/Slow-in-the-minds\" title=\"Slow-in-the-minds\">slow-in-the-mind</a>) but the other characters were mentally normal.\n</p><p>Ultra Sonichu then uses his \"Chaotic Remedy\" to immediately cure them of their Asperger's and revert them back into their old selves (begging the question of why he couldn't instantly cure Chris's autism too), and the characters one by one give their real names, show off the extremely minor design changes Chris made to differentiate them from his characters, and list all the ways their lives had improved in the ten seconds since they were cured.\n</p><p>In response to complaints in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag\" title=\"Mailbag\">Mailbag</a> that he was portraying himself and Sonichu as <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_religion#God_complex\" title=\"Chris and religion\">Messianic figures</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler_(character)\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler (character)\">Chris himself</a> then arrives, having been absent outside of his role as narrator for the past few pages, and finds the newly regenerated Sonichus and Rosechus bowing down in prayer to him, having mistaken him for God. Chris takes the time to explain to them that he was not really God, but merely <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">his humble messenger on Earth</a>.\n</p><p>Following that, Metal Asperchu shows up and randomly attacks them, leading to a fight scene in which he is of course destroyed in the space of a couple pages. Chris and Sonichu then head inside to destroy Alec's <a href=\"/cwcki/HEXBox\" title=\"HEXBox\">HEXBox</a>, whilst the new Sonichus gang up on and <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_the_law\" title=\"Chris and the law\">mercilessly beat Alec for drawing them poorly</a>.\n</p>\n<center><ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\">\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\"><div style=\"width: 155px\">\n<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><div style=\"margin:16.5px auto;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Michael_Sonichu.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"117\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/7/7a/Michael_Sonichu.jpg/120px-Michael_Sonichu.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/7/7a/Michael_Sonichu.jpg/180px-Michael_Sonichu.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/7/7a/Michael_Sonichu.jpg/240px-Michael_Sonichu.jpg 2x\" width=\"120\"/></a></div></div>\n<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n<p>Michael Sonichu, based on <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a>.\n</p>\n</div>\n</div></li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\"><div style=\"width: 155px\">\n<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><div style=\"margin:15px auto;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Kitty_Rosechu.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"120\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/a/ac/Kitty_Rosechu.jpg/106px-Kitty_Rosechu.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/a/ac/Kitty_Rosechu.jpg/159px-Kitty_Rosechu.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/a/ac/Kitty_Rosechu.jpg/212px-Kitty_Rosechu.jpg 2x\" width=\"106\"/></a></div></div>\n<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n<p>Kitty Rosechu, based on <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bubbles\" title=\"Bubbles\">Bubbles</a>.\n</p>\n</div>\n</div></li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\"><div style=\"width: 155px\">\n<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><div style=\"margin:15px auto;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Bobby_Sonichu.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"120\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/5/59/Bobby_Sonichu.jpg/105px-Bobby_Sonichu.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/5/59/Bobby_Sonichu.jpg/158px-Bobby_Sonichu.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/5/59/Bobby_Sonichu.jpg/211px-Bobby_Sonichu.jpg 2x\" width=\"105\"/></a></div></div>\n<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n<p>Bobby Sonichu, based on <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Wild\" title=\"Wild\">Wild</a>.\n</p>\n</div>\n</div></li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\"><div style=\"width: 155px\">\n<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><div style=\"margin:15px auto;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Trisha_Rosechu.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"120\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/7/74/Trisha_Rosechu.jpg/107px-Trisha_Rosechu.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/7/74/Trisha_Rosechu.jpg/160px-Trisha_Rosechu.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/7/74/Trisha_Rosechu.jpg/214px-Trisha_Rosechu.jpg 2x\" width=\"107\"/></a></div></div>\n<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n<p>Trisha Rosechu, based on <a href=\"/cwcki/Angelica\" title=\"Angelica\">Angelica</a>.\n</p>\n</div>\n</div></li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\"><div style=\"width: 155px\">\n<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><div style=\"margin:15px auto;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Swift_Sonichu.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"120\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/1/15/Swift_Sonichu.jpg/112px-Swift_Sonichu.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/1/15/Swift_Sonichu.jpg/169px-Swift_Sonichu.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/1/15/Swift_Sonichu.jpg/225px-Swift_Sonichu.jpg 2x\" width=\"112\"/></a></div></div>\n<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n<p>Swift Sonichu, based on <a href=\"/cwcki/Magi-Chan\" title=\"Magi-Chan\">Magi-Chan</a>.\n</p>\n</div>\n</div></li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\"><div style=\"width: 155px\">\n<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><div style=\"margin:15px auto;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Whisp_Sonichu.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"120\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/4/4b/Whisp_Sonichu.jpg/104px-Whisp_Sonichu.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/4/4b/Whisp_Sonichu.jpg/155px-Whisp_Sonichu.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/4/4b/Whisp_Sonichu.jpg/207px-Whisp_Sonichu.jpg 2x\" width=\"104\"/></a></div></div>\n<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n<p>Whisp Sonichu, based on <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Punchy\" title=\"Punchy\">Punchy</a>.\n</p>\n</div>\n</div></li>\n</ul></center>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Mitch_Sonichu\">Mitch Sonichu</span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:218px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:MitchSonichu.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"222\" src=\"/w/images/3/38/MitchSonichu.jpg\" width=\"216\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:MitchSonichu.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Mitch Sonichu after his transformation.

Whilst Chris has given conflicting accounts of just how much power the author has over the characters in his comic books (for example, he believes Sonichu acts completely of his own free will in his comic but the same is not true of Asperchu) he seemed to hold the view that Asperchu was independent enough from Alec that he would resent the name he had been given and would be aware of the fact that he was deliberately written to be a loser with a mental disability. It can be inferred from this that Chris saw the character of Mitch as the person who Asperchu apparently <i>really</i> wanted to be, and he changed him into Mitch in his comic in a bizarre act of charity to the fictional character, though he probably still did it more to spite Alec than anything else.\n</p><p>Asperchu was transformed alongside Alec's versions of Sonichu and the Chaotic Combo, and also took part in the fight with Metal Asperchu shortly afterwards. He was the most prominently featured of the transformed Electric Hedgehogs, and he seemed to be portrayed as the effective \"leader\" of the group. As \"Mitch\", he allegedly became smarter, more confident and better-looking than his previous self. His makeover is highly ironic, seeing that the shirt he wore before it is an exact copy of an actual shirt of Chris.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:202px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:SITMGroupShot.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"150\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/a/a8/SITMGroupShot.jpg/200px-SITMGroupShot.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/a/a8/SITMGroupShot.jpg/300px-SITMGroupShot.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/a/a8/SITMGroupShot.jpg/400px-SITMGroupShot.jpg 2x\" width=\"200\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:SITMGroupShot.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Mitch in 2019</div></div></div>\n<p>Like most characters that Chris creates based on events that occur around him, Mitch fades into the background shortly after being introduced and is never seen again.\n</p><p>In <a href=\"/cwcki/March_2019\" title=\"March 2019\">March 2019</a>, Chris featured Mitch in his drawing on the DeJarnette Center for Human Development.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup> The link between Mitch and the institute is unclear.\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Basement_Rosechus\">Basement Rosechus</span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:SchuComic11P80.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"385\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/d/d6/SchuComic11P80.jpg/300px-SchuComic11P80.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/d/d6/SchuComic11P80.jpg/450px-SchuComic11P80.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/d/d6/SchuComic11P80.jpg/600px-SchuComic11P80.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:SchuComic11P80.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Chris offers an important clarification on the complex topic of hamster/Rosechu rape</div></div></div>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">You just had them in prison and you treated them like hamsters...

Starved, dirty and traumatized, they are the first characters that actually seem congruous with the grim backdrop of <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a>. \n</p><p>The Basement Rosechus were first mentioned by Kitty and Trisha Rosechu just before they were cured by Ultra Sonichu.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]</a></sup> While expositing on the Asper-Combo's backstories, Kitty mentioned in passing that there once lived five young Roseys who grew up with them, who Alec had kept in his basement ever since he had captured them all. In a surprisingly dark turn for Chris's comics, which usually do not feature any death aside from the villains, Trisha explains that the unseen fifth one was killed by <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">Dino Dash</a>, a minor villain in the <i>Asperchu</i> comics, when she tried to report Alec to the <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_sex#Bestiality\" title=\"Chris and sex\">ASPCA</a>. \n</p><p>In typical <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_writing\" title=\"Chris and writing\">Chris style</a>, each is distinguished by some form of impairment or distinctive costume rather than any genuine personality.

Whether they were made to also retcon the <i>Asperchu</i> version of Rosechu into another character or whether they were just made for the sake of demonizing Alec further remains unknown.\n</p><p>Not long after publishing the pages featuring these characters, Chris released a video with one of his <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_remorse\" title=\"Chris and remorse\">classic insincere apologies</a>, backing off from the implication that Alec would entertain himself by abusing and raping innocent women. According to Chris's retroactive account of the situation, the Basement Rosechus were merely kept in large cages and treated like hamsters.\n</p>\n<center><ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\">\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\"><div style=\"width: 155px\">\n<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><div style=\"margin:15px auto;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Brittay.JPG\"><img alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"120\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/e/e8/Brittay.JPG/67px-Brittay.JPG\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/e/e8/Brittay.JPG/100px-Brittay.JPG 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/e/e8/Brittay.JPG/134px-Brittay.JPG 2x\" width=\"67\"/></a></div></div>\n<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n<p><b>Brit-Tay Rosechu:</b> Essentially the <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu_(species)\" title=\"Rosechu (species)\">regular Rosechu</a>, right down to a proclivity for <a href=\"/cwcki/Women%27s_rights\" title=\"Women's rights\">strutting around in slutty clothes</a>, but famished and <a href=\"/cwcki/DIRTY,_CRAPPED_BRIEFS\" title=\"DIRTY, CRAPPED BRIEFS\">dirty</a> in appearance.

In the original comic, he was created by the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Troll\" title=\"Troll\">troll</a> lord Sinestro as a way to track down the seven <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_Balls\" title=\"Sonichu Balls\">Chaos Pickles</a> he needed for his evil plan. He was based on Asperchu for unknown reasons, and quickly became independent of his master, ignoring his commands and later outright betraying him, all for the ultimate goal of collecting the Chaos <a href=\"/cwcki/Pickle\" title=\"Pickle\">Pickles</a>. He was also the one who killed Wild, Punchy and Angelica.\n</p><p>In <i>Sonichu</i>, he was basically turned into a random robot attacker, of no more threat than the average <a href=\"/cwcki/Jerkop\" title=\"Jerkop\">Jerkop</a>, and he was drawn more like a <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Mega_Man_characters#Robot_Masters\" title=\"wikipedia:List of Mega Man characters\">Mega Man Robot Master</a> than his original design. Given that the character was a major source of conflict in <i>Asperchu</i>, and Chris hates conflict or tension of any kind, he was introduced in <i>Sonichu</i> for the sole purpose of being destroyed as quickly as possible, to get rid of an unwanted threat to his characters. He is implied in the comic to be working for Alec Benson Leary, and he addresses Chris in the dialogue as the \"original creator\". Whether this is a reference to Chris's status as the original creator of the characters he had just changed or was an accusation of Metal Asperchu being based on Chris's <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Metal_Sonichu\" title=\"Metal Sonichu\">Metal Sonichu</a> is unknown.\n</p><p>The second character Chris steals is Asperchu's <a href=\"/cwcki/Asperchu/Background#Supporting_characters\" title=\"Asperchu/Background\">Grandma Snorlax</a>, a parody of <a href=\"/cwcki/Barbara_Chandler\" title=\"Barbara Chandler\">Barb</a>, who sometimes featured in scenes set at Asperchu's house in the original comic, often seen propped up against the sagging wall of the house. In <i>Sonichu</i>, she gets a one-panel cameo as Sonichu flies over towards the house before he meets the Asper-Combo, seen in the background propped up behind the house, just like in <i>Asperchu</i>. Why Chris bothered to include her at all when her only real purpose as a character is to make fun of his mother is not clear.\n</p><p>Also notable, is that while none of them actually appeared, Chris did take the time to acknowledge some of the other characters of <i>Asperchu</i> lore. The five Chus original to Alec's series, those being Jonas, Dixie, Peter, Benny and Sitting Chu, are all explained by Chris as having been bred by Alec for some unexplained reason, using the Asper-Combo's unseen Sonichu father and a <a href=\"/cwcki/Pok%C3%A9mon\" title=\"Pokémon\">Ditto</a>, also effectively <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_sex#Incest\" title=\"Chris and sex\">making all Alec's characters related</a>. Dino Dash was mentioned in passing as the one who killed the fifth Basement Rosechu, implied to have been working for Alec too. Max, one of Asperchu's best friends in the comic, is mentioned as being one of the many characters favored by Alec over the captives, which they resent, and Swift Sonichu also mentions that the group's father was later aged to death by a machine built by someone called Bill, who may or may not be a retconned version of the <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Moon-Pals\" title=\"Moon-Pals\">Moon-Pals</a></i> incarnation of <a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_Sonichu_characters#Dr._Bill_Schwartz_(Bill_the_Scientist)\" title=\"List of Sonichu characters\">Bill the Scientist</a>, who also sometimes cameoed in Asperchu. Swift's statements might have been intended to imply that Alzheichu was the Asper-Combo's father, considering that he is the only old Chu in the comic.\n</p><p><a href=\"/cwcki/Niggos\" title=\"Niggos\">Jivin</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_race\" title=\"Chris and race\">was not mentioned</a> by Chris, Despite being a prominent Asperchu character from the very beginning.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Alec_himself\">Alec himself</span></h3>\n<p>Alec himself was also included in the comic as the diabolical Rosechu rapist who had captured the Asper-Combo and given them <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Asperger%27s_syndrome\" title=\"Asperger's syndrome\">Asperger's syndrome</a>, as part of his evil plan to make them pretend to be the real Chaotic Combo and act out their fictional deaths. After Metal Asperchu was defeated, the gang of seven Sonichus all ganged up on him and beat him up in vengeance off-panel. He was later put on trial and executed for the murder of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Simonla\" title=\"Simonla\">Simonla</a>, along with the other three maniacs behind the Asperchu saga, Mao, <a href=\"/cwcki/Evan\" title=\"Evan\">Evan</a> and Sean.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Alec.27s_reaction\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Alec's_reaction\">Alec's reaction</span></h2>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">Hey bitches!

For example, several of the retconned characters were introduced as new characters separate from the <i>Asperchu</i> iterations of the <i>Sonichu</i> characters that Chris had tried to change.\n</p><p>Whisp Sonichu, for instance, appeared at the Chaotic Funeral, introduced as Punchy's <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Spanish\" title=\"Spanish\">Spanish</a>-speaking <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Slow-in-the-mind\" title=\"Slow-in-the-mind\">slow-in-the-mind</a> cousin. Alec also introduced some of the Basement Rosechus in a cameo role, where they were seen in the Albville Soup Hotel as being refugees from <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a> where they had previously lived as Ian's sex slaves.\n</p><p>Arguably the biggest impact of the retcons was that Alec adopted the character of Mitch Sonichu into his canon, but not as a revamped Asperchu, but instead as a new character called Mitch Chu. As a not-so-subtle response to the quite camp nature of Mitch Sonichu's <i>EXTREME ELECTRIC MAKEOVER</i>, Mitch Chu was rather obviously gay and seemed to hold steady employ as a stylist.\n</p><p>As well as this, Mitch Chu was also often used as a device to take pot shots at Chris in the comic. His backstory was established in Issue 3, implying that he was <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Rape\" title=\"Rape\">raped</a> as a young <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonee\" title=\"Sonee\">Sonee</a> by <a href=\"/cwcki/Ian_Brandon_Anderson\" title=\"Ian Brandon Anderson\">Ian Brandon Anderson</a>, Chris's comic incarnation. There was also something of a running joke in the comic that Ian would frequently confuse Mitch, Sonichu and Asperchu with each other, as they were all essentially different versions of the same character. In the side comic <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_Revolution\" title=\"Sonichu Revolution\">Sonichu Revolution</a>, Mitch also appeared as the narrator and a guide for <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a> during his journey through the land of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Copyright\" title=\"Copyright\">copyright</a> infringement, parodying Chris's treatment of copyright in his work and destroying everything that used previously existing characters. The comic ends with Mitch being murdered by Chris with an axe at his own request, because he was also a copyright infringing abomination.\n</p><p>Mitch was last seen in Issue 9 of the comic, in ghost form, taunting Sonichu, in a sequence parodying the Sorrow boss battle from <a href=\"/cwcki/Metal_Gear\" title=\"Metal Gear\"><i>Metal Gear Solid 3</i></a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sources\">Sources</span></h2>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"/cwcki/File:SchuComic10P54.jpg\" title=\"File:SchuComic10P54.jpg\">File:SchuComic10P54.jpg</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"/cwcki/File:SchuComic10P56.jpg\" title=\"File:SchuComic10P56.jpg\">File:SchuComic10P56.jpg</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-3\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-3\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"/cwcki/File:SchuComic10P57.jpg\" title=\"File:SchuComic10P57.jpg\">File:SchuComic10P57.jpg</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-4\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-4\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">To be specific, the shirt in question is the one dubbed by this wiki as <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_fashion#Wardrobe\" title=\"Chris and fashion\">\"The Dunwich Horror\"</a>.
