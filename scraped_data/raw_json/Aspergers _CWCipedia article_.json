Similar to his (former) irrational hatred for <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Harry_Potter\" title=\"Harry Potter\">Harry Potter</a></i>, Chris's distaste for <a href=\"/cwcki/Asperger_syndrome\" title=\"Asperger syndrome\">Asperger's</a> is based not on reason but on his misconception that it is somehow competing with his precious crutch of <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">autism</a>. Chris has established an unwavering <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_brand_loyalty#Autism_vs._Asperger's\" title=\"Chris and brand loyalty\">brand loyalty</a>, and he'll be damned if he gives any ground to this diabolical \"competitor.\" It would be shocking, if not for the fact that this is typical <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler\">Christian Weston Chandler</a>.\n</p><p>Chris has long suggested that somehow his form of autism is more special and worthy of pity than the forms of autism other people have. He'd never really given much of a reason as to <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">why he felt this way</a>, though he started getting pressed heavily on the subject in several letters he received through his <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag\" title=\"Mailbag\">mailbag</a>. When trying to explain why autism is completely different than Asperger's syndrome, he would cite sources that actually went against his suppositions. When people pointed that out, he finally decided to vomit a hateful essay all over his site that suggested, among other things, that he <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">\"Helped cultivate the First Generation of Autistic People\"</a>, that he was <a href=\"/cwcki/Slow-in-the-minds\" title=\"Slow-in-the-minds\">one of the most successful autistic people of all time</a>, and that those afflicted with Asperger's syndrome are <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/CChanSonichuCWC\" title=\"CChanSonichuCWC\">\"impostors\"</a> who are hogging the \"limelight\" from <a href=\"/cwcki/Kick_the_Autistic\" title=\"Kick the Autistic\">autistics</a>. \n</p><p>He also acts as if the fact that the name can sound like \"ass-burgers\" or \"ass-boogers\" (\"Most Terrible Cut of Meat from any Animal; even something that can be picked nasally\") is more proof that the classification of Asperger's as a type of autism is flawed (as if poor Hans's last name, which likely came from <i>Asperge</i>, a Central European word for \"asparagus,\" were his fault). Chris misses the irony that ass meat is exactly what he eats every time he drives to <a href=\"/cwcki/McDonald%27s\" title=\"McDonald's\">McDonald's</a>. \n</p><p>Long story short, he's merely crying that he thinks that people with Asperger's receive positive care and attention <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">he feels he should be receiving instead</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Article\">Article</span></h2>\n<p><b>Christian Weston Chandler's Opinion on the Autisim/Aspergers Comparison.</b>\n</p><p>December 4, 2009\n</p><p><br/>\nGood day, I, Christian Weston Chandler, of sound <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_psychology\" title=\"Chris and psychology\">mind</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_health\" title=\"Chris and health\">body</a>, type the following from <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/TRUE_and_HONEST\" title=\"TRUE and HONEST\">honest</a> personal opinions, and I <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_remorse\" title=\"Chris and remorse\">apologize for all offensive remarks</a> I will be making in the statement.\n</p><p><br/>\nAspergers is Nothing At All Like Autism. I have stated this Fact over and over again in my replies to messages from people who tell me otherwise. I feel very sick and tired of hearing that false rumor that the two are Anything to Full Similar.\n</p><p>Firstly, I can verify that I was diagnosed with Autism with papers in my parents' filing cabinets. And more current and immediate within my reach, I have the papers from my <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism_papers\" title=\"Autism papers\">most recent Psychiatric Evaluation</a> on November 5, <a href=\"/cwcki/2004\" title=\"2004\">2004</a> with <b>Dr. Zachariah C. Dameron, III, M.D.</b> She reverifies my Autisim in this, and I quote, \"Mr. Chandler is a 22-year-old man with a history of developmental delays and <b>autism</b>. Despite these limitations, he semms to have been quite successful in maximizing his academic abilities. Despite his significant delays in language, he has over the years developed relatively affective communication skills.\"\n</p><p>And with that, I have not only <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">Helped cultivate the First Generation of Autistic People</a>, but I have gone beyond the Autistic Dreams academically, communicatively and socially. Still, I have trouble maintaining Eye-Contact, my mentality is sometimes slow yet quick at other times. The people who first evaluated me ever even stated that I would never even make it to <a href=\"/cwcki/Manchester_High_School\" title=\"Manchester High School\">High School</a>, much less even <b>Write His Name</b>. Take That and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tobacky\" title=\"Tobacky\">Smoke It</a>, oldest doctors. I have worked very hard to achieve and maintain <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Honor_Roll\" title=\"Honor Roll\">Honor Roll</a> throughout Middle and High School, and even to make the <a href=\"/cwcki/Piedmont_Virginia_Community_College\" title=\"Piedmont Virginia Community College\">PVCC</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Dean's List</a>, and fulfill my parents' wishes to work for and earn the <a href=\"/cwcki/CADD\" title=\"CADD\">Degree and Certificate for Computer Aided Drafting and Design</a>.\n</p><p>And those with Aspergers DARE try to take the Shine and Limelight AWAY from us Autistic people, not only with their \"Social Flaws\" and such possibly similar traits to Autism. But to SHUN us Autistics by being BETTER Communicatively and Mentally than us. I have received a message from one who DARED called me \"Normal\" in comparison to him. IF ANYTHING, the Asperger people ARE and HAVE BEEN NORMAL. They think they can one-up, or even match, autism with the Lack of Social Capability and their Clumsiness and such. THOSE Characteristics can be FAKED by them who are MOST NORMAL compared to us TRUE AUTISTIC PEOPLE.\n</p><p>Even their Title is flawed, \"Aspergers\"; it can be misconstrued into a Most Terrible Cut of Meat from any Animal; even something that can be picked nasally.\n</p><p>I have fought Long and Hard to <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism#Chris_and_other_autistics\" title=\"Autism\">make a Stand for the Autistic People</a>; I will most certainly NOT let these impostors Steal the True Original Title of Autistic from any of us.\n</p><p>VICTORY OVER AUTISM BELONGS ONLY TO US TRUE AUTISTIC PEOPLE.\n</p><p>--ChrisChanSonichu 04:16, 5 December 2009 (CET)\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<div style=\"clear:right; background:#ffffbb; width:300px; padding:3px; border:2px solid #99aaee; float:right; font-size:90%\">\n<div class=\"floatleft\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:CWCipedia_logo.png\"><img alt=\"CWCipedia logo.png\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"60\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/5/54/CWCipedia_logo.png/60px-CWCipedia_logo.png\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/5/54/CWCipedia_logo.png/90px-CWCipedia_logo.png 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/5/54/CWCipedia_logo.png/120px-CWCipedia_logo.png 2x\" width=\"60\"/></a></div>\nFor <a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_Chris%27s_lies\" title=\"List of Chris's lies\">Truth</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Honest_Content\" title=\"Honest Content\">Honesty</a>, see the archived <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia\" title=\"CWCipedia\">CWCipedia</a> page on <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160301/http://archive.sonichu.com/cwcipedia/index.php?title=Aspergers\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aspergers (CWCipedia article)</a></div>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/cwcki/Slow-in-the-minds\" title=\"Slow-in-the-minds\">Slow-in-the-minds</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">Autism</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_Ego\" title=\"Chris and his Ego\">Chris and his Ego</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_psychology\" title=\"Chris and psychology\">Chris and psychology</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag\" title=\"Mailbag\">Mailbag</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Asperger_syndrome\" title=\"Asperger syndrome\">Asperger syndrome</a></li></ul>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCached time: 20250804002622\nCache expiry: 86400\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: []\nCPU time usage: 0.052 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.064 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 50/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 643/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 47/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 6/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/100\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   13.788      1 -total\n100.00%   13.788      1 Template:CWCipedia\n 39.95%    5.508      1 Template:CWCipedia_link\n-->\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key cwcki-1_:pcache:idhash:2766-0!canonical and timestamp 20250804002621 and revision id 348168.
