While most people on the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Internet\" title=\"Internet\">Internet</a> avoid revealing their own personal information, Chris has apparently run out of things he hasn't told about himself, and is now revealing the secrets of others. The fact that he's doing this post-<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Wallflower\" title=\"Wallflower\">Wallflower</a> is surprising, considering that she broke off all ties with him because he leaked her information to the Internet.\n</p><p>The list contains a mixture of real people and <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">trolls</a>, and is apparently in chronological order according to when Chris met them. Oddly, he includes one of his grade-school teachers on a list that is otherwise 100% people Chris wanted to bang. Notable omissions include troll heroine <a href=\"/cwcki/Vivian_Gee\" title=\"Vivian Gee\">Vivian Gee</a> whom Chris has repeatedly claimed is a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Gal-pal\" title=\"Gal-pal\">gal-pal</a>, and the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Hambeast\" title=\"Hambeast\">obese girl</a> Chris went out with once. <a href=\"/cwcki/Rocky_Shoemaker\" title=\"Rocky Shoemaker\">Rocky Shoemaker</a> is also nowhere to be seen, which is unusual considering the inclusion of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Virginia_Sanford\" title=\"Virginia Sanford\">Virginia Sanford</a>, and the <a href=\"/cwcki/IRC_(23_July_2009)\" title=\"IRC (23 July 2009)\">fact that he wanted to rape her</a>.\n</p><p>Another notable omission is <a href=\"/cwcki/Blanca_Weiss\" title=\"Blanca Weiss\">Blanca Weiss</a>, whom Chris has finally identified as a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Troll\" title=\"Troll\">troll</a>. Likewise, <a href=\"/cwcki/Sarah_May\" title=\"Sarah May\">Sarah May</a> is absent, either because Chris remembers that she was a troll or because he's forgotten her entirely. His fictitious girlfriend <a href=\"/cwcki/Chloe\" title=\"Chloe\">Chloe</a> from fall <a href=\"/cwcki/2008\" title=\"2008\">2008</a> isn't listed, but this comes as no surprise, since <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_13\" title=\"Mailbag 13\">Mailbag 13</a> from <a href=\"/cwcki/December_2009\" title=\"December 2009\">December 2009</a> confirmed that he'd forgotten his previous <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Lie\" title=\"Lie\">lie</a>.\n</p><p>Shortly after Chris published the original page, he deleted six entries for reasons unknown: <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tiffany_Robinson\" title=\"Tiffany Robinson\">Tiffany Robinson</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Virginia_Sanford\" title=\"Virginia Sanford\">Virginia Sanford</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Natasha_Turner\" title=\"Natasha Turner\">Natasha Turner</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sarah_Anne_Bevel\" title=\"Sarah Anne Bevel\">Sarah Anne Bevel</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Molly_Quarles\" title=\"Molly Quarles\">Molly Quarles</a>, and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Miranda_Joyce_Mitchell\" title=\"Miranda Joyce Mitchell\">Miranda Joyce Mitchell</a>. \n</p><p>In his entry on <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Megan\" title=\"Megan\">Megan</a>, Chris finally admits that the breakup of his friendship with her was due to his own actions, and in no way implicates his trolls. He is also aware that <a href=\"/cwcki/PandaHalo\" title=\"PandaHalo\">PandaHalo</a> did not die in <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Saturday_bushfires\" title=\"wikipedia:Black Saturday bushfires\">the Australian brushfires</a>, though it is odd that he wished her \"many happy years in their marriage\" when he had recently expressed a desire to <a href=\"/cwcki/Don%27t_Mess_With_Me\" title=\"Don't Mess With Me\">slit her husband's throat</a>.\n</p><p>What follows is the text of the page, unaltered aside from wiki styling, and attempts to conceal the identity of <a href=\"/cwcki/The_Wallflower\" title=\"The Wallflower\">The Wallflower</a>.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Page_text\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Page text</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#How_Do_I_Get_and_Know_So_Many_Women?\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">How Do I Get and Know So Many Women?</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#The_Women_in_my_Life\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The Women in my Life</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Sarah_Nicole_Hammer_(Spicer)\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Sarah Nicole Hammer (Spicer)</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Tiffany_Robinson\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Tiffany Robinson</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Mrs._Virginia_Sanford\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Mrs. Virginia Sanford</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Natasha_Turner\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Natasha Turner</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Laura_Beth_Dorazio\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Laura Beth Dorazio</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#Kellie_Lyn_Andes\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Kellie Lyn Andes</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Tiffany_Nicole_Gowen\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Tiffany Nicole Gowen</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#Sarah_Anne_Bevel\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Sarah Anne Bevel</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#Molly_Quarles\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.9</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Molly Quarles</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-13\"><a href=\"#Miranda_Joyce_Mitchell\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.10</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Miranda Joyce Mitchell</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-14\"><a href=\"#Anna_McLerran\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.11</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Anna McLerran</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-15\"><a href=\"#Megan_Schroeder\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.12</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Megan Schroeder</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-16\"><a href=\"#Sarah_Jackson\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.13</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Sarah Jackson</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-17\"><a href=\"#Sarah_Cassandra_McKenzie,_A.K.A._PandaHalo\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.14</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Sarah Cassandra McKenzie, A.K.A.

We would hang out now and then during school hours and play. Then in the 4th Grade, she dumped me for some other boy. I do not know much of what she has been up to these days.\n</p><p><i>*Shortly after the page's creation, this section was deleted.</i>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Mrs._Virginia_Sanford\">Mrs. <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Virginia_Sanford\" title=\"Virginia Sanford\">Virginia Sanford</a></span></h3>\n<p>She was the most influential teacher in my life. During my years at Providence Middle School, she taught me better social skills, how to better cope with other people, bullies and life. With a positive and fun tomboyish attitude, she was a teacher any child would be most proud to look up to and be taught by.\n</p><p><i>*Shortly after the page's creation, this section was deleted.</i>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Natasha_Turner\">Natasha Turner</span></h3>\n<p>Another girl, slightly older than me, who I felt fond of. I did not meet her until my Providence Middle days. We were next-door neighbors for a while. She hung out with me at the nearby School Bus Stop. She was a good girl.\n</p><p><i>*Shortly after the page's creation, this section was deleted.</i>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Laura_Beth_Dorazio\"><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Laura_Dorazio\" title=\"Laura Dorazio\">Laura Beth Dorazio</a></span></h3>\n<p>I did not meet her until my Freshman Year at Manchester High (she was a Cheerleader then); she was two grades ahead of me, and apparently she went to Providence Middle and was in the same class as me during my time, but she advanced to High School about 7th Grade. She was a pretty girl; I had a crush on her that one year.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Kellie_Lyn_Andes\"><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Kellie_Lyn_Andes\" title=\"Kellie Lyn Andes\">Kellie Lyn Andes</a></span></h3>\n<p>Kellie was my High School Sweetheart (<a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">in my point of view</a>). She was a pretty, sweet and smart girl in my class. We shared a number of classes together. After graduation, I kept touch with her for a while, then that touch got lost. Last I heard from a possibly hers MySpace page, she later got married and now has three children. If I could go back, I would date her <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sex\" title=\"Sex\">and then some</a>. I HAD TO BE NAIVE ON THE DATING SUBJECT BACK THEN!!!\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Tiffany_Nicole_Gowen\"><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tiffany_Nicole_Gowen\" title=\"Tiffany Nicole Gowen\">Tiffany Nicole Gowen</a></span></h3>\n<p>She was a good girl and a good friend to me back in Manchester High. We shared a few classes, and sat at the same lunch table one year or two. She had a spot of a tomboy in her, and reminded me of Peppermint Patty. She danced with me at the Seinor Prom, and I look forward to returning the favor at the Class Reunion.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sarah_Anne_Bevel\"><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sarah_Anne_Bevel\" title=\"Sarah Anne Bevel\">Sarah Anne Bevel</a></span></h3>\n<p>Another good girl of my class; shared classes and a lunch table. Not a moment flew by where I did not see her with her M.H.S. Sweetheart, Brian Smart (Lucky Dude). Last I heard, they broke up years ago now.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Molly_Quarles\">Molly Quarles</span></h3>\n<p>She was funny, sweet and possibly a bit quirky. We shared a few classes, and she was a cheerleader the same year as Laura Beth Dorazio during my Freshman Year, yet Molly was a Freshman too back then. Two years in a dating match-up thing they had every Valentines Day at M.H.S., I got matched up with Molly. The ONLY match-up I felt was a good match-up at all back then.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Miranda_Joyce_Mitchell\">Miranda Joyce Mitchell</span></h3>\n<p>A pretty girl, and was a big brain of my Circle of Friends. We shared a few classes; she was in my Class as well. She helped me in the early days of my Website Days by redesigning the \"CWC's Pok'eSite 2!\" Logo; she did a great job.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Anna_McLerran\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Anna_McLerran\" title=\"Anna McLerran\">Anna McLerran</a></span></h3>\n<p>I met Anna while she was working at a PacSun in Fashion Square during my young adult years and the early days of my Sweetheart Search. She was a good and honest woman. It made me sad when much later she and her family moved to Utah. I later learned she was a Lesbian, and I do not hold that against her at all.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Megan_Schroeder\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Schroeder\" title=\"Megan Schroeder\">Megan Schroeder</a></span></h3>\n<p>She and I were good friends for years when I was going to the Pok'emon TCG League and the Yu-Gi-Oh Tournaments. I was hoping she and I would become Sweethearts, but I <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Fuck_Quest\" title=\"Fuck Quest\">got too close</a>; <a href=\"/cwcki/ShecameforCWC.JPG\" title=\"ShecameforCWC.JPG\">freaked her out a bit</a> and eventually <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Megan_E-mails\" title=\"Megan E-mails\">lost her</a>. <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Mass_debate\" title=\"Mass debate\">I still miss her sometimes</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sarah_Jackson\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Sarah_Jackson\" title=\"Sarah Jackson\">Sarah Jackson</a></span></h3>\n<p>About during the time I was having an online relationship with one Blanca Weiss (Later learned she was a Troll), I met Sarah Jackson online. She was a good woman with sound advice and wisdom. She respected and understood me.  Unfortunately, she got into an automobile accident and passed on.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Sarah_Cassandra_McKenzie.2C_A.K.A._PandaHalo\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sarah_Cassandra_McKenzie,_A.K.A._PandaHalo\"><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sarah_Cassandra_McKenzie\" title=\"Sarah Cassandra McKenzie\">Sarah Cassandra McKenzie</a>, A.K.A. PandaHalo</span></h3>\n<p>She was a true and good Sonichu Girl (Fan); in further conversations long after I ended it with \"Blanca\", Sarah and I established an online relationship, and it was good. Sadly, she would get raped by the troll, \"Clyde Cash\" and stolen from me with their fated child. For over a year, I had thought she fell victim of the Australian Bushfires of Janurary, 2009, and I mourned over her and kept her in my heart. I recently learned that she was still alive, married to Clyde and with healthy child. Even though my memorial dedications were apparently a loss, <a href=\"/cwcki/Don%27t_Mess_With_Me\" title=\"Don't Mess With Me\">I wish Sarah and Clyde many happy years in their marriage</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Ivy_O.27Neil\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ivy_O'Neil\"><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ivy_O%27Neil\" title=\"Ivy O'Neil\">Ivy O'Neil</a></span></h3>\n<p>Another online romance, but better... with Telephone Conversations. Ivy and I were entwined within our relationship for about 3 months; it was good. Then later on, when I was talking to a detective on the case of finding my Trolls and seeing justice done unto them, he looked into Ivy and her family; found NOTHING on them, even her father who was a Police Officer. Then in a mental quandary and confusion, I stopped talking to Ivy for a few months. She called me one last time after the time; I still felt confused. Then I hear from Vivian that Ivy committed suicide by hanging.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Kacey_Devoria\"><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Kacey_Devoria\" title=\"Kacey Devoria\">Kacey Devoria</a></span></h3>\n<p>As I was in the online combat for my own identity against the <a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris\" title=\"Liquid Chris\">Brown-Stripe-Wearing \"Christian Chandler\"</a>, I found my way into his e-mail account. There I found the e-mail of his girlfriend, Kacey. I felt I had to warn her about \"Christian\" lying to her about who he was. It got complicated as <a href=\"/cwcki/For_Kacey_from_CWC\" title=\"For Kacey from CWC\">I pretended to be him</a>, so I could show Kacey my face, the Real Face of <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler\">Christian Weston Chandler</a>* of Ruckersville, VA, and Original Creator of <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu\" title=\"Rosechu\">Rosechu</a>. Eventually, we would be good friends. Then with more complications, and \"Christian\"'s charm, she dumped me as a friend and got married to him. <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_Ego\" title=\"Chris and his Ego\">At least she has MET and was FRIENDS with</a> the Real <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler\">Christian Weston Chandler</a>.*\n</p><p><i>*The dual links to \"Christian Weston Chandler\" in this passage were put there by Chris himself.

We started going out and were getting along together. We had plans on writing on a book together. But I made a huge honest mistake. To begin a small hype with the fans of her online FanFictions about our \"Guardian of the Owl Kingdom\", I started work on a level for <a href=\"/cwcki/LittleBigPlanet\" title=\"LittleBigPlanet\">LittleBiGPlanet</a>. I uploaded a Foretaste Version of the level, stating that it was a \"Chris Chan/(The Wallflower) Production\". Being Well-Aware of the Online Safety, I had thought she would be safe with me using her Pen Name; I HAD NEVER USED HER REAL NAME. But then my Trolls searched and found HER Facebook Page. The Trolls made a mockery page on their website about her; started harassing her and her family by pretending to be me on the telephone. (The Wallflower) broke up our friendship, flat-out. If she did not have a Facebook Page, she would have been safe. But I have learned from my mistakes there.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notes\">Notes</span></h2>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Chris initially used The Wallflower's real name as the title of this section before changing it to her pen name.
