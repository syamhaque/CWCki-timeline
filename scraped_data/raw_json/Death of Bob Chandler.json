He managed to alienate his other children enough that <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Carol_Chandler\" title=\"Carol Chandler\">his daughter</a> didn't attend his funeral or keep in touch while he was alive. He helped Chris to construct <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Matthew_Noble_call\" title=\"Matthew Noble call\">bizarre</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Greene_County_Conspiracy\" title=\"Greene County Conspiracy\">conspiracy theories</a> to justify <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_the_law\" title=\"Chris and the law\">trespassing and the like</a>, among <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">other things</a>. He, like Barbara, enabled Chris's crippling dependence on them, general immaturity and irresponsibility, and his myriad of other flaws. He bailed out his son repeatedly and never really let Chris experience the <a href=\"/cwcki/Financhu_Crisis\" title=\"Financhu Crisis\">consequences</a> of his misinformed <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_money\" title=\"Chris and money\">life decisions</a>. He never made any serious effort to correct his son's glaring character flaws and shortcomings, even when he <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Walks_In\" title=\"Bob Walks In\">caught him masturbating in the kitchen</a>. The <a href=\"/cwcki/THAT_IS_MY_HOUSE\" title=\"THAT IS MY HOUSE\">few</a> times he did intervene, it wasn't even for Chris's own benefit, but to shake off the trolls and the Health department. He also did not make any real attempt to provide for Chris's future, beyond ensuring the tugboat. He left all of his money to Barbara, who promptly wasted it all on <a href=\"/cwcki/Rob_Bell\" title=\"Rob Bell\">lawyer's fees</a> – a conscientious parent would have anticipated this and put some of the money in a trust for Chris, not that Chris would've handled the money any better.
