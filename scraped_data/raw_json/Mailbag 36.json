As he tried to rush through the four mailbags marathon-style, what he created was less of a series of answers, and more of a real-time picture of Chris having an emotional breakdown. Letters were deleted with increasing frequency; answers became shorter, ruder, and relied more on ALL CAPS; and he finally quit on <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_39\" title=\"Mailbag 39\">Mailbag 39</a> to vent his frustrations <a href=\"/cwcki/12_January_2010\" title=\"12 January 2010\">by screaming like a child.</a>\n</p><p>Part one of this four-part epic touched on a number of subjects. Notable among them was Chris excusing his (imaginary) infidelity by treating advances from a girl as though they were a brute force of nature, unstoppable and beyond comprehension. He also defended some of his more tasteless drawings, defended his joblessness (going so far as to claim that a <a href=\"/cwcki/Charlottesville,_VA\" title=\"Charlottesville, VA\">college town</a> with a large amount of development and construction had no openings), failed to respond to a letter about his inability to write, and deleted a very sincere appeal from a former True and Honest fan.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Answered\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Answered</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Inquiry_of_Chris's_Unemployment\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Inquiry of Chris's Unemployment</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Police_Simulation_of_Elderly_Chris\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Police Simulation of Elderly Chris</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Questioning_Chris's_Faith\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Questioning Chris's Faith</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Regarding_Spoilers_in_the_Comic\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Regarding Spoilers in the Comic</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Thoughts_on_Moral_Orel\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Thoughts on Moral Orel</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Censorship_Hypocrisy\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Censorship Hypocrisy</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#2-D_Love_and_Meg_Griffin\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">2-D Love and Meg Griffin</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#Rejected_Mailbag\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Rejected Mailbag</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Claim_That_Sonichu_is_Derivative_of_Asperchu\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Claim That Sonichu is Derivative of Asperchu</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#Gone_Forever\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Gone Forever</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#Chris's_Birthday/Holiday,_the_Nazi_Party,_and_Communism\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris's Birthday/Holiday, the Nazi Party, and Communism</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-13\"><a href=\"#Logical_Discrepancies_Regarding_Magi-chan\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Logical Discrepancies Regarding Magi-chan</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-14\"><a href=\"#Exposing_Chris's_Lies_and_Threat_of_Damnation\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Exposing Chris's Lies and Threat of Damnation</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-15\"><a href=\"#Reconsidering_Asperchu\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Reconsidering Asperchu</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-16\"><a href=\"#Cruelty_Toward_Leary\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Cruelty Toward Leary</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Answered\">Answered</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Inquiry_of_Chris.27s_Unemployment\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Inquiry_of_Chris's_Unemployment\">Inquiry of Chris's Unemployment</span></h3>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #B48246; padding:5px; background-color:#FCC\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>From: <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Mitnick\" title=\"wikipedia:Kevin Mitnick\">Kevin Mitnick</a>\n<p>Chris,\n</p><p>If a \"degree is a degree\" to you why don't you try and use your <a href=\"/cwcki/CADD\" title=\"CADD\">CADD</a> degree to get a job as an engineer or an architect?
