Out of all of the groups in the Unholy Quintet, White Knights are by far the most benevolent, but many are <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Naive\" title=\"Naive\">naive</a> to the fact that getting Chris to halt his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_Ego\" title=\"Chris and his Ego\">self-destructive lifestyle</a> is going to take a lot more than <a href=\"/cwcki/April_2017_Facebook_posts#Chris_explains_why_he_won't_get_a_job\" title=\"April 2017 Facebook posts\">a message</a> on social media, or a <a href=\"/cwcki/Patreon\" title=\"Patreon\">Patreon</a> donation.\n</p><p>There is nothing wrong with feeling sorry for Chris, but without a combination of <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tough_love\" title=\"wikipedia:tough love\"><i>really</i> tough love</a> and proper resources, White Knights can unknowingly be as dangerous to Chris as the other three groups (sometimes worse), especially if they <a href=\"#Enablers\">play along</a> with Chris's belief that <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a> and his characters <a href=\"/cwcki/Imaginary_friends\" title=\"Imaginary friends\">are real</a>, or donate large amounts of money that Chris will blow away on <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/List_of_conventions_attended_by_Chris\" title=\"List of conventions attended by Chris\">conventions</a>, toys and video games.\n</p><p>The level of devotion by White Knights vary greatly: the most moderate either back down or ask for a second opinion before making a fool of themselves, but the most fanatical may defend Chris even when it is clear as day that Chris was <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_the_law\" title=\"Chris and the law\">in the wrong</a>. \n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Criteria\">Criteria</span></h3>\n<ul><li>A person who fervently defends Chris, even after it is obvious that Chris was <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_the_law\" title=\"Chris and the law\">in the wrong</a>.</li>\n<li>A person who constantly praises Chris, even when such praise doesn’t fit his overall character or skills.</li>\n<li>A person who believes that Chris's poor decisions can be overlooked, because of his <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">disability</a> (spoiler: it's not always the case).<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup></li>\n<li>A person who attempts to paint themselves as heroic in the Chris Chan saga, despite having done many morally questionable acts, and lying about it, to gain fame.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"A-Logs\">A-Logs</span></h2>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/A-Logging\" title=\"A-Logging\">A-Logging</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p><b>A-Logs</b> (or <b>A-Loggers</b>) are people who express disproportionate levels of hatred for Chris, often wishing <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Destruction_Of_Chris%27s_House\" title=\"Destruction Of Chris's House\">misery</a> or physical harm on him. The term comes from Anthony \"A-Log\" Logatto, who would constantly boast about his superiority over Chris (and other people), and attempt to frame Chris as evil (and not <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Naive\" title=\"Naive\">naive</a> in reality).\n</p><p>A-Logs often sit in the opposite extreme of <a href=\"#White_Knights\">White Knights</a>: while White Knights try (and fail) to defend and help Chris, A-Logs try (and fail) to compare Chris to actual tyrants like <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9oneste_Bagosora\" title=\"wikipedia:Théoneste Bagosora\">Théoneste Bagosora</a> and <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolae_Ceau%C8%99escu\" title=\"wikipedia:Nicolae Ceaușescu\">Nicolae Ceaușescu</a>: one does not have to mention another certain tyrant to understand how A-Logging against Chris makes no sense.\n</p><p>Some <a href=\"#Weens\">weens</a> and malicious <a href=\"#Weens\">enablers</a> may adopt one or more tactics from A-Logs as part of their attempt to ruin Chris's life. Examples include flooding listings of establishments that Chris visits with negative reviews about him, or pure <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys#Extortion\" title=\"Idea Guys\">extortion</a> in an attempt to brute-force misery or physical harm on Chris.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Criteria_2\">Criteria</span></h3>\n<ul><li>A person who tries to compare Chris to someone who is genuinely evil, such as a mass murderer or a war criminal.</li>\n<li>A person who tries to interpret Chris's flaws as a threat to society, rather than as a result of <a href=\"/cwcki/Borb\" title=\"Borb\">bad parenting</a>.</li>\n<li>A person who celebrates or gloats when something bad happens to Chris.</li>\n<li>A person who wishes or tries to brute-force misery or physical harm on Chris.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Enablers\">Enablers</span></h2>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Enablers\" title=\"Enablers\">Enablers</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p><b>Enablers</b> are people who consistently feed into Chris’s bad habits. Unlike all other groups in the Tetrad, enablers come in all kinds of varieties. Some play along with Chris's beliefs about himself and the rest of the world. Others will donate money to him despite him imminently wasting any kind of money he already owns. All enablers do these things, and many others, with various intents and purposes. \n</p><p>Enablers usually agree with, and form a <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_religion\" title=\"Chris and religion\">religion</a> of, Chris's belief that <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a> and his <a href=\"/cwcki/Electric_Hedgehog_Pok%C3%A9mon\" title=\"Electric Hedgehog Pokémon\">Electric Hedgehog Pokémon</a> are real in the so-called \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Dimension\" title=\"Dimension\">dimension</a>\" of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/C-197\" title=\"C-197\">C-197</a>, where all other fictional characters and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/OCs\" title=\"OCs\">OCs</a> live, <a href=\"/cwcki/Dimensions#Miscellaneous_dimensions\" title=\"Dimensions\">plus a multitude of other dimensions</a>, and that he is the <a href=\"/cwcki/Hyperdimension_Neptunia\" title=\"Hyperdimension Neptunia\">CPU</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_religion#Delusions_of_godhood\" title=\"Chris and religion\">Goddess</a> of that dimension.  They also encourage Chris's beliefs that the <a href=\"/cwcki/Dimensional_Merge\" title=\"Dimensional Merge\">Dimensional Merge</a>, the apocalyptic event where <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Dimension_1218\" title=\"Dimension 1218\">Dimension 1218</a> (the dimension we live in) merges with C-197 into \"Dimension <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/1C-211987\" title=\"1C-211987\">1C-211987</a>\" to bring fictional characters and OCs into the real world, will happen in the very near future. Enablers will frequently donate large amounts of money that Chris will blow away to fuel his <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan_Syndrome\" title=\"wikipedia:Peter Pan Syndrome\">Peter Pan</a> lifestyle. However, some enablers and <a href=\"#Weens\">weens</a> (such as the <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys</a>) <a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_beliefs_brainwashed_into_Chris\" title=\"List of beliefs brainwashed into Chris\">exploited</a> Chris's weak grasp on reality for nefarious purposes.\n</p><p>Enablers are the most harmful to Chris, because it only fuels his already <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">hyperinflated ego</a>, in which he answers to no one but himself, and that people will always provide for him in all cases. In the case of the Idea Guys, their exploitation of Chris's naivety not only corrupted the <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\">Sonichu</a></i> lore, but their extortion nearly caused financial ruin in <a href=\"/cwcki/May_2018\" title=\"May 2018\">May 2018</a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup>\n</p><p>In the 25 years since the creation of <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(character)\" title=\"Sonichu (character)\">Sonichu</a>, Chris's grasp on reality has deteriorated to a point that some <a href=\"#White_Knights\">White Knights</a> face having to play along with Chris's beliefs to get in touch with him, and even after that there is no guarantee that Chris will follow their advice.\n</p><p>The works of the enablers are so well recognized by Chris himself that he refers to them officially as <b>Devotees of Chris Chan Sonichu (DoCCS)</b>, or more simply <b>devotees</b>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Criteria_3\">Criteria</span></h3>\n<ul><li>A person who encourages Chris to continue his Peter Pan lifestyle in some way.</li>\n<li>A person who pretends to believe, or genuinely believes, Chris's interpretation of reality as fact.</li>\n<li>A person who exploits Chris's weak grasp on reality for malicious purposes.</li>\n<li>A person who donates money to Chris despite <i>numerous warnings</i> not to from other people.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Weens\">Weens</span></h2>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Weens\" title=\"Weens\">Weens</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p><b>Weens</b> are people who try <u>and</u> fail to troll Chris or interfere with his life.

Some erroneously use the term against anyone who contacted Chris, even if they do not even fit the criteria of any of the Unholy Quintet.\n</p><p>Regardless of how the term is used, trying to annoy Chris is utterly pointless, as Chris is no longer negatively phased by most trolling attempts.
