A year later, he moved shop to Etsy, under a brand titled \"Cwcville Shopping\". He also began selling printed copies of Sonichu on Lulu. He held a steady stream of customers, despite issues with production and sending orders on time. For a while, he had achieved his dream of selling his own Sonichu merchandise, and was making plenty of <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_money\" title=\"Chris and money\">money</a>.\n</p><p>However, exactly two years and one week after the start of his business, on 8 <a href=\"/cwcki/June_2016\" title=\"June 2016\">June 2016</a>, Chris's infamous laziness caught up to him, and he was banned from Etsy for ignoring orders over a span of months beginning from when he bought a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PS4\" title=\"PS4\">PS4</a>. He did not take responsibility for the self-inflicted failure of his business. Instead, he lied to save face and cast blame on Lulu.com's staff for having stressed him out by labeling Sonichu as fan fiction and banning his account half a year beforehand in December 2016 (even though he had actually ban-evaded by opening a private account and was back to offering books through Lulu's services only weeks later).\n</p><p>After the Etsy ban, Chris fell back on <a href=\"/cwcki/Financhu_Crisis\" title=\"Financhu Crisis\">begging</a> and Paid Video Requests to cover <a href=\"/cwcki/Barbara_Chandler\" title=\"Barbara Chandler\">Barb</a>'s credit card bills and his expensive toy purchases. In May 2017, he felt like returning to work on the Sonichu comic and, throughout the next several months, began to rebuild his business, using Patreon, Lulu and Redbubble, and accepting interviews for money.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#List_of_ventures_by_type\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">List of ventures by type</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Storefronts\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Storefronts</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Self-publishing\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Self-publishing</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Commissioning\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Commissioning</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Miscellaneous_affairs\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Miscellaneous affairs</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Abortive_ventures\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Abortive ventures</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Customers_and_their_reasons_for_buying\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Customers and their reasons for buying</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Ad_revenue\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Ad revenue</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#Schedule_slip\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Schedule slip</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Pipe_dreams\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Pipe dreams</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#Official_publication\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Official publication</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#Games_and_merchandise\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Games and merchandise</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-13\"><a href=\"#In_general\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">In general</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-14\"><a href=\"#The_future_of_Chris_and_his_business_attempts\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The future of Chris and his business attempts</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-15\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-16\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"List_of_ventures_by_type\">List of ventures by type</span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Storefronts\">Storefronts</span></h3>\n<dl><dd><i>Main articles: <a href=\"/cwcki/EBay\" title=\"EBay\">eBay</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Etsy\" title=\"Etsy\">Etsy</a></i> <i> </i></dd></dl>\n<p>On 1 June 2014, Chris began cashing in on his Internet infamy, by offering custom artwork for sale. He later expanded his sales to include autographed photos, medallions, custom Amiibos, and personal items related to Christory. This would be his most profitable and otherwise his most important commercial endeavour. Over the years, he would earn thousands of dollars by selling off Sonichu-themed memorabilia and sundries;<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup> the largest financial contributions were often made by aspiring <a href=\"/cwcki/Weens\" title=\"Weens\">weens</a> to establish contact with Chris and put themselves in a friendly position.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup> He would not always fulfil his orders, however, and after receiving an abysmal 85% satisfaction rating through customer reviews, his merchant account was <a href=\"/cwcki/EBay#Suspension_of_Chris's_eBay\" title=\"EBay\">suspended</a> on 16 <a href=\"/cwcki/June_2019\" title=\"June 2019\">June 2019</a>. Proposals to circumvent the ban through a partnership with <a href=\"/cwcki/Jacob_Sockness\" title=\"Jacob Sockness\">Jacob Sockness</a> were never implemented.  \n</p><p>On 2 <a href=\"/cwcki/September_2015\" title=\"September 2015\">September 2015</a>, Chris expanded his online business to Etsy. He continued the same offerings from eBay and added a donation listing for the continuation of the Sonichu series. Days later, on 5 September, a YouTuber named <a href=\"/cwcki/DStecks\" title=\"DStecks\">DStecks</a> donated $1,000, thinking that Chris would deliver 100 pages of Sonichu. Instead, Chris completed 16 pages before dropping the project. This move remains controversial with Christorians, as while some believe that he honestly wanted <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_11\" title=\"Sonichu 11\"><i>Sonichu</i> #11</a> to continue, others argue that this <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ween\" title=\"Ween\">weenish</a> move validated begging in Chris's eyes, as seen with the influx of begging videos in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Financhu_Crisis\" title=\"Financhu Crisis\">Financhu Crisis</a>. In addition to DStecks, dozens of fans had also donated. Chris simply claimed that he was too stressed to continue <i>Sonichu</i> #11<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]</a></sup>.\n</p><p>However, Chris still had a passion for making custom <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Amiibo\" title=\"Amiibo\">Amiibos</a> for several months afterwards; he took it seriously enough that he was willing to <a href=\"/cwcki/Ohio_trip\" title=\"Ohio trip\">drive hundreds of miles</a> through Virginia just to buy parts for Amiibos to sell on Etsy.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-7\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">[7]</a></sup> He wasted hundreds of dollars buying up Amiibos on eBay, thinking that the market for his custom figures would sustain itself indefinitely. This was not the case. and Chris eventually grew apathetic and bored with earning his own money. To complicate things further, Chris purchased a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PS4\" title=\"PS4\">PS4</a> in <a href=\"/cwcki/March_2016\" title=\"March 2016\">March 2016</a>. The new life upgrade proved too distracting, and he ignored Etsy orders, often for months. Ultimately, Etsy took notice and banned his store from doing business.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Self-publishing\">Self-publishing</span></h3>\n<dl><dd><i>Main articles: <a href=\"/cwcki/Lulu\" title=\"Lulu\">Lulu</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Redbubble\" title=\"Redbubble\">Redbubble</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>Chris took over a decade to try any self-publishing channels. <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">Clyde Cash</a> beat him to the punch by posting Chris's comics on Lulu.com. Chris simply retorted by encouraging his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Fans\" title=\"Fans\">fans</a> not to buy them, and to simply wait for him to release the \"real\" versions later. According to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jackie_e-mails_Part_2\" title=\"Jackie e-mails Part 2\">emails from 2010</a>, Chris claimed that he was working on fixing up his pages to be published on Lulu, taking an unreasonable amount of time to accomplish this amazingly simple task, and he eventually dropped the project. Undaunted, Chris began selling printed copies of the Sonichu comic on Lulu.com in September 2015,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-8\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">[8]</a></sup> as well as offering autographed versions through Etsy (by ordering the comics from Lulu, signing them, then shipping to the buyers). \n</p><p>In December 2015, Chris was banned from Lulu for selling <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\">fan fiction</a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-9\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">[9]</a></sup> In true Chris fashion, he responded by threatening Lulu's executives with physical violence,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-10\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">[10]</a></sup> despite the fact that he was on probation for <a href=\"/cwcki/26_December_2014\" title=\"26 December 2014\">an act of violence</a> against a GameStop employee. Chris was able to continue selling comics in January 2016,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-11\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">[11]</a></sup> probably rejoining Lulu under an alternate account. He was discovered within a few months, and again his account was shut down.\n</p><p>Deprived of other reliable avenues, Chris has torpidly sought other ways to sell his own works. He opened a shop on Redbubble, an online shopping company where users can sell custom-printed items based on images of the seller's choice, on 3 <a href=\"/cwcki/October_2017\" title=\"October 2017\">October 2017</a>, selling pictures of himself pre-<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tomgirl\" title=\"Tomgirl\">Tomgirl</a> and drawings of himself on framed pictures, pillows, and miniskirts, among others. Much later, on 23 <a href=\"/cwcki/November_2019\" title=\"November 2019\">November 2019</a>, the spiritual successor to Chris's Etsy opened as a new Web site of the same name: <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Cwcvilleshopping.com\" title=\"Cwcvilleshopping.com\">Cwcvilleshopping.com</a>. Here, Chris would offer his <a href=\"/cwcki/Twilight_Sparkle%27s_Secret_Shipfic_Folder\" title=\"Twilight Sparkle's Secret Shipfic Folder\">handmade trading cards</a> for a <i><a href=\"/cwcki/My_Little_Pony\" title=\"My Little Pony\">My Little Pony</a></i>-themed game at extreme prices. \n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Commissioning\">Commissioning</span></h3>\n<dl><dd><i>Main articles: <a href=\"/cwcki/Paid_Video_Requests\" title=\"Paid Video Requests\">Paid Video Requests</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Patreon\" title=\"Patreon\">Patreon</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>In December 2015, <a href=\"/cwcki/$50_for_a_video_holiday_greeting!\" title=\"$50 for a video holiday greeting!\"><b>the singularity</b></a> happened. On Etsy, Chris offered to create a personalized video message for anyone who paid $50. Many of his fans took him up on the offer, thinking they could become <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Weening\" title=\"Weening\">a part of Christory</a> by simply handing their money over to him. He received four sales within the first three days,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-12\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">[12]</a></sup> although those customers opted for their videos to be unlisted.

He initially set it up to beg for money, claiming that he would produce more Sonichu comics if his fans paid off his mortgage and bills – he was met with low support levels, generally below $40 per month. This suddenly changed around <a href=\"/cwcki/June_2017\" title=\"June 2017\">June 2017</a>. Picking up momentum from resuming the Sonichu comic of his own volition in May, he revamped his Patreon to offer more reasonable support tiers for fans. He has enjoyed a significant uptick in support due to his continued work on the comic, earning around $500-600 per month. As his interest in his own comic has abated, and new pages more rarely released, patron support has shrivelled to about a third of its peak. Reforming his backer awards by distinguishing different <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_English\" title=\"Chris and English\">teirs</a></i> for every dollar level given have not improved his steady decline in support.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Miscellaneous_affairs\">Miscellaneous affairs</span></h3>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_Entertainment_of_America\" title=\"Sonichu Entertainment of America\">Sonichu Entertainment of America</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>In <a href=\"/cwcki/May_2016\" title=\"May 2016\">May 2016</a>, Chris displayed a level of financial ignorance that shatters any hope of him ever becoming competent with money. Days after <a href=\"/cwcki/Please,_Donate\" title=\"Please, Donate\">begging for donations</a> to assist his ailing household, he announced that he would be starting <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_Entertainment_of_America\" title=\"Sonichu Entertainment of America\">his own business</a>, with the declaration that each employee's salary would be <i>25% of the profit.</i> Naturally, Chris completely fails to realize that under these conditions, he would have no money at all if he had four or more employees. However, that's just the tip of the iceberg; days later, he uploaded <a href=\"/cwcki/Proposition_to_Sega\" title=\"Proposition to Sega\">a video</a> attempting to go into business with Sega to create official Sonichu products. In the video, he demands a six-figure salary, along with <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_health\" title=\"Chris and health\">full insurance benefits</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">maternity leave</a>. These incidents seem to indicate Chris's belief that money comes out of nowhere and is unlimited in value. Three years later, in <a href=\"/cwcki/April_2019\" title=\"April 2019\">April 2019</a>, <i>Sonichu Entertainment of America</i> was noted by Google Maps, prompting Chris to laud his company as legitimate in a video, though it would see no further activity.\n</p><p>On 24 November 2016, Chris asked his audience to watch a clip of him playing <i>Skylanders</i>, by uploading <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_vs_Koas\" title=\"CWC vs Koas\">CWC vs Koas</a>, in order to promote the idea of selling his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_Ego#Fixation_on_self-image\" title=\"Chris and his Ego\">in-game figure</a> to them using the game's <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.skylanders.com/creator\" rel=\"nofollow\">Skylanders Creation app</a>.

A February 2019 video in which a customer unboxed a <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_0\" title=\"Sonichu 0\">Sonichu 0</a> comic printed from <a href=\"/cwcki/Lulu\" title=\"Lulu\">Lulu</a> attracted over 100,000 views, and many commentators expressed a desire to buy for themselves.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-35\"><a href=\"#cite_note-35\">[35]</a></sup> Ironically, the resulting bump in Chris's Patreon gave him so many orders to fulfill that he crashed into slumber and simply ignored the backlog of orders.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ad_revenue\">Ad revenue</span></h2>\n<p>When he was uploading his <i>Sonichu</i> comic pages to the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia\" title=\"CWCipedia\">CWCipedia</a> in 2009, the thought of monetizing his web comic didn't cross his mind. People had been annoying – nay, <i>harassing</i> him with advertising he didn't approve of, yet when he attempted to replace these offensive ads with ads of his own, he simply put some random advertisements on his webpage <i>without actually signing any sort of advertisement contract</i> – the ads didn't make him any money. There are several advertising programs that allow individual people to put ads on their personal pages and make money out of them; some of these programs are even specifically geared toward webcomic artists. Many web comics have a donation box where readers can donate money to the artist via PayPal or similar services.\n</p><p>In 2016, Chris monetized his YouTube channel<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-36\"><a href=\"#cite_note-36\">[36]</a></sup> and added a Support button<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-37\"><a href=\"#cite_note-37\">[37]</a></sup> (ostensibly to accept donations for Sonichu projects, even though he didn't want to work on that, and for a year, YouTube simply became another place from which he could beg for money).\n</p><p>It took a while for Chris to try drawing on-camera in <a href=\"/cwcki/Live_Drawing_Streams\" title=\"Live Drawing Streams\">Live Drawing Streams</a>, and even then, he hasn't demonstrated it too often and has done an extremely poor job of it. He simply sits in front of his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PS4\" title=\"PS4\">PS4</a> camera, which is hard-coded to only record in flipped mirror mode, and is positioned so that viewers see an upside-down video set at a dizzying angle.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Schedule_slip\">Schedule slip</span></h2>\n<p>Most webcomics have a set schedule: some update weekly, some many times a week, some daily. Some webcomics update whenever the hell the artists get inspired enough to draw a comic, and probably reserve a whole forum for people who whine about lack of updates. Most webcomic artists that update the comic three times a week consider that schedule very demanding, and webcomics that update daily usually generate revenue of some sort (ads, donations, print versions, merchandise, what-have-you), allowing the artists treat their comics like a full-day job. These are called self-sufficient webcomics. (Examples: <i>Penny Arcade</i>, <i>xkcd</i>, <i>Questionable Content</i>.)\n</p><p>Chris has thoroughly embraced the point of view that the comic shouldn't have a set schedule and inspiration doesn't have a deadline... while <i>also</i> promising us that the comic would be updated daily. On 14 <a href=\"/cwcki/November_2009\" title=\"November 2009\">November 2009</a>, Chris promised that the comic would be updated daily, and he managed to fulfill this promise for a while. By the end of <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_10\" title=\"Sonichu 10\"><i>Sonichu</i> #10</a>, Chris was already placing author-substitutes in the story telling people to quit whining about the lack of updates. This is obviously not a question of punctuality, but <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_hypocrisy\" title=\"Chris and hypocrisy\">hypocrisy</a>; Chris would avoid a lot of drama if he just admitted that there's no set schedule whatsoever after all. If one <i>does</i> consider this a question of punctuality, it doesn't look too good.\n</p><p>Chris also tends to update in spurts in an attempt to make up for missed days; this can range anywhere from three to twenty pages at a time. Most professional web cartoonists have a buffer of guest comics so that they can avoid this sort of thing, but the thought of doing so has apparently never entered Chris's <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">autistic</a> mind.\n</p><p>The same mindset also pervades every other aspect of his business, namely that Chris will procrastinate on shipping orders. A key example is how he almost fucked up the <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_Totem\" title=\"Sonic Totem\">Sonic Totem</a> sale - he received $1,500 for it, immediately wasted much of his profit on <a href=\"/cwcki/$400_gold_necklace\" title=\"$400 gold necklace\">bling</a> and failed to ship it to the buyer on time, saying that he had run out of money to pay for mailing it, and only got around to having his mother scrounge up the cash to do so after the buyer filed a Paypal dispute. He also lost his Etsy shop as a direct result of his poor work ethic.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Pipe_dreams\">Pipe dreams</span></h2>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">----When Do You Want <a href=\"/cwcki/Nintendo\" title=\"Nintendo\">Nintendo</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/SEGA\" title=\"SEGA\">SEGA</a> to Talk to Me to EVOLVE <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(character)\" title=\"Sonichu (character)\">Sonichu</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu\" title=\"Rosechu\">Rosechu</a> more Realistically?----\n<p>NOW!!!\n</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:11px; padding:0 0 0 16px; vertical-align:bottom; width:20px\">”\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\" style=\"font-size:smaller; padding:8px 36px; text-align:right;\"><cite>Chris, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/An_Important_Update\" title=\"An Important Update\">demanding that multinational corporations take orders from a nobody</a></cite>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>Chris has had numerous aspirations to work in creative industries. So far, he has expressed his desire to make <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(game)\" title=\"Sonichu (game)\">several official <i>Sonichu</i> video games</a>, and work on a real <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\"><i>Sonichu</i> comic</a> for a real comic publisher. However, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_Ego\" title=\"Chris and his Ego\">for reasons best known to himself</a>, he elects not to find out how these industries actually work, which is quite strange; one would assume that a person seeking a career in the industries would at least take <i>some</i> effort to find out how the said industries work.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Official_publication\">Official publication</span></h3>\n<p>In <i><a href=\"/cwcki/The_Sonichu_Chronicles\" title=\"The Sonichu Chronicles\">The Sonichu Chronicles</a></i> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris%27s_resume\" title=\"Chris's resume\">Chris's résumé</a>, it's revealed that Chris is under the impression that his <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_art\" title=\"Chris and art\">art</a> isn't just good, but professional quality, and that he aspires to get into the comics and video game business. The résumé reveals his widely varied skills with both pens and crayons and his desire to work as an artist for a professional comic company such as <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie_Comics\" title=\"wikipedia:Archie Comics\">Archie Comics</a> or <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics\" title=\"wikipedia:Marvel Comics\">Marvel</a>, creating his <i>Sonichu</i> comics. There is no word on whether or not he actually submitted anything to these companies, or if they replied.\n</p><p>Unfortunately for Chris, the publishing industry doesn't work this way, especially not in the case of \"original\" creations. In the case of original work, the publishers expect complete works to be submitted to them, usually through an agent. An agent's job is to separate the <a href=\"/cwcki/Asperchu\" title=\"Asperchu\">wheat</a> from the <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\">chaff</a> and find the correct publisher for the work, taking a small percentage of the eventual profit for their reward. If the publishers take unsolicited submissions, they have to sift through a gigantic backlog (often called \"slushpile\") of submissions of highly varying quality, most of which end up rejected multiple times before there will be a publisher with the right market in mind and the right publication schedule to allow the publication deal to go forward. The whole process can take years in case of a single work.\n</p><p>If comic book publishers have salaried artists, they usually need to have a portfolio of previous work, usually work that has already been published commercially, or (if the comic house is <i>particularly</i> lenient, and most big names aren't) there has to be evidence of a successfully self-published, high-quality comic. And even in this case, these artists usually only work on characters and plotlines that come from inside the house; it can take time before the artist is in any position to present their own ideas for comics, or use their own original characters. Even if he <i>were</i> able to stick in a company for a long time, he'd still need to improve his communication skills a lot. If the <i><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_Chronicles\" title=\"Sonichu Chronicles\">Sonichu Chronicles</a></i> PowerPoint and various phone conversations are of any indication, he's unable to persuade his superiors that his ideas are worth working on.\n</p><p>In short, Chris is deluded if he thinks that any company will just pick him up and tell him to work on <i>Sonichu</i> comics.\n</p><p>Even if Chris does get in, there's also the problem with scheduling. Most comics are worked on far in advance, thus allowing for any changes concerning a book, such as plot problems, character availability changes or even cancellations. Even so, many of them maintain a certain schedule, either monthly or bi-monthly (sometimes quarterly). Very rarely do comics go bi-weekly (one every two weeks), though weekly series have been more common, though infrequent. (<a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Comics\" title=\"wikipedia:DC Comics\">DC Comics</a>, for example, experimented with the weekly format in the <a href=\"/cwcki/1980s\" title=\"1980s\">1980s</a> with <i><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_Comics#Action_Comics_Weekly\" title=\"wikipedia:Action Comics\">Action Comics Weekly</a></i>, an anthology which bombed and put the title on hiatus for a few months, returning it to its normal <i><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_Comics\" title=\"wikipedia:Action Comics\">Action Comics</a></i> title and monthly format. Twenty years later, DC has churned out a number of weekly series, including <i><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52_(comics)\" title=\"wikipedia:52 (comics)\">52</a></i>, <i><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countdown_to_Final_Crisis\" title=\"wikipedia:Countdown to Final Crisis\">Countdown</a></i>, <i><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_(comic_book)\" title=\"wikipedia:Trinity (comic book)\">Trinity</a></i> and more recently <i><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_52:_Future%27s_End\" title=\"wikipedia:The New 52: Future's End\">The New 52: Future's End</a></i>.)\n</p><p>Chris, however, has no schedule. His schedule consists of \"whenever he has the inspiration\" to work. That doesn't cut it. If Chris went with that alone, he would have a release schedule that would rival <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Liefeld\" title=\"wikipedia:Rob Liefeld\">Rob Liefeld</a> and <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_Time\" title=\"wikipedia:Valve Time\">Valve</a>. And where Liefeld, for the most part, could get away with it because he owned his own company at one point (and people have gotten him to actually do the work), if Chris pulled this kind of stunt, he'd be out on the street so fast, his head would spin.\n</p><p>Chris's understanding of <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_copyright\" title=\"Chris and copyright\">copyright</a> is a chapter in itself. Publishers want primarily original works, because securing the necessary rights to publish derivative works is often difficult or impossible. Chris has even resisted attempts to educate him in this regard.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-38\"><a href=\"#cite_note-38\">[38]</a></sup>\n</p><p>On 14 August, 2017, Chris uploaded a <a href=\"/cwcki/CLog_08142017_-_More_Positive_Content\" title=\"CLog 08142017 - More Positive Content\">video</a> where he updated the True and Loyal Fanbase on his progress on <i>Sonichu</i> #13, which he has re-numbered as <i>Sonichu</i> #12-9. He states that he decided to change the focus of the comic. Instead of being a crossover between the Sonichu gang and the <a href=\"/cwcki/Planet_Dolan\" title=\"Planet Dolan\">Planet Dolan</a> crew, it would instead be a fanfiction devoted to his pony avatar, <a href=\"/cwcki/Night_Star\" title=\"Night Star\">Night Star</a>. Throughout the video, he mentions how he not only wants the comic to be a piece of fanfiction, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">but how he also wants it to be canon to <i>My Little Pony</i>, where he himself would voice Night Star</a>. Of course, Chris doesn't seem to realize that the creators of the show can't just simply pick up his idea because, as stated earlier, it may lead to an accusation of idea theft.\n</p><p>Yet another reason why the publishing industry wouldn't accept Sonichu in its current state is because of how <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_writing\" title=\"Chris and writing\">sloppily written</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">egocentric it is in tone</a>. If a publisher somehow <i>did</i> agree to make Sonichu comics, they would more likely task other writers (not to mention artists) with actual talents to shape up the premise into something at least passable. Predictably enough, Chris would balk at lacking control over his life's work (and of course, anyone doing better than him).\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Games_and_merchandise\">Games and merchandise</span></h3>\n<p>Chris could approach <a href=\"/cwcki/Sega\" title=\"Sega\">Sega</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Nintendo\" title=\"Nintendo\">Nintendo</a> and ask them to make <i>Sonichu</i> games, comics and merchandise. This plan would also be doomed to failure, because no media companies want unsolicited ideas from the public. There are several reasons for this.\n</p><p>First, it takes effort to sift through idea piles and they can't give an equal amount of thought on the countless ideas fans send them. While game companies may listen to their fans, they usually just want to know if the time is ripe for something they've been planning to do. (For example, no doubt a big part of the reason why the newer <i><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Emblem\" title=\"wikipedia:Fire Emblem\">Fire Emblem</a></i> games got worldwide release was that the fans of <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marth_(Fire_Emblem)\" title=\"wikipedia:Marth (Fire Emblem)\">Marth</a> and <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Fire_Emblem:_F%C5%ABin_no_Tsurugi_characters#Roy\" title=\"wikipedia:List of Fire Emblem: Fūin no Tsurugi characters\">Roy</a> from <i><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._Melee\" title=\"wikipedia:Super Smash Bros. Melee\">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a></i> were wondering aloud \"why the hell isn't <a href=\"/cwcki/Nintendo\" title=\"Nintendo\">Nintendo</a> releasing these games outside of Japan?\") They most certainly don't have the capability of starting a whole new game project just because someone asks. If the game companies respond by saying Chris had, as he himself so <a href=\"/cwcki/Homemade_Nintendo_Power_magazine\" title=\"Homemade Nintendo Power magazine\">eloquently put</a>, \"rocks in his head\", then you probably don't get a slice of their precious time for making a second impression. Simply put, Chris thinks that even when the companies aren't busy with other projects, they still have time to think of <i>his</i> grandiose ideas <i>and those things only</i>.\n</p><p>Second, there is an age-old problem in a litigious society: A fan writes to the company and says \"I have this cool idea\", the company says \"thanks, but no thanks\", one of the in-house writers comes up with exactly the same idea by accident, and boom, you have a fan who's suing you for idea theft, and even if that lawsuit will usually go nowhere, it wastes perfectly usable time, energy and most of all <i>money</i> that could be used for more fruitful ventures. A famous example is British novelist <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett\" title=\"wikipedia:Terry Pratchett\">Terry Pratchett</a>, who used to post in his Usenet fan group until one of the fans was convinced Terry had stolen his ideas.\n</p><p>Therefore, most media houses will just say they will not take any ideas from the public. The game industry is not an exception. This fact has been pointed out to Chris numerous times (and at least twice by real Nintendo representatives, as evidenced by the letters he has read in the Captain's Logs<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-39\"><a href=\"#cite_note-39\">[39]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-40\"><a href=\"#cite_note-40\">[40]</a></sup>). Unfortunately, Chris misinterpreted all this.\n</p><p>Another thing that Chris disregards is the fact that writing games take a lot of effort. In <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison\" title=\"wikipedia:Thomas Edison\">Thomas Edison</a>'s words, getting things done is \"1% inspiration and 99% perspiration.\" Many good ideas don't get implemented. No one is going to invest energy in developing an idea alone if they don't know if the idea can be implemented. Game companies may be willing to negotiate a deal to use their properties (such as characters) in games developed by third parties, but those proposals are usually backed up by real companies, actual creative teams of developers, and serious, complete plans for games, if not outright working prototypes already. Even in the case the properties are tacked on the prototype later on, the prototypes are usually fully developed so that they can be used <i>without</i> those properties if the plans fall through. (Example: <i><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Fox_Adventures\" title=\"wikipedia:Star Fox Adventures\">Star Fox Adventures</a></i> began as a game that was completely unrelated to Star Fox universe, but Nintendo felt the game was better with SF characters.)\n</p><p>Surprisingly, in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Homemade_Nintendo_Power_magazine\" title=\"Homemade Nintendo Power magazine\">Homemade Nintendo Power magazine</a>, then high schooler-aged Chris offered a (slightly) better description of how the three fictional Sonic game releases he hoped for would play out than his proposals for Sonichu games later on and even then, they're highly basic and unoriginal ideas (e.g. <i>Super Mario 64</i> with Sonic the Hedgehog as its playable character and <i>Super Mario All-Stars</i> with the four classic <i>Sonic</i> games originally for Sega Genesis).\n</p><p>Theoretically, it would be possible, though extraordinarily unlikely, for Sega and Nintendo to cooperate enough to make a game featuring a Sonic/Pikachu hybrid named Sonichu. They would not, however, need any input from Chris, or even his permission, to combine characters that <i>they</i> own. Think about it. Of course, the idea of releasing it cross-platform for <i>Sony consoles</i> remains yet another absurd and fevered dream on the part of Chris.\n</p><p>In the Sonichu Chronicles he gives <a href=\"/cwcki/Shigeru_Miyamoto\" title=\"Shigeru Miyamoto\">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> \"permission\" to use the cover to his <a href=\"/cwcki/Homemade_Nintendo_Power_magazine\" title=\"Homemade Nintendo Power magazine\">hand-drawn <i>Nintendo Power</i> magazine</a> as the inevitable cover for when his game is created, even though it's several years old (and, in fact, even <i>worse</i> than Chris's current skill at art).\n</p><p>To the surprise of no one, Chris has held onto dreams of Sonichu getting turned into a video game character well into <a href=\"/cwcki/November_2023\" title=\"November 2023\">November 2023</a>, when he posted a request to \"personally\" work with <a href=\"/cwcki/Nintendo\" title=\"Nintendo\">Nintendo</a>, offering them his OCs to be integrated into Pokémon canon<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-41\"><a href=\"#cite_note-41\">[41]</a></sup>. Equally unsurprising is that Chris seems to be unaware (willfully or otherwise) that Nintendo has nothing to gain by granting fans' (ludicrous) desires for all the reasons mentioned here, <i>especially not</i> to someone who has just been released from jail (where he had been kept for a felony that shook the Internet to its core).\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"In_general\">In general</span></h3>\n<p>An issue Chris would face in the industries he aspired to contribute towards is that mainstream publishers will not allow <i>any</i> pornographic material (<a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_8\" title=\"Sonichu 8\">which Chris had nonchalantly drawn into his supposedly kid-friendly comic</a>), thus Chris would be forced to comply with a set of rules to make his magnum opus acceptable for the masses, and we all know how <i>that</i> would turn out.\n</p><p>By a similar token, both Nintendo and Sega would probably not allow <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_10\" title=\"Sonichu 10\">the extreme violent</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_8\" title=\"Sonichu 8\">and sexual imagery</a> the comic didn't shy away from, especially since he considers Sonichu appropriate for kids (although he did imagine his <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler%27s_Adult_Chronicles\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler's Adult Chronicles\"> Adult Chronicles</a> to be rated M for <a href=\"/cwcki/Honest_Content\" title=\"Honest Content\">Honest Content</a>). And that's if they didn't reject it outright <i>because of</i> said imagery, <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_and_Rosechu%27s_Luv_Shack\" title=\"Sonichu and Rosechu's Luv Shack\">not to mention Chris had drawn smut of his magnum opus himself in the past</a> which could make a bad first impression on any reputable company approached to work with him.\n</p><p>Not to mention that Chris, being the egotist we know and love, would have to essentially hand over the rights for Sonichu to whichever company agrees to own his IP, meaning he would have no little to no say in how it plays out according to his whims.\n</p><p>If Chris actually <i>were</i> in a position of creative control, consider this; during the majority of time the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia\" title=\"CWCipedia\">CWCipedia</a> was online, Chris acted as if he had free reign to dictate a site <i>others made and hosted for him</i>, so letting him be head honcho of a comic or game production would be a colossal mistake. Needless to say, the <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_stress\" title=\"Chris and stress\">stress</a> of working under him would lead some unfortunate writers/developers to quit and/or the higher-ups to <a href=\"/cwcki/Wendy%27s\" title=\"Wendy's\">eventually fire him</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_future_of_Chris_and_his_business_attempts\">The future of Chris and his business
