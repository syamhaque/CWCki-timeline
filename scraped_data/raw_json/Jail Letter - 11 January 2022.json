Kenneth uploaded a portion of the letter to Onion Farms on 25 January, claiming that Chris would not allow him to share the rest.\n</p><p>On 13 <a href=\"/cwcki/February_2022\" title=\"February 2022\">February 2022</a> Kenneth changed his mind and uploaded the full letter without explanation. He had previously stated that he would upload this letter along with the <a href=\"/cwcki/Jail_Letter_-_27_November_2021\" title=\"Jail Letter - 27 November 2021\">car crash letter from November</a> if Chris was convicted and sentenced at his hearing on 3 February.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup> Given that Chris's case was continued, it is unclear why Kenneth changed his mind. From his comments on the thread, it seems he thought Chris would be convicted and placed in a mental facility where he would have no contact with the outside world, giving Kenneth a chance to break off his correspondence with Chris. When this did not happen (<a href=\"/cwcki/Jail_Saga#Transfer\" title=\"Jail Saga\">Although it may have now</a>), Kenneth apparently decided to end his correspondence anyway.\n</p><p>The letter shows that months of solitude in jail seem to have put Chris into a far more delusional state than most assumed had been possible, even for him. Some highlights of this letter include:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Chris had written a specific part of the letter in blue ink, which Kenneth interpreted to mean that he was allowed to share that portion of the letter alone (the paragraph beginning \"To make clear with Everyone...\").\n<ul><li>Kenneth originally attempted to white out the empty space between the blue writing on the page that is shared to prevent anyone from reading what was on the back of the page through image manipulation. This failed as most of the writing on the back could be made out anyway.</li></ul></li>\n<li>Chris clarifies that he never referred to Barb as an avatar of Emanuelle. Rather, she is a reincarnation of <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin\" title=\"wikipedia:Merlin\">Merlin the Magician</a>.</li>\n<li>Chris provides lore on both himself as Jesus and on Emanuelle.\n<ul><li>Emanuelle changed genders when Chris was born as Jesus.</li>\n<li>Emanuelle planted an ovum from her ovary into Barb long ago in order for Chris to be birthed later in 1982.</li>\n<li>Emanuelle can change shape into any physical creature, even into a Sonichu.</li></ul></li>\n<li>Barbara recently \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_death#Barbara_Chandler_.281941.E2.80.93202.3F.29\" title=\"Chris and death\">fell lethargic</a>\", and Chris is concerned.
