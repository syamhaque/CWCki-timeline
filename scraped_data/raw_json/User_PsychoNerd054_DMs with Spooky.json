<b>Spooky</b>, <b>Regina</b> and <b>MakeFetchHappen</b>, was the owner of the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Burn_Book\" title=\"Burn Book\">Burn Book</a> Discord server, leader of the Mean Girls, and the leading figure in the investigation of <a href=\"/cwcki/Isabella_Loretta_Janke\" title=\"Isabella Loretta Janke\">Isabella Loretta Janke</a> and her associates.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[note 1]</a></sup> Spooky also created the OP of Bella's original megathread on Kiwi Farms on 1 August 2021,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[1]</a></sup> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Null\" title=\"Null\">Null</a> later made them a moderator of the newly established subforum on Bella.\n</p><p>Though initially held in high regard on several Chris-related circles due to their findings surrounding Bella, Spooky is now infamous for being largely responsible for the spreading of many scandalous rumors and gossip about people in the CWCSphere on a large scale. Most infamously, this included their conflicts with several CWCki staff members, including <a href=\"/cwcki/User:Canine\" title=\"User:Canine\">Marvin</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/User:Anaxis\" title=\"User:Anaxis\">Anaxis</a>, accussing them of conspiring with people from the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Template:EverfreeSaga\" title=\"Template:EverfreeSaga\">Everfree</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Template:IncestSaga\" title=\"Template:IncestSaga\">Incest</a> sagas like <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bella\" title=\"Bella\">Bella</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/The_WCT\" title=\"The WCT\">The WCT</a>. However, she had most of their attention on the jerkop and bureaucrat <a href=\"/cwcki/User:Hurtful_Truth_Level\" title=\"User:Hurtful Truth Level\">Hurtful Truth Level</a>, perpetuating a narrative to many people that Hurtful covered for the <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys</a>, and was now doing the same thing with <a href=\"/cwcki/The_WCT\" title=\"The WCT\">The WCT</a>, who was perceived to be doing far worse things to Chris.\n</p><p>Spooky and her group then started to investigate the CWCki's Discord server on 3 September 2021 due to one of its previous owners, Anaxis, being tied to The WCT, and rumors that Bella and Fiona had first met there. She came to conclude the latter due to a ban being placed on the server, discouraging people from discussing her due to the server being marked as a harassment server. I, being the only person (let alone jerkop) on the CWCki to regularly post on the subforum, expressed how strange and seemingly counterintuitive the Bella rule was, something which I think caught the attention of Spooky.\n</p><p>On 7 September 2021, one of Spooky's associates invited me onto their Burn Book Discord Server, as the members there seemed to take special interest in me propogating much of what was being said in the ILJ subforum on the CWCki, and talking with the other regulars of the subforum in DMs. Many other people who frequented Bella's subforum were also invited into the server as \"guests\". While I was on the server, I asked for feedback from Spooky and those on the server for my edits, believing that Null, the one who promoted Spooky, and CWCki staff like Marvin and Hurtful were aware that this server existed.\n</p><p>Those present were later suspicous about Hurtful Truth Level's \"CarbonCoffee99\" account supposedly covering for The WCT and Anaxis. I and other members on there also came to the conclusion that they could be \"coffee\", a name that was mentioned in chats involving Bella. At one point, we came to believe that The WCT was the one behind the account, hence the ban reason I gave to the account on the 8th. Later, we came to conclude it possibly wasn't Sean, hence why I later changed it on the 11th.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[2]</a></sup>\n</p><p>When Hurtful told me that they were CarbonCoffee on 13 September 2021, I intended to tell the people at Burn Book this in the hopes of easing tensions, letting them know that CarbonCoffee might not have been doing anything malicious. This seemed to have the opposite effect, however, as I can vaguely remember the people in the server seeing this as a big deal. I also vaguely remember this was what led to some of the DMs that occured after Hurtful admitted to being CarbonCoffee (I think it was after the post where I told them it'd probably be better for people to know about the sock, I don't know to be perfectly honest), as I think I was told by the people there to question him about the \"coffee\" person we were investigating. After interviewing me about the incident, Spooky later created a thread on Kiwi Farms about Hurtful's supposed involvement with bad actors on 18 September 2021, hours after he made his statement on the CWCki.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[3]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Following this, and several other incidents of infighting in the ILJ subforum, Spooky was demoted by Null on 2 October,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[4]</a></sup> Null made a thread regarding the shitshow two days later,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[5]</a></sup> and Null finally closed it on 4 November 2021.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-7\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">[6]</a></sup> Despite this, Spooky continued to go after the CWCki staff she'd accussed of being involved in conspiracies, to the point she eventually began targeting me when I didn't fit their vague ideals. Spooky was eventually banned from the Kiwi Farms entirely on 14 November 2021, but their actions have still left a massive impact. Many of the rumors that Spooky and their group perpetuated, such as Bella's supposed suicide plot, lingered for a long time amongst the CWCsphere, for them to then be brought to Chris while he was in jail, and would later wind up being parroted by Chris in jail letters and videos. The rumors that she spread about the CWCki staff had also gotten so bad that Anaxis had to write a comprehensive essay with the intent of debunking pretty much all of Spooky's claims.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-8\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">[7]</a></sup> Despite this, several people have or otherwise still continue to perpetuate much of the claims Spooky had propogated, or otherwise put their own twist on them for their own gain.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-9\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">[8]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Considering how much of a negative impact much of Spooky's actions have left on the discourse surrounding Chris, I only feel it's necessary to share my personal experiences with them so that similarly curious people don't wind up in the same situation I got myself in.\n</p>\n<h1><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Chats\">The Chats</span></h1>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Allegations_against_HTL\">Allegations against HTL</span></h2>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">I am trying to manage the politics of this safely\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:11px; padding:0 0 0 16px; vertical-align:bottom; width:20px\">”\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\" style=\"font-size:smaller; padding:8px 36px; text-align:right;\"><cite>One of the first things Spooky tells me in DMs</cite>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>13 September 2021\n</p><p>This is where the Discord DM I had with Spooky begins, 6 days since I've joined the Burn Book server.\n</p><p>After implementing the Suitress Policy on the CWCki, and having used Fiona's name on this website multiple times prior to that, I've wanted the ability to delete edits in the same way that staff on the site did with the Wallflower. I initially thought that Jerkops had the ability, but was mistaken entirely, so I tried to reach out to Hurtful to make sure I can obtain the ability, but to no avail as he disallowed other people from starting DMs with him. I don't remember exactly what happend down the line, but judging by the <a href=\"/cwcki/User:PsychoNerd054/DMs_with_HTL#Leaked_Kiwi_Farms_DMs\" title=\"User:PsychoNerd054/DMs with HTL\">DMs I've had with Hurtful on Kiwi Farms</a>, I at some point reached out to Spooky, who by that time was a mod on the ILJ subforum, so that she could assist me in reaching out to Hurtful. Hurtful then reached out to me on 6 September 2021. In the conversation I've had with Hurtful, he informs me that he's unable to grant me the ability, and instead to reach out to Marvin, so I talk to him, and he grants me the ability. The stuff in between that and when Hurtful reveals they were CarbonCoffee on the 13th are mostly unrelated but, as stated earlier, I inform the people on Burn Book about the reveal, and they were utterly shocked at this revelation. The stuff that came after Hurtful's reveal, as I stated, I believe was a result of the people at Burn Book telling me to question Hurtful about the \"coffee\" person from the Bella logs. \n</p><p>Spooky then starts their Discord DM with me clarifying this by telling me about allegations against Hurtful that she'd heard, claiming that he (and by extension <a href=\"/cwcki/Marvin\" title=\"Marvin\">Marvin</a>) were covering up for <a href=\"/cwcki/The_WCT\" title=\"The WCT\">The WCT</a>, which in utter shock I accepted without giving that acussation a second thought. Spooky also tells me that Hurtful had tried to cover for the Idea Guys as well. She seemingly got this idea from a thread from the CWCki Club, where there was discussion about drama on Kiwi Farms surrounding both Hurtful and Marvin supposedly knowing about what the Idea Guys were doing with Chris, but saying nothing about it, something which got Hurtful demoted from the CWCki club.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-10\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">[9]</a></sup> This was a clear attempt to reopen any old wounds that Hurtful's supposed inactivity might have caused within the community. Despite my shock, I also clarify in this DM in particular and again <a href=\"/cwcki/User:PsychoNerd054/DMs_with_Spooky#Extended_Privledges\" title=\"User:PsychoNerd054/DMs with Spooky\">in a later DM</a> my intentions, letting Spooky know my intent wasn't to betray Hurtful, but to be transparent about what was going on on the CWCki.\n</p><p>After Spooky told me more incriminating information, I then mention the fact that I told Hurtful that nobody was mad at him for socking, and was still hesitant on being in the Burn Book server, something which made me suspcious of him.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-11\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">[note 2]</a></sup> Spooky then brings up the fact that she hasn't told a majority of people in the Burn Book server about what she have claimed to have found. When I bring up the possibility that Hurtful might have been messing with Fiona, Spooky then replies by stating that Hurtful supposedly did nothing to intervene with Bella's attempts at framing her. She and I used that as a reason to believe that Hurtful was supposedly involved with Bella to some degree.\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #ffe8fc; border:1px dotted #BFB1A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">Spooky/Regina</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>so, maybe I should just let you in on some stuff at this point\n<p>since we've reached that part of it\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">Psycho</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>What is it?\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #ffe8fc; border:1px dotted #BFB1A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">Spooky/Regina</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Basically, TAH and by extension probably Marvin have been doing damage control for Sean for a while behind the scenes.\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">Psycho</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Hmmm\n<p>To think you know a guy\n</p><p>To be frank, I really wasn't trying to throw him under the bus.\n</p><p>I just felt it had to be said, because he admitted involvement to this.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #ffe8fc; border:1px dotted #BFB1A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">Spooky/Regina</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>They are also in logs mixed up with these people, and at a minimum were aware of the \"girlfriend\" before the public was and knew quite a bit more about the incest leaks and Bella herself before the public did either\n<p>They saw these things being discussed in the thread and did nothing.

Spooky attributes this to cowardice, but I come to think that this might be a sign of Hurtful hiding something in consideration of the fact that he only now tells me about the sockpuppet after I told him about The WCT. I interpretted this as meaning that Hurtful thought that I was the only person on the CWCki that didn't suspect he was doing anything shady and that he wanted me to cover up for Bella and Sean, who at the time I and many others thought were trying to do illegal things with Chris.\n</p><p>We also once again talk about Hurtful supposedly covering up for the Idea Guys. While I do recall an instance where Hurtful liked a post stating that doxing the Idea Guys went too far, Spooky spun this as him being \"sympathetic\" towards them to me, which again I bought into. From this, I also state a belief that doxing WCT was necessary because of him supposedly doing illegal things in the same vein that the Idea Guys did, but on a larger scale.\n</p><p>At the end of this conversation, I also inform Spooky that I have never heard of the Knights of CWC server, where much of WCT's activity took place.\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF;

She tells me not to post their dox there due to them being a minor. This conversation also leads to a conversation about Fiona, one that I think is very telling of the general attitudes that people, including myself, have had towards her during that time. \n</p><p>This conversations starts when I tell Spooky not to use Fiona's identity when writing about her in accordance to the Suitress policy. Though Spooky acknowledges that she disagrees with the policy, she was willing to abide by it. I myself acknowledge that I figured that not everyone was going to agree with the policy, and that I can see why people would say that she doesn't need protection. I however came to believe that Fiona needed protection due to the Reddit AMA and her interactions with Chris showing that she'll continue doing similar things in such a hectic time, and because of how her parents were likely dealing with her issues.\n</p><p>I mention to Spooky I had fairly nuanced views of Fiona, stating that I thought what she did was dumb and dangerous, but also was somewhat sympathetic towards her scenario, being blamed for the heinous crimes that people were now accussing Bella of. Spooky appears to agree to this sentiment, though she also uses this as a reason to be mad at Hurtful and Marvin for supposedly being unwilling to stop this when it happened. Spooky also states that she views Fiona a minor \"in some ways\", citing the fact that she was transitioning into adulthood while being autistic. I then tell Spooky what Klop told me, condensing it to my \"reverse Sean\" analogy. Spooky seems to agree with this, calling Fiona a \"vulnerable adult\", likely more so than Chris.\n</p><p>Spooky also mentions wanting to use the CWCki as a platform for creating a timeline for all of the events that surrounded Bella and her associates, and asks me if I can help create accounts for their friends. I tell them that I will consider this.\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">Psycho</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>I'm going to as for a suggestion about Lavender?\n<p>How should I document her.

Spooky tells me that what Hurtful had said in his statement \"sort of\" resembles what he said to her in DMs. However, because Hurtful stopped replying to Spooky, she felt now was necessary to create a Kiwi Farms thread about what Burn Book has supposedly uncovered about Hurtful up to this point. That thread being <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://kiwifarms.st/threads/the-american-hedgehog-socked-on-cwcki-involved-with-watchmen-knights-of-cwc-and-others.100474/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this one</a>.\n</p><p>I approve of Spooky's decision to do this in the hopes of revealing what I thought Hurtful was <i>actually</i> doing behind the scenes, as I felt doing otherwise would hurt the credibility of the CWCki. I once again tell Spooky that I'm a little convinced that Hurtful might not be \"coffee\" from the Bella chats, though also state it's still possible, to which Spooky replies that others should decide that for themselves. \n</p><p>After this, I tell Spooky that 4CentUser had removed the section on CarbonCoffee99 directly after Hurtful made his announcement, which Spooky said she'd revert. I then suggest to Spooky that all of the stuff surrounding \"Coffee\" should strictly be just the messages with Bella and be in the Watchmen section. \n</p><p>As Spooky and the rest of Burn Book gets to working on the thread, Spooky asks me if I want to be mentioned on the thread (this includes mentioning that I was the one that was talking to Spooky and that Hurtful had reached out to me). I reply to this by stating that Hurtful was likely going to tell people he reached out to me regardless, but Spooky tells me that he has control over the narrative on the CWCki. I reply to this by stating that Hurtful should be mentioned for the integrity of the wiki, and tell them that we (both Burn Book and the CWCki crew) must make a collective effort to \"unshit\" what I believed Hurtful was doing. I therefore also agreed to be mentioned in the thread for transparency. \n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">Psycho</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><a class=\"external free\" href=\"https://sonichu.com/cwcki/User:Hurtful_Truth_Level/Statement\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://sonichu.com/cwcki/User:Hurtful_Truth_Level/Statement</a>\n<p>I feel that this should be looked into\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #ffe8fc; border:1px dotted #BFB1A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">Spooky/Regina</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>well\n<p>that sort of resembles what he sent me\n</p><p>however, he stopped replying to my PMs when I confronted him\n</p><p>so I think it's all fair game now\n</p><p>may as well drop a thread in response 🔪\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">Psycho</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Please do.\n<p>I just find it a little less likely that he was actually Coffee from the Bella chats.

Some of these people included former editors <a href=\"/cwcki/User:Abaddon\" title=\"User:Abaddon\">Abaddon</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/User:4CentUser\" title=\"User:4CentUser\">4CentUser</a>. After Spooky finished the thread, she sent a link to it to these people in the hopes of having the rumor spread around more effectively.\n</p><p>Spooky informs me that she had gathered up these people, and was later talking to them about the supposed conspiracy that was going on on the CWCki. Abaddon then asked if these \"trusted members\" could gather in a group chat, which Spooky agrees on. I decline, stating that I was more a witness to the events that transpired. I then ask Spooky what she thinks of Marvin. I tell them that I don't think that Marvin was involved in the same way I thought Hurtful was, and Spooky seemingly agrees to this. \n</p><p>Afterwards, I elaborate that I only believed Hurtful to be doing shady things due to how I perceived him using the CarbonCoffee account as him trying to cover for bad actors, but otherwise didn't have any reason to believe Marvin or anyone else on the CWCki was conspiring with bad actors at this point. I also tell them that I hope that this doesn't become an \"autistic witch hunt\".

But more interesting stuff than that happened and we spent a month or more looking into the remainder of the Bellagate saga and in so doing came out with a lot of cool shit including the vast majority of the information we now have about Sean, GiBi, and a wide cast of peripheral characters.\n</p><p>Unfortunately, and I was told this about Discord well before I logged into one for the first time (to help with the Bella dox as it began to become more and more complex), the usefulness of the server waned as time went on and it became more and more of a liability. Accordingly, I am closing the server, effective immediately. This should not come as a significant surprise if you have been paying close attention. We've been planning on winding it down for some time.\n</p><p>My goal is to move things over to the BurnBook.CLUB forum. A word on this briefly, it very much isn't intended as a Kiwi splinter forum, the structure and goals are different. First and foremost, .club is meant to be for a smallish group of people who are friendly with one another and have similar interests to investigate targets or investigate with tactics that don't mesh with the forum we all met on. More on that later.\n</p><p>In any event, if you have not already, please register an account there.\n</p><p>Is a stopgap temporary Discord or, perhaps, eventually a Discord to act as a companion to the forum.\n</p><p>I've enjoyed working but more importantly getting to know and spending time with each of you and I hope we can continue to do both in a new context.\n</p><p>Love,\nR.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Doxes_on_the_CWCki\">Doxes on the CWCki</span></h2>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">They are in no way in the same category as Fiona and I'm not sure why you'd say that\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:11px; padding:0 0 0 16px; vertical-align:bottom; width:20px\">”\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\" style=\"font-size:smaller; padding:8px 36px; text-align:right;\"><cite>Spooky saying that GiBi, Winfield Winfield, e1ectricthunder, and Airsoft Al are not in the same \"category\" as Fiona</cite>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>23 October 2021\n</p><p>This was the point where my trust in Spooky was beginning to wane, and her facade began to slip.\n</p><p>On 22 October 2021, Spooky managed to dox GiBi, and posted the dox on Kiwi Farms.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-gibidox_19-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-gibidox-19\">[10]</a></sup> As you will see in later chats, this \"achievement\" seemed to have gotten to Spooky's head, and made them much more trigger happy and relentless, giving them more drive to go after the CWCki staff. Before getting banned from Kiwi Farms, Spooky would even go out of their way to dox GiBi's entire family,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-gibidox_19-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-gibidox-19\">[10]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-20\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">[11]</a></sup> including his fucking grandfather.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-21\"><a href=\"#cite_note-21\">[12]</a></sup> These family members that Spooky proceeded to dox aren't even remotely related to the drama that GiBi got himself in, but Spooky justified the doxes in the post through a swatting attempt from one of GiBi's fans on Christuber DawnDusk.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-22\"><a href=\"#cite_note-22\">[13]</a></sup>\n</p><p>I'm not exactly sure what flipped in me to go from being as dox-happy as the rest of the ILJ cult to seeing this happening to GiBi as a bad thing, but I would personally attribute this to the fact that Spooky lost her modding rights after being involved in infighting about Gutsy Sonichu, an associate of Jacob Sockness, posing as Bella.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-23\"><a href=\"#cite_note-23\">[14]</a></sup> She took Gutsy's ploy to be the true and honest Bella, again relying on her tactics of hindsight bias. I think this made me begin to be somewhat skeptical of Spooky's expertise given how she fell for an obvious troll akin to Chris doing the same shit. She was also completely insistent that she knew for a <i>fact</i> she was talking to the actual Bella,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-24\"><a href=\"#cite_note-24\">[15]</a></sup> making Spooky's arrogance more abundantly clear.\n</p><p>Around this time, I've also become an active member of the CWCki Discord server by then, coupled with the fact I was also starting to DM Hurtful again through Kiwi Farms DMs. As you may guess, my official debut on the server wasn't exactly the smoothest. Several of the modstaff were willing to excuse my actions, but others from the team were rightfully pissed at me, calling out my bullshit and poking holes in what I thought I knew. We did eventually find solid ground, but I'd still say it took a quite a while for everyone on the team to fully trust that I would't continue to fuck shit up or befriend shady people like Spooky. Of all people, I think I have them, and frankly the rest of the Discord community, to thank for me being able to evade Spooky's grasp. The thing about cults is that they tend to isolate people from outside that could provide information contrary to their beliefs. Having another group with a completely different perspective from what Spooky claimed to be the truth seemed to have made it easier for me to call Spooky's beliefs into question.\n</p><p>By this point, I think this was where I was starting to sense that maybe Spooky might have been going a little too far when it came to the people she targeted. This is seeing how there was a discussion about how the Suitress policy was raising questions regarding how other people on the site were being covered,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-25\"><a href=\"#cite_note-25\">[16]</a></sup> and how people like Spooky previously went after GiBi for \"purposefully\" doxing Fiona after he carelessly shared her phone number twice, something which supposedly put her in a \"mental hospital\", now turning around and doing that exact same thing to GiBi but ten-fold.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-26\"><a href=\"#cite_note-26\">[note 10]</a></sup> Even so, Spooky continued to use the supposed persecution of Fiona as justification for how horrible a person GiBi was, and therefore justification for the doxing towards him.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-27\"><a href=\"#cite_note-27\">[17]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-28\"><a href=\"#cite_note-28\">[18]</a></sup> And even after she got banned from the Kiwi Farms, she wouldn't stop there. She continued her crusade against GiBi on multiple sockpuppets.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-29\"><a href=\"#cite_note-29\">[19]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-30\"><a href=\"#cite_note-30\">[20]</a></sup>\n</p><p>A day after Spooky had doxed GiBi, she decided to put his full name on the now deleted \"Post-Merge Saga\" page. After I removed GiBi's middle and last name from that page (as far as I can remember), Spooky confronts me about my choice in a DM. After she question why I would \"defend\" GiBi, I tell them that I was doing this same practice with other minor Chris orbiters. I also explain that I feel that these people were getting too close to Chris during hectic times in the same way Fiona did with her AMA, and that I intended to make sure I didn't reveal too much sensitive information about the minor orbiters where it isn't needed. \n</p><p>Rather tellingly, Spooky asserts to me that Fiona isn't in the same \"category\" as people like Winfield Winfield or Airsoft Al, instead comparing the latter two to people like <a href=\"/cwcki/Owls\" title=\"Owls\">Owls</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/MKRNightVee\" title=\"MKRNightVee\">MKRNightVee</a>. She also put Fiona in the same category as The Wallflower, as other people have, claiming that Fiona didn't \"sign up\" for being doxed. However, she also expressed ambivalence for the existence of the Suitress policy, beliving Fiona to be sympathetic, but also being against the practice of wallflowering as well.\n</p><p>This, and several other chats that followed this, was actually a huge reason for me upholding the Suitress Policy. It was clear that Spooky and other people were going to call users on the CWCki out for supposedly \"defending\" people that were deemed as less than favorable amongst the CWCsphere at the time over certain other individuals. Considering that Spooky was acussing me of \"protecting\" GiBi, something which I'm pretty sure made her extremely salty given what she'd accuse me of later, and Hurtful of \"protecting\" The WCT, whose respective infamies both grew out of \"doxing\" Fiona to some degree, you can only imagine how shit would have gone if we removed the Suitress Policy entirely by this point.\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #ffe8fc; border:1px dotted #BFB1A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">Spooky/Regina</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Oh come on...just putting Devon's name on the cwcki is hardly doxing.

I also state disagreement with common misconceptions that surrounded her, such as Chris supposedly turning her down for Barb or the belief that Chris wasn't interested in her at all, attributing those to the fact that Chris simply started his affair with Barb before he ever met Fiona. I also expressed doubts at rumors that she was put into a \"mental hospital\", as I've talked to a few of Fiona's friends, who reached out to me about what was going on with her, possibly because I was essentially the one handling most of the coverage of her on this wiki. Said friends told me Fiona was merely put into psychiatric care for a while, but otherwise was doing fine.\n</p><p>Spooky then showcases more of their soft spot towards Fiona, as do I in this conversation. However, she also expresses how if it weren't for her involvement with Bella, or Bella framing her, she'd dox Fiona the same degree as anyone else she targeted. \n</p><p>Spooky also reveals that at one point she actually talked to Fiona, having to \"chew her out\" for her Reddit AMA. I however express that I've mellowed out at her making her AMA, though admittedly not for the right reasons.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-33\"><a href=\"#cite_note-33\">[note 13]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Afterwards, I state my general belief that Fiona wasn't a bad person...just really flawed. From this we talk about how both her and Bella were not that interesting as far as lolcows go, something that has been debated for quite a bit since she hasn't been heard from since her AMA.\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">Psycho</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>He was still kind of lecherous of her, from what I understand.\n<p>He still tried to contact her despite her distancing herself from Chirs.\n</p><p>Which I find fucking creepy.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #ffe8fc; border:1px dotted #BFB1A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">Spooky/Regina</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>wait,who?\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">Psycho</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Chris sent photos to Fiona.\n<p>When he was in the hotel.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #ffe8fc; border:1px dotted #BFB1A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">Spooky/Regina</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>oh yeah\n<p>he did\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">Psycho</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>That's kind of why I don't buy him not being into her.\n<p>He clearly did to some extent.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #ffe8fc; border:1px dotted #BFB1A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">Spooky/Regina</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>i mean, it is a woman, i'm not gonna go in for all that \"Fiona got cucked by Barb bullshit\"\n<p>exactly\n</p><p>the barb stuff, ugh, i hate even talking about, but it was ongoing, fiona was a future goal and there's no reason to think that she wasn't, he said a few things that seemed dismissive of her, but come on, he's autistic as fuck, he's gonna say awkward shit\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">Psycho</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>I just think it was because he met Fiona after he started fucking Barb.\n<p>Him saying it was an \"open relationship\" feels more like an excuse in his part.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #ffe8fc; border:1px dotted #BFB1A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">Spooky/Regina</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>yea he wasn't gonna turn down what was right there\n<p>ugh,talking about this still makes my skin crawl\n</p><p>i had the glorious distraction of bella and then sean and gibi and then random weens and now...what is left but the crying shame of what happened\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">Psycho</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Honestly, I don't care so much if she's retarded or that she talked to Chris.

As you can see here, my views on WCT's role during the Everfree Saga changed drastically from how they were before, going from believing he was some sort of sociopath obsessed with serial killers to now believing he merely had some petty rivalry with Naught and was manipulated by Bella, both of which turned out to be completely true. I also bring up the fact that while my stance on Sean has changed to now thinking he wasn't as malicious as we thought, him enabling Chris was still unacceptable. Spooky, of course, denies that Chris stumbled across Sean's documentary series, saying that he was somehow better at manipulating people than Bella.\n</p><p>Spooky then tells me about how \"useful\" Naught has been, alluding to the fact that she was using him for intel about WCT's role with Chris. When I state uncertaintly for why WCT would be against Naught, Spooky tells me it was due to a \"love triangle\", likely referencing the fact that MKR made up this exact story, which she told to Burn Book member Basalas as he was posting about it on the Farms.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-35\"><a href=\"#cite_note-35\">[21]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">Psycho</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>From what I understand, Sean was an asshole in that scenario\n<p>But it was ultimately to take down Naught.\n</p><p>Bella basically manipulated him too.\n</p><p>He's still an asshole, IMO\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #ffe8fc; border:1px dotted #BFB1A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">Spooky/Regina</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>[<i>replying to \"Bella basically manipulated him too.\"</i>]\n<p>Idk about that he came in with plenty of bad intentions of his own.

When she questioned me about this, I explained that I assumed that the stuff with MKR had been dealt with already. I also express that it's odd that MKR is seemingly getting doxed more than other people involved, expressing that I don't think doxing people should be treated as a first resort. \n</p><p>When Spooky talks about a post she'll make on the Burn Book server about doxing, I bring up the suggestion that we could probably include Chris's family members, since people like <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Barb\" title=\"Barb\">Barb</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bob\" title=\"Bob\">Bob</a> already have the information up. I also tell Spooky I'm considering just calling Sean \"The WCT\", their screen name, citing their galaxy-sized ego, and wanting to be known as \"one of the final protagonists\" as the reason. Spooky disagrees with this, and I state that I can see where she's coming from with their disagreement, given how Bella turned ship after getting doxed. I also bring up Fiona again, stating this is an instance where someone, in this case Bella, was abusing her dox for their ends. \n</p><p>From this, I express the idea of doxing people to \"discourage weenery\" could probably work in practice, though this is a sentiment that I'd abandon later on when Spooky begins abusing the shit out of it. I also talk about how I've kept the doxes of the Idea Guys for this reason due to them doing illegal things to Chris, and Spooky replies to this by reminding me that Hurtful supposedly defeneded them while also wanting to dox MKR, something I agreed was kind of weird. I also express that we shouldn't be doxing people unless there's a good reason for it, and also express agreement to what Spooky was saying in their post on Burn Book.\n</p><p>Eventually, Spooky tells me that every single person that was involved in the \"fuckery\" should get doxed, telling me she'd \"give an ovary\" for Hurtful's dox. She also talks about intending to dox people like Anaxis, Kyle, and Para, but she doesn't put me in the same \"category\" as them as I've never interacted with Chris. I then give my opinions about doxing, saying that it shouldn't be based on whether or not people \"deserve it\", which Spooky seems to agree with. \n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF;

She suggest to me that they should go on the Fan Visits page, but that the Post Merge page should be kept, but with a stub template.\n</p><p>Following this, Spooky decides to show me how she'll \"continue to find all manner of manipulation and fuckery\", showing me one of their <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://sonichu.com/w/index.php?title=The_Journey_to_the_Merge&amp;diff=271732&amp;oldid=267096\" rel=\"nofollow\">edits</a> she's made on Anaxis' \"<i>The Journey to the Merge</i>\". There, she calls the <a href=\"/cwcki/Lainchu\" title=\"Lainchu\">Lainchu</a> persona a \"glorified\" sockpuppet of Anaxis. In addition, she claims that Hurtful reverting their edit is more evidence that he is covering up for Anaxis, being aware that he was \"socking\". While doing this, she call Hurtful a \"faggot\". She also gloats about how she was making these edits just to see how Hurtful would react to it.\n</p><p>Spooky also comments on some of my own edits, such as one where I revert one of Spooky's edits saying that drama from the Kiwi Farms should stay off of the CWCki. Spooky however tries to justify that this is actually CWCki-related drama, possibly because of how I outed the CarbonCoffee account to them previously. I then reply that the edit that she made might not have been related to Chris, and that I'd check to make sure of this.\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">Psycho</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Since the Winfield stuff is now on the Fan Visits page, what do you think should happen to the stuff on the Post-Merge page?\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #ffe8fc; border:1px dotted #BFB1A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">Spooky/Regina</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Good question, there is a lot of overlap between the two\n<p>Maybe he and Ellen's main stuff should go to visits and just a stub in post merge\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">Psycho</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>[<i>replying to \"Maybe he and Ellen's...\"</i>]\n<p>Good idea.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #ffe8fc; border:1px dotted #BFB1A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">Spooky/Regina</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>also i continue to find all manner of manipulation and fuckery\n<p>here's Anaxis basically socking https://sonichu.com/w/index.php?title=The_Journey_to_the_Merge&amp;diff=271732&amp;oldid=267096\n</p><p>htl is in there too, obviously aware of whats going on\n</p><p>you people need to clean house severely\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">Psycho</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Yeah, I always found that kind of odd.\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #ffe8fc; border:1px dotted #BFB1A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">Spooky/Regina</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>and there's a lot of it going around\n<p>reverts of my edits haven't gone unnoticed btw\n</p><p>yours is kinda legit saying kf drama should stay off the cwcki but arguably it's more cwcki drama as it originates on the cwcki; htl's reverting my bit about the anaxis fuckery on the watchmen page is suspect as hell because it just shows him guarding her again\n</p><p>the fucking faggot\n</p><p>i doxed gibi 80 days after the incident lol i have a long memory and this bullshit is not going fucking unnoticed\n</p><p>(and why, yes, I did make those edits at least partially to see what would happen)\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #ffe8fc; border:1px dotted #BFB1A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">Spooky/Regina</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>[<i>replying to \"i doxed gibi 80 days after...\"</i>]\n<p>(I'm not talking about you btw, sorry, that might be able to be misinterpreted.

She also assumes various Deleted accounts from the server in the screenshots she showed me are him. How she came to believe that, I can not answer. I rebute this by saying that sometimes users that got \"Deleted\" are also banned accounts in this server in particular, so we therefore don't have enough evidence to say the posts belonged to Anaxis.\n</p><p>Spooky then brings up a set of messages alledging that the Watchmen had pictures of <a href=\"/cwcki/Cogsdev\" title=\"Cogsdev\">cogsdev</a>. I reply to this by saying that I wouldn't find it surprising if the Watchmen were actually against the CWCki in some capacity (a hypothesis that actually turned out to be entirely correct). When Spooky proposes Anaxis might be a \"sleeper agent\" of theirs', something I tentatively said was possible, Spooky then comes up with this weird theory that Naught, a person she was in direct contact with, was sending Anaxis over to the CWCki to selectively leak things to \"win Hurtful over\".\n</p><p>I elaborate that I meant it more that, because the Watchmen were going after cogsdev, the literal founder of the CWCki, this could explain why Hurtful might have been socking on the CWCki too. I also state that I believed that the Watchmen might have been going after Hurtful for some reason. I was only partially correct when I theorized this, as Hurtful created the account to leak chats from The Place and correct misinformation without getting attacked by the former Watchmen. Spooky however denies this theory entirely, stating that she only gave me the screencap because she found it \"funny\". \n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #ffe8fc; border:1px dotted #BFB1A3;

I also inform Spooky that I was going to warn them of accusing server members, in this case Klop, of working with the Watchmen before Hurtful banned them, as I wanted to give Spooky another chance and was worried that banning them might cause more suspicion and conflicts. Spooky agrees to this, but not for the reasons I had in mind. She misattributed her getting banned, and them trying to \"expose\" Hurtful banning them, to an instance of the Streisand Effect, failing to realize that the \"suppressed\" information is only becoming public knowledge because she wouldn't shut the fuck up about it, and people were already beginning to call Spooky out for her claims.\n</p><p>Right after I told them that, she denied the accusations, and despite everything I told them about Klop, stating that I didn't believe they were involved with Bella or The WCT; which Spooky seemingly agreed with prior; she then suddenly flips to saying that he was \"100% involved\". I then bring up the text that she put on the CWCki, and remind them that Klop told me they were inadvertently involved. Spooky then rejects my statements in their entirety. \n</p><p>That same day, Spooky went onto Hurtful's Kiwi Farms account to mock them about her ban.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-38\"><a href=\"#cite_note-38\">[22]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #ffe8fc;

Basically, it all boils down to this one conversation I had with her, where I think I saw her true colors up close. I was already beginning to see how tense and irritable Spooky could be when she didn't get what she wanted prior to this, but this just solidified it for me. Everything she had accused Hurtful of being was right there in front of me.\n</p><p>The reason I chose not to talk about this until now is that I didn't want to cause more in-fighting than there already was by telling people what Spooky said to me, like what happened with Hurtful Truth Level. I knew that was exactly what this asshole wanted from me, and I just know she'd probably get some sort of sadistic joy out of me trying to clear my name as she did with GiBi, The WCT, Hurtful Truth Level, and others. \n</p><p>Rereading this conversation now, though she didn't explicitly say it, I can sense that she fucking dared me to expose them for saying the things she said to me. I also knew by this point that pissing Spooky off or quote-unquote \"exposing\" them when she still had her thrall on others certainly wouldn't work in my favor, espescially given all the interactions we've had up to this point, all that I've done for them, and how she approached people like GiBi, The WCT and Hurtful Truth Level. That, I think, is what I attribute to me taking the civil approach in the posts I made replying to the message where she calls <i>BOTH</i> me and Hurtful out, and I'm real fucking glad I did. I deprived them of the satisfaction of knowing she was making me, or anyone else on the CWCki, suffer to satisfy their fragile ego.  \n</p><p>This conversation was also what advanced the mending of my friendship with Hurtful, despite any hard feelings I've might have felt towards him or anything nasty I've said about him prior, as I began talking to him regularly again on Discord the following day. I've come to realize that Spooky, despite their insistance; or that of those that looked up to her; that she was totally objective, was never interested in documenting the truth in any capacity. All she cared about was what stories sold well, regardless of how reflective to the truth they were or who gets harmed in the process. A part of that process was for them to get me angry at Hurtful Truth Level, the one who introduced me to the Chris Chan subculture, and to try and get me to destroy the CWCki from the inside to fit their vision of what it should be.\n</p><p>I would become more convinced this was the case the entire time after what Spooky proceeded to do after betraying me the way she did.\n</p><p>30 October 2021\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #ffe8fc;

Right after I confronted Spooky about her demands for the CWCki and its supposed lack of integrity, I then confronted her about her lack of transparency on her thread, as I felt this was the perfect opportunity to point this out.\n</p><p>In the thread, she talked about Skunt_TV being in Michael's Lunar Module Discord server. She painted Skunt as being an active member of the group, despite him only being there to try and ward Michael away from the CWCki server, and warn him about reaching out to Chris. She also left out the fact that Skunt notified her that he'd join the server before doing so. \n</p><p>Right after I told her about this, she lies to me saying that Skunt never talked to her about CWCIslam. I respond to this by bringing up a screenshot of a chat from Skunt, which I asked him to send me in case she pulls this kind of shit. Right after this, my fears were completely justified, and Spooky pretends to have forgotten about the exchange she had with Skunt. Although I tried to stay friendly with Spooky, I also pointed out her blatant hypocrisy, telling her that she herself was obligated to be transparent if she was going to accuse the CWCki of not being so. Spooky tries to excuse this by stating that MKRNightVee told her about this first, because of fucking course she did, and shows no seeming remorse for Skunt being upset about being portrayed the way he was in the thread.\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">Psycho</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>I was told that you talked to Skunt about CWCIslam.\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #ffe8fc; border:1px dotted #BFB1A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">Spooky/Regina</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>by?\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">Psycho</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Skunt.\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #ffe8fc; border:1px dotted #BFB1A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">Spooky/Regina</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>well, that's interesting because I didn't lol\n<p>V\n</p><p><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:SkuntRegina1.png\"><img alt=\"SkuntRegina1.png\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"345\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/3/3a/SkuntRegina1.png/400px-SkuntRegina1.png\" srcset=\"/w/images/3/3a/SkuntRegina1.png 1.5x\" width=\"400\"/></a>\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">Psycho</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>\n<p><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:SkuntRegina2.png\"><img alt=\"SkuntRegina2.png\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"552\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/1/13/SkuntRegina2.png/400px-SkuntRegina2.png\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/1/13/SkuntRegina2.png/600px-SkuntRegina2.png 1.5x, /w/images/1/13/SkuntRegina2.png 2x\" width=\"400\"/></a>\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #ffe8fc; border:1px dotted #BFB1A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">Spooky/Regina</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>that's my discord with skunt, nothing between 9/18 and today\n<p>oh wait\n</p><p>oohhhhhh\n</p><p>way back ok\n</p><p>i don't remember that but ok\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\">Psycho</span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Don't take anything I'm doing the wrong way.

What she did next after our long-winded exchange regarding the handling of the CWCki would be the final nail in the coffin for me.\n</p><p>Spooky, telling literally nobody else on the CWCki team or even Kiwi Farms about this, came up to me to propose a way to make \"everyone happy\". She proposed creating a splinter site of the CWCki whose sole focus is on the Chris orbiters that Burn Book spent a lot of their time and energy observing. The promise from this was that all of the stuff about Chris orbiters that Spooky and their crew wanted to document on the CWCki would go onto this splinter wiki, which she called the \"<b>Julaypedia</b>\", and have me agree to a partnership between both sites. \n</p><p>She asked me if I'd like to contribute, despite literally putting me on the same boat as Hurtful when I didn't give into their demands not too long ago. Despite claiming their goal was to create \"peace and harmony\", I'm far more convinced she created the site out of some sort of spite towards the CWCki judging by some of their posts on Kiwi Farms the days following this conversation, where she says the CWCki was \"rotten to its core\".<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-42\"><a href=\"#cite_note-42\">[24]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-43\"><a href=\"#cite_note-43\">[25]</a></sup> As you will see later, I rejected this proposal, which is precisely why you've never heard of this website until now.\n</p><p>A link to an archive of the site can be found <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://archive.is/ZOSmb\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. \n</p><p><b>Also a bit of trivia</b>: Though I backed away from the Julypedia project, I'd be lying if I said I didn't take inspiration from some of Spooky's ideas. As flawed as their philosophy regarding the documentation of Chris and his orbiters may have been, that of obsessively digging every nook and cranny for their personal information to plaster all over the site and stretching the truth because it's \"funny\", I still think parts of it held water. As you will see in this chat, I also thought the idea of a wiki about Chris orbiters could be useful to some degree, since some people were interested in them as they were in Chris. I also didn't want to reject everything the Julypedia had to offer solely because Spooky, who by this point proved to me she's nothing but a narcissistic, pot-stirring cunt, was running it like how Spooky rejected the CWCki as a corrupt \"institution\" for what she perceived out of Hurtful.\n</p><p>For example, the Julaypedia; when it was still active; had a template which users could put on its pages to mark people as \"unreliable sources\".<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-44\"><a href=\"#cite_note-44\">[26]</a></sup> This was actually where I got the idea for the <a href=\"/cwcki/Template:Unreliable\" title=\"Template:Unreliable\">Unreliable</a> template here, as the CWCki didn't have such a template prior to that, but most certainly should have. It was also partially the inspiration for the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCki:Gossip\" title=\"CWCki:Gossip\">Gossip</a> page and <a href=\"/cwcki/Template:Misinfo\" title=\"Template:Misinfo\">Misinfo</a> template you see here, as both of those built off of the Unreliable template.

This is where things truly became worrisome for me.

As I have demonstrated, when it comes to being in \"good standing\" with Spooky, this more or less means that you suck up to them and never ever deviate too much from their agenda. Even so much as suggesting that A-logging people like GiBi (in Spooky's mind \"protecting them\") isn't ideal is enough to get you in hot water with her. \n</p><p>Seeing how Spooky has already been banned from the CWCki for their relentlessness, questioning the integrity of the CWCki on multiple ocassions, and now going after the \"Trustworthy People\" she gathered less than a month ago, now acussing them of being in on the conspiracy,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-47\"><a href=\"#cite_note-47\">[29]</a></sup> I just knew this \"partnership\" that she was proposing to me was nothing more than a facade for Spooky to get their hands on the CWCki one last time.

This time, Spooky was trying to \"expose\" Hurtful for leaking messages from The Place for clout.

The fact she proceeded to do this even after I showed them mercy in spite off all she'd done, something she (and I for a time) refused to do with Hurtful, also didn't help with this one bit. Here, I cite them giving me the screencaps as them pulling a \"trust me bro\" on me. Spooky tries to defend themselves afterwards, posting another out of context screencap, but I refused to entertain them at this point, and I stopped replying to their messages altogether.
