A day after that, he answered (and deleted) the rest.\n</p><p>This mailbag had the highest deletion rate of any mailbag so far. Out of the 18 letters sent, only eight were answered. In this case, though, the deletions were not Chris's most shocking action. A nurse at a cancer ward asked him for a few autographed copies of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Asperchu\" title=\"Asperchu\">Asperchu</a> comic, apparently under the false impression that he produced both. Instead of correcting her error, or forwarding the letter to Alec Benson Leary, Chris changed the word \"Asperchu\" to \"Sonichu\" in her letter and answered it as though it had always been meant for him, saying he would \"consider a donation of a book or two.\" To summarize, Chris willfully prevented the request of <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_death\" title=\"Chris and death\">CHILDREN DYING OF CANCER</a> from ever being carried out in order to service his own ego.\n</p><p>Other notable letters included Chris <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_money\" title=\"Chris and money\">throwing away a hypothetical billion dollars</a>, not understanding the difference between <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Love\" title=\"Love\">love</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sex\" title=\"Sex\">sex</a>, and the rather terrifying prospect of Chris adding a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Black\" title=\"Black\">black</a> character to compete with Asperchu's Jivin.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\"

Why do you hate me enough to THREATEN my life? I only wanted to become a Great and True Artisan like you yourself are. Are you jealous because I have done so? You know, I spend my time making the ASPERCHU comic and devoting to making myself the BEST artisan I can be. I don't spend my time issuing DEATH THREATS, which as you should know by now is a FELONY and against the LAW.\n</p><p>By your OWN admission, I paid Jack Thaddeus to have the Ad Space. That means I legally have the Right to Advertise my creations there, that is how Advertising works. You care so much for your own legal rights so many occasions, Why do you not care for OTHER peoples' legal rights?\n</p><p>Perhaps in the dictatorship of CWCville you have the godly power to kill people who Only want to Aspire to Greatness in their Careers. But in America, we have something called Freedom of the PRESS, where someone who pays LEGALLY for adspace can advertise their Product without fear of MURDER. So I ask you also, why do you hate not only me, but AMERICA? Because you obviously do NOT approve of any different messages than your OWN.\n</p><p>Your former joy-boy,\n</p><p>Alec Benson Leary\n</p><p>P.S. Simonchu is feeling MUCH better now that he and his Lover <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Wild\" title=\"Wild\">Wild</a> are under the safety of ALBville's laws, which protect SAME-SEX MARRIAGE such as THEIRS; Magi-chan likewise enjoys being able to be the Homogay he truly is under my Wise Rule.

And that Meg turned out to be Silvana so it's okay.\n</p><p>First of all, your character didn't even TRY to resist her. You flirted with her (saying amongst other things that you would \"happily accept\" her performing a sexual favor for you), punched a guy out for her (which you wouldn't do if you weren't trying to impress her), and despite her being all over you, not ONE SINGLE TIME did you say, \"I'm sorry, but I'm already taken, please stop touching me.\" You never mentioned Lovely Weather to her at all. You let her do everything she did to you willingly and flirted right back. So stop lying that you were powerless to do anything.\n</p><p>Secondly, your character still thinks she's Meg. So it doesn't matter at all if she's Meg or Silvana. You still willingly flirted with her. That's a pretty lame excuse that no woman in real life wouldn't accept if you were cheating on her like that. \n</p><p>So stop being dishonest.
