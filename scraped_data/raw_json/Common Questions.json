Obviously, none of these were questions that Chris would be commonly asked by any sane, rational individual. Chris was surprisingly diligent about answering all of these <b>Common Questions</b> (normal people would call them \"Frequently Asked Questions\" - \"FAQ\") with every new Mailbag. The answers, unsurprisingly, were erratic at best. Sometimes Chris provided <a href=\"/cwcki/Honest_Content\" title=\"Honest Content\">far too much information</a>, and other times he would provide a single word in response when a longer answer would have been expected. On occasion, he would change the text in the question itself to suit his needs, a practice of editing he'd been using in the mailbags since day one.\n</p><p>All of his answers have been compiled here, arranged by the date on which he answered them.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#28_December_2009\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">28 December 2009</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#31_December_2009\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">31 December 2009</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#1_January_2010\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">1 January 2010</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#5_January_2010\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">5 January 2010</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#7_January_2010\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">7 January 2010</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#9_January_2010\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">9 January 2010</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#15_January_2010\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">15 January 2010</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#20_January_2010\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">20 January 2010</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#26_January_2010\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">9</span> <span class=\"toctext\">26 January 2010</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#30_January_2010\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">10</span> <span class=\"toctext\">30 January 2010</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#1_February_2010\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">11</span> <span class=\"toctext\">1 February 2010</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#22_February_2010\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">12</span> <span class=\"toctext\">22 February 2010</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-13\"><a href=\"#Unanswered\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">13</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Unanswered</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-14\"><a href=\"#From_Mailbag_58\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">13.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">From Mailbag 58</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-15\"><a href=\"#From_Mailbag_59\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">13.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">From Mailbag 59</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-16\"><a href=\"#See_Also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">14</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See Also</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"28_December_2009\">28 December 2009</span></h2>\n<ul><li><b>Q: Have you ever read any books on how to go about creating <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Art\" title=\"Art\">art</a>? e.g. <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawing_on_the_Right_Side_of_the_Brain\" title=\"wikipedia:Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\">Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain</a>, <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style\" title=\"wikipedia:The Elements of Style\">The Elements of Style</a>, How to Draw Comics the Marvel Way, <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_26#In_which_Chris's_brain_starts_to_work!\" title=\"Mailbag 26\">On Writing</a>, or things like internet tutorials?</b></li></ul>\n<dl><dd><dl><dd>A: <a href=\"/cwcki/My_Half_of_A_Whole_New_World_for_Kacey\" title=\"My Half of A Whole New World for Kacey\">I have read such books</a>, and I have taken many <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Art\" title=\"Art\">arts</a> classes too.</dd></dl></dd></dl>\n<ul><li><b>Q: If you were a director <a href=\"/cwcki/A_CWC_Audition\" title=\"A CWC Audition\">in Hollywood</a>, what kinds of films would you make?</b></li></ul>\n<dl><dd><dl><dd>A: Action/Steamy (<a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_English\" title=\"Chris and English\">Striaght</a>) Romance</dd></dl></dd></dl>\n<ul><li><b>Q: You said you read <a href=\"/cwcki/R.L._Stine\" title=\"R.L.
