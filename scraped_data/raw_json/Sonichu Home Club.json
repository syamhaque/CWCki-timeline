However, since Chris is lazy and got occupied with other ventures (such as his dealings with <a href=\"/cwcki/Shigeru_Miyamoto\" title=\"Shigeru Miyamoto\">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>), he forgot all about this.\n</p><p>It is not known what happened to the club, but due to the shutdown of PlayStation Home in <a href=\"/cwcki/March_2015\" title=\"March 2015\">March 2015</a> and Chris forgetting about it, it can be assumed to be lost.\n</p><p><a href=\"/cwcki/Vivian_Gee\" title=\"Vivian Gee\">Vivian Gee</a> produced two videos in collaboration with Chris. The first video is mainly a slideshow with frames recorded off a CRT (it is unknown if it was meant to be in full motion or not) while the second is audio-only. The first video has Chris presenting parts of <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_8\" title=\"Sonichu 8\"><i>Sonichu</i> 8</a> in a conference hall, while the second is Chris rambling about future plans on the club, Sony products, and video games. <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Julie\" title=\"Julie\">Julie</a> also makes an appearance.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Part_1\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Part 1</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Transcript\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Transcript</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Part_2\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Part 2</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Transcript_2\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Transcript</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Part_1\">Part 1</span></h2>\n<center><div class=\"thumb embedvideo autoResize\" style=\"width: 328px;\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo autoResize\" style=\"\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideowrap youtube\" style=\"width: 320px\"><div class=\"embedvideo-consent\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo-consent__overlay\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo-consent__message\">Click to load content</div><!--\n--></div><!--\n--></div><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" data-src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YLUpXIaX25U\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"180\" loading=\"lazy\" modestbranding=\"1\" width=\"320\"></iframe></div><!--\n--></div><!--\n--></div></center>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">[The SonichuGirls forum] makes me feel omnipotent!\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:11px; padding:0 0 0 16px; vertical-align:bottom; width:20px\">”\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Transcript\">Transcript</span></h3>\n<p>[<i><a href=\"/cwcki/Metal_Gear\" title=\"Metal Gear\">Metal Gear Solid</a>'s VR mission intro theme plays</i>]\n</p><p>[<i>Cut to a shot of what appears to be a <a href=\"/cwcki/LittleBigPlanet\" title=\"LittleBigPlanet\">LittleBigPlanet</a> ragdoll standing under a tagline that reads \"Sony is Hard Qore\".

WE’RE JUST ENJOYING THE FESTIVITIES! OH – THE OTHER DAY – I SAW THIS CAT GAL FLIRTING WITH BIONIC?

Black Sonichu, <a href=\"/cwcki/Blake\" title=\"Blake\">Blake</a>. He’s just walkin’ in front of our-- front of our... girls. And he just kicks sand in their faces, and they’re like:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>[<i>uses a girly voice</i>]<br/>\n<b>“HEY!”</b></p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>[<i>uses his Rosechu voice</i>]<br/>\n“BLACK SONICHU, WHAT’D YOU DO THAT FOR?!”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Rosechu cla-- exclaims.

Anyway, as I was saying, uh...\n</p><p>Anyway, while Blake is-- while Black Sonichu is achin’ in pain... Bubbles just whis-- whispers smoothly... to him. She’s saying:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>“YOU’RE DOING GREAT.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>And while <i>straining</i>, he says:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>[<i>uses a pained version of his Blake voice</i>]<br/>\n[<i>groans</i>] “GOOD!”</p></blockquote>\n<p>And then-- so, the... a-- in a-- in a <i>acting</i> moment of, uh, rage, Bubbles says:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>[<i>uses his Bubbles voice</i>]<br/>\n“ALRIGHT, BIG MAN: I’M GONNA SHOW YA THE POWER OF A WOMAN! IT’S NOT AS GENTLE AS YOU THINK IT IS!”</p></blockquote>\n<p>And they walk off, and, uh, R-Rosechu reali-- and then, Rosechu... kn-<i>knows</i>, so, she, like, she just... gives ’em-- gives ’em, uh, a little <i>glare</i> in their direction. A <i>knowing</i> glare. She says-- she tells ’em-- she's like, uh...\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>[<i>uses his Rosechu voice again</i>]<br/>\n“SHE THINKS SHE CAN FOOL US... BUT IT’S SO <i>OBVIOUS</i> SHE AND BLAKE ARE TRUE LOVERS.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>And Angelica says:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>[<i>uses his Angelica voice, which quickly reverts to his normal voice</i>]<br/>\n“IT’S <i>SO</i> CUTE!”</p></blockquote>\n<p>So, anyway, uh... then, we’ve been [unintelligible for several seconds].\n</p><p>Hmm. Y’know, I wonder... lemme just move away from the table.\n</p><p>Can see all y’all. [<i>chuckles</i>] Maybe my... avatar won’t look so <i>distracted</i> now!\n</p><p>Well, anyway, uh, continuing-- continuing on, though: Jiggli-- just to finish this up, though: Jiggliami... said:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>[<i>uses his Jiggliami voice</i>]<br/>\n</p><p>“THANK YOU, CITIZENS OF CWCVILLE, VIRGINIA!

BUT, UH, CURRENTLY IN A <i>TIME VOID</i>... OR, UH, RATHER, IN MY HEART AND <i>HEAD</i>... A CONSEQUENTIAL, CONFLICTING DECISION <i>HAS</i> BEEN MADE.”<br/>\n[Note: Chris changes a few details even while reading this narrative caption.]</p></blockquote>\n<p>End of meeting for this time?\n</p><p>[<i>total silence</i>]\n</p><p>Mmm. Okay. So, I’m assuming that nobody-- oh! Yes?\n</p><p>[Troll question: “Do you have any more Sonichu-themed levels for <i><a href=\"/cwcki/LittleBigPlanet\" title=\"LittleBigPlanet\">LittleBigPlanet</a></i> planned?]\n</p><p>Oh, yeah! I might-- I’m <i>contemplating</i> about that: the, uh, <i>LittleBigPlanet</i> level. I even-- uh, test-- I even... did a little testing for, uh... the, uh, how to make it a <i>speedy</i> level. Well, y’know, basically with <i>glass floors</i> and, uh, hopefully, a <i>loop-de-loop</i>? That’s why I-- that’s pretty much the reason why I... created the te-- the <i>speed test</i> level... with a little bit of, uh... <i>Metal Gear Solid</i> content. Y’know, just basically add a little action to it. And I also tried my hand at a... electrified <i>maze</i> and a... rocketpack! So, the speed test level was pretty much practice for, uh, when I decide to, uh... do the-- do a-- do <i>another</i> Sonichu level in LittleBigPlanet.\n</p><p>[<i>clears throat</i>] Are there any <i>more</i> questions?\n</p><p>As I can see from the-- I can see that some person’s typing up a <i>new</i> mess--\n</p><p>[Troll question: “Are you working on any other Sonichu-related projects besides the comic at the moment or do you have any planned for the near future?”]\n</p><p>Oh, yes! Uh... that’s-- which-- which brings up <i>another</i> topic of interest... that-- y’all can applaud for this! (Where-- where is the alien? There it is.) Okay. But anyway, uh, <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Animal_Crossing\" title=\"Animal Crossing\">Animal Crossing</a>: City Folk</i>? It’s official: Sonichu and Rosechu... goin’ to be... <i><a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_AC:_City_Folk_Update\" title=\"CWC AC: City Folk Update\">villagers</a></i>... officially created from the, uh... head-- from the head game... master behind there. I got the e-mail the-- earlier today. And so, I replied to give him-- needed to give him my approval, even though a few people managed to, uh, give-- get it <i>early</i>... because-- uh, b-because, uh, they left their Con-- the WiiConnect24 on... one night. But anyway, the official release date for both characters is gonna be on my birthday: February 24th!\n</p><p>[<i>a troll types something</i>]\n</p><p>There ya go! [<i>laughs</i>] Props to Miss <a href=\"/cwcki/Emily\" title=\"Emily\">Emily</a> over there!\n</p><p>Okay. I see we got another pending question?\n</p><p>[Troll question: “Have you seen the ‘<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/SonichuGirls\" title=\"SonichuGirls\">SonichuGirls</a>’ forum?”]\n</p><p>Pssh! <i>Yeah!</i> I love-- I love the ladi-- I <i>love</i> the girls on there! They’re so <i>sweet!</i> Believe me! I’ve been there! Sergeant iPod(?) knows. <i>Yeah</i>. I’ve been there. And I’ve offered so much-- and I’ve-- I offered a lotta input on there.

I know <i>you</i> did! Cool.\n</p><p>I-- uh, I enjoy reading the-- reading the individual posts from, uh, every one of the... <i>gals</i> on there. I mean, not only-- uh, good-- not only good, <i>honest</i> opinions, but so many... sweet compliments! I mean, I tell ya: it really boosts-- it’s really boostin’ me up! It makes me feel <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">omnipotent</a>!</i>\n</p><p>Okay. So, uh, any <i>more</i> questions?\n</p><p>[Troll question: “Have you been to another new forum, ‘<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Gay4Sonichu\" title=\"Gay4Sonichu\">Gay4Sonichu</a>’?”]\n</p><p>Tshh! Yeah, I’ve heard about it. I don’t care much for it. Uh... I’d rather just, uh, not think about it.\n</p><p>'Cause everybody here <i>knows</i>... that it’s well-<i>proven</i>... that I’m <i>straight</i>. That’s my story, and I’m stickin’ to it! Really.\n</p><p>[<i>a troll types something</i>]\n</p><p>I <i>see</i>. Hmm. I hear that! Hmm. Frankly, I appreciate that. I really do. I appreciate that.\n</p><p>[Troll statement: “I miss <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ryan_Cash\" title=\"Ryan Cash\">Ryan</a>!”]\n</p><p>Yep! We all do. At least I was-- at least I was able to, uh, say what I did about him.\n</p><p>[<i>a troll types something</i>]\n</p><p>Well, that’s alright. At least you came back!\n</p><p>Yeah, but at least I was able to offer my condolences to the family about their loss. I mean, the best thing to do is to just move on. And, uh, just try to be happy from the, uh, mem-- from the good memories they had... while he was around.\n</p><p>[<i>a troll types something</i>]\n</p><p>Hmm. That’s an idea, but I don’t know what he looks like. <i>Hmm</i>. That’s an idea, y’know... anything from his fan art-- I might be able to, uh... use part of that for, like, y’know, I don’t know... maybe additional <i>characters</i> or somethin’. Hunh. I’ll gladly accept them!\n</p><p>Okay. So, uh... if there are no more questions... then, uh, I’ll just, uh, basically, uh... let y’all know when the next-- at the <i>next</i> Sonichu Club meeting. Hopefully, we’ll have more <i>attendance</i>. At least more than I was able to tell, ‘cause I was-- had my eyes down at my comic pages! [<i>chuckles</i>]\n</p><p>But anyway, uh, let’s-- let’s meet-- the next topic-- the next meeting topic will be about, uh... y’know, the way I-- the way I color my pages... and, uh, draw-- and some drawing methods, uh, <i>art</i> styles.

[<i>high-pitched</i>] You know what, [<i>normal</i>] something like a <i>Blackberry</i> I guess, ‘cause the uh, keys are that small. I mean, it’s like, you turn your controller into your... keyboard.
