It is a computational system that allows the transmission of data over long distances through a massive collection of networks connected all over the world. The Internet has grown immensely since its first real conception in the <a href=\"/cwcki/1980s\" title=\"1980s\">1980s</a> as a means for the military, and later <a href=\"/cwcki/Piedmont_Virginia_Community_College\" title=\"Piedmont Virginia Community College\">universities</a>, to communicate with each other; it is said that about 6.4 billion<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup> people are connected to the Internet today. One of those people is <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris\" title=\"Chris\">Chris</a>, the Internet's <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Basement_Rosechus\" title=\"Basement Rosechus\">battered girlfriend</a> who always comes back for more.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Understanding\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Understanding</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Fora\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Fora</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Password_sharing\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Password sharing</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#VPN\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">VPN</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Bans\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Bans</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Bans_from_Orbiters\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Bans from Orbiters</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Attempts_to_leave_the_Internet\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Attempts to leave the Internet</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Understanding\">Understanding</span></h2>\n<p>Chris seems to be aware that the Internet is a place where, once you put something up, anyone with access to a computer can see it. However, due to a combination of his ego and his <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">general inability to understand others</a>, Chris has come to the conclusion that if he puts anything on the Internet, <i>everyone</i> will see it; and if you direct a message to someone, only <i>they</i> will see it. Chris has in the past attempted to address videos to specific people, from <a href=\"/cwcki/Congrats,_Jack_Black\" title=\"Congrats, Jack Black\">celebrities</a> to <a href=\"/cwcki/Shigeru_Miyamoto\" title=\"Shigeru Miyamoto\">potential employers</a> to <a href=\"/cwcki/Ivy\" title=\"Ivy\">Internet girlfriends</a> to <a href=\"/cwcki/Eid,_Pmurt,_Eid\" title=\"Eid, Pmurt, Eid\">his country's president</a>. Most telling is <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/100_2178\" title=\"100 2178\">his 8 May 2010 rant</a>, which was addressed to anyone who served on the Greene County School Board in the early 1990s.\n</p><p>Chris sees no problem in revealing <a href=\"/cwcki/Honest_Content\" title=\"Honest Content\">highly sensitive information</a> in his videos, including his phone number, <a href=\"/cwcki/14_Branchland_Court\" title=\"14 Branchland Court\">street address</a>, and others' potentially identifying info (such as the real name of <a href=\"/cwcki/The_Wallflower\" title=\"The Wallflower\">the girl</a> he desperately wanted to be his <a href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart\" title=\"Sweetheart\">sweetheart</a>). He doesn't understand that <a href=\"/cwcki/YouTube\" title=\"YouTube\">YouTube</a> is a public website and not an instant messaging service, never paying attention to the deluge of comments he gets from horrified onlookers that definitively prove his <a href=\"/cwcki/For_Julie%27s_Eyes_Only\" title=\"For Julie's Eyes Only\">\"private\"</a> messages are anything but.\n</p><p>Chris has been on the Internet since the late <a href=\"/cwcki/1990s\" title=\"1990s\">1990s</a>, yet does not understand how to act online any more than he does in real life. While many users of the Internet contribute content, are polite and helpful, and generally <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_the_Law\" title=\"Chris and the Law\">follow any established rules</a>, Chris sees all websites as vehicles to spew his <a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_Chris%27s_edits_to_the_CWCki\" title=\"List of Chris's edits to the CWCki\">self</a>-<a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_Chris%27s_edits_to_Encyclopedia_Dramatica\" title=\"List of Chris's edits to Encyclopedia Dramatica\">serving</a> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/User:ChrisChanSonichu_profile\" title=\"User:ChrisChanSonichu profile\">version</a> of the truth. Even worse, when given his own website, he audaciously claimed that <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_Blog#January_2010\" title=\"CWC Blog\">it was he who had control over the site</a>, not <a href=\"/cwcki/User:Cogsdev\" title=\"User:Cogsdev\">the Sysop</a> who did the work of setting it up, or the <a href=\"/cwcki/Jack_Thaddeus\" title=\"Jack Thaddeus\">advertisers</a> who paid for it.\n</p><p>Out of fear of <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">trolls</a>, Chris refuses to meet people online or interact with people he knows beyond 'closed doors'. He has tried to join public forums at least <a href=\"/cwcki/Trollin_Train\" title=\"Trollin Train\">a couple</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Tomboys_And_Tomgirls_of_Virginia\" title=\"Tomboys And Tomgirls of Virginia\">times</a> without attaching his name to the account, but has outed himself either on his own or through his <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_writing\" title=\"Chris and writing\">unusual and distinctive writing style</a>, abandoning them when he feels unsafe from his trolls.\n</p><p>In the recent years though, he has been very active on <a href=\"/cwcki/Facebook\" title=\"Facebook\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Twitter\" title=\"Twitter\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Discord\" title=\"Discord\">Discord</a>, using them as safespaces and content bubbles to bask in his own glory. He was in multiple self serving groups, such as <a href=\"/cwcki/The_Place\" title=\"The Place\">The Place</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Golden_Church_of_Sonichu\" title=\"Golden Church of Sonichu\">Golden Church of Sonichu</a> or <a href=\"/cwcki/The_Knights_of_CWC\" title=\"The Knights of CWC\">The Knights of CWC</a>, which served as places to spew out his horrid ideas and worldviews in a regulated environment to people who won't be bothered by it. When it was impossible, Chris opted to either block people who spoke against him or use multiple sock puppets to view people who have blocked him instead, a typical show of his <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_hypocrisy\" title=\"Chris and hypocrisy\">hypocrisy</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Fora\">Fora</span></h2>\n<p>Chris does not normally participate in forum discussions, either due to a dislike of reading, simple egotism or both. When he does, he always signs his message – be it a comment on YouTube, a rant on the <a href=\"/cwcki/Adult_Swim_posts\" title=\"Adult Swim posts\">Adult Swim boards</a>, or a complaint about something in <i><a href=\"/cwcki/LittleBigPlanet\" title=\"LittleBigPlanet\">LittleBigPlanet</a></i>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup> He never follows up on these posts either, nor does he read the comments left by other users, just like on YouTube. Any retractions or responses are saved for completely unrelated posts elsewhere on the Internet.\n</p><p>Common sense would suggest that Chris would fare well in the Internet forums, which are havens for socially-inept, thirty-something weeaboo man-children who still live with their parents. However, Chris has managed to fail here too. By appearing in the web as his usual nicknames or full names, and plastering <i>Sonichu</i> crap all over, he draws the attention of his trolls, and reacts predictably when they follow him. More importantly, if the trolls somehow fail to notice his new hangouts, he's quick to make enemies completely of his own accord, due to his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_Ego\" title=\"Chris and his Ego\">ego</a>, selfishness, and complete disregard of rules.\n</p><p>Chris is or has been active on many other mediums on the Internet. He has ran his own blogs and websites, posted videos on <a href=\"/cwcki/YouTube\" title=\"YouTube\">YouTube</a>, and communicated with the outside world through social media sites such as <a href=\"/cwcki/MySpace\" title=\"MySpace\">MySpace</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Twitter\" title=\"Twitter\">Twitter</a>, and <a href=\"/cwcki/Facebook\" title=\"Facebook\">Facebook</a>. It was only through Chris's extensive activity on these mediums that made the complication of this huge extensive wiki possible. As of 2018 however, Chris's online activity has transformed from a naive manchild's <a href=\"/cwcki/Kick_the_Autistic\" title=\"Kick the Autistic\">accidental comedy act</a> to the <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">insane ramblings</a> of an unhinged madman.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Password_sharing\">Password sharing</span></h2>\n<div class=\"rellink boilerplate seealso\">See also: <a href=\"/cwcki/Gregg_Mays_E-mails\" title=\"Gregg Mays E-mails\">Gregg Mays E-mails</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/2018_Twitter_account_compromise\" title=\"2018 Twitter account compromise\">2018 Twitter account compromise</a></div>\n<p>One of the most cardinal rules of the Internet, taught to pretty much anybody of any age, is that you should never give away your password to an account you have on any website, since (obviously) this runs the risk of you being hacked by people like trolls and scammers. Chris, in his <a href=\"/cwcki/Honor_roll\" title=\"Honor roll\">infinite wisdom</a>, has broken this rule on multiple occasions.\n</p><p>During the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Miyamoto_Saga\" title=\"Miyamoto Saga\">Miyamoto Saga</a> in <a href=\"/cwcki/2009\" title=\"2009\">2009</a>, Chris was contacted by one <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Gregg_Mays\" title=\"Gregg Mays\">Gregg Mays</a> (really an alias of <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">Clyde Cash</a>), who wanted to help update his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu.net\" title=\"Sonichu.net\">website</a> to promote <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_AC:_City_Folk_Update\" title=\"CWC AC: City Folk Update\">Sonichu's appearance</a> in <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Animal_Crossing\" title=\"Animal Crossing\">Animal Crossing</a></i>, and thus asked him to provide his username and password for his Tripod account. Chris was surprisingly somewhat hesitant to do so initially,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup> but when he was pressed with a deadline to give Gregg his password, he let his guard down. Shortly after this, Gregg hacked the site.\n</p><p>In <a href=\"/cwcki/BlueSpike_PSN_Chat_3\" title=\"BlueSpike PSN Chat 3\">BlueSpike PSN Chat 3</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/BlueSpike\" title=\"BlueSpike\">BlueSpike</a>, under the guise of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Julie\" title=\"Julie\">Julie</a>, asked Chris if he could share his <a href=\"/cwcki/PlayStation_Network\" title=\"PlayStation Network\">PlayStation Network</a> account with \"her\". Chris was all too eager to give away his password to his then-<a href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart\" title=\"Sweetheart\">sweetheart</a>, which would eventually caused his account to get hacked.\n</p><p>In fall <a href=\"/cwcki/2018\" title=\"2018\">2018</a>, members of the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Teen_Troon_Squad\" title=\"Teen Troon Squad\">Teen Troon Squad</a> posed as <a href=\"/cwcki/Magi-Chan\" title=\"Magi-Chan\">Magi-Chan</a>, and <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_manipulation\" title=\"Chris and manipulation\">manipulated</a> Chris into giving him the password to his Twitter account, from which they would control for <a href=\"/cwcki/2018_Twitter_account_compromise\" title=\"2018 Twitter account compromise\">three months</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"VPN\">VPN</span></h2>\n<p>VPNs can be used for several purposes, including security, anonymity, and bypassing country restrictions. The first known usage of a VPN was during the <a href=\"/cwcki/2018_Twitter_account_compromise\" title=\"2018 Twitter account compromise\">2018 Twitter account compromise</a> when the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Teen_Troon_Squad\" title=\"Teen Troon Squad\">Teen Troon Squad</a> logged into Chris's Twitter to troll him by writing tweets in his name, but sometimes left their VPN stamp visible.\n</p><p>In <a href=\"/cwcki/2024\" title=\"2024\">2024</a>, Chris himself was observed using a VPN.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Bans\">Bans</span></h2>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_places_that_have_banned_Chris#Websites\" title=\"List of places that have banned Chris\">List of places that have banned Chris#Websites</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:BANHAMMER.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"300\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/5/57/BANHAMMER.png/300px-BANHAMMER.png\" srcset=\"/w/images/5/57/BANHAMMER.png 1.5x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:BANHAMMER.png\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Some people see <a href=\"/cwcki/Duck\" title=\"Duck\">dicks</a> everywhere on the Internet.

However, due to his relative inactivity concerning Internet forums, he's banned from fewer places online than expected. He was banned from <a href=\"/cwcki/DeviantART\" title=\"DeviantART\">deviantART</a> in the summer of 2009 for posting the uncensored version of <i>Sonichu</i> #9 without a NSFW tag, though he doesn't understand why - comments he left on the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia\" title=\"CWCipedia\">CWCipedia</a> suggest that he is under the impression that his dA account simply vanished into cyberspace for no reason.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]</a></sup> He was also banned earlier for the uncensored version of <i>Sonichu</i> #8. Despite bouncing from one account to the next, Chris has only been <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/The_July_10th_Messages\" title=\"The July 10th Messages\">banned once</a> from <a href=\"/cwcki/YouTube\" title=\"YouTube\">YouTube</a>; however, unlike dA, Chris has constantly made new accounts after one was taken down or abandoned. He has also had posts moderated at <a href=\"/cwcki/GameFAQs\" title=\"GameFAQs\">GameFAQs</a> when he attempted to solicit money for special characters in <i><a href=\"/cwcki/ModNation_Racers\" title=\"ModNation Racers\">ModNation Racers</a></i>. When his \"article\" on <a href=\"/cwcki/Wikipedia\" title=\"Wikipedia\">Wikipedia</a> was deleted and his talk page there got trolled, his account was indefinitely blocked, although the blocking admin mistakenly thought that he was a sock-puppet of a troll and not <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/TRUE_and_HONEST\" title=\"TRUE and HONEST\">the real deal</a>.\n</p><p>His most grievous ban to date involves <a href=\"/cwcki/Flipnote_Hatena\" title=\"Flipnote Hatena\">Flipnote Hatena</a>. Between 29 June and 2 July, Chris had <a href=\"/cwcki/RomanticLabyrinth\" title=\"RomanticLabyrinth\">the same Flipnote</a> removed from the site <i>4 times</i> because of its sexual nature, with Chris thinking it was being removed by trolls instead of realizing the fact that a <a href=\"/cwcki/Nintendo\" title=\"Nintendo\">Nintendo</a>-owned website wouldn't <i>like</i> having animated sex dreams being put on their site. Because of this and other Flipnotes he had uploaded and reuploaded, the mods briefly blocked Chris's DSi from uploading any further Flipnotes. When his ban expired, Chris resurfaced on the website and reuploaded all the Flipnotes that got him banned in the first place. (The entire situation wasn't helped by try-hard trolls flagging his animations in a desperate attempt to have an impact.)\n</p><p>One notices a pattern in all of this – Chris has a tendency to not read a website's terms of service or gain an understanding of websites he uses. When protesting his ban from Wikipedia for violating one of their numerous rules, he argued that he didn't have the time to read the pages upon pages of fine print that stipulated what constituted acceptable behavior. When faced with a similar conflict on Flipnote, he failed to get the hint that each deleted animation was violating the terms of service, even uploading a video anyone could tell was inappropriate for the PG-13 website no less than <i>4 times</i> before getting his console blocked.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Bans_from_Orbiters\">Bans from Orbiters</span></h3>\n<div class=\"boilerplate metadata\" id=\"incomplete\">\n<table cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"background-color:#ffff88; border:5px outset #06c4ff;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Stress.jpg\"><img alt=\"Stress.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"91\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/2/2c/Stress.jpg/120px-Stress.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/2/2c/Stress.jpg/180px-Stress.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/2/2c/Stress.jpg/240px-Stress.jpg 2x\" style=\"vertical-align: bottom\" width=\"120\"/></a>\n</td>\n<td><p style=\"text-align: center;\"> <span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms\"><b>This article is still yet to be completed due to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress\" title=\"Stress\">stress</a>.</b></span></p><p> <span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms\">We get a lot of stressful torture in our lives that makes us crash into slumber.

He's like a child who packs up all of his toys and goes out in the driveway when things don't go his way. For many trolls, this would be a great victory – threatening to quit the Internet forever is such a common reaction to trolling that it has its own term: \"flouncing\".\n</p><p>Of course, his game consoles are still hooked up to the Internet (where he plays video games, reads game forums and logs into YouTube), so he never really leaves for good, he merely changes his outlet. When Chris talks about quitting the Internet, he means ceasing video and comic production, and no longer tangling with trolls. \n</p><p>His <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Youtube_Finale\" title=\"Youtube Finale\">first attempt</a> to abandon the Internet was when the <a href=\"/cwcki/Ivy\" title=\"Ivy\">Ivy</a> saga was hitting its peak; tired of <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">Clyde Cash</a>'s trolling, Chris proclaimed that he was leaving the Internet.

This shows not only that Chris is still looking out for his Internet reputation, but that he also assumes that by telling trolls \"I'm leaving the Internet forever,\" he expects them to stop talking about him.\n</p><p>This would've been easy for the trolls to do, if Chris had just <a href=\"/cwcki/EXCLUSIVE_Manchester_High_School_2000_Reunion_Required_NOW\" title=\"EXCLUSIVE Manchester High School 2000 Reunion Required NOW\">stopped</a> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/The_MovingForward_videos\" title=\"The MovingForward videos\">making</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/ItIsFinished.MOV\" title=\"ItIsFinished.MOV\">videos</a> – especially ones <a href=\"/cwcki/Stardate,_August_27,_2010\" title=\"Stardate, August 27, 2010\">addressing them</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Haters_Gonna_Hate.MOV\" title=\"Haters Gonna Hate.MOV\">specifically</a> (<a href=\"/cwcki/Charlottesville_Fashion_Square#Chris_captured_on_video\" title=\"Charlottesville Fashion Square\">not seeking out trolls offline couldn't hurt, either</a>).\n</p><p>On 22 <a href=\"/cwcki/November_2010\" title=\"November 2010\">November 2010</a> Chris <a href=\"/cwcki/100_2357.MOV\" title=\"100 2357.MOV\">announced that he would be leaving the Internet</a> <i>yet again</i>, and began what would become his longest time away from the Internet. For an hereto unsurpassed period of time, Chris managed to refrain from doing something that would directly attract the attention of the trolls, although he was not completely able to repress his urge to spread his ego over the tubes, and thanks to his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PS3\" title=\"PS3\">PS3</a> with web connection and keyboard controller, he still made <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC%27s_Collector%27s_Case_Tutorial\" title=\"CWC's Collector's Case Tutorial\">occasional</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism_Tutorial\" title=\"Autism Tutorial\">efforts</a> to make the world realize his greatness.\n</p><p>Despite his claims to have stopped socializing online, a new <a href=\"/cwcki/Facebook\" title=\"Facebook\">Facebook</a> account bearing a <a href=\"/cwcki/File:CWCJuly2011.jpg\" title=\"File:CWCJuly2011.jpg\">previously unseen photograph of Chris</a> was discovered on 5 <a href=\"/cwcki/July_2011\" title=\"July 2011\">July 2011</a>, and two weeks later it was revealed that between 29 <a href=\"/cwcki/May_2011\" title=\"May 2011\">May</a> and 20 <a href=\"/cwcki/June_2011\" title=\"June 2011\">June 2011</a> Chris was frequenting the forum <a href=\"/cwcki/Tomboys_And_Tomgirls_of_Virginia\" title=\"Tomboys And Tomgirls of Virginia\">Tomboys And Tomgirls of Virginia</a> while trying (and failing) to stay anonymous. This culminated with <a href=\"/cwcki/Calling_Out\" title=\"Calling Out\">three new videos</a> released on 6 August 2011 after a 257-day YouTube hiatus.\n</p><p>Although unofficial, it is worth mentioning that after the death of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bob\" title=\"Bob\">Bob</a> in <a href=\"/cwcki/September_2011\" title=\"September 2011\">September 2011</a>, Chris had not returned to YouTube for over 2 years, which broke his previous record of 257 days. Technically, that could have been considered a seventh Internet abandonment (with the only exceptions being Facebook and Twitter).<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-7\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">[7]</a></sup> However, in <a href=\"/cwcki/November_2013\" title=\"November 2013\">November 2013</a>, Chris uploaded a <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_Lego_Manchester_High_School_Oct_18_2013\" title=\"CWC Lego Manchester High School Oct 18 2013\">video</a> he'd recorded the previous month, once again showing that, ultimately, he just can't resist <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_Ego\" title=\"Chris and his Ego\">uploading things about himself</a>. He continued to upload videos sparingly throughout 2014 and 2015, returning on a regular basis from October 2015 onwards.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Jeff_is_Beyond_Denounced.\" title=\"Jeff is Beyond Denounced.\">Jeff is Beyond Denounced.</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a class=\"external free\" href=\"https://datareportal.com/global-digital-overview\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://datareportal.com/global-digital-overview</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-3\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-3\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a class=\"external free\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20100806143004/http://forums.littlebigworkshop.com/t5/PS3-Workshop/Complaints-on-the-Sonic-the-Hedgehog-and-Werehog-Costumes/m-p/239893;jsessionid=C15F46579256D040386028A0EAB09412\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://web.archive.org/web/20100806143004/http://forums.littlebigworkshop.com/t5/PS3-Workshop/Complaints-on-the-Sonic-the-Hedgehog-and-Werehog-Costumes/m-p/239893;jsessionid=C15F46579256D040386028A0EAB09412</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-4\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-4\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Gregg_Mays_E-mails#January_7,_2009\" title=\"Gregg Mays E-mails\">Gregg Mays E-mails#January 7, 2009</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-5\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-5\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"/cwcki/February_2024_social_media_posts#RussiaIsMLPG5\" title=\"February 2024 social media posts\">February 2024 social media posts#RussiaIsMLPG5</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-6\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-6\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://archive.sonichu.com/cwcipedia/index.php?title=DeviantART\" rel=\"nofollow\">DeviantART</a> on the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia\" title=\"CWCipedia\">CWCipedia</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-7\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-7\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Facebook</span>\n</li>\n</ol></div>\n<table align=\"center\" id=\"toc\" style=\"text-align:Left;
