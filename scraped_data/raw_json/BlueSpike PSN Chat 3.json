The chat covers his early experiences with pornography and <a href=\"/cwcki/Mass_debating\" title=\"Mass debating\">masturbation</a>, his experimentation with <a href=\"/cwcki/Sex_toys\" title=\"Sex toys\">sex toys</a>, the acquisition of his first blow-up doll, and other disturbing subjects. \n</p><p>Perhaps the worst of all is the revelation that Chris discusses his masturbation habits in detail with his mother. <a href=\"/cwcki/Affair_with_Mother\" title=\"Affair with Mother\">No, there's nothing Oedipal going on here at all.</a>\n</p><p>Surprisingly, this chat sees Chris using the word \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Na%C3%AFve\" title=\"Naïve\">naïve</a>\" correctly and in context.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Summary\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Summary</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Audio\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Audio</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Transcript\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Transcript</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#External_links\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">External links</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Summary\">Summary</span></h2>\n<p>Some of this chat is more intriguing than disgusting. Chris talks about the \"random thoughts\" that inspire his fear of becoming a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Homo\" title=\"Homo\">homo</a>, such as mental images of a penis and voices telling him that \"Christian is gay.\" He claims to have a \"philopathic memory,\" whatever that's supposed to mean.\n</p><p>Most of it, though, is just really disgusting. After Julie asks for his \"entire sexual history,\" Chris discusses his early attempts at masturbation, his collection of pornography, and his chats with his mother about his jacking-off schedule. Some of what he mentions is rehashed from his <a href=\"/cwcki/IRC_(27_December_2008)\" title=\"IRC (27 December 2008)\">27 December</a> chat with <a href=\"/cwcki/PandaHalo\" title=\"PandaHalo\">PandaHalo</a> — the story about his first encounter with porn on cable television, for instance — but as is typical of his conversations with Julie, there's a good deal more gory detail here.\n</p><p>The same is true of the sections where Chris discusses his sex toy experiences. Chris bought his first blow-up doll in person at Spencer's (showing either some impressive gumption or an impressive lack of shame) and later switched to buying online from <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Adam_%26_Eve\" title=\"Adam &amp; Eve\">Adam &amp; Eve</a>. Here we learn about the ugly fate of his anal beads and dildo, both of which wound up in the trash after their encounters with the business end of Chris's digestive tract.\n</p><p>Later, Chris and Julie mercifully turn to more mundane topics. Chris talks about the sources of his credit-card debt, which added up to around $2,000 at this point. Some of it was apparently just bad luck, like a flat tire on <a href=\"/cwcki/Son-Chu\" title=\"Son-Chu\">Son-Chu</a>, but most of it came from his flood of <a href=\"/cwcki/PlayStation_Network\" title=\"PlayStation Network\">PlayStation Network</a> downloads and other impulse purchases. In a flash-forward to the <a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey\" title=\"Kacey\">Kacey</a> saga, Julie tries to convince Chris to exercise more. Chris, of course, merely promises to do a bit more standing up.\n</p><p>At the end of the chat, Chris makes a fateful mistake and gives Julie his PSN account password. He would eventually come to <a href=\"/cwcki/Julie_Reveals_Herself\" title=\"Julie Reveals Herself\">regret this</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Audio\">Audio</span></h2>\n<table style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa; background-color: #f9f9f9; color: black; margin: .5em auto .5em auto; padding: 0.2em; font-size:89%; width:260px;-moz-border-radius:10px\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFFF00\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size:110%; color:#008080;-moz-border-radius:10px\"><b>BlueSpike PSN Chat 3</b><br/>\n</td></tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<td colspan=\"2\"><div class=\"thumb embedvideo autoResize\" style=\"width: 328px;\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo autoResize\" style=\"\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideowrap archiveorg\" style=\"width: 320px\"><div class=\"embedvideo-consent\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo-consent__overlay\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo-consent__message\">Click to load content</div><!--\n--></div><!--\n--></div><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" data-src=\"//archive.org/embed/bluespike_psn_chat_3\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"247\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"320\"></iframe></div><!--\n--></div><!--\n--></div>\n</td></tr>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#696969\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;-moz-border-radius:5px;color:#ffffff;\"><b>Stardate</b>\n</td>\n<td>18 <a href=\"/cwcki/February_2009\" title=\"February 2009\">February 2009</a>\n</td></tr>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#696969\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;-moz-border-radius:5px;color:#ffffff;\"><b>Featuring</b>\n</td>\n<td><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris\" title=\"Chris\">Chris</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bluespike\" title=\"Bluespike\">Bluespike</a>\n</td></tr>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#696969\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;-moz-border-radius:5px;color:#ffffff;\"><b>Saga</b>\n</td>\n<td><span style=\"display:none\">Julie</span><a href=\"/cwcki/Julie\" title=\"Julie\"><img alt=\"Julie\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"32\" src=\"/w/images/c/ca/Julie_saga.png\" width=\"32\"/></a> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Julie\" title=\"Julie\">Julie</a>\n</td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><br/>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Transcript\">Transcript</span></h2>\n<p>[<i>Chris and BlueSpike/Julie are chatting.

Uh... and uh, in my humble opinion, it just did not feel right to me. And uh, the anal beads, I just put 'em in there and they were, it's like... in. Not so stiff. So it was just that one time, then they got <a href=\"/cwcki/DIRTY,_CRAPPED_BRIEFS\" title=\"DIRTY, CRAPPED BRIEFS\">covered in poo</a>, and I just, I put them in the trash can.\n<br/><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> [<i>almost cracks up laughing</i>] I'm sorry.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> That's ok.

That's no surprise. Uh, what'd you masturbate over?\n<br/><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Not really over anything. I just went into one of the stalls and, y'know...\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Ah. You just felt horny.\n<br/><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Yes. Something...\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> That's okay.

No, I've never done, I've never masturbated in a public place, mostly it's been confined in my bedroom, and at least from there I've found like, you know, a good place to masturbate is while sitting on the front edge of the bathroom sink. It's like, uh, you get your feet off the ground, off the floor, and, and uh, it's like, you're in air and it just feels good.\n<br/><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Yeah. Chris, I know this may be hard for you but I want you to tell me your entire sexual history.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Sure, I'll give it to you from the best of my recollections... Um, I was... I think it started about sometime when, while I was 16 or 17. Uh, this is when my family and I were still living in [<i>unintelligible, presumably \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Richmond\" title=\"Richmond\">Chesterfield</a>\"</i>] County, and I was, uh, it was uh, let me see... I believe it would be my, uh, sophomore or junior year of while I was, while I was in high school. Anyway, basically one night I was just channel surfing and I figured out the, the code that was blockin' out the channels like HBO and Cinemax that we had at the time there. And I just tuned in, I just tuned in and I found the first porno movie I ever watched. Called \"I Like to Play Games... Too.\" And, uh, basically I tuned into the part where, there were, where the guy and the woman was having sex in the pool. The swimming pool.\n<br/><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Okay. Continue.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> And uh, it was at that point I first learned about, first learned about, uh, <a href=\"/cwcki/Semen\" title=\"Semen\">stuff</a> that would ooze out of my, uh... penis. Mmm... I think I'll say \"duck\" from this point on, but anyway, the stuff that oozed out of my duck, after seeing those things, and uh, it's like uh, I learned from watching the pornos, like, you know, learning from it, were, uh, threesomes, and [<i>drowned out by fading volume and background noise</i>] I dunno, I was more <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Naive\" title=\"Naive\">naive</a> about dating back then anyway, I wasn't into dating as much back then as I am now, because I was naive about dating and all that. And... mmm. Anyway. Anyway, anyway since then I, uh, just began lying face-down naked on my bed with a washcloth, uh... uh, in front of my uh... duck. And uh... and the, and the stuff would just uh, the stuff would just come out. I figured, I figured this was like, uh, this was like only precum. The, uh, clear stuff that comes out before the white. So anyway, so anyway, over the years I over the years I, uh, just been watching more softcore porn. Until after I turned 18 I, uh, after I, after I turned 18, after we moved back to Ruckersville, after I graduated from Manchester High, and I, uh, found, I finally got into the Playboy magazines, and I found porno... DVDs, I'm not sure which one was my first one, but I had a bunch of softcore recorded onto VHS. And uh, over those, over the years. And I think, I think it was, like, the first time I actually, uh, figured out the masturbation part where it's like you know, I'm rubbing, rubbin' my duck, instead of just me, instead of just lying face down with a washcloth in front of my duck on the, on the place, like, like on my mattress, I wanted to wash my duck. Make a sandwich there. Like that. But yeah. Anyway, it was, it wasn't until, until I was like 17 when I first figured out about, uh, actually masturbating and rubbing it up and down.\n<br/><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Huh.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> And aside from that, aside from that I am definitely still a <a href=\"/cwcki/Virgin_with_rage\" title=\"Virgin with rage\">virgin</a>, and, uh, you know, over the course, over the course of time I did confide in my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Barb\" title=\"Barb\">mother</a> and tell her, and tell her about, uh, my, uh, masturbation history there. [<i>BlueSpike suppresses a laugh.</i>] And uh, about how often, and that sort of thing. \n<br/><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Huh.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I mean, my mom is more open-minded about the subject, but my father is, because he's much older, and uh, possibly more strict, more close-minded on the subject.\n<br/><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Ahh. Alright.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Talking about it... [<i>unintelligible, lots of background noise</i>] Anyway, I did, I did not realize that I really needed to be dating until after I turned 21. It was like I turned 21 and then I'm like, \"Oh my God I need to be out, I need to be with a better woman to become my sweetheart!\" And that's when the <a href=\"/cwcki/Love_Quest\" title=\"Love Quest\">sweetheart search</a> started.\n<br/><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Huh.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>long pause</i>] And then eventually I found adamandeve.com. After I got that, yeah, it was like after I turned 21 I, uh, bought my first female love doll at Spencer's, and then I learned about adamandeve.com and I could order them off of the, uh, internet.\n<br/><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Huh.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> And then, I think it was after that I got my first porno D-, my first hardcore porno DVD.\n<br/><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Mmm-hmm.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I forget which one it was, though. I mean, I like have, I have it up in a box. Usually it's like, and I got a message on my Wii.\n<br/><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Huh, alright.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I have to switch the input and take a look. It could be from Sarah May. Cuss she and I exchanged our Wii numbers.\n<br/><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Hey Chris, do you have Mario Kart Wii?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Oh, you do have a Wii?\n<br/><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> I was able to get one actually.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Okay, hang on. Let me check the message and then I'll, I'll register your Wii number. [<i>BlueSpike interrupts</i>] ... look it up\n<br/><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Yeah, but do you have Mario Kart Wii?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> No.\n<br/><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Why not? It's an awesome game.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I know it is, I just haven't gotten it yet.\n<br/><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Well what games do you have?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uh, I, I will make it a point to get a copy of Mario Kart Wii.\n<br/><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> What games do you have?\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uh, hang on, is that, this, this actually came from Adam.

[<i>unintelligible</i>] added to the rest. And then there was this one time, I, uh, needed a new tire for my car, after I, after it got flat and I had to ride to Sears to get a new tire. And uh, and some other things, yeah.\n<br/><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Huh.

If I wanted to get myself a 360 it would be like a month before I could afford one.\n<br/><font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Really, hm.
