But for ALL those of Satanism and Atheism; I do not care for those Non-Religions AT ALL. I will not discriminate the people of those Non-Religions as Individual People. 2) As individual people, they all deserve Most Rights, but GAY MARRIAGE Should be made Illegal ALL Countries; Marriage is ONLY for Straight Man/Woman couples. I stand behind that most fully. 3) As a Moderate (of Middle, Neutral Opinion), I have nothing against the other political parties. Mainly, because even though I do have the ability to learn about them, I know not ALL of the details of them. 4) I STAND FULLY AGAINST Cigarettes, Marijuana, Cocaine, Cigars and ALL other Drugs of the sort. The only exceptions are drugs that are Prescribed to the Individual Person, as long as they are not given to anyone they were not originally prescribed to, I have no objections. And Alcohol; in Responsible, Moderate amounts, it can be good for you, yet I do not support Too Much of it, as if left unchecked, unresponsible or unassisted, too much can lead to fights that can lead to a trip to the hospital and automobile accidents. 5) Only those who fully promote smoking or such drugs that I have just elaborated against of. 6) I have no discomfort or tension against people of all colors. The only exception is in my choice of Sweetheart or Mate; No Personal Offense, but she can not be Black. 7) I have agreement on some lyrics of Death Metal tracks, but the Tune, as long as it is not at loud volume, it is still good. 8) I think Obama is doing okay, yet I disagree with his Health Plan; it is premature at the time, because we can not afford it yet. <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bob\" title=\"Bob\">The Right Wing</a> are sour, mean people; I give no concern to them. 9) I do not know much about those countries, so I can not give a full opinion on the topic.
