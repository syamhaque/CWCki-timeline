Yet sometimes after she reminds me of that, I reply, \"If I'm so handsome, why won't any women (in person) approach me?\" During my <a href=\"/cwcki/Love_Quest\" title=\"Love Quest\">Sweetheart Search</a>, while I'm waiting to be personally approached by an <a href=\"/cwcki/Attraction_Sign\" title=\"Attraction Sign\">\"18-(my age at that time and current) Boyfriend-Free, caring, smoke-free, non-alcoholic white girl, to make into a Sweetheart from the ground-up,\"</a> I did feel lonesome. Yet at the end of each time out to the location, I did feel a sad moment, but I take it with a \"That's okay; maybe next time\" attitude. But I can tell y'all understand from my past actions that I am honest, dedicated and true, and I truly appreciate that. If anything, that is exactly a neutral fact that I would wish to be fully understood among the worldwide <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">fanbase</a>.\n</p><p>Aside from the understood fact, I feel that I am truly in touch with <a href=\"/cwcki/Tomgirl_Pictures\" title=\"Tomgirl Pictures\">my feminine side</a>, to the point where I am capable of learning from that to better understand how to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Rape\" title=\"Rape\">treat women in a caring, nuturing, positive way</a>; I've also learned from <a href=\"/cwcki/Red_Skelton\" title=\"Red Skelton\">Red Skelton</a> of how to be a gentleman. Sometimes I wonder between my caring attitude and the lack of a Sweetheart if I was born the wrong gender; I would wonder what life would have been like <a href=\"/cwcki/Crystal_Weston_Chandler_(sister)\" title=\"Crystal Weston Chandler (sister)\">if I had actually been born a girl</a>. But afterwards, I'd realize that I should still apreciate being born a boy to gentleman; <a href=\"/cwcki/Family_Guy\" title=\"Family Guy\">God gave me the package, and I signed for it</a>.\n</p><p>Another thing I feel I should bring up is my honest feelings to validate my being Straight (although it goes without saying). I honestly feel more comfortable around women, because y'all are mostly more sympathetic and caring to another's feelings, y'all are mostly honest in your converstations, y'all are emotionally better and stronger than the majority of the male population, and simply put, y'all are simply fun and delightful to be around. And while it is true (and I am not ashamed to admit it) that I have seen my share of porn, I have learned how to better, positively treat a woman before, during and after the act. I would definitely stay until she woke up, and I would call her back later to see how her day was. And I have and would put the seat up then back down when I use the restroom she would use later. But I digress. When it comes to the private parts, be they covered or not, I look more at the <a href=\"/cwcki/China\" title=\"China\">female parts</a>, and definitely her face, because not only of my being straight, but every one is truly a masterful work of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/God\" title=\"God\">God</a>'s art that is simply beautiful in their own way. But even more beautiful beyond that which makes it truly a wonderous design are the individual personalities. I care more about every woman's feelings and opinions over their body.\n</p><p>On the flip side, I feel discomfort around men, because they can be such mean and cruel <a href=\"/cwcki/JERKS\" title=\"JERKS\">jerks</a>. I could go on with what I detest about them, but I will not stoop to their level of cruelty. Also, I feel discomfort when shopping for underwear for myself; they do not need models pictured on the package. It grosses me out to see <a href=\"/cwcki/Pickle\" title=\"Pickle\">that thing</a>. It's bad enough that I sometimes see<a href=\"/cwcki/Duck\" title=\"Duck\"> my own</a> when I look down (of which I don't feel as much discomfort), but the very sight of others is like kryptonite to me; it makes me feel like throwing up even when the image randomly pops up in my head.\n</p><p><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress_sigh\" title=\"Stress sigh\">*sigh*</a>\n</p><p>I'm okay; I just took some deep breaths.\n</p><p>I want to thank y'all again for treating me like a King, not just with respect, but with emotional understanding of my feelings. And y'all do not need feel inhibitation in personally approaching me in public *blush*; shoot I would honestly feel most flattered and would personally/emotionally benefit from it (I would most welcome it).\n</p><p>Y'all know I live in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ruckersville\" title=\"Ruckersville\">Ruckersville</a>, Virgina, and I can be found in the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Charlottesville\" title=\"Charlottesville\">Charlottesville</a> area when I'm out and about.

It Is Legit, and I have officially approved it.

While working at Nintendo, I have heard about your original character, Sonichu, from many of my co-workers who read emails sent from your fans who were asking for a Sonichu game. I eventually received a message from <a href=\"/cwcki/Shigeru_Miyamoto\" title=\"Shigeru Miyamoto\">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> that we at <a href=\"/cwcki/Nintendo\" title=\"Nintendo\">Nintendo</a> should take the first step into creating a Sonichu game. That is why I am programming in two new characters into Animal Crossing: City Folk: Sonichu and Rosechu. Once they are released, we will find out how popular Sonichu and Rosechu are with the Nintendo community. If a large number of players enjoy Sonichu and Rosechu, we will create a Sonichu game with the help of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/SEGA\" title=\"SEGA\">Sega</a>. We have already contacted them about our plan, and are anxious to see the results of our little test. We are almost finished with the Sonichu villager, and are almost ready to start on Rosechu. I have attached a few photos of our prototype Sonichu neighbor, and we would like your feeback on it. Currently it is only in its beta phase, and we should be able to release it on February twenty-fourth.\n</p><p>We did run into a slight problem due to a little b it of error, though. In our testing town, WiiConnect24 was left on, and our latest Sonichu beta villager moved out of our town. Luckily, we were able to create a backup of the electric hedgehog villager, so nothing was lost! The only problem is that a handful of players may have recieved a Sonichu villager early.\n</p><p>I hope to get your input from our current project, so please email me back with your feelings on our Sonichu/Rosechu project at this address: animalcrossingnintendo@usa.com\nKindest regards,\nTakashi Tezuka,\nGeneral producer of Animal Crossing and leader of the Sonichu-Alpha project.\n</p><p><br/>\nI gave Takashi my approval and tips for the design of the final version of the characters. The images I have received in the e-mail can be seen below. The first one is from a Fan who accidently received through the WiiConnect24.\n</p><p>And with this, I declare another step forward in the Sonichu Game project, and the downfall of that Impostor, <a href=\"/cwcki/Jimmy_Hill\" title=\"Jimmy Hill\">Jimmy Hill</a>. I have also informed them of Sarah Mitchel's message of Sega of Japan leaning to pay the impostor, but Takashi will most certainly step in and avert the mistake from being made. Then hopefully, with their help, I'll be able to claim the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Copyright\" title=\"Copyright\">copyrights</a> in the UK that should have been mine in the first place. I already had them from the Virginia Library of Congress.\n</p><p>Anyway, when I have new thoughts, I will be sure to add them to this topic.\n</p><p>Love and Peace to y'all. &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3\nChristian C.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p><br/>\nSubsequently, Chris invited his fans to join him in playing Animal Crossing.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Sonichu_Crossing.2C_For_Nintendo_Wii_.288_January_2009.29\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sonichu_Crossing,_For_Nintendo_Wii_(8_January_2009)\">Sonichu Crossing, For Nintendo Wii (8 January 2009)</span></h3>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>I also wanted to share with the Wii owners who have Animal Crossing City Folk, and likewise Wild World for DS, my respective Friend Codes.
