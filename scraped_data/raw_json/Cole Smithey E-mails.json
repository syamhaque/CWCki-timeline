It was the first and last known interaction between them.\n</p><p>This conversation was in all likelihood initiated on Barb's behalf, to guilt trip Cole into becoming her personal piggy bank, like they tried several times afterwards up until Chris' arrest.\n</p><p>Chris started out by talking about his (then) current situation and then how much their <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Barb\" title=\"Barb\">mother</a> loved Cole.  Cole however, refuted the latter by giving Chris interesting revelations about his past, revealing to Chris how abusive and neglectful she really was towards him and how she lied about the identity of his biological father. Chris, however, reacted dismissively, derailing the conversation by asking Cole to vote for him in a Playstation <a href=\"/cwcki/Chop_Chop_Master_Onion%27s_Rap_Showdown\" title=\"Chop Chop Master Onion's Rap Showdown\">contest</a>, rather than listening to his older half-brother's insights on their abusive, neglectful mother.\n</p><p>At the end of the conversation, Cole voiced his frustration at Barb's refusal to come clean to Cole about the identity of his biological father, whom she insisted was <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jack_Smithey\" title=\"Jack Smithey\">Jack Dale Smithey</a>, only for Cole to track him down all the way to Florida and find out that he was neither his biological father, nor were they ever married. When Cole confronted Barb, she just hung up on Cole.\n</p><p>Years later, Chris would go to claim <a href=\"/cwcki/Message_for_John_Kyle\" title=\"Message for John Kyle\">that Cole was just being lied to</a> and Barb was actually a good person.\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>\n<p>Hey, Big Bro. :)\n</p><p>Mar 4, 2007\n</p><p>Remember your lil' bro.? It's me, Christian C. It's been a long while. I'm doing good. I graduated from <a href=\"/cwcki/PVCC\" title=\"PVCC\">PVCC</a> with two <a href=\"/cwcki/CADD\" title=\"CADD\">Computer Aided Drafting &amp; Design</a> Degrees. And currently, I'm getting by with livin' with my folks and a <a href=\"/cwcki/Monthly_tugboat\" title=\"Monthly tugboat\">monthly tugboat</a>. <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Barbara\" title=\"Barbara\">Mama</a> is doing okay; she's been retired for like over a year now; she feels happier not having to rush back-and-forth through traffic and all that <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress\" title=\"Stress\">hustle and bustle</a>. But currently, she mostly sleeps on the couch during a bunch of the day, yet she does get up sometimes to go out with the family or do some work. We haven't seen much of our aunts either. \n</p><p>I have talked to mom, and I quote her when she said, \"I do not regret giving life to Cole. We've had a bunch of good years up till the madness. And all things considered I still love Cole very much like any mother would for her son.\" She really does. :) And I have \n</p><p>&lt;The rest is cut off&gt;\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #B48246; padding:5px; background-color:#FCC\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>\n<p>Re: Hey, Big Bro. :)\n</p><p>Mar 6, 2007\n</p><p>It's very Christian of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Barbara\" title=\"Barbara\">Barbara</a> to not regret having given birth to me but I'm an <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atheism\" title=\"wikipedia:atheism\">atheist</a>. I also have no\nregrets about emerging from her womb. Although, she is mistaken about the \"bunch of good years\"\nwe supposedly had together. I grew up in an abusive household with Barbara and my former\nstepfather <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jerry\" title=\"Jerry\">Jerry</a>, where physical and mental punishments ran the gambit from bare-assed beatings\nto cold showers to bizarre scenarios acted out with glee by two deeply neurotic adults. The\ntreatment I received in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Richmond\" title=\"Richmond\">Richmond</a>, Va was another matter altogether. To raise a child in such\nconditions is inexcusable. Even at a very young age, I knew that they would abandon me. They\nwere both irresponsible and incompetent parents who exposed me to traumas that I would rather\nnot remember.\n</p><p>As for Barbara professing her \"love\" for me, I have not seen any evidence of it in close to 20 years,\nand that's a very long time. Barbara's definition of love is <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC-isms\" title=\"CWC-isms\">a hackneyed sentimental term she uses to\nextract a response</a>. Love is not something you say, it's something you do by staying in contact with\na person, visiting, communicating, asking questions and answering them. You will remember that in\nthe 16 years that I lived in California, Barbara only visited me one time. In the 11 years that I have\nlived in New York, she has never visited me.<br/>\nIn spite of the fact that it is always the parent's responsibility to guide their relationship with their\nchildren, on several occasions I have gone beyond the call of duty to visit her. But I will never make\nsuch an effort again.\n</p><p>The crux of my problem with Barbara comes from two sources. The first is <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bob\" title=\"Bob\">Bob</a>'s bitter influence on her, which worked to separate our relationship just as Bob did with his own children with whom he has no association. In nearly 44 years of life, I have never met a meaner or more reprehensible <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)\" title=\"wikipedia:Republican Party (United States)\">Republican</a> cur than Bob Chandler. I hope that you will e-mail me <a href=\"/cwcki/September_2011\" title=\"September 2011\">when he dies</a> so that I can celebrate. Our mutual hatred has never been a secret, and it points out Barbara's proclivity to isolate herself via scurrilous mates. \n</p><p>The second and more compelling issue that permanently ruined my relationship with Barbara is the litany of lies she tells anyone who'll listen about the identity of my biological father and about her marriage history. \n</p><p>After lying to me about the identity of my father, Barbara refused to come clean and disclose the truth on the eve on my wedding. This might not sound much to you, but I assure you that I spent 15 years attempting to track down my real father with no help from the one person who could clear the air with a few words, your mother. \n</p><p>As it turns out, Barbara was never married to the man she swore was my real father (Jack Dale Smithey) and to whom she said she was married, but she was married to Ran Coleman Yeatts, a man who visited us when I was a child and who was always introduced as a \"friend.\" I think the fact that Ran's middle name is \"Coleman\" tells you all you need to know about the true identity of my father. Realize here the double lie that Barbara told about who she had been married to. It's an example of pathological behavior. \n</p><p>Even in their handling of you when you were a child left alone everyday for years by an unfit baby sitter, Barbara and Bob proved themselves to be careless parents. Everyday of our lives, you and I both pay a price for our parents' selfishness. Bob and Barbara pay a bigger price. They are the lonely and tortured people that they imagined their enemies to be. That is a curse that I would not wish on my worst enemy, especially not my own family. \n</p><p>Yes, I have a great life living in New York City, seeing six movies a week and interviewing my heroes. I live with a wonderful women named Katherine, whose family treats me like one of their own. I play guitar in a Jazz combo every Wednesday night. I spend two weeks out of every year on the French Riviera at the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes_Film_Festival\" title=\"wikipedia:Cannes Film Festival\">Cannes Film Festival</a>, and two weeks in California every <a href=\"/cwcki/Christmas\" title=\"Christmas\">Christmas</a> with Katherine's family. I have everything that I have ever wanted except a mother's love. \n</p><p>The moral of the story here is that just because someone is a mother does not mean that they are automatically a good person or that they are capable of acting as a parent. When Barbara thinks of me every single day of her life, just as I think about her, she may not regret the many wasted days of opportunity she had to share a relationship with her first son. But she does regret the fact that the opportunity will never come again. The best she can hope for is to read every word that I write, in search of clues that will never come.\n</p><p>If you want a kick, Google my name and you'll see some of the many newspapers that run my stuff.\n</p><p>Go ahead and send your <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/DVD\" title=\"DVD\">DVD</a> to my address listed below.
