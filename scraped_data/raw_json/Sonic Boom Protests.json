While everyone else was posting on <a href=\"/cwcki/Facebook\" title=\"Facebook\">Facebook</a> about less important political concerns, Chris decided that the most important cause of the time was protesting <a href=\"/cwcki/Sega\" title=\"Sega\">Sega</a>'s decision to make <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog\" title=\"Sonic the Hedgehog\">Sonic</a>'s arms blue (as opposed to the usual tan color) in  <i>Sonic Boom</i>, a <i>non-canon</i> spin-off series. Chris was so passionate about this supposed defamation of his favorite video game character that he went so far as to write incoherent, rambling letters to Sega, throw tantrums about it on Facebook, <a href=\"/cwcki/Death_threats\" title=\"Death threats\">threaten the lives</a> of Sega employees, glitterbomb Sega's American HQ, and even physically assault retail staff. His angry, incoherent letters to Sega clearly show that Chris's <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">prolonged estrangement from reality</a> could reach new heights, and that concepts such as civility, moderation and channeling <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_anger\" title=\"Chris and anger\">anger</a> in any way that doesn't involve ranting like a child throwing a tantrum are by now completely alien concepts to Chris, or at least go out the window whenever he's annoyed. Unfortunately, unlike previous bouts of anger where Chris would film himself or take to social media to rage at his target, in this instance, he decided to take a hands-on approach to it by vandalizing copies of <i>Sonic Boom</i> wherever he saw them. When GameStop employees rightfully tried to make him leave the store, he agreed to walk out, but only after <a href=\"/cwcki/26_December_2014\" title=\"26 December 2014\">brandishing his can of mace and spraying it at one poor employee's shirt</a>.\n</p><p>At first, it was unclear whether Chris would boycott <i>Sonic Boom</i> or just buy the games and watch the show like the <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_brand_loyalty\" title=\"Chris and brand loyalty\">consumerist lemming</a> he is. Given his irrational hatred and acts of vandalism towards otherwise available games, the former seemed more likely. On 13 <a href=\"/cwcki/January_2015\" title=\"January 2015\">January 2015</a>, it was <a href=\"/cwcki/Kiwi_Farms\" title=\"Kiwi Farms\">revealed</a> that he owned copies of the games. Chris said that they were sent to him by <a href=\"/cwcki/Catherine\" title=\"Catherine\">Catherine</a>.\n</p><p>Why Chris has such a bizarre distaste for such a minor, insignificant detail in the first place is still up for speculation. It could simply be some <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">overly-attached</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Manchester_High_School\" title=\"Manchester High School\">nostalgia</a> to the 'original' Sonic the Hedgehog, or possibly some inner-venting for his own <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\">failed franchise</a>. Whatever the reason, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_mental_healthcare\" title=\"Chris and mental healthcare\">it certainly isn't healthy for Chris, given his current state</a>. In other words, this makes the superficial reactions to Godzilla supposedly getting \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Obesity\" title=\"Obesity\">fatter</a>\" in the 2014 movie, or the new designs for the lightsabers in <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Star_Wars\" title=\"Star Wars\">Star Wars</a>: The Force Awakens</i>, seem simple and quaint in comparison. At least he isn't complaining about Sonic's green eyes?\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Protests\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Protests</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Blarms_Backstory\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Blarms Backstory</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Oh_Noes,_It's_Got_a_Second_Season!\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Oh Noes, It's Got a Second Season!</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Spreading_the_Good_Word\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Spreading the Good Word</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Greatest_Mistake_Ever\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Greatest Mistake Ever</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Pickle_Joke\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Pickle Joke</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#For_Christ's_and_God's_Sake\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">For Christ's and God's Sake</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#E-mail_to_SEGA\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">E-mail to SEGA</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#The_Forces_of_CWCville_Besiege_GameStop\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The Forces of CWCville Besiege GameStop</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Sonic_Boom_for_Christmas\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.9</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Sonic Boom for Christmas</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#Chris_(Still)_Blames_Everyone_Else_for_His_Problems_(Wait,_Did_We_Say_Still?_We_Meant_Always)\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.10</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris (Still) Blames Everyone Else for His Problems (Wait, Did We Say Still?

In December he offered the following chronology:\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>3 December 2014\n<p>I have just received a question from one of my girl friends: \"So, I'm curious, where did you hear about this blue-armed Sonic Issue? Is it something you discovered on your own, or is it a bigger issue in the Sonic community?\"\n</p><p>To best answer this question, and to VERY MUCH my visual dismay and further recollection: I HAVE been feeling this SINCE Last February. I needed to search for the ONE Announcement Trailer Video of the DAMN TV Show. I Remember finding it for myself on either Facebook through SEGA's feed, or on YouTube through the video recommendations, on my laptop, as we were moving into the temporary house. I felt UTTER Shock at the sight of the Blue Arms on Sonic immediately as I watched it for the first time that day in Early February, 2014; This Year.\n</p><p>I was too busy and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress\" title=\"Stress\">stressed</a> from collecting as much as possible from the burnt house, and bringing them either to our Storage Unit, and this house's basement\n</p><p>I had not thought about the issue much, UNTIL Last June or July with the E3 Trailers being presented on the SEGA and Sonic Facebook Pages! Since Then, I have continuously protested the Blue Arms by commenting and messaging them that \"Sonic's Arms are NOT Blue!!!\" And among which, I have Warned Them that this sort of thing would NOT end well for them, and it was, and still is, a Very Bad Idea!!!\n</p><p>So, in short: I watched the damn trailer last February, I felt Pissed Off Then, I relearned about it last June or July: I Still felt Very Pissed Off, and NOW I am continually Growing and GROWING More Angry and PISSED OFF AT SEGA, NINTENDO AND CARTOON NETWORK AND EVERYONE ELSE INVOLVED THERE!!!\n</p><p>I have Contacted SEGA and Commented NUMEROUSLY with MONTHS worth of time. They ignored me, Not Responded or Done Anything about it at all, and therefore the time for Talk IS LONG DONE AND OVERWITH!!! AND WE NEED ACTION UPON SEGA AND SONIC BOOM NOW MORE THAN EVER!!!\n</p><p>Thank you.\n</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_A3e2bl334\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>For all the agitation and violence, Chris has never clearly explained exactly <i>why</i> this particular alteration to this particular cartoon character makes him so furious. The closest he came to explaining his confrontational stance was in a June Facebook post:\n</p>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">I only just heard and seen the ugly change a few weeks ago, and I had too many other <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress\" title=\"Stress\">stresses</a> going on to act earlier.\n<p>Why do I feel this way?\n</p><p>The same reason why many people feel <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_race\" title=\"Chris and race\">Michael Jackson should</a><a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\"> not have had to </a><a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_race\" title=\"Chris and race\">change his color</a>.

Like many autistic people, Chris is very resistant to change, especially when it is forced upon him. Chris would not change (“commit suicide”) even in the face of tremendous hardship. Sonic, however, was forced to change for trivial reasons such as appealing to a broader audience. Sonic has been Chris’s lifelong hero with whom he identifies strongly, so he has taken this injustice very personally. Unfortunately, he falsely assumes that countless millions feel the same way.\n</p><p>At other times, however, Chris has latched onto the idea that the blue arms cause him \"sensory overload.\" <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sensory_Overload\" title=\"Sensory Overload\">Sensory overload</a> is a broad term simply meaning that the body reacts to overstimulation of a sense, but in autistics it generally refers to an abstract, specific sensory stimulus (such as blue arms) which the autistic person is simply unable to stand. However, if sensory overload were a real issue, all he would need to do is avoid <i>Sonic Boom</i>. Chris has never before complained about sensory overload, and damningly has gone so far as to <i>draw blue-armed hedgehogs himself</i> such as <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_art\" title=\"Chris and art\">some depictions</a> of <a href=\"/cwcki/Bubbles_Rosechu\" title=\"Bubbles Rosechu\">Bubbles Rosechu</a>. The truth is that Chris either believes that Sega is abusing his best friend, or he is using his <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">autism</a> as an attempt to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_the_industry\" title=\"Chris and the industry\">manipulate the intentions of a multi-billion dollar worth company.</a>\n</p><p>Since the change to Sonic's arm color isn't the only element of the redesign, or even the most obvious one, it's anyone's guess as to why that was the aspect Chris chose to focus his ire on. Nor was this the first time Sonic was redesigned: the previous instance was all the way back in the 1990s, where the Blue Blur was given a \"more mature\" new design during the lead-up to the release of <i>Sonic Adventure</i>. Moreover, unlike the <i>Boom</i> redesign (which was done for an alternate continuity and had no effect on the main canon), the <i>Adventure</i> redesign affected virtually all <i>Sonic</i> media going forward. Yet there's no evidence Chris reacted nearly as badly in this case; indeed, to the contrary, it was the gift of a Sega Dreamcast and a copy of <i>Sonic Adventure</i> that reignited his interest in the franchise. In light of all this, Chris's bizarre hatred of Sonic's blue arms looks even more inexplicable and inconsistent than it already did.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Oh_Noes.2C_It.27s_Got_a_Second_Season.21\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Oh_Noes,_It's_Got_a_Second_Season!\">Oh Noes, It's Got a Second Season!</span></h3>\n<p>After discovering that the TV series was renewed for a second season, Chris posted on Facebook to complain about it again.\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>5 December 2014\n<p>A Second Season of the ‪#‎SonicBoom‬ show with those, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress_sigh\" title=\"Stress sigh\">UGH!!!</a>, Blue Arms?!!!
