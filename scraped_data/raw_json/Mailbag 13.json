Each letter does the minimum required amount of ass-kissing to get Chris's attention before launching a battery of questions that the trolls have been curious about.\n</p><p>Chris answered the letters in this mailbag in the very early hours of 10 December 2009. Surprisingly, he actually managed to provide full answers to almost all the questions asked, only occasionally veering off topic to talk about video game betas or shout at his Sysop in bolded all caps.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Answered\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Answered</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Dinosaurs_with_evolution_rights,_and_some_Brotherly_Love\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Dinosaurs with evolution rights, and some Brotherly Love</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#My_brain_feels_like_a_bomb,_night_and_day._It_must_expand!\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">My brain feels like a bomb, night and day.

The crew on my ship loves to read it, and the adventures of that Electric Hedgehog Poke'mon have inspired us all! My personal favorite character is <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Wild\" title=\"Wild\">Wild</a> Sonichu. \n</p><p>I have a few questions that I'd like to ask you, though...\n</p><p>1. Which theory do you align yourself with, evolution or intelligent design? Most Christians believe that the theory of evolution is nothing but myth, but your comic seems to be pro-evolution. Is this true?\n</p><p>2. What is your current relationship with your brother, <a href=\"/cwcki/Cole_Smithey\" title=\"Cole Smithey\">Cole Smithey</a>? I've always enjoyed reading his film reviews, so it was certainly a surprise to find out that you two are related.\n</p><p>3. If God loves us all, then why is there so much suffering in the world? Why are you made fun of so much? Why are there homos and dykes in the world? If all of these things go against God's will, then why do they exist?\n</p><p>4. Whatever happened to your gal pal, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chloe\" title=\"Chloe\">Chloe</a>? I remember you mentioning her in a video a while ago, but she just disappeared after that.\n</p><p>5. How can you justify Rosechu's behavior in Issue No. 8 of your comic? What is it that <a href=\"/cwcki/Jason_Kendrick_Howell\" title=\"Jason Kendrick Howell\">Jason Kendrick Howell</a> did that was so bad... draw a picture of <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu\" title=\"Rosechu\">Rosechu</a> with a <a href=\"/cwcki/Pickle\" title=\"Pickle\">pickle</a>? You clain to be \"patriotic\" and that you \"love America\" (even though you <a href=\"/cwcki/Mumble_7#Summary\" title=\"Mumble 7\">don't know the words of the National Anthem</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Twin_Falling_Towers\" title=\"Twin Falling Towers\">mock national tragedies</a>), yet you act as is someone creating a parodic image is like an abomination of God. In your mind, is having one's head shoved up an Electric Hedgehog Poke'mon's <a href=\"/cwcki/China\" title=\"China\">vagina</a> and then electricuted the correct punishment for drawing a picture?\n</p><p>I look forward to reading Issue No. 10... keep up the good work, Christian!\n</p><p>Your fan,\n</p><p>Charles\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Thank you for your support. To your first question, <a href=\"/cwcki/Honor_roll\" title=\"Honor roll\">I am in support of both theories equally.</a> God made the Big Bang, then created the Garden of Eden to start, but outside the garden was where the dinosaurs roamed. The dinosaurs, and the other creatures, had to begin in their own way, so God gave them the evolution rights, whereas in the garden, he went to the point \"B\" of the final creature/human creations. To put it another way, within the garden were his final ideas, and all those outside of the garden were all that were to be made the final ideas being made from scratch. It's like drawing the plans for a house; the plans is comparable to the garden, but to make the actual house, you would have to start from scratch.\n<p>Cole and I have not communicated with each other for years; he does not care much for <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Barb\" title=\"Barb\">our mother</a>, whereas I love our mother, so therein is the difference that has made the conflict between him and me. I do not know for sure, but I can imagine they are here as a challenge for us to cope with. If we didn't have these events/people, this world would be boring. I'm not sure who you are referring to, I currently have no recollection of a Chloe. Rosechu was standing up for <a href=\"/cwcki/Women%27s_rights\" title=\"Women's rights\">Women's Lib and Rights</a>, and they have the right to object to being portrayed so wrongfully; I agree fully.\n</p><p>--<a href=\"/cwcki/User:ChrisChanSonichu\" title=\"User:ChrisChanSonichu\">ChrisChanSonichu</a> 06:48, 10 December 2009 (CET)\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3><span id=\"My_brain_feels_like_a_bomb.2C_night_and_day._It_must_expand.21\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"My_brain_feels_like_a_bomb,_night_and_day._It_must_expand!\">My brain feels like a bomb, night and day.

I've grown to appreciate it a great deal, and being an avid reader, I would like to enjoy more books like it!\n</p><p>I absolutely love books of all forms. Some of my favorite authors include Tim Dorsey, Max Barry, GK Chesterson, Robert W. Chambers, Mark Z. Danielewski, and of course, Christian Weston Chandler! :) But I'm curious to know what you like, or what you find particularly inspiring. So I gotta ask:\n</p><p>1.) What books or authors would you say influenced your writing the most? I know you're a fan of RL Stine's work, but are there any others?\n</p><p>2.) What books would you recommend to your fans? Again, I know you enjoy the collective works of RL Stine and <u><a href=\"/cwcki/How_to_Talk_to_Girls\" title=\"How to Talk to Girls\">How to Talk to Girls</a></u> by Alec Greven. What else do you enjoy?\n</p><p>3.) Have other mediums inspired your writing style? For example, I love the storytelling of Gochi Suda (Who wrote the story for games like Contact and Killer7). Are there any TV, Film, or Video game writers that influenced how you tell your stories?\n</p><p>4.) A little bit off topic, but a lot of great writers crave variety, and like to occasionally take a break from their established work and focus on telling a completely new story that's totally disconnected from their prior work. Do you plan on telling any stories with nothing to do with Sonichu, Rosechu, or anybody else from CWCville VA?\n</p><p>Please be as in depth as possible, as I really love your work, and want to know as many of your inspirations as I can! :D\n</p><p>Thanks a bunch, and have a great day!\n</p><p>--Gabe Syme\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Thank you.

I'm a 16-year-old Sonichu fan from Finland.\n</p><p>I've got some questions:\n</p><p>1) I just saw you were looking for sponsors from Europe. I don't like the horrible horrible ads either! I might help! Me and my best friend have €1000 in savings. We were going to buy PS3s (I think they go for about €500 these days, if it's less, we'd buy some games too). Do you think we should buy the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PS3\" title=\"PS3\">PS3s</a>? I mean, we don't have any other new consoles right now, just old GameCube and PS 1 and GBAs. Or should I spend it on the ad space?\n</p><p>2) These Sonichu games you had mentioned sound awesome. Can you tell us more about what you planned for them? I know they've got Sonichu and Rosechu and other characters, but what kind of games they are? Are they like Sonic 3D games? Or are they more like Pokemon? Or are they something between (like how Sonichu is between Sonic and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Pokemon\" title=\"Pokemon\">Pokemon</a>)? Are they action games or RPGs? Or maybe even Action RPGs?\n</p><p>3) <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Metal_Sonichu\" title=\"Metal Sonichu\">Metal Sonichu</a> was awesome! (I mostly liked him because the metal characters are awesome in SSB Melee) Will he ever return from the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Moon\" title=\"Moon\">Moon</a>?

Whatever your decision, I am still thankful for kind and considerate people like you two.\n<p>The games would be both; the Pok'emon Lightning Version would be obviously an RPG, whereas <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu%27s_Adventure\" title=\"Sonichu's Adventure\">Sonichu's Adventure</a> and CWC's <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Adult_Chronicles\" title=\"Adult Chronicles\">Adult Chronicles</a> would be 3D Adventures.

So it was very interesting to see that you've studied engineering and drafting! And it shows in the Comic! That's why the Comic is so interesting! And I see you've put a lot of effort to the architecture of the CWCville!\n</p><p>But I'd like to know a bit more of the CWCville and the Mall that is featured in the Comic, if you don't mind.\n</p><p>Putting a Mayoral Office in a Mall was pretty innovative! I've not heard of anything like that. You can imagine my surprise, because here, municipal buildings (like City Halls) and business buildings are strictly separate! Is it common in America to have Mayoral Offices in Shopping Malls? If it is unusual in America too - and I guess it could be - how did you come up with such an interesting Plan?\n</p><p>And who owns the CWCville Mall? Here, we have some Government-Owned Enterprises, but I have heard they're quite rare in America. If the Mayoral Office is based in the Mall, does the City own the mall, or have they rented the office space? There must be some special Arrangements in place, right?\n</p><p>As I said, I'm not yet an Architect, but I have made some City Plans. Have you made more detailed City Plans of CWCville? The ones in the Comic are not very detailed, but it would be fun to see a more detailed City Plan.\n</p><p>-*- Bert -*-\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Smart decision on studying building designs and structures, and I thank you for your compliments.
