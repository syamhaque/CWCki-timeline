And I'm lookin' forward to meeting you all there buuuut- [<i>lowers artwork and momentarily raises finger to chin </i>] though I am partially set up, I'm gonna need like a <i>few</i> more dollars to make sure I'm still covered for <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Toys\" title=\"Toys\">everything else I'm gonna need</a> over the lovely weekend. <i>Lovely weekend</i>. \n</p><p>Anyway, so, I got a lovely gu- got a <a href=\"/cwcki/Null\" title=\"Null\">lovely guy</a> who's helping me out.

And he's gonna do a very good job; I have faith in this guy- I have faith in 'im. Hey, I wouldn't throw a <a href=\"/cwcki/Kiwi_Farms\" title=\"Kiwi Farms\">kiwi</a> at him or anything.\n</p><p>But anyway, aside from that, I got everything mostly prepared like I said, so yeah. I got my gaiter in case I need to [<i>covers mouth with hand</i>] <i>cover up</i>. But I got the most important ticket- this convention ticket [<i>briefly raises lanyard with a <a href=\"/cwcki/COVID-19\" title=\"COVID-19\">COVID-19</a> vaccination record card on it, and a note beneath it reading \"She/Her pronouns\"</i>] so, only if I reeeally need to.

Mm.\n</p><p>Anyway, so, EVERFREE NORTHWEST is gonna be whole bunch of individuals and whatnot- artists and wha- and anybody- everybody from the brony community. It is IN-<b>persooooon</b>! Amongst the very, very first in-person convention since the frickin' pandemic resonated and started a couple of Novembers ago or so. Anyway, it's gonna be an awesome time. I'm lookin' forward to meeting everybody, seeing the ol' favorite celeb- old favorite people that I like- you know, from my favorite- Alice and other people I've gotten to know over the past year or two- through their videos, binging 'em and whatnot. Got a few more favorites in mind. And just lookin' forward to meetin' all of you- all of you lovely people who are gonna be there. My fans and art appreciators and aficionaaados and everything. But yeah, I'm approachable. Hugs are free. Only making sure you're fully vaccinated though, so [<i>raises vaccine card again</i>] mm- make sure you show the guys at the door your convention ticket.\n'\nSo aside from that, yeah. I need a <i><b>few bucks</b></i>. Like a few <i><b>extra thousand</b></i> to help me [<i>itches nose</i>] with the weekend. [<i>itches nose some more</i>] I'm sorry, I had an i- I really have an itch on my nose- this is <i>not</i> a body language or anything, I wanna emphasize that clearly. But yeah, for food, for additional details and transportation and a hotel- <i>additional details</i>, mind you- and just, whatever else- whatever else and... yeeeah, a little bit of swag, I wanna be able to share some of this- share a little bit for the arts as well. Hey, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_art\" title=\"Chris and art\">I'm an artist</a>, and I appreciate and support <i>all</i> other artists. Okay? They're insightful. They're linked to the other <a href=\"/cwcki/Dimensions\" title=\"Dimensions\">dimensions</a> as much as I am, if not... on matching levels, cuz, I'm overpowered, obviously. But anyway, so, <i>Everfree Northwest!</i>... Um... I'm tryna remember the dates in my noggin right now, but- it's the ssssecond weekend in August, so, I'm hopin' to see y'all there, and I'm lookin' forward to meeting such lovely new people and seeing lovely old people again- I don't mean old as in elderly, though they need compassion and respect, too, mind you. [<i>sighs</i>]\n</p><p>But aside from that, Everfree Northwest. Come on down and give me a hand to get there, please. I am heavy at work at this time, so... At this time, but at the convention I'm gonna have a good time and I'm gonna be even more busy. I'm lookin' forward to seein' y'all there! I'd like a hand!

Christine / Chris / Chris-Chan is considered one of the most documented people in human history thanks to enormous volumes of online encyclopedias written about Chris and Sonichu, a comic series that Chris has worked on since highschool. This documentation started during the early years of the Internet and never stopped. Chris also really likes MLP, and has been a fan since 2007: many years before it was popularized in Gen 4.\n<p><br/>\nChris already has tickets and a hotel reservation, but has never traveled cross-country before. This is organized by Joshua Moon. I have been in light contact with Chris for about 7 years and have previously helped Chris deal with serious problems in that time.\n</p><p><br/>\nOriginally, Chris planned to make the 41-hour-long journey from Ruckersville, VA to Seattle, WA alone, crossing the badlands and Rocky Mountains both ways in an old minivan. That was a very bad idea, so instead, we're setting up a GoFundMe to help buy a plane ticket.\n</p><p><br/>\nThe roundtrip flight will cost $750 and has already been reserved. Extra money will be put towards expenses while in Seattle. If the GoFundMe greatly exceeds $1000, the overflow will be held for emergencies.\n</p><p><br/>\nTo reward contributors, <b>Chris has agreed to do shout out videos and drawings for donors.</b> I have been assured that these will be done and have stressed to Chris that completing these rewards is crucial to doing more things like this in the future. There is an understanding and I have confidence rewards will be completed.\n</p><p><br/>\n<b>Any$</b> - Your name will be read out on a thank-you video after the GFM is concluded.\n</p><p><b>$40</b> - Shout out video from Chris\n</p><p><b>$40</b> - Character drawing.\n</p><p><b>$60</b> - Both a shout out video from Chris and a character drawing.\n</p><p>If you would like a drawing mailed to you, please add <b>$5</b> extra for shipping and handling.\n</p><p><br/>\nChris did a drawing for me. Here's an example of what you might get:\n</p><p><br/>\n<a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:July9Artwork.jpg\"><img alt=\"July9Artwork.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"169\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/7/77/July9Artwork.jpg/300px-July9Artwork.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/7/77/July9Artwork.jpg/450px-July9Artwork.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/7/77/July9Artwork.jpg/600px-July9Artwork.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a>\n</p><p><br/>\nPlease keep in mind that while I can make sure every order is fulfilled, what you receive may not be what you expect. Your shoutout / drawing could exceed your expectations, fall short, or be something totally weird and unpredictable. Chris is just like that: roll with it.\n</p><p><br/>\nThank you for your help in sending Chris out to have fun and for furthering Chris's childhood dreams of becoming a professional artist.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Update_1\">Update 1</span></h3>\n<p>Null later posted an update to the campaign shortly after it had reached its $1,000 goal.\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Thank you for your support in sending Chris to Everfree NW.
