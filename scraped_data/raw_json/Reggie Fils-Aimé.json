President of Nintendo of America</b> from <b>Reggie Fils-Aimé</b> to <b>Chris</b> on 28 January 2009 1:16 AM\n<hr/>\n<p>But right now, I'm just strictly Reggie. I'm not going to even bother sending this through my Nintendo email address. Because you know what? This isn't business. This is strictly personal. I have something to say to you, and you need to listen. This has nothing to do with Nintendo right now, this is just me and you. Mano e mano. Man to man. I don't normally do this, but hell, I just need to get this off my chest.\n</p><p>If you don't know who I am, then allow me to introduce myself. My name is Reggie Fils-Aime. I've been kicking ass and taking names ever since the E3 expo at <a href=\"/cwcki/2004\" title=\"2004\">2004</a> where I made my debut, where from then on I eventually earned my position as president of this company.\n</p><p>I'm known to be a loud mouth. I don't take crap from anyone. So if you are easily offended, I suggest you stop reading. But don't worry, I'll try to go easy on you, key word being \"try\" here.\n</p><p>But with that out of the way, I just want to say something to you personally.\n</p><p>May I kindly ask, what the hell is wrong with you? Are you for real or what? I was there for everything. I saw Miyamoto waiting for up to 2 days in the bitter cold for you to show up and you stood him up. I was even there trying to arrange everything for you, even setting up someone to escort you to our building complete with bodyguards and full security because I knew you were concerned about safety. And for what? So you could just NOT show up? I mean, I don't even know what to think, it's just completely unbelievable.\n</p><p>I'm sorry but it just is. I heard what you said to Mr Miyamoto too, your reasons for not coming. And I just have to say. How old are you? You're 27, if I'm not mistaken right?\n</p><p>27! I mean, think about it, you are almost 30! What is a man of your age still doing being coddled by his parents? Let me tell you, when I was about your age, I was already married and had children!\n</p><p>Your autism isn't an excuse either. I've raised a son with autism who is far worse functioning than you are and he can easily make his own decisions. The only thing I see here is a person who is not only lazy and makes excuses, but cannot even take charge of his own life.\n</p><p>That right there is what made it pretty clear that there is no chance in hell you're going to get anywhere with this project. Nevermind the fact that your parents didn't want you to go (or that you still have to get your parents permission at your age).\n</p><p>Think about what happened if you did go, and you had to ask mommy and daddy for an OK on everything? Imagine what a complete disaster that would be. I mean, listen. Simply put, you are not fit to do business with us as you are not even in a position where you can make your own decisions, which is vital to survive in the workplace, and even life in general.\n</p><p>I mean, seriously, who the hell were we talking to? I don't know about you. But this deal was about Nintendo and you. This was not the deal between Nintendo and the parents of Christian Weston Chandler.\n</p><p>I'm sorry, but provided that this whole thing you pulled on us wasn't an elaborate prank, this project was doomed from the start. It's just completely ridiculous. It is impossible for anyone to do business with someone who still has to rely on their parents to make their decisions.\n</p><p>Right now, I don't see how anything good could come from any of this. The only way I could even see this going anywhere is if you were to somehow learn to become independent, like a person of your age should be, and try to do something so that you don't rely on your parents to decide things for you.\n</p><p>But I don't see that happening ever in the near future (nor is it really my job to even have to tell you this). And because of that, I don't see how you'll ever be able to do business with us.\n</p><p>And you know what? I'll just leave it at that. Also, forget recieving a letter from us (and for what? So your parents can read it out loud to you? For Christ sake). This whole thing is through.\n</p><p>Our company will gladly deal with people who are up to the task. But we cannot waste valuable time and money on children who have no means of actually doing their part (their part, as in not their parents but \"their part\") to cooeprate with us.\n</p><p>Sorry for the rant, but you've wasted so much of our time, money and effort that I had to personally do what I'm known for, and that is kicking ass and taking names.\n</p><p>I always tell it like it is, and I'll be damned if I ever change that. So consider this as the final notice, this whole thing is through. It was through as soon as you made it clear that you are not mature enough to do business with us.\n</p><p>Other than that, I have nothing more to add. Please feel free to complain about me not being professional, I get that all the time. But nobody ever doubts my ability to tell people the things they need to hear. And what I just told you is nothing but that.\n</p><p>Sincerely,\n</p><p>The man who has been kicking ass and taking names since <a href=\"/cwcki/2004\" title=\"2004\">2004</a>.\n</p><p>Reggie Fils-Aime\n<br/>President\n<br/>Nintendo of America\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Well, it is good to make your acquaintance, Reggie. I have viewed your <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Music\" title=\"wikipedia:Wii Music\">WiiMusic</a> Tip Video on my Wii recently, and your introduction basically expanded my knowledge of you personally. Allow me to offer my congratulations on you becoming President of N.O.A.; last I heard, from snail-mail exchange, y'all had a woman for a president (I can't recall her name at the moment), so for my knowledge now. :)\n<p>In response to your message, let me say that I deserved that; it was as shocking as Mr. Resetti in <a href=\"/cwcki/Animal_Crossing\" title=\"Animal Crossing\">Animal Crossing</a>, but in the sense of personally expressing yourself, I mean the comparison as genuinely a positive compliment.\n</p><p>I feel Truly, Deepest Sorry for missing the appointment; I have made the mistake of not being clear in the fact of my being unable to make the trip, and trying to compensate with sending myself via snail-mail (in a sense). As much as it was due to the lack of support from my family, I Could Not afford the Travel Fare to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Redmond\" title=\"Redmond\">Redmond</a> in the first place. I am considered compusive with handling money, and since the first notice of the business between me and Mr. Miyamoto came up Mid-January, I felt like I was \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bob_walks_in\" title=\"Bob walks in\">caught with my pants down</a>\". I had spent my last amount of money from <a href=\"/cwcki/Monthly_tugboat\" title=\"Monthly tugboat\">my Social</a> that I get every month to pay rent to my family, make payments on my Credit Card Bills, and even after that, I would have had only a hundred or so left over, and I had already compulsively spent that on the day I got the money on a couple of games. I feel at fault for not controling my compulsiveness enough to save a hundred at a time months before.\n</p><p>Then there is the mixture of Ligitimate business e-mail, from you all for example, and e-mails from <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Internet\" title=\"Internet\">Internet</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">Trolls</a>/Bullies/<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Impostor\" title=\"Impostor\">Impostors</a>, and among the chaos and confusion, I felt out of sorts, even the moments when I felt calmed down after a time from the stress. And my mother and father felt at unease amongst that confusion as well. Even when I put it up to my friends at my church; the same thing; they thought I was talking to an impostor, posing as Mr. Miyamoto. But after I received the automated e-mail from donotreply@noa.nintendo.com verifying Mr. Miyamoto's e-mail address as legitimate, I felt MOST Confident that I was dealing with the real Miyamoto. And yet, even after presenting the printout of that e-mail, everyone was still in doubt.\n</p><p>I have made great effort to seek local aid to fund me for the trip to Redmond, but unfortunately, I failed. It was heavily advised that I have the business between me and Miyamoto hand-written on Paper sent to me to present to my Attorney. Also, considering the rumors were Flying Heavily among the Internet Troll Population, if I had made the trip, I felt I might have been heavily physically harmed by those <a href=\"/cwcki/Death_threats\" title=\"Death threats\">vicious people</a>.\n</p><p>I will not disagree with the accusations of my emotions. Even though my family are of Great Business Expierences (let me also mention that my father, Mr. <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bob\" title=\"Bob\">Robert Franklin Chandler, Jr.</a>, while working at G.E. (<a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Electric\" title=\"wikipedia:General Electric\">General Electric</a>) has designed the Controls for the Plastic Molding Machines, so without him, we would not have anything Plastic as simple as a Funnel, or even the casing for the NES), I feel that I personally lack heavy business expierences that I would require. Due to my mental block, I feel that I would require someone to speak for me in the beginning of a Heavy amount of Business. They also gave me a small amount of the words that were typed to Mr. Miyamoto, especially the requests for the advance in travel fare so I could have made the trip. While <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_money\" title=\"Chris and money\">I personally understand the economical situations</a> prohibiting the advance, my family, as well as the Majority of my Church's Congregation, disagree. With that one bit of green absent from being advanced, it set the Ground for the locally popular disbelief in my talking to Mr. Miyamoto.\n</p><p>If I did have the money advanced to me for the trip, my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Mother\" title=\"Mother\">escort</a> and I would have Most Definitely made the flight.\n</p><p>Believe me, I have been feeling the worst stress from my being unable to afford the trip, my attempt to compensate with the CD-R and DVD-R failing badly, having to cover-up in online discussions for my family and local friends' HUGE concern for my safety and health, and worst of all the shame I feel from all the stress.\n</p><p>I sincerely meant no harm, hostile behavior, or anything major like that from the words I have spoken, written and typed so far in this business transaction.\n</p><p>I Truly Want to Continue with the Sonichu Projects, because I require a brighter future to set me in good standings with my future wife and my future daughter, <a href=\"/cwcki/Crystal_Weston_Chandler_(daughter)\" title=\"Crystal Weston Chandler (daughter)\">Crystal Weston Chandler</a> (God promised her to me in a multiple of <a href=\"/cwcki/Dreams\" title=\"Dreams\">Dreams</a>). So, I respectfully ask you to NOT Cancel it. With the Paper Documents Snail-Mailed to me, my efforts to save money for the trip, convincing my family, friends and attorney, getting my act well-prepared and well-together, and my Female <a href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart\" title=\"Sweetheart\">Sweetheart</a> by my side (she's <a href=\"/cwcki/PandaHalo\" title=\"PandaHalo\">on her way to me from Australia</a>), I, <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler\">Christian Weston Chandler</a>, will Truly Feel that I can Tackle the Project Head-On.\n</p><p>I appreciate your time and paitence, Reggie.

I apologize for yelling at you, but if you know me, I am a guy who doesn't pull his punches. Let me tell you. They call me the most feared man in the game's industry, the \"man who kicks ass and takes names.\" That Mr. Resetti comparison was kind of accurate actually. I guess I do deserve that title.\n<p>But I just have to be honest with you. I don't think you're ready for any of this. You seem to have a lot of issues in your life that you need to take care of before you can do business with anyone. I think right now Nintendo is the LEAST of your worries.\n</p><p>I mean, compulsive spending, severe paranoia, friends and family who do not trust you, you having to get their permission to do anything despite almost being 30, relying on social security and taxpayer money to survive, and the list goes on and on.\n</p><p>I'm sure if you had a job, didn't live with your parents, and were a self made man like a person of your age ought to be, you'd have no problem making it here.\n</p><p>But from what you're telling me, you've got a lot of issues and things to take care of in your life before you could ever reach such a state, and I wonder right now if I'm asking for the impossible right now.\n</p><p>Until then, I don't see how this could go anywhere. We've wasted so much time and money on this project only to find out that the man we're dealing with still is being coddled by his parents and doesn't even have a job or money of his own (taxpayer social security money issued to you for food/clothing doesn't count, which you shouldn't be spending on games anyway) or anything of that sort to even come through with this.\n</p><p>That is why I'm so frustrated with any of this. It's just so ridiculous. I've never seen anything like it. I thought we were dealing with a grown man, a self made man who could make his own decisions and come through with this. But what you've shown us is anything but that.\n</p><p>Sort out your own life first. Don't worry about Nintendo. Maybe once you finally grow up to be independent, sort out all the things preventing you from coming, and maybe even be able to make your own decisions and in life, then maybe at that point we'll be able to do business with each other.\n</p><p>But until then, I doubt we'll see anything come out of this. And even if it does work out at the moment, I can't imagine you being anything other than a huge liability for us. Being an independent person who can make his or her own decisions is paramount to survive in the business world, especially in the games industry. We don't have time to babysit you.

The project is dead and buried and all <a href=\"/cwcki/Nintendo\" title=\"Nintendo\">Nintendo</a> employees have been told to never acknowledge that the project ever existed.<br/>\nI already told you before that the project was canceled due to your inaction. We will not accept any more unsolicited game suggestions or business requests from you. As we mentioned, Mr. Miyamoto does make occasional business trips to the U.S. (and your previous appointment, which has expired and been erased from memory, was one of those trips), but for now he is back in Japan where he usually spends the majority of his time.\n</p><p>Now that you have received the letter, consider the cancellation official. It was nice doing business with you, but we will not make any games or take any ideas you have into consideration nor will we make Sonichu the game or anything related to it.\n</p><p>Sincerely,<br/>\nReggie Fils-Aime<br/>\nPresident<br/>\nNintendo of America, Inc.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>And it is Official that YOU, Sir ARE an IMPOSTOR.
