Chris claims to have originally been provoked into his <a href=\"/cwcki/Love_Quest\" title=\"Love Quest\">Love Quest</a> after becoming <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_anger\" title=\"Chris and anger\">enraged</a> at seeing Sarah sitting on Wes's lap. Much like with <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Mary Lee Walsh</a>, this lead to a one sided blood feud with him, and he began to see Wes as a romantic rival and an enemy, even though Sarah saw Chris as nothing more than a friend and Wes himself probably barely even knew Chris as anything other than \"that weird <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">autistic</a> kid Sarah hangs out with\".\n</p><p>The trio of <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu\" title=\"Rosechu\">Rosechu</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Black_Sonichu\" title=\"Black Sonichu\">Black Sonichu</a> in Chris's early ideas before the comic started, existed to represent the \"hero, lover and rival\" triangle that Chris believed himself, Sarah and Wes to fulfill as well, with Chris <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">obviously</a> cast as the hero, and Wes as the villain. This is evident in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_%2B_Sarah%27s_Life-Shares\" title=\"Chris + Sarah's Life-Shares\">Chris + Sarah's Life-Shares</a> story, in which he represented himself and Sarah as Sonichu and Rosechu, and when Wes was brought up in passing, Chris included a drawing of Blake holding a magic wand and magician's hat, complete with helpful annotation pointing out that he was evil. Chris would later come up with unique Sonichu forms for himself, Wes and Sarah instead of using Sonichu, Rosechu and Blake as stand-ins, and these new Sonichu forms would go on to be featured in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\"><i>Sonichu</i> comics</a>.\n</p><p>Chris also included avatars of Wes in his homemade <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Animal_Crossing\" title=\"Animal Crossing\">Animal Crossing</a></i> and <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Yu-Gi-Oh!\" title=\"Yu-Gi-Oh!\">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></i> cards, for both his human form and his Sonichu form in each, (though in the <i>Yu-Gi-Oh!</i> cards the human Wes Iseli was just named as \"A <a href=\"/cwcki/JERKS\" title=\"JERKS\">Jerk</a>\").\n</p><p>Wes (under comic alias Walter Grisby) was mentioned in the infamous <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_Loses_It\" title=\"Chris Loses It\">Chris Loses It</a> video. In that video, Chris, after performing a spectacular act of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tard_rage\" title=\"Tard rage\">tard rage</a>, pretends to call Walter Grisby, asking him \"Who threw the frisbee?\", before yelling at the telephone and <a href=\"/cwcki/Category:Videos_with_Camera_Abuse\" title=\"Category:Videos with Camera Abuse\">throwing it</a> at the <a href=\"/cwcki/PSEye\" title=\"PSEye\">PSEye</a>.\n</p><p>Wes made an appearance on the TV series <i><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penn_%26_Teller:_Fool_Us\" title=\"wikipedia:Penn &amp; Teller: Fool Us\">Penn &amp; Teller: Fool Us</a></i> and successfully fooled them, on a season 7 episode aired on 6 <a href=\"/cwcki/July_2020\" title=\"July 2020\">July 2020</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"In_the_comic\">In the comic</span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:149px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Wls.PNG\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"256\" src=\"/w/images/2/28/Wls.PNG\" width=\"147\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Wls.PNG\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Wes-Li is pissed.</div></div></div>\n<p>As the author of the comic, when Chris first made <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_2\" title=\"Sonichu 2\">Sonichu #2</a> he was given the unique opportunity to <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">revise his personal history with Wes</a> at his leisure. Comic Wes differs from his real life counterpart in that whilst the real Wes Iseli broke up with Sarah, moved on, married another woman, probably forgot Chris ever existed and is now  <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcybvGOvmrY\" rel=\"nofollow\">running a charity which helps fight Parkinson's Disease</a>, Comic Wes appears to have <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_Ego\" title=\"Chris and his Ego\">held a grudge against Chris</a> ever since he first met him while he was dating Sarah, in spite of Chris having nothing he wanted and Wes having no reason to care about Chris.

Wes learned that he was the descendant of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Wasabi_Clan\" title=\"Wasabi Clan\">Wasabi Clan</a>, and upon gaining his powers his own ancestor implored him to take vengeance upon the <a href=\"/cwcki/Ancient_leader_of_the_Cherokee_Clan\" title=\"Ancient leader of the Cherokee Clan\">Ancient leader of the Cherokee Clan</a>, who was now Chris. Wes, knowing of Chris's jealousy towards him, accepts.\n</p><p>He later finds both Chris and <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a> out on the \"rough terrain\" just outside <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a>, and the two fight, not only over their current feud, but also over the Cherokee/Wasabi war in the ancient past, over the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Cherokian_Crown\" title=\"Cherokian Crown\">Cherokian Crown</a>. Wes grabs the crown out of thin air during the fight (implying he stole it from Chris, which was <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_writing\" title=\"Chris and writing\">never depicted</a>) and eventually the fight ends when Sarah appears and pins Wes against a tree with a lightning arrow, just as he was about to defeat Chris. Sarah breaks up with him, he whines a bit, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_hypocrisy\" title=\"Chris and hypocrisy\">Chris tells him to suck it up and move on</a>, and he then unites with Chris and Sarah to defeat the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golem\" title=\"wikipedia:golem\">golem</a> summoned by <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Mary Lee Walsh</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Count_Graduon\" title=\"Count Graduon\">Count Graduon</a>.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Sonichu05-P12.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"388\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/1/1a/Sonichu05-P12.jpg/300px-Sonichu05-P12.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/1/1a/Sonichu05-P12.jpg/450px-Sonichu05-P12.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/1/1a/Sonichu05-P12.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Sonichu05-P12.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Wes-Li Sonichu apparently <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_art\" title=\"Chris and art\">grows to about 20 feet tall</a>, does an <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_G._Robinson\" title=\"wikipedia:Edward G.

Despite ostensibly not wanting to be kidnapped, Sarah neglects to employ any of her Anchuent powers, and thus Chris must take him down. This being the early days of the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Megan\" title=\"Megan\">Megan</a> Saga, Chris drew heavily from anime themes in this issue, so Chris and Wes did battle via <a href=\"/cwcki/Yu-Gi-Oh!\" title=\"Yu-Gi-Oh!\">children's card games</a> rather than an actual fight. Chris loses (again), proving for a second time that Wes was a superior fighter to him, but he and Sarah are saved by <a href=\"/cwcki/Sailor_Megtune\" title=\"Sailor Megtune\">Sailor Megtune</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Megagi_La_Skunk\" title=\"Megagi La Skunk\">Megagi La Skunk</a>, and the wedding continues without issue.\n</p><p>Iseli was briefly seen in <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_7\" title=\"Sonichu 7\"><i>Sonichu #7</i></a>, attending the conference of villains following Christian's disappearance into the <a href=\"/cwcki/Time_Void\" title=\"Time Void\">Time Void</a>. Given that the conference was run by Mary and Count Graduon, the evil that Wes was destined to defeat alongside Chris and Sarah, the prophecy seems to have gone horribly wrong. <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_writing\" title=\"Chris and writing\">Chris, naturally, does not address this</a>.\n</p><p>Wes was last seen in the comic in <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_9\" title=\"Sonichu 9\"><i>Sonichu #9</i></a>, appearing on a grand total of two pages. First early in the issue, where he was seen scouting around the city in preparation for the <a href=\"/cwcki/Private_Villa_of_Corrupted_Citizens\" title=\"Private Villa of Corrupted Citizens\">PVCC</a> attack, assisted by <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Reldnahc_Ha-Taque\" title=\"Reldnahc Ha-Taque\">Reldnahc Ha-Taque</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Silvana\" title=\"Silvana\">Silvana</a>, and later on again, when he calls Mary and tells her that a magic dome was protecting the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville_Shopping_Center\" title=\"CWCville Shopping Center\">CWCville Shopping Center</a> from attack, and that they needed Mary to come down there personally to get through. He is never seen fighting in this issue, and it is to date his final appearance.\n</p><p>Still to this day, Wes's final fate remains unknown. Whether he was counted among the brainwashing victims freed by Chris or not has never been stated, and depending on whether or not Wes was acting of his own free will in helping Mary and the PVCC, he may or may not be the last surviving villain other than <a href=\"/cwcki/Clawdorf\" title=\"Clawdorf\">Clawdorf</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Metal_Sonichu\" title=\"Metal Sonichu\">Metal Sonichu</a> after the <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_10\" title=\"Sonichu 10\"><i>Sonichu #10</i></a>  purge.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Wes-Li_Sonichu\">Wes-Li Sonichu</span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:FlameSnipers.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"176\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/2/23/FlameSnipers.jpg/300px-FlameSnipers.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/2/23/FlameSnipers.jpg 1.5x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:FlameSnipers.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Wes-li's Flame Sniper (left) compared to Sailor Mars' Flame Sniper (right).</div></div></div>\n<p>Wes-Li Sonichu (pronounced [wɛzlaɪ], \"Wez-lie\", according to Chris's <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Videobooks\" title=\"Videobooks\">videobooks</a>, and as \"Wesley\" according to the <a href=\"/cwcki/Audiobooks\" title=\"Audiobooks\">Audiobooks</a>) is the <a href=\"/cwcki/Electric_Hedgehog_Pok%C3%A9mon\" title=\"Electric Hedgehog Pokémon\">Electric Hedgehog Pokémon</a> form of Wes Iseli when he is transformed by the Fireshock Pendant empowered by the <a href=\"/cwcki/Anchuent_Prophecy\" title=\"Anchuent Prophecy\">Anchuent Prophecy</a>.

With the name change, it makes absolutely no sense that a person named \"Walter Grisby\" would have an alter ego that does not resemble his name in any way - unless one knows the background of this character. Renaming him something like \"Wal-By Sonichu\" was something Chris did not bother with.\n</p><p>Curiously, Wes-Li is one of the more detailed Sonichus that Chris has made, which is saying something given the <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_art#Tracing\" title=\"Chris and art\">cookie-cutter</a> nature of most of the other characters Chris has designed.\n</p><p>As he is not featured much, Wes-Li Sonichu is not seen to possess anything like the absurdly vast array of powers that Chris-Chan Sonichu does. He is, however, seen using the Pokémon moves Fire Blast, Flamethrower, Mega Kick and Sky Uppercut, as well as a move known as the Flame Sniper, in which he uses a bow and arrow made of fire to shoot at a target. The name and attack itself are another rip-off from <a href=\"/cwcki/Sailor_Moon\" title=\"Sailor Moon\">Sailor Moon</a>. With help from Chris-Chan and Saramah, Wes-Li can also use the \"Team Blast: Blue Fireball Attack\", but being the stupid Deus Ex Machina finishing move it is, the attack is used only once to destroy Graduon's golem and is never used again. It is also ripped off from <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog\" title=\"Sonic the Hedgehog\">Sonic Heroes</a></i>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Wasabi_Rival\">Wasabi Rival</span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:102px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Wasabi_rival.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"154\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/c/ce/Wasabi_rival.jpg/100px-Wasabi_rival.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/c/ce/Wasabi_rival.jpg/150px-Wasabi_rival.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/c/ce/Wasabi_rival.jpg 2x\" width=\"100\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Wasabi_rival.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>The Wasabi Rival or the Pope? YOU DECIDE!</div></div></div>\n<p>The Wasabi Rival was the ancient alter ego of Wes Iseli in the <i>Sonichu</i> comics. According to <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_2\" title=\"Sonichu 2\">Sonichu 2</a></i>, the <a href=\"/cwcki/Wasabi_Clan\" title=\"Wasabi Clan\">Wasabi Clan</a> were contemporaries of the Ancient Cherokee. One of the Wasabi, presumably a leader figure of some sort, somehow determined that stealing the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Cherokian_Crown\" title=\"Cherokian Crown\">Cherokian Crown</a> from his  <a href=\"/cwcki/Ancient_leader_of_the_Cherokee_Clan\" title=\"Ancient leader of the Cherokee Clan\">rival</a> would allow him and his tribe to rule the world. This led to a bitter rivalry between the ambitious Wasabi man and the Cherokian Leader. Despite their differences, the Cherokian Leader and his Wasabi Rival were eventually able to forge a temporary alliance against the greater menace of <a href=\"/cwcki/Count_Graduon\" title=\"Count Graduon\">Count Graduon</a>. Together, the Wasabi and Cherokee defeated Graduon, imprisoning him within a magic scepter for centuries.\n</p><p>Years later, when the <a href=\"/cwcki/Anchuent_Prophecy\" title=\"Anchuent Prophecy\">Anchuent Prophecy</a> was at last fulfilled, the Wasabi Rival appeared in a vision to his reincarnation, Wes Iseli, in order to instruct him in use of the Fireshock Pendant. Exactly how and why the Wasabi Rival is able to communicate with Wes like this is not explained.
