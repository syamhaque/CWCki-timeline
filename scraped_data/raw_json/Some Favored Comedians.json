He reiterates his <a href=\"/cwcki/Cleveland_Show_Voice_Rant\" title=\"Cleveland Show Voice Rant\">dislike for</a> the change in voice actors on <i>The Cleveland Show</i>, does several terrible impersonations, and describes a scenario where <a href=\"/cwcki/Seinfeld\" title=\"Seinfeld\">Jerry Seinfeld</a> meets him and does a stand up act about how <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">awesome</a> it is to meet a retarded manchild. Apparently, Seinfeld also forgets to throw in anything resembling a joke during the act. During this extended fantasy, Chris refers to himself as a \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">teenage boy</a>\", even though he was twenty-eight at the time the video was made, and hadn't been a teenager since early <a href=\"/cwcki/2002\" title=\"2002\">2002</a>.\n</p><p>After the <a href=\"/cwcki/Seinfeld\" title=\"Seinfeld\">Seinfeld</a> bit, Chris spends a while trying to explain how he doesn't actually hate Jews at all, but makes no attempts to justify his <a href=\"/cwcki/Michael_Snyder_is_ColdHearted_and_Mean\" title=\"Michael Snyder is ColdHearted and Mean\">recent actions</a>. He shifts gears to mention that Larry the Cable Guy should be called \"Larry the Trucker Man,\" and then changes subjects once again, in an ADD kind of way, to Peter Cullen's voice acting <a href=\"/cwcki/Optimus_Prime\" title=\"Optimus Prime\">Optimus Prime</a>.\n</p><p>Despite Chris being a critical and avid fan of <i>The Cleveland Show</i>, he consistently refers to <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reagan_Gomez-Preston\" title=\"wikipedia:Reagan Gomez-Preston\">Reagan Gomez</a> as \"Regina\". This could be an artifact of his <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">autism</a> for which he blames almost all of his shortcomings, or he could have confused her with <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regina_King\" title=\"wikipedia:Regina King\">Regina King</a>, who voices characters on <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Don%27t_Trust_Any_Homos_Over_There\" title=\"Don't Trust Any Homos Over There\">The Boondocks</a></i>. He also repeatedly mispronounces Mila Kunis's name. Considering that she's the voice of his favorite <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Family_Guy\" title=\"Family Guy\">Family Guy</a></i> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Gal-pal\" title=\"Gal-pal\">gal-pal</a>, well, that comes as no surprise.\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Video\">Video</span></h2>\n<table style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa;

I just uh, started up this video [<i>takes his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Glasses\" title=\"Glasses\">glasses</a> off</i>] to uh, give y'all a little update about myself [<i>puts glasses back on, coughs</i>]. You know, I'm doing well, so's my <a href=\"/cwcki/Barbara_Chandler\" title=\"Barbara Chandler\">|mom</a>, and for your information my <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler\" title=\"Bob Chandler\">|father</a> is alive and well, so that rumor is false. My father is alive and well.\n</p><p>Anyway uh, anyway with that, I wanna talk about some of my favorite uh, comedy people. But uh, I'd like to start off with uh, prefacing with uh, preferencing an old- a <a href=\"/cwcki/Cleveland_Show_Voice_Rant\" title=\"Cleveland Show Voice Rant\">past video of mine</a>, of which I have uh made the complaint about uh... <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reagan_Gomez-Preston\" title=\"wikipedia:Reagan Gomez-Preston\">Reagan Gomez</a> replacing <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\" title=\"wikipedia:\">Nia Long</a> on <i><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/The_Cleveland_Show\" title=\"The Cleveland Show\">The Cleveland Show</a></i>. I mean yeah that was definitely like a trade down in comparison. [<i>Chris turns to his TV</i>] Let's go to a clip of Nia Long.\n</p><p>[<i>Clip of </i>The Cleveland Show<i> plays – probably from \"Da Doggone Daddy-Daughter Dinner Dance\"</i>]\n</p><p>And then uh now, check out uh, Regina Gomez in comparison.\n</p><p>[<i>Plays another clip from </i>The Cleveland Show<i> – probably from \"Once Upon a Tyne in New York\"</i>]\n</p><p>You see a difference? Big difference. Regina is a whiny-voiced little brat, whereas uh Nia... [<i>turns to TV</i>] was a lot better. And uh, [<i>turns to camera</i>] an another reference, that was like uh, when they changed the voice- they changed the voice actress for [<i>turns to TV</i>] <a href=\"/cwcki/Family_Guy#Chris_and_Meg\" title=\"Family Guy\">Megan Griffin</a>. I mean, yeah, here's the first voice. This is an improvement, by the way.\n</p><p>[<i>Plays a clip from </i>Family Guy<i> </i>]\n</p><p>Yeah, see well, this was a better change in comparison. You know, change it from... I forget her name... to <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mila_Kunis\" title=\"wikipedia:Mila Kunis\">Mila Kunis</a>. [<i>pronounced \"kuhn-is\" instead of the proper \"koon-is\"</i>] Whoops, I don't need to select it. Here we go. Here's Mila.\n</p><p>[<i>Plays a clip from </i>Family Guy<i> </i>]\n</p><p>Yeah, big difference. Big difference between the uh, voice actresses, you know. When they sw- they, did it from <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacey_Chabert\" title=\"wikipedia:Lacey Chabert\">whoever she was</a> to Mila Kunis, that was an improvement because, you know, maturing- the voice deepens naturally. Whereas The Cleveland Show switching from Ni- switching from Nia Long to Regina Gomez. That's a trade <i>down</i> [<i>gestures and points down</i>]. I mean I- I gotta tell you my opinion [<i>removes glasses</i>]. It must have been like uh, Seth MacFarlane and uh, Mike Henry musta had uh, too many <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Alcohol\" title=\"Alcohol\">drinks</a> or somethin' to decide to uh, switch from Nia to Regina. Or a- or I don't know whether it's um, it was their decision or what Nia had in her head when sh- uh, when she left the show for that point.\n</p><p>And I leave you all with that. Let's talk about uh, let's talk about famous comedy people. Uh, y'all know I like uh, I like from class-, from the classics, <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucille_Ball\" title=\"wikipedia:Lucille Ball\">Lucille Ball</a> [<i>High-pitched voice impression</i>] <i>Hello, friends. I'm your <a href=\"/cwcki/Vitameatavegamin\" title=\"Vitameatavegamin\">Vitameatavegamin</a> girl. Are you tired, run down, and listless? Do you <a href=\"/cwcki/DIRTY,_CRAPPED_BRIEFS\" title=\"DIRTY, CRAPPED BRIEFS\">poop out</a> at parties? Are you unpopular? The answer to all your problems is in this little bottle. Vitameatavegamin</i>. And I also like <a href=\"/cwcki/Red_Skelton\" title=\"Red Skelton\">Red Skelton</a>. [<i>Dopey voice impression</i>] <i>We were all going, OK, we were all going to the, uh, we're going to the par-, we're going to the parade. We got a float that we-, and this float that we were on, it looked like the back end of a Cadillac. And then something, and then something happened and we, uh, we don't know what happened, but we went out of control and crazy, and we ended up in McGriffin Park lake. Two ducks swam by and one turned the other and said, \"Gertrude, who hatched that thing?\"</i> [<i>chuckles a bit</i>] Very funny people. I also liked uh, I also liked <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Van_Dyke\" title=\"wikipedia:Dick Van Dyke\">Dick Van Dyke</a>, <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Tyler_Moore\" title=\"wikipedia:Mary Tyler Moore\">Mary Tyler Moore</a> and, <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Newhart\" title=\"wikipedia:Bob Newhart\">Bob Newhart</a>, there's another good one. I like those types of people, but from today's, uh, from this generation, I like <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Allen\" title=\"wikipedia:Tim Allen\">Tim Allen</a>. He's a funny man. Yeah. [<i>Laughs</i>] I was just remembering the uh, part where- the one where he <i>Tim don't put your hand in the light socket *pfft*</i>. But seriously though, he does very good, he's a funny man.\n</p><p>I also like <a href=\"/cwcki/Seinfeld\" title=\"Seinfeld\">Jerry Seinfeld</a>. He- he's very funny. I watch his show every- I watch his show every day on TBS... And, you know, too bad- too bad it got ended. He coulda done more shows but whatever. That was his call there. He decided that after nine seasons. I like Jerry Seinfeld, he's a funny man. You know I would- you know I would definitely like to see this, you know, even as <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">a video response from Jerry Himself</a>, his view on autis- on autistic people. Especially the high functioning autistics like myself, you know.\n</p><p>[<i>Stares into space, makes a creepy smile</i>]\n</p><p>And also, think about this, I probably sound like Jerry Sein- I probably sound like Jerry Seinfeld, you know? This could be a comedy routine for himself, you know, that he could do for autistics.\n</p><p>[<i>Pantomimes holding a mic, attempts to impersonate Jerry Seinfeld</i>]\nAh yeah, so I just recently been introduced to this uh, autistic, uh, boy- this autistic teenage boy here. And uh, and we sai- you know, I was introduced, so he opened up to me right away. And then I- and then- later, like I- later at this picnic, this community picnic, he uh, I see him- I see him over there and he wants to find- he wants to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Fuck_quest\" title=\"Fuck quest\">meet himself a lady</a>, so he's hanging out over there. And I don't see him talking to the ladies, he just uh, he's just uh, smiling and being silent. I mean, he ain't gonna go anywhere unless he talks to- unless he talks to ladies, but then again that's part of the autism right there. He just tends to blank out when he's not introduced to people. Because he's scared of the uh, unknown. That's very common amongst the autistic people. And I'll tell you something else. <a href=\"/cwcki/Toucher_and_Rich_Segment#Chris's_Response\" title=\"Toucher and Rich Segment\">Today's society where everybody is glued to their computers and Internet and all that, they're definitely closing themselves off from society. It's like they're becoming autistics themselves</a>. I mean, if they're definitely not glued in front of their computer they're definitely about as blank as that au- that little teenage boy was.\n</p><p>[<i>Pantomimes releasing mic, stares into space for a few moments.</i>]\nEh, yeah, but anyway I would definitely like to hear Jerry Seinfeld's uh, opinions and views, or a comedy sketch about autistic people. 'Cuz I want to ask him about that. Oh yeah, also you know, another Jewish dude I like- that he strikes me as funny, <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Garrett\" title=\"wikipedia:Brad Garrett\">Brad Garrett</a>, you know, from <i>Everybody Loves Raymond</i>, also doing the guy from <i>’Til Death</i>. He actually also starred in an episode of <i>Seinfeld</i> I read, where he steals Jerry's car. Still that does- that seems kind of dumb, you know. I even read that he tried- he tried out for Kramer, I mean, I mean he definitely would not have been- I do not know if he would be a better Kramer, I mean [<i>Voice changes</i>] \"What are you looking at crazy?\" I dunno. Ha, I mean, \n[<i>Waves arms around</i>] \"Who-whoop-whoop PIA!  Yeah. Hi Jer!\" [<i>chuckles</i>] Yeah I think uh, Brad Garrison is a little bit more subtle, but I like him too. You know. And I have nothing against <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jews\" title=\"Jews\">Jewish people</a>, I mean there's people too, and I got nothing against Jewish community. I mean they have their views and we have our views, let's leave it at that. I mean they're all- they're all- they're people we're people, [<i>face contorts with racism</i>] no problem.\n</p><p>I know I sent <a href=\"/cwcki/Michael_Snyder_is_ColdHearted_and_Mean\" title=\"Michael Snyder is ColdHearted and Mean\">crossed signals</a> about that at past points. Oh, hey, you know <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">another dude I like?</a> [<i>puts on a baseball cap</i>]quo- Larry the quote-unquote Cable Guy. <i>Git-R-Done!</i> [<i>chuckles</i>] Funny dude, you know. He definitely could been- he definitely had the trucker look going for him if he uh, wasn't being the cable guy. Yeah I mean, I would definitely think that would have uh, the way he was dressed they would him \"Larry the Trucker Man!\" Trucker Man. [<i>chuckles</i>] Yeaah, pretty funny. [<i>takes off cap</i>] Oh and also you know, speaking of impressions uhh, here's <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Cullen\" title=\"wikipedia:Peter Cullen\">Peter Cullen</a>. [<i>Poorly impersonates some lines from <a href=\"/cwcki/Transformers\" title=\"Transformers\">Transformers</a>.</i>] \"Autobots! Transform and roll out! Bumblebee, I need you to go and spy on the Decepticons. Let's- Let's see what they're go- what they're doing over there.\" That's <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ego\" title=\"Ego\">spot on, dead on</a> Peter Cullen right there. And I'm glad that, you know, aside from the generation one series, they let him do t- he volunte- he volunteered to do the voice of Optimus in the new movies, as well as in the video games. I mean all th- of all the generations between the Optimus Primes and the Optimus Primals, [<i>points at camera</i>] Peter Cullen <i>is</i> Optimus Prime. Of all time. \n</p><p>Anyway, that's uhh, just uh some of my opinions about some current and past comedians and uh, Seth! Mike! Bring back Nia Long!
