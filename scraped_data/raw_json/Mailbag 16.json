I can't really say for sure as I am not a mind-reader, but I feel that the right women not only enjoy, but is also important, are having the same rights as men; the vote, to be recognized, and even, possibly crazily, walk a mile in the man's shoes and clothing. LOL I understand that women like men who <a href=\"/cwcki/DIRTY,_CRAPPED_BRIEFS\" title=\"DIRTY, CRAPPED BRIEFS\">stay</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_health#Hygiene\" title=\"Chris and health\">clean</a>, are <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/List_of_Chris%27s_Lies\" title=\"List of Chris's Lies\">truthful and honest,</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Obesity\" title=\"Obesity\">look</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_fashion\" title=\"Chris and fashion\">good</a> and all-around <a href=\"/cwcki/Death_threats\" title=\"Death threats\">kind</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Megan\" title=\"Megan\">considerate</a> with a dash of rough and tough. I feel that if ALL some women look for in a man is Power, Fame or Money are Totally Shallow, or otherwise Low on Self-Esteem. The <a href=\"/cwcki/China\" title=\"China\">private</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Pickle\" title=\"Pickle\">parts</a> are a big difference. But from my P.O.V., <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Gal-pals\" title=\"Gal-pals\">most women</a> are kind, considerate, sweet, emotionally sharing, outgoing, yet sometimes harsh and strict with good intentions. And again from my P.O.V., <a href=\"/cwcki/JERKS\" title=\"JERKS\">most men</a> are <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_Ego\" title=\"Chris and his Ego\">obnoxious, selfish</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/I%27LL_BREAK_YOU_DEAD\" title=\"I'LL BREAK YOU DEAD\">violent</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Slow-in-the-mind\" title=\"Slow-in-the-mind\">ignorant and mentally slow</a>, and they are certainly <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">do not share their emotions</a> to make themselves appear Tough and not weak. The women characters in the comics have roles in which they live as they would normally, or assert themselves in opinions and/or strength when appropriate. There are times when it may be considered they were portrayed by the stereotypes talked about, but that was never the case; I put them in those situations at those times as I saw fit in the story. For example, in the 20th Episode, Rosechu attacked the villians valiently, yet I had to let her get captured so I could make the recreation and reference to the Fan Animation from (YouTube User) <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_Fan_Promo\" title=\"Sonichu Fan Promo\">Timmys1984</a> fully and successfully.\n<p>--<a href=\"/cwcki/User:ChrisChanSonichu\" title=\"User:ChrisChanSonichu\">ChrisChanSonichu</a> 07:50, 13 December 2009 (CET)\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Second_date\">Second date</span></h3>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #B48246; padding:5px; background-color:#FCC\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>From: Steven Pinelli &lt;pinelliacid@gmail.com&gt;\n<p>Hello Chris.

I've tried almost everything to get her to notice me; like flirting with her, standing really close to her when we're together in public, buying gifts for her, singing romantic songs to her, and painting pictures of her. It's nothing creepy or perverted, just stuff with us holding hands, kissing, and this one where we're frolicking together in an Spring meadow.

I recommend checking out the movie, \"Just Friends\" starring Ryan Reynolds and Amy Smart; NOT exactly, but you may learn from how Ryan's character got out of the Friend Zone and stepped it up.
