In this fifty-minute chat, Chris mostly goes on about video games. Gems include the thought that <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_Sex#Incest\" title=\"Chris and Sex\">incest</a> is okay if there are two women, and stuff about the <a href=\"/cwcki/Shigeru_Miyamoto\" title=\"Shigeru Miyamoto\">Nintendo trip</a>.\n</p><p>Length: <b>49:32</b>\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Summary\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Summary</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Notes\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Notes</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Video\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Video</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Transcript\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Transcript</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Links\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Links</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Summary\">Summary</span></h2>\n<p>The conversation begins with a discussion between Chris and a girl about <a href=\"/cwcki/Transformers\" title=\"Transformers\">Transformers</a>, before moving onto <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Video_games\" title=\"Video games\">video games</a> (surprised?). After quite a length of time, the discussion moves onto his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Room\" title=\"Room\">room</a>, and the fact that he has a <a href=\"/cwcki/Lego\" title=\"Lego\">Lego</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a> that he's been building his entire life (and that he plans on continuing for his entire life). He then mentions he buys <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_fashion\" title=\"Chris and fashion\">his clothes</a> from Goodwill and the Salvation Army because \"IT WAS A BARGAIN\" (complete with falsetto). He then announces that he hates <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">homos</a>. Lesbians are OK though. Thanks to <a href=\"/cwcki/Cogsdev\" title=\"Cogsdev\">Our Lady Cogs</a> to bringing it up for us. He doesn't want to make any more new male friends though. Back to lesbians, and they're good. So good, he'd have a threesome with two girls. It also transpires he has no idea what incest is. It turns out that he can be sure that <a href=\"/cwcki/Anne_Boleyn\" title=\"Anne Boleyn\">Anne Boleyn</a> never had sex with her brother, but sister-on-sister incest is fine. There's some talk of cars. Chris is invited to Louisville, Kentucky by a girl, and he farts. Chris knows that Canadians are nice and play ice hockey too.\n</p><p><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Obama\" title=\"Obama\">Obama</a> and Chris have common ground, apparently. Chris sees himself in Obama as they were both outcasts. He also discovered he was a 'moderate' in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/High_school\" title=\"High school\">high school</a>. <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Clyde\" title=\"Clyde\">Clyde</a> is a 'joike' as well, by the way. He describes an argument with <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bob\" title=\"Bob\">Bob</a>, and then goes onto mention he could beat Bob's ass, because Bob is 81. The love and respect conundrum is mentioned- turns out Chris doesn't love Bob, but he does respect him.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notes\">Notes</span></h3>\n<ul><li>Info for Chris's Room map: L-shaped Lego CWCville.</li>\n<li>Chris then admits to his family being <a href=\"/cwcki/14_Branchland_Court\" title=\"14 Branchland Court\">pack rats</a>.</li>\n<li>He's \"unanimous\" about being against homos.</li>\n<li>He appreciates the <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_Girls\" title=\"Sonichu Girls\">Sonichu Girls</a>.</li>\n<li><i><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Shuffle!\" title=\"Shuffle!\">Shuffle!</a></i> is a harem dating sim/anime he wants to see.</li>\n<li>He was \"tested\" for <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">autism</a>...</li>\n<li>Has no desire to make new male friends.</li>\n<li>He went to California to meet <a href=\"/cwcki/Cole_Smithey\" title=\"Cole Smithey\">Cole</a>.</li>\n<li>Lesbians are okay, two gay lovers are not.</li>\n<li>Threesome with two women a-okay with him.</li>\n<li>\"An incest?\" he doesn't understand, discourages it.</li>\n<li>Anne Boleyn is his aunt.

Yeah but I know but it's like available used, but anyway, anyway the-anyway the point is, you can pick up the least expensive for a PlayStation 3, and give it more memory capacity. That's like more bang for your buck, by buying the- like a 500GB Serial AT- Internal Serial ATA Norton <a href=\"/cwcki/Duck\" title=\"Duck\">two and a half inch</a> notebook drive. And then you just-and then you just swap out- swap it in- swap out the old one and put in the new one. That's what I did. I got like, I couldn't- I co-... It's been working for me!

It's just it... Yeah, it's still bad news and it depresses me.<br/>\n<font color=\"#800080\"><b>Trap:</b></font> Well I'll fix that right now. Just give me a second to type this in... (mumbling) There's uhh... that's probably the biggest show I've ever been to. I knew a Bob and Geraldo he's kind of a cool guy. Hangs out in Germany a bit more than France, but uh, heh heh, yeah I was lucky to see him in Seattle. I was on business, before I decided to kinda settle here.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeahh... I well I appreciate that but you don't have to make any effort for me to feel better, I mean, just give me some time without any bad news and I'll eventually feel better.<br/>\n<font color=\"#800080\"><b>Trap:</b></font> Alright, fair enough.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> That's something I'll about.<br/>\n<font color=\"#800080\"><b>Trap:</b></font> Oui.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah I checked- [<i>brief pause</i>] Yeah actually I checked it recently and that top, that top that top piece of information that was on top of the page said it was going away, went away. So they pretty much just introduced stuff and they pretty much just extended it's life. [<i>Loud sigh</i>] I'm not going to believe it, you know even though it's advertisements saying it's gonna go away I can't believe it until it's actually gone. You know like that guy who couldn't believe in Jesus until, like you know, he could actually see and touch Jesus.<br/>\n<font color=\"#800080\"><b>Trap:</b></font> Hmmm.<br/>\n[<i>Pause</i>]<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> The-uh, the administrators behind the ED page want to get rid of it.<br/>\n[<i>Pause</i>]<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>Sigh</i>] Hope so. I'm just, you know, sick of it being there. It was pretty much one of the factors that also made Miyamoto question my person and incentives and all that. It-<br/>\n[<i>Pause</i>]<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I did not send them anything like that. That was a- that was a troll, who went under my screen, that hacked into- that was <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">Clyde</a> who hacked into my AOL address and spammed the uh, quote-unquote “confession” which was a huge lie.<br/>\n[<i>Pause</i>]<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. Yeah. Anyways it was Clyde. I hate that jerk (pronounced joike).<br/>\n<font color=\"#800080\"><b>Trap:</b></font> Hmmm.<br/>\n[<i>Pause</i>]<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>Sighs very loudly</i>]<br/>\n[<i>Pause, intermittent background noise</i>]<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, to quote New Brian from an episode <a href=\"/cwcki/Family_Guy\" title=\"Family Guy\">Family Guy</a>. Inspiration does not have a schedule so it's like you know. One day you can be inspired to do something and the next day something bad happens and you're like drained from days to weeks to months.<br/>\n[<i>Pause</i>]<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. Yeah I tried but then more bad stuff happens and it just drags me down further. Especially my father, causing an argument when I'm trapped with him in the car.<br/>\n<font color=\"#800080\"><b>Trap:</b></font> Hmmm.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>Sigh</i>]<br/>\n[<i>Pause</i>]<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I uh- I tried to- I tried to ignore him, but still, eventually he will cross the line and hit a nerve.<br/>\n<font color=\"#800080\"><b>Trap:</b></font> Uh oh.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, like, recently when I blocked him out so much he eventually gave me the finger and I was like [<i>Ear rapingly high voice</i>] “Did you just give me the finger?!”<br/>\n<font color=\"#800080\"><b>Trap:</b></font> [<i>Forced laughter</i>]<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I did the headphone thing as well, I mean I'd turn on whatever I had saved on my PSP in the line of like a television show or a movie I've downloaded or have copied to the Memory Stick.<br/>\n[<i>Pause, intermittent background noise</i>]<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. Oh, And uh, Julie, I know I could take him on he's friggin' 81. But it's like, you know he's my father and I have to respect him. I mean I don't have to love him but I have to respect him. Yeah. [<i>Yawn</i>] Lot of life factors that can bring you up or take you down.<br/>\n<font color=\"#800080\"><b>Trap:</b></font> Yeah... Hey Chris. Have you ever thought, like, just randomly, what it would be like if you were a cyborg? You know, half man, half machine?<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uhhh. Yeah that doesn't happen but uh, a bunch of time, I often will randomly <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tomgirl\" title=\"Tomgirl\">ponder what my life would be like if I was actually born a woman</a>.<br/>\n<font color=\"#800080\"><b>Trap:</b></font> [<i>Surprised</i>] Oh really?<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, but... I dunno, but, you know, I mean I would theorize that it could be better than my life now.<br/>\n<font color=\"#800080\"><b>Trap:</b></font> Alright.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> But- well I dunno. I mean uh, I can't think of any- I can't think of them right now. But eventually then-but eventually- but eventually in the end I would always realize eh, I can't change it at this point. God gave me <a href=\"/cwcki/Duck\" title=\"Duck\">the package</a> and I signed for it.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, probably from an episode of Family Guy. Stewie said it. Yeah the uh- [<i>brief pause</i>] Yeah the episode I'm talking about is the one where Stewie had his female baby- his babysitter he fell in love with, then he like, put the baby bottle in his diaper and says [<i>Terrible Stewie Impression</i>] “Oh, this is just me being myself. Oh, this?  This is um, this us um, this is just my package. God delivered it, I signed for it.” [<i>brief pause</i>] But you know, in Family Guy I'm most fond of <a href=\"/cwcki/Meg_Griffin\" title=\"Meg Griffin\">Megan Marie Griffin</a>. I mean it's just too bad that she gets the bad end of the deal. She deserves a lot better.<br/>\n[<i>Pause</i>]<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, yeah I know, I know “Road to Germany”. Yeah. Yeah. [<i>High, whiny voice</i>] “Can I use your restaurant? I've taken a whole bunch of stool softener and now I've really gotta go.” [<i>Some other voice</i>] “Oh yeah sure, Martin just go upstairs to the bathroom.” [<i>Third voice</i>] “I'll be out in a minute! “I'll be right out!” “She said she'll be out in a minute!” “Giggidy giggidy goo!”<br/>\n<font color=\"#800080\"><b>Trap:</b></font> Oui... Oh, so Cogs had a suggestion...<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah I know, I read it. I'm definitely not doing that. I'm not doing that. I mean uh, you know... Yeah I'm definitely not doing that. Yeah. I think he's like refereeing for that such, that the- kind of over the counter drug just basically gives you like bigger... gives the man like, bigger man boobs, and shrivels up the uhhh... <b>dick</b>.<br/>\n<font color=\"pink\"><b>Girl:</b></font> Attack of the killer Moobs!<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Oh boy. I mean, hey, you know, any man who's dumb enough to take hormones may as just go ahead pay up thousands of dollars for a sex change. In that episode where they showed Mr. Garrison actually having that surgery that just turned me off.<br/>\n<font color=\"#800080\"><b>Trap:</b></font> Yeah but you... Gonna be a woman might as well use those god-given ovaries, right?<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. [<i>Brief pause</i>] I mean, I may as well go ahead and say it, because it's a fact that's been on my mind for  long time I mean. I'd sooner have a sex change before I would ever turn into a homo.<br/>\n<font color=\"#800080\"><b>Trap:</b></font> Oh...<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> But uh yes Julie, what is, what  you got, what you want to say there?<br/>\n[<i>Pause</i>]<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>Sigh</i>] Yeah, but I'd rather not. Besides, I really should go get something to eat cuz I fell asleep at the 9:00 Hour and I just woke up during the 3:00 hour.<br/>\n<font color=\"#800080\"><b>Trap:</b></font> Huhh...<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, another time perhaps. Yep. Well whatever, if you want to send me an invite- if you want to send me... wait.<br/>\n[<i>Pause</i>]<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uhhh. Julie I'll give you permission to share that. Among the, uh, among these fans here.<br/>\n<font color=\"#800080\"><b>Trap:</b></font> Oh?<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah cuz she was talking to me on a Skype window as well.<br/>\n[<i>Pause</i>]<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah but also, lemme uh, I mean yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Even though- even though- Even though those people be born- can be born that way, some people can be changed. I mean, that's what I heard, and uh, you know, I'm definitely not going to change. So you know- if anything- If anything I'm definitely born straight, you know, you hear on like Family Guy you know for gals it's a choice. For women it's a choice.<br/>\n<font color=\"#800080\"><b>Trap:</b></font> Oh, to your left (referring to the placement of the chat window in Mumble).<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Being a homo. Alright. I'm straight so I will not be changed. Alright so anyway I'm gonna get something to eat so I'll come back later. Y'all take care.<br/>\n[<i>Chris signs off, trolls converse among selves</i>]<br/>\n<font color=\"#00FF00\"><b>GeckoMantis:</b></font> I got most of that recorded- I got all of that recorded for when I returned back.<br/>\n[<i>Typing</i>]<br/>\n<font color=\"#00FF00\"><b>GeckoMantis:</b></font> I just sent him a message, from uh, in my, from Skype saying \"This is GeckoMatis from the Mumble, add me as your friend.
