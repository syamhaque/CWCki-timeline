The only things that have been removed are the email ads at the bottom of each page.\n</p><p>Megan's e-mails are in pink, Chris's in light blue.\n</p><p>Chris's friendship with Megan had already shown signs of cracks even before the <a href=\"/cwcki/ShecameforCWC.JPG\" title=\"ShecameforCWC.JPG\">ShecameforCWC</a> fiasco, but it wouldn't be until after it that their friendship finally shattered into bits. Between Chris's shoddy attempts at \"apologizing\" for drawing him fingering his only friend – a friend who not only repeatedly told him to stop touching her, but also was asexual and didn't <i>want</i> to engage in a romantic/sexual relationship – and him admitting that he \"might have become an abusive maniac\" if he didn't draw it, Megan finally had enough of his creepy behavior and utter refusal to listen to her. After telling him she couldn't trust him anymore, she finally broke all contact with him. This marks the last time Chris had any sort of conversation with Megan.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#E-mails\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">E-mails</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Chris_wants_Megan_to_live_with_him\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris wants Megan to live with him</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Megan_doesn't_want_to_be_on_Chris's_websites\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Megan doesn't want to be on Chris's websites</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Chris_apologizes_for_something,_what_could_it_be?\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris apologizes for something, what could it be?</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Chris_emails_her_some_detective_work,_Megan_likely_doesn't_give_a_shit\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris emails her some detective work, Megan likely doesn't give a shit</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Megan_is_scarred_by_ShecameforCWC.JPG\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Megan is scarred by ShecameforCWC.JPG</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Megan_wants_Chris_to_leave_her_alone\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Megan wants Chris to leave her alone</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Chris_thinks_she_was_scarred_because_she_doesn't_know_much_about_sex\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris thinks she was scarred because she doesn't know much about sex</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#Chris_bothers_Megan_about_Encyclopedia_Dramatica_again\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris bothers Megan about Encyclopedia Dramatica again</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Megan_is_fed_up\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.9</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Megan is fed up</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#Chris_continues_bothering_her_about_ED\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.10</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris continues bothering her about ED</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-12\"><a href='#Chris_does_not_regret_the_Meganporn_and_claims_drawing_it_helped_prevent_him_from_doing_\"something_really_dumb_and_stupid\"'><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.11</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris does not regret the Meganporn and claims drawing it helped prevent him from doing \"something really dumb and stupid\"</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-13\"><a href=\"#Chris_still_wants_Megan\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.12</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris still wants Megan</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-14\"><a href=\"#Megan_asks_Chris_to_leave_her_alone_again,_attempts_to_talk_sense_into_him\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.13</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Megan asks Chris to leave her alone again, attempts to talk sense into him</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-15\"><a href=\"#Megan_still_wants_to_be_alone\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.14</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Megan still wants to be alone</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-16\"><a href=\"#Chris_talks_about_his_feelings,_then_some_shit_no_one_cares_about\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.15</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris talks about his feelings, then some shit no one cares about</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-17\"><a href=\"#Megan_can't_trust_Chris_anymore\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.16</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Megan can't trust Chris anymore</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-18\"><a href=\"#Gallery\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Gallery</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"E-mails\">E-mails</span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris_wants_Megan_to_live_with_him\">Chris wants Megan to live with him</span></h3>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF;

Please allow me to fill you in. My first major clues of a matching duo were the original date of the document creation, Wednesday, Ocotber 31, 2007, and this .jpg, <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4chan\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4chan</a>, which was obviously taken on the previous Friday, October 26, 2007. For the week, my family and I were pondering the major suspect; the dude who took that pic, which I distinctly remember seeing the camera flash while I playing a young gentleman in Pokemon TCG. Thus, my family came in and we found that <a href=\"/cwcki/Daniel_Mimms\" title=\"Daniel Mimms\">Mimms</a> had the camera in question, but he did not take the picture. Then we've suspected <a href=\"/cwcki/Lucas\" title=\"Lucas\">Lucas</a>, but we did not question him at the time. But a more obvious expression reply was found by myself, when Saturday March 8, 2008, at the Gamestop in Forest Lakes, the Midnight release event of <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._Brawl\" title=\"wikipedia:Super Smash Bros. Brawl\">Super Smash Bros. Brawl</a>, Mimms and I were watching a pair of tournament players brawling; one was playing <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Kong\" title=\"wikipedia:Donkey Kong\">Donkey Kong</a>. So it brought up to mind my first word being \"Monkey\", so I told Mimms that. And with a turn around towards the accompanying Lucas, I said in his direction, \"Well, that's something new you didn't know about \"be-4\" about this \"Chan\". I noticed a look on his face like, \"Wow, I can totally wail on that tidbit of information.\" He said nothing. And today, I looked up <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4chan\" title=\"wikipedia:4chan\">4Chan</a> on Wikipedia.com, <a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Image:Chrischannov2007.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Image:Chrischannov2007.jpg</a>, apparently 4Chan is solely a web thing that people can go on and mess around for the attention, with examples of false bombings, hackers on <a href=\"/cwcki/MySpace\" title=\"MySpace\">MySpace</a>, and more similar events listed on there. Upon the collected information on this case I've let set on the back-burner for a while, I can only suspect Lucas for being the culpret in putting that page up in the first place, because, seeing how close <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Mimms\" title=\"Mimms\">Mimms</a> and Lucas were, he had as much access to the beforementioned pic from October 26 as Mimms did. Also, I photographically remember the person who took my pic that day being tall and wearing a long coat. I'd like to put Lucas under a spotlight and question him about this whole thing, then put him behind bars for descreation of someone else's character. I'd question him myself, but <a href=\"/cwcki/Michael_Snyder\" title=\"Michael Snyder\">Mike</a> of <a href=\"/cwcki/The_GAMe_PLACe\" title=\"The GAMe PLACe\">the Game Place</a> said after my mother and father questioned Mimms that Friday night, if I were to bring up ANYTHING about that page again, he would kick me out of the Game Place for like a month. If you'd like to talk to Lucas discreetly about the subject, I'd appreciate it for the benefit of my investiga tion.\n</p><p>Megan, I am sorry about this whole mess, and having drawn that drawing, and raging the fire and hurting your feelings and emotions. If I can, not only will I get that drawing off that webpage, but I'll try to take down the whole thing. But I can't do it alone (my mother and father have been letting it set on the back-burner without giving it much thought).\n</p><p>I can only hope you'll forgive me, but no matter what, I still love you as my closest gal-pal.\n</p><p>I hope you feel better soon; Chris Chan.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Megan_is_scarred_by_ShecameforCWC.JPG\">Megan is scarred by <a href=\"/cwcki/ShecameforCWC.JPG\" title=\"ShecameforCWC.JPG\">ShecameforCWC.JPG</a></span></h3>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#F2CECE; border:1px dotted #BFA3A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>\n<p>−−−−−Original Message−−−−−<br/>\nFrom: Megan Schroeder &lt;yoshimitsuharakiri@yahoo.com&gt;<br/>\nTo: cwcsonichu@aol.com<br/>\nSent: Thu, 13 Mar 2008 7:33 am<br/>\nSubject: well...\n</p><p>I just don't know what to say now....\n</p><p>I am very much scarred by that image and it will never leave me.

I'm sorry. If it helps put things into perspective, I can reccomend finding information on the internet through this educational website I've found through <a href=\"/cwcki/Sex_toys\" title=\"Sex toys\">AdamEve.com</a>. Or I reccomend renting <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_40-Year-Old_Virgin\" title=\"wikipedia:The 40-Year-Old Virgin\">\"The 40 Year Old Virgin\"</a>; that movie touches on some of the issues around sex, and how it can really frustrate an older virgin who hasn't had the pleasure yet (or I can loan you my copy of \"The 40 Year Old Virgin\").

Anyway, you can remove the all the junk they put about you on there, as well as the drawing from the page for starters, but be careful not to take out TOO MUCH; they may undo your doing, so you may want to make multiple edits; remove the story on the first time, then add some random thing that comes to your mind onto the bottom of the page. <a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_Chris%27s_edits_to_Encyclopedia_Dramatica\" title=\"List of Chris's edits to Encyclopedia Dramatica\">I've managed to have the drawing removed and replaced with a different, yet similar image for a while, but they undid that bit of my handiwork</a>.\n</p><p>I can only do so much at one time, since after I make an edit (behind their backs), they \"ban\" my IP address from undoing their undoing, and I have to wait a few hours to a day or two before I can anything more against them.\n</p><p>That's the story there.\n</p><p>Also, under a spot of rage against them for the answer some of them gave me when I asked them why they hated me, I've alerted the media about it through e-mail. I've said nothing about you to them, but you may want to try to remove the stuff about you from the page ASAP.\n</p><p>Again, I am really sorry about this whole mess.\n</p><p>I pray for your emotional recovery.

It's not that actual sex-act that traumatises me, it's the fact that you fantasize doing such things to me when you know I would never. It's like, how do I know you're not going to abduct me and such? That was a figure of speech. You know what I mean? It creeps me out you have such thoughts about me. It's like you're stalking me so you really need to back off.\n</p><p>I mean thinking like that is one thing (though disturbing as well) But sitting down and actually drawing a detailed image of it is even worse. I don't like being around people like that at all!\n</p><p>I don't like being around people who think only of sex and pleasure. I don't care how lonely you are, I haven't had luck with relationships either, but I don't boast about being a \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Virgin_with_rage\" title=\"Virgin with rage\">virgin with rage</a>\" When you say things like that, it just makes it sound you're looking for someone to fuck.\n</p><p>I'm sorry to say this but you're partially to blame for some of the content on the site. Because things about me and things they quoted about me came from you obviously. You have those blog things and so you <a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_Chris%27s_edits_to_Encyclopedia_Dramatica#12_November\" title=\"List of Chris's edits to Encyclopedia Dramatica\">blabbed</a> to the whole cyber world about the angry <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Emails,_Aug-Dec_2007#Megan_is_annoyed_and_creeped_out\" title=\"Megan Emails, Aug-Dec 2007\">email</a> I sent you last summer. Ok, just WHOSE business is it anyway? I don't understand why you post things involving me like that. And you also made it sound that I just wrote you an angry email and you had nothing to do with it, when in fact the reason being was because I was sick of telling constantly to stop touching me. That is SEXUAL HARRASSMENT. I wrote the email in response to what YOU did wrong to me.\n</p><p>Although it may not seem like a big deal to you, it was to me. Just because I've allowed other guys to hug me, doesn't mean you automatically have that right. I have the <a href=\"/cwcki/Women%27s_rights\" title=\"Women's rights\">right</a> to decide who can get close to me. If a female doesn't like the way a guy advances or touches her, even if other females are ok with it- if that one female doesn't like it, it IS sexual harrassment. You greatly need to understand that.\n</p><p>That's all I have to say to you<br/>\nI'm too angry and upset to want to help with the website's demise. So sorry but you're on your own with that one.\n</p><p>PS I think it's rather amusing how you complain of these people defiling you. Yes many posts are ridiculous BUT you have defiled Mary Lee Walsh, and our wonderful security officers who were simply doing their job. Then you defiled me. And lied about it.\n</p><p>You need to stop with this mindset that the whole world's against you, and start taking some responsibility for once.

Imaginary sister?\" to \"I don't like where this is going\" and finally, \"Chris' own artwork portraying his sick fantasies.\" And to break my camel's back, they state in the second paragraph under \"The Comic Itself\", I quote, \"A later upload by CWC himself verified that he wants to have sex with his imaginary twin sister. So, this Crystal would be both his daughter and sister... In other words, he wants to impregnate his mother, then have sex with the offspring.\"\n</p><p>Secondly, I have TRIED to delete the nude drawing, even to replace it, but in the discussion page of my account I created to edit the page away from mockery, but every time I delete or replace the image, they would re-upload the original pic. They call what I'm doing AGAINST the \"article\" vandalism, and they tell me, \"vandalism is completely pointless (click here to find out why), and will get you a swift ban, so you might as well stop.\" And even though after they \"ban\" me, I wait a few hours to a couple of days and I am unbanned.

If I didn't have the foresight to put my pent-up frustrations and feelings in the form of something, I might have become an abusive maniac, so thank god for allowing me to release my bottled up frustrations in a more positive, yet not so \"Politically Correct\", and not physically hurting others, method.\n</p><p>Be the release as it may, I am hurting <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_Ego\" title=\"Chris and his Ego\">SOOOOO MUCH MORE</a> than you can be, because I have been taking the abuse from those <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jerks\" title=\"Jerks\">jerks</a> on E.D. If you want to get it all off the \"article\", be my guest; make your account, send your message of the \"Resistance\" and delete the Major Chunk off the page in edit; they will only undo your missile barrage of damage in one felt swoop.\n</p><p>I am depressed and emotionally exausted from <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress\" title=\"Stress\">ALL THIS STRESS</a>.
