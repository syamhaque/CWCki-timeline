These apologies, like most of the other times Chris tries to come off as emotional, often feel very forced and insincere, leading many <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">trolls</a> to wonder if Chris is even capable of feeling <b>remorse</b>.\n</p><p>It's not out of the question. A common trait of <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">autism</a> is a lack of cognitive empathy, meaning it's likely that Chris has a difficult time trying to understand what other people feel. Time and time again he's shown himself unable to understand others' feelings of <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_death\" title=\"Chris and death\">loss or sadness</a>. He seems equally incapable of understanding how his actions could possibly hurt or anger others. Additionally, Chris is also shown to be incapable of sharing the emotional experiences of others, being affected by them, and being able to respond with an appropriate emotion due to his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Narcissism\" title=\"Narcissism\">narcissism</a>. This ultimately shows that Chris is incapable of understanding and feeling other people's emotional states.\n</p><p>When he is expected to show remorse, it often seems as though he is just going through the motions, making the absolute minimum effort to get whoever he has upset to stop pestering him, so he can go back to his oblivious existence playing <a href=\"/cwcki/PlayStation_3\" title=\"PlayStation 3\">PlayStation 3</a>.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Concept_of_wrongdoing\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Concept of wrongdoing</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Motivation_to_apologize\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Motivation to apologize</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Common_traits_of_a_CWC_apology\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Common traits of a CWC apology</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Explanation\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Explanation</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Rationalization\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Rationalization</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href='#\"Maturing\"'><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">\"Maturing\"</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Retraction\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Retraction</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Shifting_blame\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Shifting blame</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#The_Wallflower\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The Wallflower</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Forgetting\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Forgetting</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#Index_of_Chris's_apologies\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Index of Chris's apologies</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#Conclusion\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Conclusion</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Concept_of_wrongdoing\">Concept of wrongdoing</span></h2>\n<p>Developing an understanding of right and wrong is an important part of a child's development. Very young children don't take into consideration what is ethically the right or wrong thing to do. They base their actions on whether they are punished or rewarded before they eventually internalize a consistent value system and learn to police their own behavior. Chris seems to be stuck in the former, childlike state. If something makes him feel bad, or if experience tells him he'll get in trouble for doing something, it must be wrong. If it makes him feel good or looks like it could have potential rewards, it must be right. Other considerations, such as what his <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_religion\" title=\"Chris and religion\">supposed faith</a> proscribes or how this will affect others, simply do not rank.\n</p><p>An excellent example would be how Chris managed to destroy his relationship with <a href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Schroeder\" title=\"Megan Schroeder\">Megan Schroeder</a>. Chris was at war with <a href=\"/cwcki/Encyclopedia_Dramatica\" title=\"Encyclopedia Dramatica\">Encyclopedia Dramatica</a>, who were, among other things, calling him <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">gay</a>. In an attempt to disprove their allegations, Chris uploaded <a href=\"/cwcki/ShecameforCWC.JPG\" title=\"ShecameforCWC.JPG\">a certain image</a> to the website, apparently under the belief that that sort of information overload would get them to shut up. When the denizens of ED assumed the image was of Crystal, Chris was quick to correct them. At no point did he even consider Megan's feelings. When she <a href=\"/cwcki/Megan_emails,_2008#Megan_is_scarred_by_ShecameforCWC.JPG\" title=\"Megan emails, 2008\">called him out</a>, Chris didn't realize he had done anything wrong and assumed she was upset simply because she didn't watch enough <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_sex\" title=\"Chris and sex\">porn</a>.\n</p>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">I understand.

The natural precursor to an apology is the internal realization that one has done something wrong, a realization that Chris's childish, self-centered mindset will not allow him to reach. In his mind, he's done something \"wrong\" only when the people around him react negatively. Furthermore, as a rule, he assumes that their reaction is just the result of some misunderstanding, reasoning that if he was just given the chance to explain what he was trying to accomplish, they would understand, and all would be forgiven.\n</p><p>Judging by <a href=\"/cwcki/Michael_Snyder_is_ColdHearted_and_Mean\" title=\"Michael Snyder is ColdHearted and Mean\">his plea for a hobby store's manager to \"forgive and forget\"</a>, it's very likely that Chris still operates on kindergartener-level moral philosophy in that he expects recipients of his apologies to immediately retract their disapproval and let him off the hook (which he might have experienced since it's a common scenario with smaller children and authority figures) despite being a grown adult, not realizing such a thing no longer applies to social situations after a certain point. Given his track record for <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">selfishness</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler%27s_Adult_Chronicles\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler's Adult Chronicles\">issues with growing up</a>, and <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_Boom_Protests\" title=\"Sonic Boom Protests\">resistance to change</a>, that would come as no surprise.\n</p><p>Moreover, Chris doesn't seem to understand that the purpose of an apology is essentially a promise not to repeat whichever negative behavior led to recompense in the first place, instead seemingly interpreting it as <a href=\"/cwcki/Alec_Benson_Leary_Phone_Call_3#Summary\" title=\"Alec Benson Leary Phone Call 3\">a magic phrase to clear his slate</a> so he can continue his self-serving endeavors unimpeded.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Motivation_to_apologize\">Motivation to apologize</span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:VivianLetsTalkBusiness.PNG\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"336\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/1/1b/VivianLetsTalkBusiness.PNG/300px-VivianLetsTalkBusiness.PNG\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/1/1b/VivianLetsTalkBusiness.PNG/450px-VivianLetsTalkBusiness.PNG 1.5x, /w/images/1/1b/VivianLetsTalkBusiness.PNG 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:VivianLetsTalkBusiness.PNG\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>TL;DR: I'm sorry, now give me money.</div></div></div>\n<p>As explained above, Chris's logic when it comes to matters of right and wrong is almost wholly reactionary. His rationale for apologizing follows the same pattern. He issues them only when made fully aware that he won't get what he wants unless he at least tries to appear genuinely remorseful. \n</p><p>Every apology Chris has ever made can be immediately connected to something Chris wants, and thinks he'll get if he says the magic words \"I'm sorry\". We almost never have to guess what that thing might be, he almost always mentions his desired goal in the same paragraph, sometimes even in the next sentence.\n</p>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">I wish to apologize to <a href=\"/cwcki/Michael_Snyder\" title=\"Michael Snyder\">Michael Snyder</a> for that mistake I made over nine months ago that got me kicked out of The GAMe PLACe...

In <a href=\"/cwcki/I_am_Alive\" title=\"I am Alive\">one notable case</a>, he admitted to ungentlemanly conduct regarding his feud with <a href=\"/cwcki/Asperchu\" title=\"Asperchu\">Asperchu</a>. It was a fairly obvious attempt to get <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia#CWCipedia_advertisements\" title=\"CWCipedia\">certain ads removed from the CWCipedia</a>, but, notably, he announced his intention to kill off the character of <a href=\"/cwcki/Simonla_Rosechu\" title=\"Simonla Rosechu\">Simonla Rosechu</a>, in accordance with <a href=\"/cwcki/Evan\" title=\"Evan\">her creator's</a> wishes. He didn't act quickly enough, and CWCipedia was taken down from the web altogether. Although his anger was understandable, Chris revealed in <a href=\"/cwcki/9_February_2010\" title=\"9 February 2010\">his next video</a> that he had never intended to kill Simonla in the first place, and that the apology was not TRUE and HONEST. We had all suspected as much, but it's nice to get a confirmation once in a while. After CWCipedia returned, he did indeed kill Simonla, but only under pressure, and in the most contrived, dull, yet very lulzy way possible.\n</p><p>The one apology that arguably highlights Chris's insincerity the most is his in-comic apology to the Asperpedia Four, which takes place <i>while <a href='/cwcki/Chris_and_hypocrisy#\"I_would_have_them_ESS-acuted!\"_—_Capital_Punishment' title=\"Chris and hypocrisy\">condemning them to death</a></i>. The cognitive dissonance this creates would be overwhelming to any sane person, but <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">for some reason</a>, Chris thought that this ludicrous non-apologetic apology was both okay and that the recipients would accept it as genuine. In that very same issue, in fact, Chris at one point sheds a tear after sealing up the populated <a href=\"/cwcki/4-cent_garbage.com\" title=\"4-cent garbage.com\">4-cent garbage.com</a> building and destroying it. You know, because faking remorse with crocodile tears <i>totally</i> justifies mass murder.\n</p><p>Chris's insincerity can also be seen in Chris's misadventures with <a href=\"/cwcki/The_Wallflower\" title=\"The Wallflower\">The Wallflower</a>. When the shit hit the fan and she cut off all ties with him, he made his usual <a href=\"/cwcki/%22Damian_Antaria%22,_PLEASE,_Don%27t_Leave_Me_-_I_NEED_YOU!!!\" title=\"&quot;Damian Antaria&quot;, PLEASE, Don't Leave Me - I NEED YOU!!!\">pathetic display of sorrow</a>, making it very clear in the process that he had only wanted her for <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sex\" title=\"Sex\">sex</a>. When his apology failed to work as planned, Chris became very angry and spiteful, and started <a href=\"/cwcki/Damien_Antaria_(CWCipedia_page)\" title=\"Damien Antaria (CWCipedia page)\">demanding that she apologize for hurting <i>his</i> feelings</a>.\n</p><p>Another came from his apology note on his <a href=\"/cwcki/Facebook\" title=\"Facebook\">Facebook</a> discovered in <a href=\"/cwcki/October_2012\" title=\"October 2012\">October 2012</a>. In it, he seemingly came to the realization that he had massively messed up, that about as many laughs had been gotten from him as possible and that he was sorry for it all happening. Surprisingly, it was a very well-written, unselfish apology that would seem somewhat convincing - right until he demanded that all instances of trolling and <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCki\" title=\"CWCki\">websites</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCki_Forums\" title=\"CWCki Forums\">dedicated</a> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki//cwc/\" title=\"/cwc/\">to</a> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Private_Villa_of_Corrupted_Citizens_(message_board)\" title=\"Private Villa of Corrupted Citizens (message board)\">him</a> be stopped and removed, and there was absolutely no mention made of him making any attempt to straighten up. All he wanted was all the bad stuff about him removed so he can feel better about himself. Had he not included that, people might have actually taken him seriously, but, <a href=\"/cwcki/Nudes\" title=\"Nudes\">as</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/28_October_2011\" title=\"28 October 2011\">usual</a>, he had to fuck himself over.\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Common_traits_of_a_CWC_apology\">Common traits of a CWC apology</span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Explanation\">Explanation</span></h3>\n<p>One recurring element in Chris's admissions of guilt is an explanation of why he did whatever he's apologizing for. The way these speeches are worded often indicates that Chris believes that if we just understood his intentions, we would all agree with him and that nobody would be offended. \n</p><p>A famous example appears in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Captain%27s_Log,_Stardate_April_28th,_2009\" title=\"Captain's Log, Stardate April 28th, 2009\">Captain's Log, Stardate April 28th, 2009</a> video. Chris explains that yes, he videotaped himself performing a selection of disturbing sex acts, but it was all for his sweetheart <a href=\"/cwcki/Ivy\" title=\"Ivy\">Ivy</a>, and this evidently renders his actions understandable and acceptable. Supposedly speaking to a young child who was deeply disturbed by his behavior, he tells her that his behavior was perfectly reasonable because he is both an adult and human. This combination of warped logic and an even more warped worldview was a crucial component of his breakthrough into mainstream infamy.\n</p><p>Another good example would be the time he <a href=\"/cwcki/Twin_Falling_Towers\" title=\"Twin Falling Towers\">used the worst terrorist attack in American history for an exceedingly bad joke</a>. After learning that <a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey\" title=\"Kacey\">Kacey</a> came from a military family, Chris did what was expected of him and made a <a href=\"/cwcki/Apology_for_9/11_Joke\" title=\"Apology for 9/11 Joke\">public apology</a>. However, he was more concerned with continuing to slander <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">Clyde Cash</a> and assuring us he was a <a href=\"/cwcki/United_States_of_America\" title=\"United States of America\">good American</a> (although he didn't know the words to his own national anthem)<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup> than with actually expressing remorse and making an attempt at recompense.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:193px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:SnuffOutClyde.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"194\" src=\"/w/images/f/fa/SnuffOutClyde.jpg\" width=\"191\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:SnuffOutClyde.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>This looks like a good idea.</div></div></div>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">The joke was mainly directed to how WEAK Clyde Cash was only, I had no idea or intention of offending anyone, other than Clyde, on such a massive world-wide level.\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:11px; padding:0 0 0 16px; vertical-align:bottom; width:20px\">”\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\" style=\"font-size:smaller; padding:8px 36px; text-align:right;\"><cite><a href=\"/cwcki/Apology_for_9/11_Joke#Apology_image_text\" title=\"Apology for 9/11 Joke\">Chris's written apology</a>.</cite>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>Within the same video, he changed the photoshop he'd done of the World Trade Center towers into birthday candles. That he saw no problem in presenting an image of the two buildings on fire and repeatedly calling them weak while he asserted that he was a good American proves that he <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Slow-in-the-mind\" title=\"Slow-in-the-mind\">completely missed the point</a> of what he was supposed to be apologizing for. He was far more concerned with sullying Clyde's name than with any blowback or offense his comments might have caused.\n</p><p>In at least one case, though, Chris came up with a fantastical reason related to <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">his fictional universe</a> for something he did wrong <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">as though it would be easily understood by anyone else as truth</a>. Specifically, when Chris attempted reparations with <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Mary Lee Walsh</a>, he explained that by slandering the \"real\" Mary Lee Walsh via comic villain counterpart, he allowed an evil witch to soil her reputation and that by retconning the \"evil\" Mary as Slaweel with her being portrayed getting arrested, he expected the \"good/real\" Mary would accept this nonsensical so-called \"apology\" and all would be well (not once admitting to violating campus regulations <i>countless times</i>, let alone personally attacking her when she tried to hash things out with him).\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Rationalization\">Rationalization</span></h3>\n<p>Chris is incredibly self-righteous. In his mind he is the only decent man left in the world, and everybody else is a stupid, evil <a href=\"/cwcki/JERKS\" title=\"JERKS\">JERK</a> whose sole mission in life is to cockblock him because he is <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">special</a>, and furthermore out of jealousy for his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_Ego\" title=\"Chris and his Ego\">many</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">\"successes\"</a> in life. This mindset gives Chris all the justification he needs to mistreat others, because as far as he's concerned they're all the bad guys, standing in the way of his <a href=\"/cwcki/Love_Quest\" title=\"Love Quest\">heroic quest</a>.\n</p><p>This \"Everything I do is right\" mindset shows through when he is forced to talk about his prior transgressions. Chris might offer a half-assed apology, simply to conform to the wishes of whoever he's talking to, but it will often be accompanied by a long explanation as to why he <i>had</i> to do it.\n</p>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">I was wrong...

Since Liquid wronged him by trolling him in the first place, anything he did in response was entirely justified.\n</p><p>Though as it would later turn out, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">ego</a> is not the only culprit behind Chris rationalizing deeds he should be apologetic for.\n</p><p>For a more recent example, Chris (in the throes of declining mental health) justified himself initiating his affair with Barb by arguing <a href=\"/cwcki/Jail_Communications\" title=\"Jail Communications\">in statements he wrote following his arrest</a> that he did it as a form of divine intervention to \"purify\" his elderly mother of her sins. To pour salt on an open gash, he eventually flat out <i>denied</i> that his \"Soul-Bonding\" was ever sexual in nature (<a href=\"/cwcki/Incest_Call\" title=\"Incest Call\">despite earlier admissions to sexual conduct with his mom existing</a>), once again proving that Chris doesn't truly feel remorse for any wrongdoing he commits.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\".22Maturing.22\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id='\"Maturing\"'>\"Maturing\"</span></h3>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">I Have Matured.\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:11px; padding:0 0 0 16px; vertical-align:bottom; width:20px\">”\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\" style=\"font-size:smaller; padding:8px 36px; text-align:right;\"><cite>Chris's catchphrase</cite>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>Ever since the <a href=\"/cwcki/DoopieDoOver\" title=\"DoopieDoOver\">Doopie Saga</a>, Chris had the tendency to claim that he has not only learned his lesson but that he has also \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Adult_Chronicles\" title=\"Adult Chronicles\">matured</a>\". More than anything, Chris uses this as an excuse to avoid any kind of responsibility or backlash from trolls, who understandably view him as childish for many of his interests and actions.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Retraction\">Retraction</span></h2>\n<p>Chris, believing that his actions are always right, nearly always has to be pressured into making any form of apology at all. Most, if not all, of his apology messages, are motivated by the people he <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Fuck_Quest\" title=\"Fuck Quest\">physically desires</a> (be they obvious troll or otherwise) or <a href=\"/cwcki/Asperchu\" title=\"Asperchu\">desires to appease</a>, rather than the public outcry he causes, and certainly not by any true sense of guilt. His retraction of an apology is often redundant because nobody believed he was truly remorseful in the first place, and just as hollow as the apology itself, in that Chris is quite happy to lie to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_Ego\" title=\"Chris and his Ego\">save face</a> or to gain <a href=\"/cwcki/China\" title=\"China\">something he wants</a>. For instance, Chris <b>finally</b> <a href=\"/cwcki/02_March_2010\" title=\"02 March 2010\">'sincerely' apologized to Alec and Mao</a> for his actions towards them on 2 March 2010. However, only a month later, on 8 April, he was talking to <a href=\"/cwcki/Jackie_E-mails#Chris's_only_friends:_trolls_and_his_parents\" title=\"Jackie E-mails\">Jackie</a> and, in an attempt to gain sympathy from her, claimed that Alec was \"trying to one-up [him] for months now\".\n</p><p>When trolls hacked his PSN accounts, Chris made <a href=\"/cwcki/A_near_public_apology\" title=\"A near public apology\">a near public apology</a>. A blatant attempt to get his PSN account back, the apology was, of course, chock full of lies and insincerity.\n</p><p>One of his favorite ways to smite his <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">invisible internet enemies</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Jerkop\" title=\"Jerkop\">real-life foes alike</a> is to lay a <a href=\"/cwcki/Curse-ye-ha-me-ha\" title=\"Curse-ye-ha-me-ha\">Curse-ye-ha-me-ha</a> upon them; thinking that he has powers akin to something more along the lines of Wicca, Voodoo, or Goku from <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Dragon_Ball_Z\" title=\"Dragon Ball Z\">DBZ</a> than with the <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_religion\" title=\"Chris and religion\">Christianity</a> he supposedly practices. He only issued the <a href=\"/cwcki/Curse-ye-ha-me-ha_Retraction\" title=\"Curse-ye-ha-me-ha Retraction\">Curse-ye-ha-me-ha Retraction</a> after <a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey\" title=\"Kacey\">his latest e-girlfriend</a> told him that he shouldn't have used the Curse-ye-ha-me-ha in the first place.\n</p><p>Considering that he <a href=\"/cwcki/Surfshack_Tito_(video)\" title=\"Surfshack Tito (video)\">quickly returned</a> to his ways of cursing, <a href=\"/cwcki/Don%27t_Mess_With_Me\" title=\"Don't Mess With Me\">threatening</a>, and <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_Drops_the_N-Bomb\" title=\"Chris Drops the N-Bomb\">insulting</a> his enemies, the sentiment obviously didn't stick.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Shifting_blame\">Shifting blame</span></h2>\n<p>When Chris isn't trying to justify the trouble he causes, he usually resorts to blaming others. The most famous example is him blaming <a href=\"/cwcki/Encyclopedia_Dramatica\" title=\"Encyclopedia Dramatica\">ED</a> for the end of his friendship with <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Megan\" title=\"Megan\">Megan</a>, even though it was because of a picture he himself thought up, drew, and then uploaded to his <a href=\"/cwcki/Encyclopedia_Dramatica\" title=\"Encyclopedia Dramatica\">article</a>. Chris had it literally screamed at him in <a href=\"/cwcki/Mumble_3\" title=\"Mumble 3\">Mumble 3</a>, but then, as now, he still doesn't know the true reason. The best anyone has ever been able to extract from Chris is that he came on too strong. While technically true, this is a vast understatement that fails to capture the massive amount of fault which lies with Chris (that is to say, all of it).\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Wallflower\">The Wallflower</span></h4>\n<p>Chris went to great lengths to keep the knowledge of <a href=\"/cwcki/The_Wallflower\" title=\"The Wallflower\">The Wallflower</a> away from the slanderous trolls of the Internet. However, he really wanted to credit her in one of his sycophantic Little Big Planet levels. Chris asked Wallflower if she thought it would be safe to credit Wallflower by her FF.net penname. Wallflower agreed as she was unable to find any obvious trails leading from her FF.net account to her Facebook account. Unfortunately for both of them, trolls still managed to find a link between the two accounts within 24 hours of Chris dropping her pen name. After she was linked to the site and promptly horrified by how much of her personal information had been compromised, she politely requested that the article be reworked with her privacy in mind. As much of the information in the original Wallflower article had very little to do with Chris, the request was deemed reasonable and the admins of the CWCki complied.\n</p><p>Frightened and disgusted by what she had found, <a href=\"/cwcki/%22Damian_Antaria%22,_PLEASE,_Don%27t_Leave_Me_-_I_NEED_YOU!!!\" title=\"&quot;Damian Antaria&quot;, PLEASE, Don't Leave Me - I NEED YOU!!!\">she broke off all contact with Chris</a>. She also clarified to the CWCki admins that they had never dated, never had any kind of relationship beyond casual association, and before her introduction to the CWCki she really didn't know much about him at all. Chris, however, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">not to be deterred</a>, proclaimed many times that they had <a href=\"/cwcki/Damien_Antaria_(CWCipedia_page)#What_had_happened\" title=\"Damien Antaria (CWCipedia page)\">been on several dates</a>, and <a href=\"/cwcki/Damien_Antaria_(CWCipedia_page)#What_had_happened\" title=\"Damien Antaria (CWCipedia page)\">\"Shared DNA\"</a>, along with enjoying a kiss and massage. Since this would have been Chris's \"real\" first kiss (aside from \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Chloe\" title=\"Chloe\">Chloe</a>\", a lie), it was considered important by obsessive CWCki editors to see if he remembers it later (The Wallflower CWCipedia page article was written on April the 19th). However, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jackie_e-mails_Part_2\" title=\"Jackie e-mails Part 2\">leaked e-mails from Jackie</a> show that by the 10th of April, <i>nine days before making this highly suspicious claim</i>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jackie_e-mails_Part_2#Jackie's_Questionaire_1\" title=\"Jackie e-mails Part 2\">Chris had either momentarily forgotten that he had been kissed</a>, something that would have been a monumental occasion in his life, lied on his CWCipedia about being kissed, or lied to Jackie about <i>not</i> being kissed (though that is very unlikely). Either way, he still lied about the kiss, although it's <i>possible</i> he's basing his story on a gross exaggeration of the truth (the two sharing a drinking straw is the current troll favorite for this).\n</p><p>In the month following their \"breakup\", Chris would go on to blame The Wallflower for <a href=\"/cwcki/Damien_Antaria_(CWCipedia_page)#What_had_happened\" title=\"Damien Antaria (CWCipedia page)\">having an internet presence at all</a>. From Chris's perspective, the whole incident was Wallflower's fault for having a Facebook page for trolls to discover in the first place. Chris repeatedly insisted that <i>Wallflower</i> was the one who needed to apologize to him (as she had okayed the use of her screen name), despite the fact that putting her screen name in the level was his idea in the first place. More than a year after the debacle, Chris <a href=\"/cwcki/Calling_Out\" title=\"Calling Out\">made it obvious</a> that he believes that the person who should apologize to Wallflower is Surfshack Tito rather than himself.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Forgetting\">Forgetting</span></h4>\n<p>Aside from directly shifting the blame by <a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_Chris%27s_lies\" title=\"List of Chris's lies\">lying</a>, Chris has been frequently known to \"forget\" important, critical details of his life, typically memories that either make him either look or feel bad. When <a href=\"/cwcki/Jackie_E-mails\" title=\"Jackie E-mails\">Jackie</a> was flirting with him by e-mails and found out about the CWCki, she asked Chris about cheating on <a href=\"/cwcki/Ivy\" title=\"Ivy\">Ivy</a> with <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Vanessa\" title=\"Vanessa\">Vanessa</a>, the full details of which are documented right <a href=\"/cwcki/Ivy\" title=\"Ivy\">here</a>. Chris, of course, claimed flat out that the whole thing was a troll deception and that Jackie shouldn't believe it. When Jackie informed Chris she found a video of him admitting it and confessing, Chris claimed he <a href='/cwcki/Jackie_E-mails_2#Chris_\"forgot\"_he_cheated_on_Ivy' title=\"Jackie E-mails 2\">\"forgot\" this \"portion\"</a>.\n</p><p>On <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Captain%27s_Log,_Stardate_October_27th,_2008\" title=\"Captain's Log, Stardate October 27th, 2008\">October 27th in 2008</a>, Chris nervously announced he had found his one true sweetheart; <a href=\"/cwcki/Chloe\" title=\"Chloe\">Chloe</a>. Many things immediately leapt out at the trolls as being lies, including his previous announcements on an <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris%27s_Sonichu_IRC_Chloe_Introduction\" title=\"Chris's Sonichu IRC Chloe Introduction\">IRC chat</a>. Due to Chris's unreliable short-term memory and inaction on the part of <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">trolls</a>, after the 27 October video Chloe was never mentioned again in a video by Chris. A little more than a year later, in <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_13\" title=\"Mailbag 13\">Mailbag 13</a>, rather than simply admit he was lying, Chris claimed \"I currently have no recollection of a Chloe\", even though she was supposedly the woman he had his first real kiss with.\n</p><p>In <a href=\"/cwcki/Mumble_6#On_The_Transgender_Community\" title=\"Mumble 6\">Mumble 6</a>, the troll army called out Chris on his statements regarding transgendered women. Chris claims that he forgot his previous statement, which may or may not be completely honest. In any event, Chris has discovered that (real or otherwise) a faulty memory is a socially acceptable way to dodge probing questions about one's past lies.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Index_of_Chris.27s_apologies\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Index_of_Chris's_apologies\">Index of Chris's apologies</span></h2>\n<p>Below is an abridged list of Chris's various apologies for his many, many misdeeds. Small apologies may have been missed here and there, but these are the big ones.\n</p>\n<ul><li>When Megan <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Emails,_2008#Megan_is_scarred_by_ShecameforCWC.JPG\" title=\"Megan Emails, 2008\">called Chris out on his reprehensible actions</a> regarding the porn he drew of her, he first <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Emails,_2008#Chris_apologizes_for_something,_what_could_it_be?\" title=\"Megan Emails, 2008\">copy-pasted \"Megan, I'm sorry for hurting you.\"</a> fifteen times in an e-mail to her, then <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Emails,_2008#Chris_thinks_she_was_scarred_because_she_doesn't_know_much_about_sex\" title=\"Megan Emails, 2008\">went into detail about how a handjob works</a>, figuring that <a href=\"/cwcki/Virgin_with_rage\" title=\"Virgin with rage\">sexual frustration</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Naive\" title=\"Naive\">ignorance</a> were the root causes of her <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_anger\" title=\"Chris and anger\">anger</a>. Yeah, about that...</li>\n<li>After Chris was banned from <a href=\"/cwcki/The_GAMe_PLACe\" title=\"The GAMe PLACe\">The GAMe PLACe</a>, he tried several times to get unbanned. The first was <a href=\"/cwcki/Apology_to_Game_%26_Hobby_Place\" title=\"Apology to Game &amp; Hobby Place\">a video where Chris apologies just so he can buy more junk</a>. The <a href=\"/cwcki/Michael_Snyder_is_ColdHearted_and_Mean\" title=\"Michael Snyder is ColdHearted and Mean\">second</a> was where he prepared a script, stashed a camera in his pocket, then walked into The Game Place to confront <a href=\"/cwcki/Michael_Snyder\" title=\"Michael Snyder\">Michael Snyder</a>, claiming he had changed and apologizing for his actions. After Michael flatly refused to listen and called the cops, Chris berated him and hoped God would forgive him for being so \"heartless and cruel\". Mike responded \"He probably will\", and Chris stormed out, but not before calling him a Jew.</li>\n<li>After threatening <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Vivian\" title=\"Vivian\">Vivian</a>'s life when she made better <a href=\"/cwcki/Audiobooks\" title=\"Audiobooks\">audiobooks</a> than he did, Chris apologized to her... then made a demand for a cut of her \"profits\", the two sentences separated by only a single dot.</li>\n<li>Chris made an <a href=\"/cwcki/A_near_public_apology\" title=\"A near public apology\">apology video</a> after <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_Calls_Out_Three_Na%C3%AFve_YouTubers\" title=\"CWC Calls Out Three Naïve YouTubers\">releasing a series of videos insulting various YouTubers.</a> Aside from sounding half-assed and insincere about it, Chris's motivation for doing so was clear: his PSN account was being held hostage by the last YouTuber he had insulted.</li>\n<li>In <a href=\"/cwcki/I_am_Alive\" title=\"I am Alive\">I am Alive</a>, Chris apologizes for his ungentlemanly conduct in regard to Asperchu. This was a transparent attempt to get the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Homo\" title=\"Homo\">homo</a> ads removed from the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia\" title=\"CWCipedia\">CWCipedia</a> and his behavior <a href=\"/cwcki/9_February_2010\" title=\"9 February 2010\">subsequent</a> to this apology proved he meant nothing he said in the video.</li>\n<li>In <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_10\" title=\"Sonichu 10\">Sonichu 10</a>, Chris apologized to the Asperchu Four <i>while simultaneously having them brutally executed</i>, including having one of them killed by a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sandy\" title=\"Sandy\">toddler</a>.</li>\n<li>After <a href=\"/cwcki/April_16_Fetish_Vids\" title=\"April 16 Fetish Vids\">filming himself performing sex acts for Ivy</a>, Chris <a href=\"/cwcki/Captain%27s_Log,_Stardate_April_28th,_2009\" title=\"Captain's Log, Stardate April 28th, 2009\">apologized for his actions</a>, supposedly to a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ching_Chong\" title=\"Ching Chong\">young girl</a> who had found the footage and was scarred by it. But he structured his apology to state that his behavior was, in fact, completely normal and that she shouldn't feel bad for watching it.</li>\n<li>In <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Matthew_5_27,_CWC_Confessions\" title=\"Matthew 5 27, CWC Confessions\">Matthew 5 27, CWC Confessions</a>, Chris apologized for cheating on <a href=\"/cwcki/Ivy\" title=\"Ivy\">Ivy</a>.</li>\n<li>In 2009, Chris apologized to <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Mary Lee Walsh</a>... for slandering her via his fictionalized villainous counterpart using her name (not for his actively defiant and vindictive behavior towards her, mind you). The contradictory nature of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Retroactive_continuity_in_Sonichu\" title=\"Retroactive continuity in Sonichu\">retcon</a> aside, Chris drew up a picture depicting this very act of remorse and even went to the trouble of <i>delivering a hand-framed copy to her office</i>, to which she responded with legal action. <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_26#Mary_Lee_Walsh_trolls_IRL\" title=\"Mailbag 26\">Chris took this as well as you'd expect</a>.</li>\n<li>After <a href=\"/cwcki/Twin_Falling_Towers\" title=\"Twin Falling Towers\">mocking the worst act of terrorism</a> in United States history, Chris made a subsequent <a href=\"/cwcki/Apology_for_9/11_Joke\" title=\"Apology for 9/11 Joke\">apology video</a>...which featured the Twin Towers as candles on a birthday cake, complete with multiple gouts of flame flying from the top.</li>\n<li>When <a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey\" title=\"Kacey\">Kacey</a> discovered Chris had pretended to be the <a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris\" title=\"Liquid Chris\">other, better Chris</a> in order to get a travel visa to <a href=\"/cwcki/China\" title=\"China\">China</a>, Chris apologized by way of his video <a href=\"/cwcki/I_Love_You_Kacey\" title=\"I Love You Kacey\">I Love You Kacey</a>, where he claimed he \"...was wrong for the right reasons.\"</li>\n<li>Chris <b>finally</b> <a href=\"/cwcki/02_March_2010\" title=\"02 March 2010\">'sincerely' apologized to Alec and Mao</a> for his actions towards them on the 2nd of March. However, only a month later on the 8th of April, he was talking to <a href=\"/cwcki/Jackie_E-mails#Chris's_only_friends:_trolls_and_his_parents\" title=\"Jackie E-mails\">Jackie</a> and, in an attempt to gain sympathy from her, claimed that Alec was \"trying to one-up [him] for months now\".</li>\n<li>On 21 <a href=\"/cwcki/October_2012\" title=\"October 2012\">October 2012</a>, Chris posted a public <a href=\"/cwcki/Facebook\" title=\"Facebook\">Facebook</a> status <a href=\"/cwcki/Facebook#Please_forgive_me!\" title=\"Facebook\">apologizing</a> for past misdeeds. He immediately asked that all online groups and \"individual hatreds\" be disbanded.</li>\n<li>On 17 <a href=\"/cwcki/December_2014\" title=\"December 2014\">December 2014</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Apology_Letters\" title=\"Apology Letters\">three letters</a> were leaked on the CWCki Forums that Chris wrote to the <a href=\"/cwcki/Charlottesville_Fashion_Square\" title=\"Charlottesville Fashion Square\">Charlottesville Fashion Square</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Wal-Mart\" title=\"Wal-Mart\">Wal-Mart</a>, and <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Mary Lee Walsh</a>. Naturally, in each one, he shoehorns in references to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Troll\" title=\"Troll\">trolls</a> causing <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress\" title=\"Stress\">stress</a>.</li>\n<li>On 29 <a href=\"/cwcki/October_2015\" title=\"October 2015\">October 2015</a>, Chris uploaded a <a href=\"/cwcki/Apology_for_past_homophobic_comments_and_homophobia.\" title=\"Apology for past homophobic comments and homophobia.\">YouTube video</a> explaining his apology for his prior homophobia. However, barely 1 minute into the video, he stressed the importance of <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu\" title=\"Rosechu\">Rosechu</a> being straight, showing a facet of his old self that hadn't truly disappeared completely.</li>\n<li>On 20 <a href=\"/cwcki/December_2020\" title=\"December 2020\">December 2020</a>, Chris was forced to apologize for being accused of stealing mods (which was backed by evidence). Chris, being controlled by Sonichu Prime denounces these claims yet \"apologizes\" anyway, owing to the issues being due to him still learning about modding and using Blender. He ended the tirade by telling the haters to be grateful and stop badmouthing him.</li>\n<li>On 24 <a href=\"/cwcki/September_2021\" title=\"September 2021\">September 2021</a>, in a <a href=\"/cwcki/Jail_Letter_-_19_September_2021\" title=\"Jail Letter - 19 September 2021\">letter</a> dated five days prior, Chris stated that he intended to enact 'repentance' for his crime of stealing 750 dollars from his aging mother's bank account - a crime he attempted to rationalize only moments before by citing his own poor finances and his fears arising from being made temporarily homeless, and for which he attempted to shift blame by claiming that Null had personally betrayed his trust and failed his 'destined test' by alerting others of his act of theft. Not a word was spared for <a href=\"/cwcki/Affair_with_Mother\" title=\"Affair with Mother\">certain other offenses</a>, just as recent and even more damning.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion</span></h2>\n<p>To Chris, remorse is nothing more than a formality that he must pantomime in order to get what he wants. Chris rarely, if at all, ever feels guilt for something he has said or done and expects either pity and sympathy or for those he hurt to forgive and forget. If you expect that he would ever be sincerely sorry for anything he does without an ulterior motive behind it, you are expecting way too much of him.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"
