If [redacted] had to call for assistance from another person, then I can only assume that you became loud, maybe even aggressive, and she felt threatened.\n</p><p>From what you said in your post, it sounds like you walked up to an Xbox display and deliberately vandalized it. It doesn't sound like anyone made you do it. There was nobody there to force you. This was your own bad idea. I don't really know you that well outside of Facebook, so I can't imagine why you'd do something like this in the first place. It sounds like you've got some pretty serious issues, and you should probably look into getting some counseling. Just my .02.\n</p><p>Ashley will probably be talking to you about the reunion.

I was not soliciting, and I seriously and certainly never had sex on the mind during my trials at all. Mary Lee Walsh interprets Solicitation, and gives me a most difficult time. Left me alone; nothing would have happened. She provoked; I retaliated by making her a Witch in my pages, as well as Cursing her in her face (not obscene language; a full on \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Curse-Ye-Ha-Me-Ha\" title=\"Curse-Ye-Ha-Me-Ha\">Curse-Ye-Ha-Me-Ha</a>\" energy attack; no punches or kicks or physical harm). Years later, I felt forgiving, and I personally went back to <a href=\"/cwcki/Piedmont_Virginia_Community_College\" title=\"Piedmont Virginia Community College\">PVCC</a> to apologize to her for the curse, actions and drawing her as a witch. I even drew an apology drawing for her and framed it.

And behind my back, consorts with Michael Snyder to work online with the Trolls and search for an excuse to ban me from the PLace.

That was the best thing for you to do under the circumstances. Hopefully, she is a reasonable person and she will lift the ban and allow you to continue to shop at your local Walmart. I get where you're coming from with the cost of gas (you've seen the pictures of what I drive on my Facebook page). I try to do all of my shopping as close to home as possible.\n</p><p>I'm sorry if my last email seemed a bit harsh. I've been having a rough week and there's been a lot of drama on Facebook lately. There are a lot of things going on in my life right now, and I'm trying to get my business going full-time, so I don't need any drama.\n</p><p>Let me know how things go with [redacted] and I'll think about re-adding you as a Facebook friend. I understand that you've been through a lot, and I sympathize with you. I was just disappointed by the way you handled this. I know that you're a better person than that.\n</p><p>I was also disappointed to hear about <a href=\"/cwcki/September_2013_Facebook_Posts#God_Trolls_Chris_Yet_Again\" title=\"September 2013 Facebook Posts\">your accident at El Agave</a>. What happened? Did that woman hit you, or did you accidentally scrape her car while you were backing up? From your post, it was obvious that you were very upset.\n</p><p>Don't let this stress you out. I've had my share of fender benders. Usually it's a pretty simple matter for the insurance company to deal with and you shouldn't have to do much more than fill out some paperwork, or maybe answer a few questions from the Insurance company. The important thing here is that you weren't hurt. Cars can always be fixed. Not so much with people.\n</p><p>I also wouldn't worry too much about the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jerkops\" title=\"Jerkops\">police</a> being there. They have to fill out an accident report, even if it's just something minor. A lot of insurance companies require any driver involved in an accident, even a minor one, to provide a copy of the accident report as well.\n</p><p>I can sympathize with your dislike of the police, some of them can be real assholes. I've learned the hard way though, that sometimes it's better to just stay calm and keep my mouth shut, or to just keep it simple and say \"yes officer\" and \"no officer\" until they let me go. A cop with a bad attitude can really ruin your day (trust me, I know).\n</p><p>So, it looks like we've both had a rough couple of days. I'm not angry at you Christian, I just need a little cooling off period. Try to understand my position. I haven't heard anything about you since high school, and now I'm involved in your Facebook drama. You're not the only one, as I said, I'm just getting a bit tired of the whole thing.\n</p><p>I hope your luck changes for the better and that this is the start of a better, happier, more productive week for you.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>9 September 2013\n<p><b>Re: Got Your Message</b>\n</p><p>Christian Weston Chandler to you\n</p><p>I will make a \"Most Trusted\" post on what happens with Wal-Mart. My mother has been informed about that.\n</p><p>I have disappointed myself with a lot of things I did; mostly the questionable <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Videos\" title=\"Videos\">videos</a> I was tricked into doing by the Trolls that are on <a href=\"/cwcki/YouTube\" title=\"YouTube\">YouTube</a> or wherever, long out of my grasp.\n</p><p>The accident was bumper scratches; <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tobacky\" title=\"Tobacky\">smokers</a> are going to be harsh and grumpiest. I have never smoked. The details have been sorted out by my State Farm rep.\n</p><p>I get your difficult time: transitions in your own business and jobs are all enduring chores.\n</p><p>I continue to take my <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_health\" title=\"Chris and health\">medications</a> for my anxieties and blood pressure.\n</p><p>In my rounding up our classmates, I did not expect your offer to take up helping me bust the Trolls and bad people who have been bothering me. I mean, first impressions on my end when i first read it: \"Shady\" was a word that came to mind. But then you elaborated further, which was good. Every person has their own bunch of stress and problems. I would not encourage. Googling my name, but the hundreds to thousands of insulting, hate-filled and embarrassing content and stuff; me, being the subject and the Prime of all that... Not to mention all of the stories: true, exaggerated, slandered, and false/fabricated; all of the \"Dramadaries\"... It ends up sounding obvious that emotions will rise in my head near or most daily.\n</p><p>Soldier, you volunteered and offered your services, care, understanding and friendship (granted, I was the one who sent the request, because we are of the same school class blood (blood being metaphoric), and we are of the same generation. You have the right to unvolunteer, but I have seen you as a true and great friend in your genuine responses to my problems. And I am truly blessed to have you as my friend now, in my difficult times, among everyone else who here all care as well. Not a lot of people would do that in this corrupted world.\n</p><p>From my perspective, I hardly remembered most of my classmates, aside from my closest friends, and yet to hear it from you that I was remembered, and even better from more of the School Class Blood that I was little or none acquainted with as well, They remembered me too. And to learn this after more than a decade is not only flattering to me, but it emotionally goes a lot deeper. Learning that I actually had more than an inkling of popularity, when for the long time, I had understood and accepted that I was hardly popular. And I had missed out on a Lot during the MHS years. I did not join any clubs, I did not date any girls (Yet I was good friends and was friendly with a number of them. I was really <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Naive\" title=\"Naive\">Naive</a> on the subject of <a href=\"/cwcki/Dating\" title=\"Dating\">Dating</a>), no \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_8\" title=\"Sonichu 8\">wild Spring Breaks</a>\". I was not invited to many parties. Kellie Andes invited me to her 18th. I went to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Prom\" title=\"Prom\">Seinor Prom</a> with my mother, and Tiffany Gowen asks me to dance. Popularity was another subject I was Naive or unaware of. A couple of times, in the hallway, I was even slapped on my butt by a <a href=\"/cwcki/Niggos\" title=\"Niggos\">black girl</a>; I turned her into Mr. Don Skeen. I interpreted it similar to sexual harassment, but I did not comprehend that it might have meant a crush interest. I never knew her, or her name.\n</p><p>But I digress. You are right to feel overwhelmed in response to my drama. Anyone who has just become friends with anyone will feel that way upon the initial or eventual small or great drama of one or the other's life. I feel the same kind of overwhelming emotions from learning my unknown popularity level. I am elated on one hand, and in the other, I feel sad, because there were a number of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Hanky-panky\" title=\"Hanky-panky\">things and perks</a> I learned from TV and movies that Popular People tend to get (up to the point where it all goes to their heads and gets them corrupted); perks and blessings that the unpopular would have wished for. And that the naive hardly would become aware of.\n</p><p>The online (worldwide) popularity of my <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(character)\" title=\"Sonichu (character)\">Sonichu</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu\" title=\"Rosechu\">Rosechu</a> (and city of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Cwcville\" title=\"Cwcville\">Cwcville</a>, VA) had become far too overwhelming for me to bear. Especially the input from all of the Trolls, Cyber-Bullies and Bad People, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jerkops\" title=\"Jerkops\">Jerkops</a>, Mary Lee Walsh, Michael John Snyder, Megan Schroeder, etc. I was not mentally designed or capable of coping with such a high popularity.\n</p><p>Do you understand a point I'm trying to make, because I did have a point to make earlier, or I thought I did,... But my thoughts were interrupted. I really hate when that happens.\n</p><p>A question set comes to my mind that I believe I would appreciate an answer to, and please pass it around to the other classmates as well.\n</p><p>How Popular was I, Christian Weston Chandler (<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Spanish\" title=\"Spanish\">appoledo espan~ol, Ricardo</a>)? (I picked out the nickname for my first Spanish Class out of two). Was I considered at least cute by the girls (women now)? What kind of group, or click, was I believed, or appeared to be, belonging to? What characteristics, deeds, or created items from my hands and mind, contributed to the school popularity?\n</p><p>Hell, with my brain, these questions and issues and whatnot, I'm as popular as <a href=\"/cwcki/My_Little_Pony\" title=\"My Little Pony\">Derpy Hooves</a>. I do sympathize with her and her impairments. And she is really cute and appealing in her own way.\n</p><p>Anyway, I still deeply care a lot about everyone who cares about me as well, as well all of my friends and family. Our Millennium MHS Class; I consider everyone, regardless of current status, situation or whatever, and especially regardless of lack of acquaintanceship on my part; all my family that I am looking to bring together in Good Friendship and for our Family Photo that is our Reunion.\n</p><p>The \"<a href=\"/cwcki/My_Little_Pony\" title=\"My Little Pony\">Equestria Girls</a>\" movie and the <a href=\"/cwcki/Lego\" title=\"Lego\">Lego</a> Friends High School building set have really started turning my life around in inspiring me to begin the <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">rounding up beginning of August</a>. For Everybody, I highly recommend the movie. Commercial as it may be, it is truly inspirational in its message of Seeking Friendship, or forever being alone. And even better the Cafeteria Song is like a Uniting Pep Rally Song that just really brought me up from the deepest of depression, sadness and loneliness.\n</p><p>I'll wrap it up for now, and I will copy my popularity questions onto my timeline for High School Only.

Honesty and integrity are absolutely essential if you want to be a success in life, and the first step to achieving that success is to learn to be honest with yourself.

As far as her ruining your high school memories, do you really think it would be better to continue living a lie? Accept this revelation for what it's worth, try to learn something from it, and get on with your life. We all have to learn to deal with disappointments at some time in our lives. It's all part of being an adult. If this is the worst disappointment you ever have to face, then consider yourself lucky. Other people have gone through much worse, yet they somehow managed to put it all behind them and move on.

You're already on thin ice as it is with a lot of people over that rape fantasy porn you drew of your former friend. Nobody is buying your apology. You claim to be sorry for what you did to this woman, and yet you put her in detention in your Lego high school video. Yes, I saw the video, a lot of us did (whether we wanted to or not). Pestering people with private messages isn't going to endear you to anyone. People are having just as bad, if not a worse reaction to your 911 video. What is the matter with you that you could do something like this? You do know that there are MHS alumni who are or have been in the military and / or have families or friends that are in the military. How do you think watching that video made them feel? \n</p><p>Didn't your father serve in the military?

If you want to have - and keep friends, you're going to have to get your act together. I don't know how many other people have seen your 911 video. It was actually another MHS person sent it to me.
