Chris thought that the fire started around 2:00 A.M.; however, the official report states that the 911 call wasn't received until 2:44 A.M.

The cord was looped over the top of the door, and the friction caused by the motion of the door had abraded the cord, starting the fire.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup> Chris claimed that the brewer was off when the fire started, although he admitted that <a href=\"/cwcki/Honor_roll\" title=\"Honor roll\">it wasn't unplugged</a>. Why the Chandlers had an extension cord running out of the bathroom to plug in a coffee maker is anyone's guess, but it probably has something to do with Barb's hoarding. It is worth noting that in <a href=\"/cwcki/Tour_of_Chris%27s_House_II\" title=\"Tour of Chris's House II\">Chris's second video tour of his home</a>, coffee cups are spotted around his bathroom sink, suggesting that the bathroom has become the primary source of water. Said video also shows the blatant fire hazard that was the Chandler home, with piles of paper and plastic inside a barely standing structure of dry wood.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Victims_and_survivors\">Victims and survivors</span></h2>\n<p>Chris reports that he, his mother, and his pets Clover, Snoopy and Lucy escaped the blaze unharmed. Unfortunately, Scamper, one of the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chandler_cats\" title=\"Chandler cats\">Chandler cats</a>, was killed in the blaze from smoke inhalation and was discovered by the cleaners and buried in the backyard by Chris.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup>\n</p><p>According to the news report, one of the firefighters suffered minor, unspecified injuries while putting out the fire. Considering how difficult it had been for Chris to navigate his junk-ridden hallways, it is likely that, in the rush to fight the fire, one firefighter may have tripped over the clutter. Chris told Catherine and Al that firefighters were unable to enter the house through either door because of the hoard, and had to climb in through windows.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Firefighters\">Firefighters</span></h3>\n<p>In the aftermath of the house fire, Barbara found that a knock-off Dali painting and her purse were missing, and believed someone had stolen them. Chris repeated that belief in a personal email sent to a friend, in which he suggested that a \"greedy firefighter\" or a thief taking advantage of the unlocked door had made off with the items.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Extent_of_damage\">Extent of damage</span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:14305011100_debcde366f_b.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"224\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/a/ac/14305011100_debcde366f_b.jpg/300px-14305011100_debcde366f_b.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/a/ac/14305011100_debcde366f_b.jpg/450px-14305011100_debcde366f_b.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/a/ac/14305011100_debcde366f_b.jpg/600px-14305011100_debcde366f_b.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:14305011100_debcde366f_b.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Photo of the melted Lego Manchester High School, taken within the house on 11 Jan 2014.</div></div></div>\n<p>Chris wrote that he was able to save his wallet, Barb's medication, some clothes and shoes, and his iPhone (as shown in <a href=\"/cwcki/Brushfire_Video\" title=\"Brushfire Video\">a later video uploaded through YouTube Capture</a>). Soon after the fire, Chris was also observed on <a href=\"/cwcki/Miiverse\" title=\"Miiverse\">Miiverse</a>, not to mention he eventually bought <i>Super Mario Maker</i>, heavily implying that he managed to save his Wii U and possibly at least one of his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/3DS\" title=\"3DS\">3DS</a>'s. He could have also acquired another Wii U, but this is unlikely. He was also seen on his PSN, showing that he either still had his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PS3\" title=\"PS3\">PS3</a>, or that he promptly acquired another (also unlikely.) He even had his old <a href=\"/cwcki/PSEye\" title=\"PSEye\">PSEye</a>.\n</p><p>In <a href=\"/cwcki/Reaching_Out_to_Game_Developers.\" title=\"Reaching Out to Game Developers.\">Reaching Out to Game Developers.</a>, uploaded on 19 <a href=\"/cwcki/November_2015\" title=\"November 2015\">November 2015</a>, Chris shows off his <a href=\"/cwcki/Scrapbook_of_Fail\" title=\"Scrapbook of Fail\">Scrapbook of Fail</a>, confirming the fire did not destroy all of the original <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a></i> comics and artwork.\n</p><p>Chris stated on Facebook that everything else was \"considered physically lost.\" However, he later revealed to Catherine that his mother had rented a storage unit to hold items which had been recovered from the house. Al and Catherine also noted that the rental house was piled high with boxes and trash. As is typical of hoarders, Barb probably decided that much that was burned or water-damaged was actually salvageable. \n</p><p>A fan viewed the house two days after the fire, and found that while the exterior structure of the house appeared largely intact, there was apparently sufficient damage to the roof that it had to be covered over with plastic cladding. Some of the exterior wood paneling had also warped and twisted, presumably due to being near where the fire was burning at its strongest, though due to the house's exact layout being unknown, it's hard to say where exactly this was. The house's windows had been boarded over (as is standard in house fires of this kind), making it impossible to get any exact details on the house's interior condition.\n</p><p>It is unclear to what extent Chris's personal possessions survived the flames. The <a href=\"/cwcki/Lego\" title=\"Lego\">Lego</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Manchester_High_School\" title=\"Manchester High School\">High School</a> escaped only partially melted, and he was able to use some of the smokey pieces to reconstruct the structure. He also employed his creative <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Geinus\" title=\"Geinus\">geinus</a> to build a <a href=\"/cwcki/ReBrick#Billboard_Person_from_Melting_Chaos\" title=\"ReBrick\">surprisingly-original sculpture</a> out of the damaged pieces. Two copies of his <a href=\"/cwcki/Manchester_High_School\" title=\"Manchester High School\">high school</a> yearbooks survived, albeit with smoke and water damage. At least one of his <a href=\"/cwcki/Pixelblocks\" title=\"Pixelblocks\">Pixelblocks</a> creations and a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Medallion\" title=\"Medallion\">medallion</a> survived. In reply to a comment on his <a href=\"/cwcki/EBay\" title=\"EBay\">eBay</a> auction of his autographed photos, Chris claimed that the <a href=\"/cwcki/The_Classic\" title=\"The Classic\">\"Classic\" shirt</a> was lost in the flames; however, three years later, he revealed the shirt had in fact survived, albeit badly damaged.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]</a></sup> He also confirmed that his Nintendo GameCube was a goner as well. The <a href=\"/cwcki/Crumple-Lope\" title=\"Crumple-Lope\">Crumple-Lope</a> survived the fire as well as some cards from <a href=\"/cwcki/The_Wall_of_Originals\" title=\"The Wall of Originals\">The Wall of Originals</a>.

Large numbers of school books and documents also survived the fire, but were thrown away once the renovations began.\n</p><p>Over the year, Chris bought multiple Lego sets to replace those lost.

The package was eventually held at a post office in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Charlottesville\" title=\"Charlottesville\">Charlottesville</a> and withdrawn by the Chandlers. Chris made a <a href=\"/cwcki/Facebook\" title=\"Facebook\">Facebook</a> post about it, thanking those involved before diverging to express his distaste for the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCki\" title=\"CWCki\">CWCki</a>. A note was sent alongside the goods:\n</p>\n<blockquote><p>Hey Chris!\n</p><p>Your Sonichu friends have heard about the house fire, and to help you out we put together a care package as CWC as we could! In a few days, 34 donated and collected over $900 towards getting this stuff out to you!\nSince your bathroom is where it started, I’ve focused on buying toiletries and hygienic stuff to keep you clean and healthy as you recover from the damages. I could not spend all the money collected, so I’ve also included a money order for $500 that you should give to your mother. She can cash it out and buy whatever you guys need to keep chugging. Don’t forget to get something nice for your pets, too!\n</p><p>I know you often feel that life is hopeless, but there’s good in the world and in people. I hope this package helps you see that. No person on the Internet can ever take away your right to be happy. You must find reasons to enjoy life, even when there are enemies trying to bring you down.\n</p><p>I’ve included some arts and crafts to help you take your mind off things. I think your fans would really like to see what you come up with, because it’s been a very long time since we’ve seen anything new from you. Try to create something that makes you happy and that you can be proud of.\n</p><p>Good luck with everything, Chris. Keep hate out of your heart and look forward to each day.\nWe will be around if you need us.\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<center><ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\">\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\"><div style=\"width: 155px\">\n<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><div style=\"margin:41px auto;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Carepackage_box.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"68\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/1/13/Carepackage_box.jpg/120px-Carepackage_box.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/1/13/Carepackage_box.jpg/180px-Carepackage_box.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/1/13/Carepackage_box.jpg/240px-Carepackage_box.jpg 2x\" width=\"120\"/></a></div></div>\n<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n<p>Care package.\n</p>\n</div>\n</div></li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\"><div style=\"width: 155px\">\n<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><div style=\"margin:41px auto;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Carepackage_contents.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"68\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/0/07/Carepackage_contents.jpg/120px-Carepackage_contents.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/0/07/Carepackage_contents.jpg/180px-Carepackage_contents.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/0/07/Carepackage_contents.jpg/240px-Carepackage_contents.jpg 2x\" width=\"120\"/></a></div></div>\n<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n<p>Its contents.\n</p>\n</div>\n</div></li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\"><div style=\"width: 155px\">\n<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><div style=\"margin:41px auto;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Carepackage_letter.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"68\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/8/86/Carepackage_letter.jpg/120px-Carepackage_letter.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/8/86/Carepackage_letter.jpg/180px-Carepackage_letter.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/8/86/Carepackage_letter.jpg/240px-Carepackage_letter.jpg 2x\" width=\"120\"/></a></div></div>\n<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n<p>Note.\n</p>\n</div>\n</div></li>\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 155px\"><div style=\"width: 155px\">\n<div class=\"thumb\" style=\"width: 150px;\"><div style=\"margin:43px auto;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Carepackage_facebook.png\"><img alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"64\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/e/e9/Carepackage_facebook.png/120px-Carepackage_facebook.png\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/e/e9/Carepackage_facebook.png/180px-Carepackage_facebook.png 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/e/e9/Carepackage_facebook.png/240px-Carepackage_facebook.png 2x\" width=\"120\"/></a></div></div>\n<div class=\"gallerytext\">\n<p>Chris's update on Facebook.\n</p>\n</div>\n</div></li>\n</ul></center>\n<p>A note by Chris that was posted on the website of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Wesley_Memorial_United_Methodist_Church\" title=\"Wesley Memorial United Methodist Church\">Wesley Memorial United Methodist Church</a> attest that the church had also provided donations to the Chandlers in response to the house fire.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-8\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">[8]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Thanks to All from the Chandlers: “Thank you all for your donations and prayers in my mother and I’s misfortune with the fire in our house on January 10th morning.  Our insurance, State Farm, agent was most helpful to us with temporary hotel accommodations, and our current rental house residence.  It will take up to six months for the reconstruction of our original house.  Our dogs and cat have settled in our new home well as well, and we are faring okay.  Financially, it is slim, and we are unsure of being reimbursed for our turned-in receipts to our agent.  But we have recovered many to most of our belongings from the house that did not get destroyed in the fire, as well as replacing some of them. . . . Aside from that, my mother and I are suffering to recovering from bronchitis (hit me first on the tenth of February; hit her a week later; we have prescribed antibiotics, juice and chicken noodle soup to help us recover).  I have been feeling better lately. Again, thank you all so much for caring and helping us in our time of loss and need.”—Christian\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span id=\"The_Return_of_Chris.27s_House\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Return_of_Chris's_House\">The Return of Chris's House</span></h2>\n<p>On 3 <a href=\"/cwcki/December_2014\" title=\"December 2014\">December 2014</a>, Chris announced that 14 Branchland Court was being reconstructed, and by <a href=\"/cwcki/January_2015\" title=\"January 2015\">January 2015</a> he was safely moved back in. Between those dates, however, he was forced to briefly stay at <a href=\"/cwcki/26_December_2014\" title=\"26 December 2014\">Albemarle Regional Jail</a>. Chris's newer videos show small areas of the now-renovated house - Chris's room, whilst still full of boxes of clutter and other things, has been repainted in magnolia and has had the wooden cladding removed, making the room look much lighter and less claustrophobic, for example. In addition, with the fire destroying much of the hoard, the building as a whole is in a much more sound condition, although only time will tell as to how long this will last.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Years_later\">Years later</span></h3>\n<p>In March 2018, <a href=\"/cwcki/Tour_of_Chris%27s_House_III\" title=\"Tour of Chris's House III\">Tour of Chris's House III</a> was filmed, showing the house becoming more cluttered again, with boxes of junk, furniture &amp; toys again piled carelessly throughout the dwelling.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/cwcki/January_2014_Facebook_Posts\" title=\"January 2014 Facebook Posts\">January 2014 Facebook Posts</a> - Facebook posts Chris posted about the house fire.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Misc_E-mails\" title=\"Misc E-mails\">Misc E-mails</a> - E-mails exchanged between Chris and his classmates about the house fire.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Rental_House\" title=\"Rental House\">Rental House</a> - The Chandlers' temporary household after the incident.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"/cwcki/December_2016_Facebook_posts#Number_14_was_aflame_in_'14._LOL\" title=\"December 2016 Facebook posts\">December 2016 Facebook posts#Number 14 was aflame in '14.
