Ed Winkler Banned me from the church for a month. He has Banned me from Speaking my peace during the Sharing of Joys and Concerns, and from that, I have felt unnecessarily Silenced. I also feel my meetings with Rocky no longer have much effect on me or my life. My life continues to be at a disappointing standstill of sadness, loneliness and great stress. Only the people way older than me ever do so much as greet me, and I have very little to share in common with any of them. Nobody even close to my age, or even in their twenties, gives me much to do, or include me in their conversations.\n</p><p>Aside from that, I am hated by a number of people for <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">reasons</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Niggos\" title=\"Niggos\">beyond</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Death_threats\" title=\"Death threats\">my</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Jason_Kendrick_Howell_message\" title=\"Jason Kendrick Howell message\">full</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Vivian_Gee#Extortion_by_Chris\" title=\"Vivian Gee\">understanding</a>, because I always tried to be a good and nice person for a long time. And in public, I am constantly overlooked, ignored or ostracized by Everybody. Even speaking out gets me absolutely no attention. I continue to be paranoid of most everyone, because of them likely being among the Internet Trolls that still continue to haunt and taunt me. I am still long desperate for a woman to be my <a href=\"/cwcki/Love_Quest\" title=\"Love Quest\">Sweetheart</a>. I am tired of being single, dang it. I continue to serve my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Barb\" title=\"Barb\">family</a> the best I can, and I continue to feel sad, depressed and lonely. My heart feels numb, and I am forced to keep a great emotional distance from Everybody outside my house and home. I am an <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">autistic</a> mental and emotional mess, and there is very little I can do to help myself, beyond my knowledge. And <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/God\" title=\"God\">God</a> sees fit for some (hate-filled) reason to continue to curse me as a jinx.\n</p><p>And, so, the church is not helping me much in my life, mentally, or emotionally, at all. So I will not be coming back for a long time.\n</p><p>Sent from my iPhone\n</p><p>Stay Safe,\n</p><p>Christian W.

The letter also reveals that Chris has earned himself a <a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_places_that_have_banned_Chris\" title=\"List of places that have banned Chris\">temporary ban</a> from the church, probably because the minister was tired of hearing Chris ramble about <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">da trolls</a> during the homily. In a rare moment of insight, Chris also notes that <a href=\"/cwcki/Rocky_Shoemaker\" title=\"Rocky Shoemaker\">Rocky Shoemaker</a> has been ineffective as a counsellor.\n</p><p>It should also be noted that Chris had asked Rocky to distribute copies of this exact letter to the congregation, effectively demanding she distribute not only \"proof\" of her own counselling inadequacy but also a letter insulting God to an entire Methodist congregation.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"In_the_comics\">In the comics</span></h2>\n<p>The <i>Sonichu</i> comics feature a church called Samuel Memorial United Christian Church, located outside of <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-ang_cwcipedia_12-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-ang_cwcipedia-12\">[12]</a></sup> The name of the fictional Church is most likely based on the name of Chris's real church.
