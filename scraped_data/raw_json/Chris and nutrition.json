He is an infamous fast food lover, eating at either <a href=\"/cwcki/McDonald%27s\" title=\"McDonald's\">McDonald's</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Burger_King\" title=\"Burger King\">Burger King</a> or some other fast food restaurant at least once a day. He has been known to dine out up to 4 times a day. The fact that he's merely fat and not morbidly obese with such an awe-inspiring calorific intake and inactive lifestyle suggests a fairly high metabolism, one which will almost certainly not last indefinitely. The frequency of his fast food trips was confirmed in 2015 when a <a href=\"/cwcki/Kiwi_Farms\" title=\"Kiwi Farms\">Kiwi Farms</a> user sent him $500 to see what he would do with it.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Consumption_of_food\">Consumption of food</span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:202px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Sonic_rainboom_$500_1.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"790\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/0/08/Sonic_rainboom_%24500_1.png/200px-Sonic_rainboom_%24500_1.png\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/0/08/Sonic_rainboom_%24500_1.png/300px-Sonic_rainboom_%24500_1.png 1.5x, /w/images/0/08/Sonic_rainboom_%24500_1.png 2x\" width=\"200\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Sonic_rainboom_$500_1.png\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Chris eats at multiple fast food restaurants, visiting McDonald's 10 times in 13 days, eating at other chains as well in the same documented period.</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:202px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Hypnosis_for_fatter_ass.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"262\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/e/e4/Hypnosis_for_fatter_ass.png/200px-Hypnosis_for_fatter_ass.png\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/e/e4/Hypnosis_for_fatter_ass.png/300px-Hypnosis_for_fatter_ass.png 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/e/e4/Hypnosis_for_fatter_ass.png/400px-Hypnosis_for_fatter_ass.png 2x\" width=\"200\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Hypnosis_for_fatter_ass.png\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Chris wants to use subliminal hypnosis to make his belly slimmer but his ass fatter.</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:202px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Recycle.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"446\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/4/48/Recycle.jpg/200px-Recycle.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/4/48/Recycle.jpg/300px-Recycle.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/4/48/Recycle.jpg/400px-Recycle.jpg 2x\" width=\"200\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Recycle.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Chris tends to drink large amounts of soft drinks daily.

His complexion also gives insight into his daily nutrition, often showing various signs of acne and acne scarring.\n</p><p>According to Chris, he eats more vegetables than any other food group.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]</a></sup> The veracity of this statement is dubious, given what is known about Chris's medical history and health in general (as well as his tendency to lie).\n</p><p>During the <a href=\"/cwcki/Father_Call\" title=\"Father Call\">Father Call</a>, Chris told <a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey\" title=\"Kacey\">Kacey</a>'s father that he was prescribed <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atorvastatin\" title=\"wikipedia:Atorvastatin\">Lipitor</a> for his high cholesterol. He claimed he stopped taking the drug in fall 2009, but whether he was being honest (especially given the number of obvious <a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_Chris%27s_lies\" title=\"List of Chris's lies\">lies</a> he told about his health in the course of the rest of the call) is uncertain.\n</p><p>When Chris admits to going to McDonald's regularly for his meals (including the time in the father call) he will often fall back on another lie that he only eats the salads provided and drink the lemonade. This is ironic as McDonald's salads were actually proven to contain <i>more</i> calories than an average Big Mac meal, due to the sauce that came with them. Chris also seems to be under the impression that lemonade is healthy because it has (or at least tastes vaguely like) lemons despite them being just as unhealthy as any other type of soda.\n</p><p>In 2016, he began listening to <a href=\"/cwcki/Subliminal_Frequency_Hypnosis\" title=\"Subliminal Frequency Hypnosis\">Subliminal Frequency Hypnosis</a> videos under the false believe that they would improve his health. He liked videos such as \"Lose Weight Super Fast!\", \"Eliminate Armpit Odor Permanently Fast!\", \"Lower Your Blood Pressure Fast! Hypertension Treatment\", and \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Fart_Song\" title=\"Fart Song\">Produce Odorless Farts Fast!</a>\". There is no sort of scientific and medical evidence that proves listening to binaural beats can do these things – the only real health effect is hearing loss if listened to at a high volume, and maybe a headache.\n</p><p>In 2017, Chris had a brief online relationship with <a href=\"/cwcki/Jessica_Quinn\" title=\"Jessica Quinn\">Jessica Quinn</a>, who has a fat fetish and influenced Chris with it. The Sonichu comic features an obese Rosechu in <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_12\" title=\"Sonichu 12\">issue 12</a>. After their breakup, Chris consumed a large bowl of ice cream, then took a side photo of his gut, saying, \"THIS!!! Right Here was ALLLLL HERS!!!!!!\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-7\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">[7]</a></sup> This marks one of the only times that Chris has admitted that he has <a href=\"/cwcki/Obesity\" title=\"Obesity\">Obesity</a> issues.\n</p><p>In 2019, Chris showed us his idea of a \"salad\", mostly made with unhealthy ingredients like bacon bits and croutons.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-8\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">[8]</a></sup>\n</p><p>In 2020, Chris claimed to make breakfast omelettes/scrambled eggs with ghost pepper sauce or spinach.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-9\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">[9]</a></sup>\n</p><p>In October 2023, Chris posted photos of his snack bowl, consisting of fruits, a large chunk of dark chocolate, and a liberal amount of what appears to be whipped topping. Chris touted the vitamin benefits of the fruits among the snacks, but unfortunately for him, the nutritional benefit is outweighed by the excessive amount of sugars contained in the bowl.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-10\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">[10]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Jail_food\">Jail food</span></h2>\n<p>Since the <a href=\"/cwcki/Jail_Saga\" title=\"Jail Saga\">Jail Saga</a> saw Chris incarcerated for quite a while, it's safe to assume he broke his long standing policy of <a href=\"/cwcki/28_October_2011\" title=\"28 October 2011\">not eating prison food</a> and entered the regular diet alongside all the other jail inmates. Chris stated that he liked the selection of food items the jail had for sale.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-11\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">[11]</a></sup>\n</p><p>In an <a href=\"/cwcki/October_2021\" title=\"October 2021\">October 2021</a> letter, Chris discussed the quality of the meals by writing that the \"Food's mostly good and well; not perfect meatballs (Banquet Dinners have better meatballs), and chicken is often dry.\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-12\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">[12]</a></sup>\n</p><p>As of 3 <a href=\"/cwcki/May_2022\" title=\"May 2022\">May 2022</a> (following his three month stay at <a href=\"/cwcki/Western_State_Hospital\" title=\"Western State Hospital\">Western State Hospital</a>), his weight noticeably dropped since he was unable to exploit the \"begging for junk food money\" loophole he once had access to, and his final mugshot taken upon his release on 27 <a href=\"/cwcki/March_2023\" title=\"March 2023\">March 2023</a> showed him having shed even more pounds.

It's very possible he did this once every week and that it was a starting point for his health issues in the intervening years.\n</p><p>On many of the days between 6 March 2007 and 4 September 2009, Chris drank about 1.8 liters (over 3 pints) of Coke <i>every day</i> (assuming that none of it was drunk by his equally <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Obese\" title=\"Obese\">obese</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Borb\" title=\"Borb\">parents</a>), so he could gain points on My Coke Rewards. This represents a grotesque 195 grams (nearly 7 ounces) of sugar per day from Coke alone, representing almost <i>800</i> calories (1/3 of his daily calorie intake). To put that in perspective, Chris drank enough Coke to fill <i>10 oil barrels</i> in order to get the amount of points he got. <a href=\"/cwcki/30_Push-Ups\" title=\"30 Push-Ups\">Needless to say</a>, the effects are staggering. On record, he apparently consumed a whopping 120 cans of cola on 9 April 2008, 24 March 2009, and 15 August 2009; how this didn't send him into immediate diabetic shock is anybody's guess.\n</p><p>Before his arrest in <a href=\"/cwcki/July_2021\" title=\"July 2021\">July 2021</a>, Chris drank tons of water from a Glacee water bottle with an <a href=\"/cwcki/Magic_stones\" title=\"Magic stones\">amethyst crystal</a> inside. He believes that there are many health problems that drinking water in this fashion alone can cure, such as food poisoning. While this is not actually true, it's at least far healthier than drinking tons of soft drinks. Ever since the discovery of himself being Goddess CPU Blue Heart, he had used this bottle constantly as a way to charge up his \"powers\", in order to help further the merge into its future stages. The reason he went with the amethyst crystal is most likely the same reason that he uses his <a href=\"/cwcki/Amnyfest_Ring\" title=\"Amnyfest Ring\">Amnyfest Ring</a> in the comics as his main source of power. So, therefore, Chris used this bottle as a way to inadvertently makes his powers stronger.\n</p><p>As of 2023, Chris has developed an interest in the popular energy drink G Fuel, likely because the brand is known to constantly release flavors in partnership with various gaming/media franchises, an unsurprising example being that <a href=\"/cwcki/Post-jail_sightings_(2023)#Walmart_(July)\" title=\"Post-jail sightings (2023)\">he was seen looking at</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog\" title=\"Sonic the Hedgehog\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>-themed G Fuel cans <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Post-jail_sightings\" title=\"Post-jail sightings\">during a post-jail release shopping trip</a>. Given the canned drink has an average of 300 mg of caffeine (equivalent to about 3 cups of coffee), it's likely Chris may soon slip back into erratic behavior patterns.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Results_of_Chris.27s_Diet\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Results_of_Chris's_Diet\">Results of Chris's Diet</span></h2>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_health\" title=\"Chris and health\">Chris and health</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Obesity\">Obesity</span></h3>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Obesity\" title=\"Obesity\">Obesity</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:202px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Fat_chris.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"113\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/a/aa/Fat_chris.jpg/200px-Fat_chris.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/a/aa/Fat_chris.jpg/300px-Fat_chris.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/a/aa/Fat_chris.jpg/400px-Fat_chris.jpg 2x\" width=\"200\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Fat_chris.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Chris showing off his gut in <a href=\"/cwcki/October_2017\" title=\"October 2017\">October 2017</a>, as an attempt to make <a href=\"/cwcki/Jessica_Quinn\" title=\"Jessica Quinn\">Jessica Quinn</a> regret breaking up with him.

Irritable bowel syndrome may be another reason for Chris's problems with controlling his bowels. The cause of IBS is not known, but two major triggers are <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress\" title=\"Stress\">stress</a> and poor diets, with wheat, dairy, and carbonated drinks being known IBS triggers.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-16\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">[16]</a></sup> Chris has given testament to fast-food not agreeing with him.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-17\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">[17]</a></sup> However, being raised on a poor diet, it's unlikely he'll stop eating junk anytime soon.\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Denial_of_poor_diet\">Denial of poor diet</span></h2>\n<p>Chris often denies his diet is doing more harm to him than good.
