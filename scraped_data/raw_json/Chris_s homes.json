city of <a href=\"/cwcki/Virginia\" title=\"Virginia\">Virginia</a> and the former capital of the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America\" title=\"wikipedia:Confederate States of America\">Confederate States of America</a>. Chesterfield County is just southwest of Richmond and contains many of its suburbs. Chris and his parents lived in this area from <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/1993\" title=\"1993\">1993</a> to <a href=\"/cwcki/2000\" title=\"2000\">2000</a>. During his life here, Chris attended <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Providence_Middle_School\" title=\"Providence Middle School\">Providence Middle School</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Manchester_High_School\" title=\"Manchester High School\">Manchester High School</a>. He attended Korean Canaan Presbyterian Church with his father and occasionally went swimming at the local YMCA. By late 1999 he was regularly playing <a href=\"/cwcki/Pok%C3%A9mon\" title=\"Pokémon\">Pokémon</a> at <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Books-A-Million\" title=\"Books-A-Million\">Books-A-Million</a>.\n</p><p>The Chandler family <a href=\"/cwcki/A_Week_With_Christian_Chandler#Page_4\" title=\"A Week With Christian Chandler\">moved back</a> to <a href=\"/cwcki/Ruckersville,_VA\" title=\"Ruckersville, VA\">Ruckersville</a> at the end of Chris's senior year, meaning that his transition from childhood to adulthood was marked by a physical relocation across the state. This move has therefore acquired enormous symbolic significance for Chris. His complete failure to become a successful adult since then, coupled with his <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_nostalgia\" title=\"Chris and nostalgia\">rose-tinted view</a> of high school and his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Gal-pals\" title=\"Gal-pals\">gal-pals</a>, have caused him to romanticize Chesterfield County. He continues to believe that had his family not moved back to \"lame Ruckersville,\" he would currently be drowning in <a href=\"/cwcki/China\" title=\"China\">china</a> and everything would be perfect and uncomplicated.\n</p><p>The Chandlers have ties to the Richmond area going back to well before Chris's birth. Barb moved to Richmond in 1961 with her first husband Ran Coleman Yeatts, and Bob moved to the area with his family in 1975 for work. Barb's son <a href=\"/cwcki/Cole_Smithey\" title=\"Cole Smithey\">Cole</a> was brought up in inner Richmond, and Bob's son <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Alan\" title=\"Alan\">Alan</a> attended high school in Chesterfield County and daughter <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Carol\" title=\"Carol\">Carol</a> attended <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Providence_Middle_School\" title=\"Providence Middle School\">Providence Middle School</a> in Chesterfield County, the same school Chris would later attend. Bob and Barb met at a bar in Richmond in 1979 and were living at Bob's house in Chesterfield County at the time of their marriage in 1980. They left the area shortly afterward when Bob was transferred by his job to Charlottesville.\n</p><p>Chris attended <a href=\"/cwcki/Anime_Mid-Atlantic\" title=\"Anime Mid-Atlantic\">Anime Mid-Atlantic</a> in Richmond in summer <a href=\"/cwcki/2004\" title=\"2004\">2004</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/2005\" title=\"2005\">2005</a>, staying at a hotel both years for the three-day event.\n</p><p>Chris's <a href=\"/cwcki/Aunt_Harriet_and_Uncle_Tom\" title=\"Aunt Harriet and Uncle Tom\">Aunt Harriet and Uncle Tom Ashby</a> also live in Chesterfield County, as does his uncle <a href=\"/cwcki/Minor_Family_Members#Wayne_Weston\" title=\"Minor Family Members\">Wayne Weston</a>. Chris leaked Harriet and Tom's then-current home address in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Miyamoto_emails\" title=\"Miyamoto emails\">Miyamoto emails</a>, hoping that <a href=\"/cwcki/Shigeru_Miyamoto\" title=\"Shigeru Miyamoto\">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> would send them a letter to somehow establish his legitimacy. They have since moved to a different residence, also in Chesterfield County, and wisely chose not to share their new address with Chris or Barb.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup> In the wake of the summer 2021 allegation that Chris had committed incest with his mother, Chris was forbidden by <a href=\"/cwcki/Emergency_Protective_Order\" title=\"Emergency Protective Order\">Emergency Protective Order</a> from the home he shared with her and made plans to stay with his <a href=\"/cwcki/Aunt_Harriet_and_Uncle_Tom\" title=\"Aunt Harriet and Uncle Tom\">Aunt Harriet and Uncle Tom</a>; however, they refused to accommodate him after they learned what he had done. Chris had already driven to Richmond, however, so he booked a room at the <a href=\"/cwcki/Regency_Inn_Richmond\" title=\"Regency Inn Richmond\">Regency Inn Richmond</a>, a drive-in motel a short distance away from the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Regency_Square_Mall\" title=\"Regency Square Mall\">Regency Square Mall</a> in <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrico_County,_Va\" title=\"wikipedia:Henrico County, Va\">Henrico County</a>; after spending the night of July 31 there, he was <a href=\"/cwcki/Jail_Saga#Arrest\" title=\"Jail Saga\">arrested and jailed</a> the following afternoon.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cloverleaf_Lakes_Apartments\">Cloverleaf Lakes Apartments</span></h3>\n<p>The Cloverleaf Lakes Apartments are a set of apartments located just outside of Richmond in Chesterfield County, where the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chandler\" title=\"Chandler\">Chandler</a> family lived from September <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/1993\" title=\"1993\">1993</a> through the summer of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/1995\" title=\"1995\">1995</a>.\n</p><p><a href=\"/cwcki/Chris%27s_Wikipedia_profile\" title=\"Chris's Wikipedia profile\">Chris's Wikipedia profile</a> and his <a href=\"/cwcki/DVD_Slideshow_Transcripts\" title=\"DVD Slideshow Transcripts\">DVD Slideshow Transcripts</a> state that he moved to Chesterfield County in September 1992.
