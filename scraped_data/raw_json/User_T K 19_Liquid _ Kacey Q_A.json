At first, I simply thought (since we were in the middle of a huge drought at the time) that if Chris wasn't making content, then maybe I'd make some of my own. I thought others might appreciate it, too, but my summer was going slowly and I had only just found that I could do a decent impression. Chris was just so absorbing that it was almost like he needed to keep making videos or else I wouldn't get to see the slow-motion car crash of his life end.\n<p>It wasn't until later that I ended up actually confronting Chris instead of doing an imitation of him. Champthom from the CWCki sent me a message asking if I'd incorporate some things in my next script, like going to Otakon and selling Sonichu merch.

Even if he gives you a slight smile, it just makes you feel worse. When he walked right past me, it was like having a pig grovel and sniff your air and you're just like \"ugh, stop intaking the air around me, you disgusting person\" and he will always stare at you.
