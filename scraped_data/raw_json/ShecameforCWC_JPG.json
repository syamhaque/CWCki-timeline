Arguably the most scandalous of all of <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_art\" title=\"Chris and art\">Chris's artistic canon</a>, this single image managed to invoke much drama. It was the straw that permanently destroyed the already dying friendship between Chris and Megan, and the consequences of uploading it online have continued to face him for years afterward. In fact, it's entirely conceivable that the targeted effort to troll Chris may have simply faded away had he <i>not</i> edited the page repeatedly and uploaded this image to Encyclopedia Dramatica, thereby putting blood in the water for <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">trolls</a> for years to come.\n</p><p>At first, people believed the picture to be of his imaginary twin sister Crystal, which was not helped by the initial caption that Chris provided. In order to defend his fictional sister's honor, Chris edited the article to confirm that it was in fact Megan.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup> He also angrily decried these scurrilous rumors in the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Madman_Rising\" title=\"Madman Rising\">Madman Rising</a> video, shouting that it was Megan, defeating the purpose of censoring her eyes to hide her identity. While this is less disturbing than Chris wanting to have an incestuous relationship with his own fictitious twin sister, it is notably creepy that it is of his only friend, with whom he had no romantic or sexual relationship (no matter how much he tried, anyway).\n</p><p>Megan was understandably disturbed when she figured out the truth behind the image. As it stands, she had made it perfectly clear to Chris that she had no romantic feelings for him and that she wanted to remain \"just friends\"; in the aftermath, she was so disgusted that she severed ties with Chris. Since the release of the picture, Chris has flip-flopped from taking responsibility for making the image to blaming the trolls and even blaming Megan herself, or some combination of these things.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Background\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Background</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Analysis\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Analysis</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Drama\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Drama</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#With_ED\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">With ED</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#With_Megan\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">With Megan</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Epilogue\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Epilogue</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Sources\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Sources</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Background\">Background</span></h2>\n<p>When Chris first discovered the ED page, he was disturbed by the number of images depicting his female characters (mostly <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu\" title=\"Rosechu\">Rosechu</a>) with <a href=\"/cwcki/Pickle\" title=\"Pickle\">penises</a> on the site, along with general <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">gay porn</a> of his characters and himself. Chris then decided that the best response would be to replace these images with images of things that Chris likes as a means of \"replacing negativity with positivity.\" He thought that uploading pictures of his fictional characters fucking and a drawing of himself fingering his not-girlfriend would counteract the perceived homosexuality prevalent on the ED page.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup>\n</p><p>He also ignorantly believed that spamming large edits on the page (what he referred to as an \"information overload\") would overwhelm the trolls and scare them into deleting it. On 11 November <a href=\"/cwcki/2007\" title=\"2007\">2007</a>, along with <a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_Chris%27s_edits_to_Encyclopedia_Dramatica#11_November\" title=\"List of Chris's edits to Encyclopedia Dramatica\">adding large walls of text detailing his own personal life</a>, Chris uploaded several new, original images to ED, including ShecameforCWC.JPG. Some of these pictures were duplicated on the page to further the \"overload\" plot. These were pornographic drawings of several romantic pairings from the comics, made for this exact purpose. The sole exception, of course, was with ShecameforCWC.JPG, which depicted real people. Chris wrote a relationship between himself and Megan in the comics as wish fulfillment, so we can assume Chris was imagining this from the very beginning. This is made even more likely when Chris admitted to Megan sometime after she discovered the picture that he probably would have sexually advanced on her had he not done the drawing.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup> This supposed need to suppress his sexual advances ironically hinted at <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_sex#Incest\" title=\"Chris and sex\">what was to come</a> more than a decade later. All of the images that Chris posted were varying degrees of horrifying, but ShecameforCWC.JPG proved to be the most appalling, leaving <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">trolls</a> in total shock.\n</p><p>Ironically, these behaviors, compounded with Chris's apparent obliviousness as to why this picture hurt his friend, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chop_Chop_Master_Onion%27s_Rap_Showdown\" title=\"Chop Chop Master Onion's Rap Showdown\">among</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/The_GAMe_PLACe\" title=\"The GAMe PLACe\">other</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">things</a>, only showcased his child-like view of the world, and just how easy he was to manipulate. Thus, it isn't hard to see why he became such an easy target to trolls in the following years to come – since it only took some perverted \"fan\" art to upset Chris, others got to thinking about what else could be done to push his buttons.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Analysis\">Analysis</span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:ShecameforCWCanatomy.JPG\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/c/c2/ShecameforCWCanatomy.JPG/300px-ShecameforCWCanatomy.JPG\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/c/c2/ShecameforCWCanatomy.JPG/450px-ShecameforCWCanatomy.JPG 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/c/c2/ShecameforCWCanatomy.JPG/600px-ShecameforCWCanatomy.JPG 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:ShecameforCWCanatomy.JPG\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Anatomical analysis</div></div></div>\n<p>This image is held in such regard for being a shining example of Chris's art style. The drawing showcases many major problems with Chris's artistic abilities:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Chris clearly attempted to foreshorten Megan in this image, given how he draws her legs significantly longer and her head smaller than the rest of her body, but the lack of depth perception and proportion makes her look as flat as the paper she was drawn on.</li>\n<li>He also shows a complete <a href=\"/cwcki/Biology\" title=\"Biology\">unfamiliarity with human anatomy</a>. Megan's legs seem to start right at the groin while her hips are directly behind them. Also, it looks like neither Chris nor Megan have elbows, joints, or even bones for that matter. What is supposed to be her foot looks like a deformed flipper. Many other glaring anatomical flaws in this picture deserve analyses of their own:\n<ul><li>The vagina is not one long hole and you could never do that sort of thing with a real vagina, looking like that. There is also the fact that Chris didn't draw her a crotch, and instead placed her vagina directly on her perineum.</li>\n<li>The vagina in question appears to be either glowing or shooting out a powerful gust of wind. Chris probably meant to convey that Megan was \"wet\" and/or \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Masturbating_and_squirtin%27\" title=\"Masturbating and squirtin'\">squirtin'</a>,\" but due to his own stupidity, he drew her \"<a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_ejaculate\" title=\"wikipedia:Female ejaculate\">cum</a>\" around and outside the vagina instead of coming from inside it, leading to the \"Glowing Ethereal Cunt of the Ages\" effect shown in the picture. He also made the vaginal fluid blue, likely to shade it in. This not only further shows his ignorance, but it also shows his inability to stay consistent with his artstyle, as he did not attempt to shade in anything else in the picture.</li>\n<li>Megan's body lacks any curves whatsoever. As a result of this, <a href=\"/cwcki/Pedofork\" title=\"Pedofork\">Megan looks significantly younger</a>.</li>\n<li>Chris is somehow reaching over his left shoulder with his right hand despite the fact that his right elbow remains near his side, creating an effect straight out of <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._C._Escher\" title=\"wikipedia:M. C. Escher\">M. C. Escher</a>'s darkest nightmares. Due to the perspective of Chris's forearm, his forearm is either very floppy and bent backward towards Megan, or Chris's hand is actually nowhere near his partner's parts.</li>\n<li>Chris's right forearm is severely elongated in comparison to his left - If this version of Chris were to be viewed from the front, his right arm would probably hang low or even drag along the ground. His left thumb is also unrealistically large compared to the rest of his hand.</li>\n<li>Both of Megan's arms also appear to each have six fingers, two of which are haphazardly redrawn to look like nipples. As a result of this, Megan's right arm now looks like it's in a permanent <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulcan_salute\" title=\"wikipedia:Vulcan salute\">Vulcan salute</a> from <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Star_Trek\" title=\"Star Trek\">Star Trek</a>.</li>\n<li>As a result of Chris' haphazard attempt to turn her fingers to nipples, Megan's nipples appear unnaturally pointy. Not to mention how they seem to point directly towards her face, and how her areolae are placed higher up on her breasts than they should be.</li>\n<li>Megan's pubic hair, which was probably supposed to be a <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_strip_(pubic_hair)\" title=\"wikipedia:Landing strip (pubic hair)\">landing strip</a>, in this drawing bears a slight resemblance to <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler\" title=\"wikipedia:Adolf Hitler\">Hitler</a>'s mustache (coincidentally, Megan had a fetish for German soldiers). It is also quite far up on her body, and looks like some kind of messed-up <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_hair\" title=\"wikipedia:Abdominal hair\">happy trail</a> instead of pubic hair.</li>\n<li>Chris's head is deformed and oval-shaped, and his eyes appear to be set very far up his skull, being where most people's hairlines or eyebrows should be. This can be ascertained with the fact that Chris appears to have drawn himself hastily - Even in some of Chris's earlier artworks, he depicted himself with something resembling an actual jawline, but not here.</li></ul></li>\n<li>The way Chris drew Megan's hands is a prime example of how Chris habitually does all of his drawings in one fell swoop without any planning or revisions. Megan's nipples looks at first to be extra fingers, suggesting that Chris messed up (more than usual) while drawing the hands and decided to turn them into nipples. Chris also appeared to tacked on her thumbs directly afterward.</li>\n<li>Chris pays close attention to the parts that interest him, namely genitalia and breasts, yet had to squeeze in a tiny head, most likely because he started with the former and realized \"Oh, she needs a face.\" He also shows clear attention to his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Medallion_of_Fail\" title=\"Medallion of Fail\">Medallion of Fail</a>, his <a href=\"/cwcki/Heterochromia\" title=\"Heterochromia\">heterochromia</a>, etc.</li>\n<li>Note the retarded pun, a reinforcement of Chris's narcissism, that when a woman orgasms, it's for his sake and not her own pleasure (as he titled it \"<i>She</i>came<i>For</i>CWC,\" emphasis added). The smug look he has on his face as he gives a thumbs up while fingering her seals the deal. He's also wearing his <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(character)\" title=\"Sonichu (character)\">Sonichu</a> medallion while fingering a woman. He stated that ideally, he'd like to be wearing his medallion for his first time.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup></li>\n<li>There is the fact that the girl in the drawing is his best and only friend, Megan, and he sees nothing wrong with it other than the fact that it's on the Internet where she (and millions of others) can see it.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Drama\">Drama</span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:MeganBrotherTroll.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"349\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/c/c3/MeganBrotherTroll.jpg/300px-MeganBrotherTroll.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/c/c3/MeganBrotherTroll.jpg/450px-MeganBrotherTroll.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/c/c3/MeganBrotherTroll.jpg/600px-MeganBrotherTroll.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:MeganBrotherTroll.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Megan reminisces about learning of the picture and explains Chris's mysterious caption.</div></div></div>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"With_ED\">With ED</span></h3>\n<p>When Chris first uploaded the image to ED, he captioned it \"Your sister has cum for me.\" Exactly what he meant here was long disputed, but it had the unintended effect of leading ED's users to widely conclude that the picture represented <i>Chris's</i> sister, the fictional character Crystal (given the nature of <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_art\" title=\"Chris and art\">Chris’s artwork</a>, any two females with long brown hair are easily mistaken for each other). \"Your sister\" suggests that the message is addressed to Megan's brother <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/John_Schroeder\" title=\"John Schroeder\">John Schroeder</a>, but why Chris would want to incorporate Megan's brother into his sexual fantasies is anyone's guess. Megan would one day shed light on this by explaining that Chris's caption was, indeed, directed at her brother because he believed at the time that John was the mastermind behind the trolling campaign on ED.\n</p><p>Over the next few months, the image was removed and replaced a few times over the course of Chris's simmering edit war against ED. It didn’t become a serious hot potato until <a href=\"/cwcki/March_2008\" title=\"March 2008\">March 2008</a>, however, when Megan discovered the picture and learned that it was meant to be a picture of her. (Chris, not realizing that it would probably be better to cut his losses and let the trolls believe that he wanted to screw his imaginary sister, spilled the beans himself, <a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_Chris%27s_lies\" title=\"List of Chris's lies\">but not before first attempting to lie to her about how it was a picture of Crystal</a>.) In between bombarding Megan with apologies via e-mail, he went on a desperate campaign to remove the image from his ED page, which naturally was an unsuccessful effort.\n</p><p>Chris spent most of a week trying to remove the image, trying to delete references to Megan from the article, trying to erase random bits of the article in order to camouflage his real intentions, and otherwise failing to realize that once something goes up on a wiki, you can’t make it come back down. Amazingly, he even tried to replace the image with a <a href=\"/cwcki/File:TomTomCloseup.jpg\" title=\"File:TomTomCloseup.jpg\">cropped version</a> which just involved the vagina, as though Megan were only angry about her and Chris's facial features being depicted and would be satisfied if the image just showed his hand disappearing up her radiant quim. ED admins quickly reverted his edits and eventually protected the page once it was obvious that Chris was up to something.\n</p><p>On 18 March, Chris admitted defeat in his own disturbing way, and edited the image’s caption — as well as several other captions around the article — to make it clear that the woman depicted is Megan, not Crystal, to at least protect his own honor by indicating that he was not into <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_sex#Incest\" title=\"Chris and sex\">committing incest</a> (<a href=\"/cwcki/Affair_with_Mother\" title=\"Affair with Mother\">at least not yet</a>), even if, in the process, he was demonstrably perfectly okay with drawing pornography of a friend who did not reciprocate any romantic feelings that he had. Over the next few days, he made a number of other <a href=\"/cwcki/You_know_what,_I_HATE_ME_TOO!!!\" title=\"You know what, I HATE ME TOO!!!\">self-deprecating and self-pitying changes and additions to the page with a series of images and captions</a>, in an attempt to further barter with the trolls, before giving up on editing ED for six months.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"With_Megan\">With Megan</span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:MeganGoodEnding.jpeg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"181\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/1/1d/MeganGoodEnding.jpeg/300px-MeganGoodEnding.jpeg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/1/1d/MeganGoodEnding.jpeg/450px-MeganGoodEnding.jpeg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/1/1d/MeganGoodEnding.jpeg/600px-MeganGoodEnding.jpeg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:MeganGoodEnding.jpeg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Chris providing Megan with a real gift.</div></div></div>\n<p>By 12 March 2008, Megan had discovered the full extent of what Chris had written and drawn about her around the Internet, particularly the fact that she'd starred in his cartoon fantasy porn. While failing to get the image off the ED page over the next several days, Chris sent her a series of messages trying to put out the fire.\n</p><p>Some of his attempts to \"explain\" the image to Megan are downright bizarre. It's hard to do justice to the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Emails,_2008#Chris_apologizes_for_something.2C_what_could_it_be.3F\" title=\"Megan Emails, 2008\">original e-mails</a>. At one point, he seemed to think Megan was offended because she didn't understand the action on display, and went off on a frighteningly awkward explanation of what a handjob is. In another e-mail, Chris confirmed the suspicion of many trolls — that he had entertained thoughts of sexually assaulting Megan.\n</p>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">If I didn't have the foresight to put my pent-up frustrations and feelings in the form of something, I might have become an abusive maniac...\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:11px; padding:0 0 0 16px; vertical-align:bottom; width:20px\">”\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\" style=\"font-size:smaller; padding:8px 36px; text-align:right;\"><cite>Chris, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Emails,_2008#Chris_continues_bothering_her_about_ED\" title=\"Megan Emails, 2008\">e-mail to Megan, 18 March 2008</a></cite>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>Generally, Chris's \"apologies\" are a classic display of his insensitivity and <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">narcissism</a> in action. He shows little <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_remorse\" title=\"Chris and remorse\">remorse</a> for creating and publishing the image while offering plenty of woe-is-me whining about the ED bullies. In a message from 18 March, he actually had the gall to tell Megan that no matter how bad she might be feeling, he himself has definitely got it worse.\n</p><p>After sending several messages and receiving little in the way of a response from Megan, Chris appeared to have given up on winning back her trust, which coincided with the slackening of his campaign to remove the image from ED and the increasingly self-hating tone of his edits there. On 23 March, Megan finally sent him two brief replies to the effect of \"leave me alone.\" Those mark the end of the active drama over the image. Chris stopped editing ED around the same time.\n</p><p>As a coda to the fiasco, Chris tried once more to repair his relationship with Megan about a month later, sending a message with a mix of everyday news and creepy stalkerish longing. Given some time to consider the implications of his earlier messages, especially the parts where he brought up the prospect of raping her, Megan slammed the door shut, saying \"I'm afraid I can't trust you anymore.\" This remains their last known communication.\n</p><p>It is debatable how dramatic was the effect of ShecameforCWC on Chris's relationship with Megan.
