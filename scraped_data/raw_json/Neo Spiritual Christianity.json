the <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys</a> brainwashed Chris into believing in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Dimensional_Merge\" title=\"Dimensional Merge\">Dimensional Merge</a>, and incorporated several elements from the video game <a href=\"/cwcki/Hyperdimension_Neptunia\" title=\"Hyperdimension Neptunia\">Hyperdimension Neptunia</a> into his fantasy world, particularly the idea that it was being ruled by CPU Goddesses. \n</p><p>These beliefs were further spurred by many White Knights and enablers, such as <a href=\"/cwcki/The_Sons_of_the_Miscreants\" title=\"The Sons of the Miscreants\">the Sons of the Miscreants</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Praetor\" title=\"Praetor\">Praetor</a>. The latter group as well as the <a href=\"/cwcki/Watchmen\" title=\"Watchmen\">Watchmen</a> would enable various beliefs about Chris's status as a god.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cosmology\">Cosmology</span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Gods_and_Deities\">Gods and Deities</span></h3>\n<p>Chris claims that there are multiple gods, goddesses and deities which manage all of the different dimensions.\n</p><p>The most powerful, and influential of these gods and deities is <b><a href=\"/cwcki/Emmanuelle\" title=\"Emmanuelle\">Emmanuelle</a></b>, likely named after a Hebrew name found in the Book of Isaiah as a sign that God will protect the House of David. Emmanuelle is responsible for the management of the multiverse along with its safety and wellbeing. The exact identity of Emmanuelle is hard to pinpoint, but Chris has stated that Emmanuelle is his godly mother, once father, having changed her gender and physicality to female over a century ago, while <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Barb\" title=\"Barb\">Barb</a> was her \"earthly mother.\" Chris has claimed that Barb is a reincarnation of Merlin the Wizard.\n</p><p>According to Chris, the world in which we live in is also inhabited by <b>CPUs</b>, which are the sons and daughters of Emmanuelle . The CPUs are the goddesses and gods who protect and govern the various universes that are part of the greater multiverse; some of these gods and goddesses are Neptune, Blanc, Noire, Vert, Uzume, along with Chris, the self-proclaimed CPU of our dimension. Chris claims to be Goddess <a href=\"/cwcki/CPU_Blue_Heart\" title=\"CPU Blue Heart\">CPU Blue Heart</a> of the Commodore Consoles. All CPUs also supposedly live in the heaven realm, where three days on Earth are equal to four months there.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris_as_a_Messiah\">Chris as a Messiah</span></h3>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Messiah_complex\" title=\"Messiah complex\">Messiah complex</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>In Neo Spiritual Christianity, Chris is a reincarnation of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, complete with all of the memories from birth to his ascension to heaven. \n</p><p>Chris believes that he has lived many different lives before being born. He claims to have divided the Universe in 1389 after the legendary King Arthur ordered Merlin to exile all the dragons from his realm and was subsequently transported back and forth through time and space, flew through the chaotic rainbow's apex in 2003, and become reborn on February 24, 1982.\n</p><p>According to Chris, Emanuel planted an ovum from her ovary into Barb's ovary to attract him from his trip through time. He claims that all of the prayers to Jesus since his death were received by Emanuel and his divine body. His divine body allegedly forms the core of universe <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/1C-211987\" title=\"1C-211987\">1C-211987</a>. \n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Dimensional_Merge\">Dimensional Merge</span></h3>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Dimensional_Merge\" title=\"Dimensional Merge\">Dimensional Merge</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>The <b>Dimensional Merge</b> (also known as Judgement Day or the Second Coming) is a supposed apocalyptic event in which <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler\">Chris</a> believes that \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Dimensions#1218\" title=\"Dimensions\">Dimension 1218</a>\" and \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Dimensions#C-197\" title=\"Dimensions\">Dimension C-197</a>\" (read: the universe of real life, and the <a href=\"/cwcki/Dimensions\" title=\"Dimensions\">parallel universe</a> where <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(character)\" title=\"Sonichu (character)\">Sonichu</a>, every person who has died, and every other fictional character lives) will combine into a new dimension titled 1C-211987, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">bringing fictional characters into reality</a>, and in which Chris, being the designated liaison of the event, will ascend unto <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_religion\" title=\"Chris and religion\">godhood</a>.\n</p><p>Of course, the Merge is just an escapist fantasy and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Coping\" title=\"Coping\">coping</a> mechanism for Chris. Originally part of the lore the <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys</a> had <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Brainwashed\" title=\"Brainwashed\">brainwashed</a> into Chris, the Dimensional Merge is Chris’s latest means of avoiding <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Reality\" title=\"Reality\">reality</a>, believing that it will rescue him from his self-inflicted real-life problems and enable him to continue <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality#Psychological_problems\" title=\"Chris and reality\">living like a child</a>. \n</p><p>First announced in <a href=\"/cwcki/October_2018\" title=\"October 2018\">October 2018</a>, the Merge was expected to take place by the end of the year. After that deadline – and several others predicted by Chris – passed without incident, Chris has remained persistent and claimed that he is unaware of the date of its occurrence. In the years since, indulging this belief has become the default latching-on point for would-be trolls. \n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Toxic_Minority\">The Toxic Minority</span></h3>\n<p>Chris believes that the Dimensional Merge will include Chris as the second coming of Jesus Christ as the fully reawakened god and judge over a group of individuals that he refers to as the Toxic Minority. He claims that that he will descend to <a href=\"/cwcki/14_Branchland_Court\" title=\"14 Branchland Court\">14 Branchland Court</a> (presumably from <a href=\"/cwcki/Jail\" title=\"Jail\">jail</a>) during the second coming, where he will then personally complete the Dimensional Merge.\n</p><p>Chris claims that 18% of 1218-Earth's population (claimed by Chris to consist of 600 million individuals despite 18% of the current world population resulting in 1.43 billion) will be left to burn. Some selected buildings, statues, possessions, and artifacts will be relocated to 1C-211987, but remaining artifacts and the \"Toxic Minority\" will remain. 1218-Earth will subsequently be destroyed with nothing but pebbles left behind. \n</p><p>However, Chris made a tweet on 14 <a href=\"/cwcki/November_2018\" title=\"November 2018\">November 2018</a> with a different alleged survival rate. Chris explains the population math as follows; 61.25% of the population of dimension C-197 is identical to that of Earth in dimension 1218, the remaining 38.75% of the population of C-197 are OCs which are unique to C-197, all of the OCs of C-197 are guaranteed to survive the merge, at least 51% of the human population of the Earths in both sister dimensions will survive the merge and at least 41% will not with an uncertainty of 8%, the best outcome of the merge would leave 59% of the population of 1218 alive and all of the 38.75% of the OCs of C-197 plus 11.25% of the human population of C-197 in the dimension 1218C197, the dimension 1C-211987 would be left with 109% of 1218's current population leaving approximately 8.365 billion humans and OCs in the new universe.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Signs_of_the_Dimensional_Merge\">Signs of the Dimensional Merge</span></h3>\n<p>Chris has claimed that numerous events will occur prior to the Dimensional Merge as signs of the end of the world:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Many inhabitants of 1218 will suddenly begin to be able to speak foreign languages such as <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Hebrew\" title=\"wikipedia:Ancient Hebrew\">Ancient Hebrew</a> and the Akashic Language (a mysterious language hidden only to a few people according to the religion of Theosophy).</li></ul>\n<ul><li>These same individuals will also start downloading massive amounts of information from the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akashic_Records\" title=\"wikipedia:Akashic Records\">Akashic Records</a>.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Some individuals will start behaving ritualistically and appear schizophrenic; these individuals will actually be guided by the gods and goddesses.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Random animals, including some anthropological, sentient, and human-language speaking creatures will suddenly start to appear in random places around 1218-Earth.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Certain non-members of the Toxic Minority will suddenly, without dying, physically disappear from 1218 Earth, and reappear on 1C-211987-Earth.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>The truth-blinding veil will suddenly start disappearing from everyone who is among the majority physical eyes; those individuals will now start to know greater truths leading up to the Second Coming.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>The number of believers in Neo Spiritual Christianity will suddenly skyrocket, even from the Toxic Minority, seeking to repent in the light of these revelations.</li></ul>\n<p>Chris claims that Jacob Sockness cursed the country of <a href=\"/cwcki/China\" title=\"China\">China</a> with <a href=\"/cwcki/COVID-19\" title=\"COVID-19\">COVID-19</a> and the percentage of the population considered to be Toxic consequently increased dramatically because of the effects of isolation and quarantine. He also claims that people who are still among the Toxic Minority prior to the Merge will receive various chances of redemption in the form of divine tests. One of these divine tests is simultaneous lockdown, which he claims to have been a test of faith, endurance and self-motivation administered by Christine and the other gods and goddesses. Chris claims that if COVID had not occurred, these tests would have come in the form of natural disasters and catastrophic events.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Origins_of_Chris.27s_Beliefs\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Origins_of_Chris's_Beliefs\">Origins of Chris's Beliefs</span></h2>\n<p>As stated above, Neo Spiritual Christianity is largely an admixture of essentially every religious or spiritual teaching that Chris has been exposed to and agrees with. However, this section aims to analyze the origins of each belief taught by Chris as part of his so-called religion. \n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Beliefs_Originating_in_Christianity\">Beliefs Originating in Christianity</span></h3>\n<p>According to Chris, his life is a retelling of the Bible. In <a href=\"/cwcki/Jail_Letter_-_3_October_2021\" title=\"Jail Letter - 3 October 2021\">Jail Letter - 3 October 2021</a>, Chris claimed that the state of his life at the moment of writing the letter mirrored the third and fourth chapters of the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Malachi\" title=\"wikipedia:Book of Malachi\">Book of Malachi</a>. \n</p><p>Chris has identified the <a href=\"/cwcki/Dimensional_Merge\" title=\"Dimensional Merge\">Dimensional Merge</a> with the Apocalypse found in the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Revelation\" title=\"wikipedia:Book of Revelation\">Book of Revelation</a> in the New Testament of the Bible despite the differences between his descriptions of the Merge with the apocalyptic narrative found in the Book of Revelation. \n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Beliefs_Originating_in_the_New_Age_Movement\">Beliefs Originating in the New Age Movement</span></h3>\n<p>The <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Age\" title=\"wikipedia:New Age\">New Age</a> is an umbrella term referring to a variety of <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_religious_movements\" title=\"wikipedia:new religious movements\">new religious movements</a> and alternative spiritual practices originating in the Western world during the 1960s, whose practitioners are referred to as New Agers. These practices include various forms of prayer and meditation conducted along a multitude of cosmologies combined with various pseudosciences such as astrology and alternative medicine. New Age beliefs often encourage <a href=\"/cwcki/Magical_thinking\" title=\"Magical thinking\">magical thinking</a>, which only serve to reinforce Chris's beliefs in his supposed divinity. Unlike in most other religious denominations, New Age worship does not typically occur in organized, tax-exempt places of worship and instead takes place at home or within for-profit storefronts. \n</p><p>New Age worship practices frequently incorporate yoga and other exercise routines. Despite Chris's poor physical <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Health\" title=\"Health\">health</a> and attitudes towards <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Exercise\" title=\"Exercise\">exercise</a>, he was seen purchasing a pair of yoga mats at <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Walmart\" title=\"Walmart\">Walmart</a> on <a href=\"/cwcki/Post-jail_sightings_(2023)#Walmart_4\" title=\"Post-jail sightings (2023)\">16 September 2023</a>.\n</p><p>Chris has affirmed his belief in various forms of New Age practices in the past, all of which were syncretized with forms of Christianity and his own beliefs in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Dimensional_Merge\" title=\"Dimensional Merge\">Dimensional Merge</a>. Chris has performed <a href=\"/cwcki/Tarot\" title=\"Tarot\">tarot</a> readings, believed in <a href=\"/cwcki/Magic_stones\" title=\"Magic stones\">magic stones</a>, and <a href=\"/cwcki/Meditation\" title=\"Meditation\">meditated</a> in the hopes of achieving astral projection.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Beliefs_Originating_in_Theosophy\">Beliefs Originating in Theosophy</span></h3>\n<p><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theosophy\" title=\"wikipedia:Theosophy\">Theosophy</a> is a minority religion founded in the 19th century. An adherent of Theosophy is known as a Theosophist and believers worship at Theosophical Societies. Adherents of Theosophy predominantly consist of converts to the faith, rather than multigenerational family-based groups.\n</p><p>Chris has been influenced by Theosophy in his affirmation of the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akashic_Records\" title=\"wikipedia:Akashic Records\">Akashic Records</a>, mentioned in various jail letters to fans. Owing to the religion's denial of free will, the Akashic Records are believed to be a flawless compendium of all thoughts, actions, and words spoken by all human beings in the past, present, and future. Theosophists believe that they can access the Akashic Records to \"heal past wounds, lift pain and past issues, and find a higher expression for [their lives].\" \n</p><p>The origin of Chris's belief in the existence of the Akashic Records is unknown. Several New Age religious groups incorporate some Thesophist belief and worship customs into their spirituality as Theosophy lacks a central faith authority and currently possesses multiple competing sects; this is a probable source of Chris's belief in certain elements of the religion. However, Chris appears to incorporate every spiritual or supernatural concept (regardless of whether it is intended to be religious or purely fictional) he finds into this bizarre pantheon of spirituality. \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Spiritual_Practices\">Spiritual Practices</span></h2>\n<p>Chris has created several forms of worship and spiritual practices as part of his newly formed religion. So far, he has written new commandments and a prayer.  \n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Commandments\">Commandments</span></h3>\n<p>During his stay in Jail, Chris made up various <b>commandments</b> for his religion, which he disclosed on various jail letters. So far, Chris has made up 21 of these commandments, and only 13 of them are known. These new Ten Commandments serve in part as a statement of <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/secular_humanist\" title=\"wikipedia:secular humanist\">secular humanist</a> beliefs, although Chris upholds the prohibition on blasphemy and the observance of the Sabbath.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"List_of_known_Commandments\">List of known Commandments</span></h4>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>\n<p>1) Thou may have and worship one or multiple Gods, Goddesses, and Demi-Gods, or even <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_religion#Atheism\" title=\"Chris and religion\">none at all</a>; which ever best feels well and good with thee.\n</p><p>2) Thou may make for yourself an <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_Totem\" title=\"Sonic Totem\">Idol</a> that is safe and good and blessed; thou must not make for yourself an Idol that is harmful, toxic, or demonic to you or anyone else.\n</p><p>3) Thou must not misuse the name of the Lord your God, or any other God, Goddess, or Demi-God; \"God Damn It\" shall be most punishable as well.\n</p><p>4) Remember to observe the Sabbath day (Sunday) by keeping itHoly <i>[sic]</i>.\n</p><p>5) Honor thy <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler\" title=\"Bob Chandler\">father</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Barbara_Chandler\" title=\"Barbara Chandler\">mother</a>, and any or all legal guardians who have helped greatly in your raising and support.\n</p><p>6) <a href=\"/cwcki/Wedding_Comic\" title=\"Wedding Comic\">Thou must not murder</a>, nor commit, or helpanother <i>[sic]</i> to commit, <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash#Ryan's_Death\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">suicide</a>, regardless of circumstances.\n</p><p>7) Adultry <i>[sic]</i> is okay, well, and good, as long as all involved are direct, open, and <a href=\"/cwcki/Honest_Content\" title=\"Honest Content\">honest</a> with each other; thou must not commit adultry <i>[sic]</i> in secret from thy partner(s).\n</p><p>8) <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Simonla\" title=\"Simonla\">Thou must not steal</a>.\n</p><p>9) Thou must not <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Lies\" title=\"Lies\">testify falsely</a> against thy neighbor, or anyone, nor testify without prior knowledge of the greater contexts and truths of the circumstances and details.\n</p><p>10) Thou must not covet thy neighbor's belongings.\n</p><p>14) Thou shalt not hate thy neighbours or others that share <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_race\" title=\"Chris and race\">Any similarities in Race, Ethnicity, Interests, or whatever else</a> with thee.
