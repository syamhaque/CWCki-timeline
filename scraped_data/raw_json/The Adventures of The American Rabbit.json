It was the last theatrical film made by Fred Wolf, so it was a miracle that the next year, <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_(1987_TV_series)\" title=\"wikipedia:Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)\">two</a> <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuckTales\" title=\"wikipedia:DuckTales\">projects</a> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://animationguildblog.blogspot.com/2007/01/brief-history-of-disney-tva.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">he helped produce</a> were major successes. Nonetheless, it set the standards for young <a href=\"/cwcki/Christopher%27s_name_change\" title=\"Christopher's name change\">Christopher</a>'s perception of many things, including himself, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/America\" title=\"America\">America</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_writing\" title=\"Chris and writing\">storytelling</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_race\" title=\"Chris and race\">race</a> (something that will become quickly apparent to any viewer of the film in question), honesty and respect for oneself and others (which, as in the movie, are given much talk for no reason whatsoever). His claims for being truthful, honest, and decent are almost certainly informed by the movie's shallow glossing over of the issues in an anvilicious fashion. Even the \"famous\" cover for <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_0\" title=\"Sonichu 0\"><i>Sonichu</i> #0</a> is <a href=\"/cwcki/Things_Chris_has_ripped_off\" title=\"Things Chris has ripped off\">plagiarized</a> partially, in an eerie subconscious fashion, from a scene early in the film where the titular rabbit goes out from his home village, encouraged by his father.\n</p><p>Robert Rabbit is, next to <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog\" title=\"Sonic the Hedgehog\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>, one of Chris's biggest role models in life. In Chris's <a href=\"/cwcki/Wikipedia\" title=\"Wikipedia\">Wikipedia</a> entry, he stated \"they REALLY SHOULD HAVE MADE A <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_television\" title=\"Chris and television\">TV SERIES</a> of him.\" Along with Filmation's <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Ghostbusters\" title=\"Ghostbusters\">Ghostbusters</a></i>, <i>American Rabbit</i> is another obscure cartoon likely culled from videotape bargain bins that had an inexplicably large impact on Chris's childhood. Why Chris latched onto a shitty cartoon movie from the 80s so hard is anybody's guess, though the <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">colorful visuals</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Slow-in-the-minds\" title=\"Slow-in-the-minds\">easy-to-understand plot</a>, and anthropomorphic characters are probably a significant part of the reason. Despite the closeness of the movie to Chris, he also called it  \"cringe\" in a 27 March 2025 Bluesky Post, but still believes that a TV series should be made of the character.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Influence\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Influence</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Possible_influences_on_the_Sonichu_comic\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Possible influences on the <i>Sonichu</i> comic</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Anchuent_Powers/Legacy\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Anchuent Powers/Legacy</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Shallow_love_interests\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Shallow love interests</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Worthless_side_characters_that_all_look_alike\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Worthless side characters that all look alike</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Worthless_side_characters_in_general\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Worthless side characters in general</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Worthless_law_enforcement\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Worthless law enforcement</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#All_the_protagonists_are_worthless\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">All the protagonists are worthless</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#A_villain_in_a_staff\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">A villain in a staff</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Plot_holes_and_loose_ends\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Plot holes and loose ends</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#External_links\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">External links</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Influence\">Influence</span></h2>\n<p><i>The Adventures of The American Rabbit</i> seems to have had a tremendous influence on Chris's narrative style; the film has numerous plot holes, a bland Aesop-style moral tacked onto it, moments that make you go \"Wait, <i>what</i>?\" (e.g. when some jackals somehow take over the world by kidnapping a couple of moose who make chocolate for a living), and the use of anthropomorphic animals as heroes. In other words, key ingredients of a <i>Sonichu</i> comic.\n</p><p>What's truly startling, however, is how much of it seems to have influenced Chris <i>outside</i> the <i>Sonichu</i> comics.\n</p><p>A character in the movie has a speech at the rally against the evil gang in the movie that starts out verbatim the same way that <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC%27s_Second_Message\" title=\"CWC's Second Message\">CWC's Second Message</a> does, with the Panda character leading off by saying that \"[they] all should know [him] by now.\" Much like the protagonist of the movie (and a lot of bad children's media) Chris regards his own actions as morally good no matter whether they actually are or not, and inversely the actions of his antagonists as bad simply because they aggrieve him. This very simple mentality doesn't seem to be directly tied to this movie until you look closer at it: The Jackals can get away with tormenting and destroying as they see fit, just like <a href=\"/cwcki/Encyclopedia_Dramatica\" title=\"Encyclopedia Dramatica\">several</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCki\" title=\"CWCki\">things</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Kiwi_Farms\" title=\"Kiwi Farms\">that</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris\" title=\"Liquid Chris\">Chris</a> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/4chan\" title=\"4chan\">has</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Get-Tar_Region\" title=\"Get-Tar Region\">compared</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">the</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Mal-Wart\" title=\"Mal-Wart\">same</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Private_Villa_of_Corrupted_Citizens\" title=\"Private Villa of Corrupted Citizens\">way</a>. If you look closer, constant analogies between this horrible movie and Chris's almost-equally-horrible life become woefully apparent.\n</p><p>This includes Chris's <a href=\"/cwcki/Greene_County_Conspiracy\" title=\"Greene County Conspiracy\">tendency to play into conspiracy theories</a>. In <i>American Rabbit</i>, all problems stem from the same small group of antagonists, in much the same way that Chris views all those who <a href=\"/cwcki/Kick_the_Autistic\" title=\"Kick the Autistic\">Kick the Autistic</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">as part of a conspiracy to ruin his life</a>. In many ways, <i>The Adventures of The American Rabbit</i> thus provides one of the most compelling and disturbing looks into <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_psychology\" title=\"Chris and psychology\">Chris's worldview</a> outside his own body of work. Such was the import the young Chris assigned this testament to mediocrity that it became the centerpiece of not only how he <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_writing\" title=\"Chris and writing\">writes</a> and even influenced how he <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_English\" title=\"Chris and English\">talks</a>, but formed a big part of how Chris views the world itself.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Possible_influences_on_the_Sonichu_comic\">Possible influences on the <i>Sonichu</i> comic</span></h2>\n<h4><span id=\"Anchuent_Powers.2FLegacy\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Anchuent_Powers/Legacy\">Anchuent Powers/Legacy</span></h4>\n<p>In the story, Rob Rabbit is visited at birth by a wizened old rabbit, who keeps tabs on him throughout his life until his latent powers are revealed when he saves his family. He then appears in a wizard's robe (for some reason; he isn't a wizard) and tells Robert that he has inherited the Legacy of the American Rabbit. This is very similar to Chris's <a href=\"/cwcki/Anchuent_Prophecy\" title=\"Anchuent Prophecy\">Anchuent Prophecy</a>, where Chris is given superpowers for no reason other than being the author's literal Mary Sue.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Shallow_love_interests\">Shallow love interests</span></h4>\n<p>As soon as Rob meets the <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu\" title=\"Rosechu\">pink</a> Bunny O'Hare, it becomes very obvious that the two are attracted to each other. Granted, unlike the <i>Sonichu</i> comic, <i>American Rabbit</i> actually remembers that it's <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_and_Rosechu%27s_Luv_Shack\" title=\"Sonichu and Rosechu's Luv Shack\">supposed to be for kids</a> so there's never anything more than a peck on the cheek. Regardless, this could have easily set the standard for Chris's idea of love at first sight - Sonichu and Rosechu were in love less than five pages after they met. The movie only features ONE female character - the aforementioned - who does absolutely nothing whatsoever to help fight evil, helping to set the standard for <a href=\"/cwcki/Women%27s_rights\" title=\"Women's rights\">Chris's views on women</a>.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Worthless_side_characters_that_all_look_alike\">Worthless side characters that all look alike</span></h4>\n<p>To be fair, he could have just as easily gotten this from <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i> or other media, but it's certainly present in <i>American Rabbit</i>. The band Rob travels with is called the White Brothers Band, a group composed of five white rabbits who look and sound exactly alike. Even the <a href=\"/cwcki/Chaotic_Combo\" title=\"Chaotic Combo\">Chaotic Combo</a> receive (marginally) more development than this.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Worthless_side_characters_in_general\">Worthless side characters in general</span></h4>\n<p>Notionally, besides attempting to make money to rebuild a bar, the characters traveling with Rob believe that they have a \"duty to fight against evil,\" but out of all of them (including Rob) only Ping Pong the gorilla actually does anything effective to thwart the antagonists. This is mirrored in <i>Sonichu</i>, where often the entire cast will struggle to defeat an enemy (or in the case of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Women%27s_rights\" title=\"Women's rights\">female characters</a>, stand around and watch) because Chris wants his <a href=\"/cwcki/Darkbind_Sonichu\" title=\"Darkbind Sonichu\">flavor</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Crystal_Weston_Chandler_(sister)\" title=\"Crystal Weston Chandler (sister)\">of</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Sailor_Megtune\" title=\"Sailor Megtune\">the</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Bionic_the_Hedgehog\" title=\"Bionic the Hedgehog\">month</a> to be the focus of the action.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Worthless_law_enforcement\">Worthless <a href=\"/cwcki/Jerkop\" title=\"Jerkop\">law enforcement</a></span></h4>\n<p>Rob's world has <i>no meaningful law enforcement</i> and the Jackals are free to terrorize, destroy, and threaten the global economy as they see fit (even though, as addressed, the means through which they do so make absolutely no sense). The Jackals' ability to get away with what they do in the cartoon indicates that, American Rabbit aside, there is no organized police or military force of <i>any kind</i>. This is analogous to the dystopian <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a>, where <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris-Chan_Sonichu\" title=\"Chris-Chan Sonichu\">Chris-Chan Sonichu</a> and his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Electric_Hedgehog_Pokemon\" title=\"Electric Hedgehog Pokemon\">Electric Hedgehog Pokemon</a> are the only thing standing between the Private Villa of Corrupted Citizens and the terrified citizenry of the ailing dictatorship, rather like things are for the bulk of <i>Sonichu</i> before <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_31#Magi-Chan_knows_when_you_fuck\" title=\"Mailbag 31\">CWCVille was revealed to be under martial law</a>.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"All_the_protagonists_are_worthless\">All the protagonists are worthless</span></h4>\n<p>With all his superpowers, Rob punches out all of two Jackals during the whole movie. Every other time he uses his powers is to save himself and his moron friends from another trap the Jackals have sprung on them. At one point, Rob is reduced to <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_is_Sad\" title=\"CWC is Sad\">a blubbering mess</a>, and has to be given a pep talk by the same geriatric rabbit who was watching over him as a child (who is now a New York taxi driver for some fucking reason) before he can finally save the day once and for all. This worthlessness can be seen in both Sonichu AND Chris, particularly during the earlier comics where Chris was always getting saved by <a href=\"/cwcki/Sailor_Megtune\" title=\"Sailor Megtune\">Sailor Megtune</a>.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"A_villain_in_a_staff\">A villain in a staff</span></h4>\n<p>Or at least, a villain ON a staff. The main antagonist of the movie, Vultor, is portrayed as a man entirely concealed in a gangster suit and hat, with a staff that doubles as a perch for his pet vulture. It's later revealed that the gangster suit and hat were filled with nothing but air, and that the vulture IS Vultor, and has somehow been controlling the suit in a way that is never addressed by the movie. While <a href=\"/cwcki/Count_Graduon\" title=\"Count Graduon\">Count Graduon</a> isn't directly controlling <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Mary Lee Walsh</a>, he certainly calls the shots, despite being less powerful and trapped in a fucking staff.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Plot_holes_and_loose_ends\">Plot holes and loose ends</span></h4>\n<p>As mentioned, a great many inconsistencies exist within the movie. The whole reason Rob and his band start to travel America is to raise money to rebuild a bar, but all the venues they plan to play at get destroyed, they lose their car, and even their instruments. At the very end of the movie they can't even afford to rent new ones, but this point is never addressed since the fact that Vultor has been defeated automatically means it's a happy ending. Not to mention the aforementioned \"chocolate moose\" plot. The only excuse that <i>The Adventures of The American Rabbit</i> has is that it is just a single hour and a half movie made for children (and even then, children deserve far better animated movies than <i>this</i>), whereas Chris will either forget about plot points in <i>Sonichu</i> until he's reminded in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag\" title=\"Mailbag\">Mailbag</a>, or have the story in his head all along and expect everyone else to magically understand it, and get angry when they inevitably don't.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"/cwcki/March_2025_social_media_posts#What_got_Chris_into_Sonic?\" title=\"March 2025 social media posts\">March 2025 social media posts#What got Chris into Sonic?</a></span>\n</li>\n</ol></div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_fictional_characters_guest_appearing_in_Sonichu#Others\" title=\"List of fictional characters guest appearing in Sonichu\">Bugs Bunny</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_and_Rosechu%27s_Children\" title=\"Sonichu and Rosechu's Children\">Robbie Sonee</a>, possibly named after the film's incompetent \"hero\".</li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Robee_Sonee_and_the_Tomgirls\" title=\"Robee Sonee and the Tomgirls\">Robee Sonee and the Tomgirls</a>, Robbie's <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tomgirl\" title=\"Tomgirl\">Tomgirl</a> years.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<ul><li><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_the_American_Rabbit\" title=\"wikipedia:The Adventures of the American Rabbit\">Wikipedia article</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0166948/\" rel=\"nofollow\">IMDb page</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfTheAmericanRabbit\" rel=\"nofollow\">TV Tropes page of the movie.</a></li></ul>\n<table align=\"center\" id=\"toc\" style=\"text-align:left;
