In print, he types out the word \"sigh\" too.</li>\n<li>\"Mmm\": Closely related to the Sigh, this content-sounding utterance is more of a happy way to begin a video.</li>\n<li>\"Yay!\": In moments of joy, Chris would punctuate his statements with this, not realizing that it makes him sound totally <a href=\"/cwcki/Slow-in-the-minds\" title=\"Slow-in-the-minds\">retarded</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Claw_of_Fail\" title=\"Claw of Fail\">The Claw of Fail</a>: A dramatic, villainous hand gesture Chris uses to show that he means <i>serious business</i>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Random-access_humor\" title=\"Random-access humor\">Random-access humor</a>: Chris's tendency to blurt things at random, regardless of its relevancy in the situation. Intended to be funny but only succeeds in making him sound retarded, which then makes it funny again.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Pedo-Glasses\" title=\"Pedo-Glasses\">Dramatic Glasses Removal</a>: Chris puts on his glasses so he can remove them dramatically, like David Caruso. Again. And again. It tends to kind of wear down the intended effect, and unlike David Caruso, he doesn't have kickass background music whenever he does it.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Creepy_stare\" title=\"Creepy stare\">The Creepy Stare</a>: A blank to incredibly intense stare; often straight into the camera. Either intended to be threatening or alluring, but it only succeeds in achieving the name granted to it.</li>\n<li>The Autistic Shuffle: Like some people on the autistic spectrum, Chris finds pointless, repetitive rocking motions soothing. Whether sitting or standing, in some of the more <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress\" title=\"Stress\">stressful</a> videos he can be seen swaying back and forth when he's <a href=\"/cwcki/Greetings_to_Kaceys_Folks\" title=\"Greetings to Kaceys Folks\">nervous</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Re_to_Chris_No_2_-_SHE_IS_MINE_NOW#Ian.27s_video\" title=\"Re to Chris No 2 - SHE IS MINE NOW\">angry</a>, or anticipating <a href=\"/cwcki/For_My_Sweetest_Ivy\" title=\"For My Sweetest Ivy\">sex-time</a>.</li>\n<li>The Salute: Chris occasionally displays a limp version of the Cub Scout salute (middle and index fingers pointing, ring finger and pinky under the thumb). Typically this appears when Chris wants to show off his patriotism and/or respect for someone, sometimes before he butchers some popular patriotic song.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/DIRTY,_CRAPPED_BRIEFS\" title=\"DIRTY, CRAPPED BRIEFS\">The Important Fart</a>: Chris has no problems whatsoever farting in middle of an important video blog update, but most people have already fortunately been bedazzled by his continuous, sleep-inducing, rambling droning. In this regard, Chris is a true illusionist, a master of diversion. Bet you didn't notice when he farted it in the first time when you watched the video? <i>You only notice it if you watch it the second time.</i> (Obviously this is not as neat a trick as making the Statue of Liberty vanish, but still, it's pretty fearsome. In certain circles.)</li>\n<li>The Falsetto: Occasionally, when speaking to a sweetheart or in some other situation where he wishes to appear as innocent and non-threatening, Chris will start to speak in an inhumanly high-pitched, baby-like voice. While in Chris’s head this is seen as cute, in reality there are few things that are more terrifying to the boyfriend-free crowd than hearing a grown man speak to them in a voice reminiscent of Big Bird on helium. Perhaps the most disturbing instance of this was in the video <a href=\"/cwcki/For_My_Sweetest_Ivy\" title=\"For My Sweetest Ivy\">”For My Sweetest Ivy,”</a> in which Chris lovingly regales Ivy about his intentions to have their sex-time together while sounding like a store-brand, Virginian Tiny Tim.</li></ul>\n<table align=\"center\" id=\"toc\" style=\"text-align:Left; clear:both;\" width=\"70%\">\n<tbody><tr align=\"center\" style=\"background:#ccccff\">\n<td><b><a class=\"mw-selflink selflink\">Mannerisms</a></b>\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"font-size:11px;\">\n<center>\n<p>🦀 <a href=\"/cwcki/Claw_of_Fail\" title=\"Claw of Fail\">Claw of Fail</a> • 👀 <a href=\"/cwcki/Creepy_stare\" title=\"Creepy stare\">Creepy stare</a> • 😎 <a href=\"/cwcki/Pedo-Glasses\" title=\"Pedo-Glasses\">Dramatic glasses removal</a> • 🎲 <a href=\"/cwcki/Random-access_humor\" title=\"Random-access humor\">Random-access humor</a> • 😓 <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress_sigh\" title=\"Stress sigh\">Stress sigh</a>\n</p>\n</center>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCached time: 20251126112428\nCache expiry: 86400\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: []\nCPU time usage: 0.037 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.041 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 46/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 1217/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 23/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 9/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/100\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 0/5000000 bytes\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   11.197      1 -total\n 61.61%    6.898      1 Template:Mannerisms\n 37.35%    4.182      1 Template:Incomplete\n 36.19%    4.052      1 Template:Namespace_detect\n-->\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key cwcki-1_:pcache:idhash:2881-0!canonical and timestamp 20251126112428 and revision id 307253.
