Chris would initially refuse to do it, which made her cry, but he would become completely on board after a few rule clarifications. Jackie also clarified that if he succeeded, she would have sex with him. This contest resulted in a huge amount of videos uploaded that month, a quantity has yet to be topped by Chris ever since. It also, barring <a href=\"/cwcki/100_2357.MOV\" title=\"100 2357.MOV\">one more video</a> uploaded the next month, serves as the last hurrah of the 'classic Chris' era, prior to him coming out as a <a href=\"/cwcki/Transgender\" title=\"Transgender\">tomgirl</a>. Jackie came up with the idea immediately after Chris posted <a href=\"/cwcki/Song_for_Jackie.MOV\" title=\"Song for Jackie.MOV\">Song for Jackie.MOV</a>, possibly seeing the gold mine of content that could come from Chris <a href=\"/cwcki/Cosplaying\" title=\"Cosplaying\">cosplaying</a>.\n</p><p>Most of Chris's cosplays are completely <a href=\"/cwcki/Facial_blindness\" title=\"Facial blindness\">bizarre depictions</a> of the characters, that no-one would be able to recognize if not told who it was by Chris. Also, while the intent was for Chris to upload a video every day of the month, Chris would often be late and upload videos days later, citing his computer and Internet issues as the result - though other times, he would claim he would upload videos using the Internet at the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Alderman_Library\" title=\"Alderman Library\">Alderman Library</a>, but then forget to do so for weeks. Chris also half-assed a lot of the videos made for the contest due to laziness, or having discomfort or unwillingness to do the task he was given (such as rewriting the ending to <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_10\" title=\"Sonichu 10\">Sonichu 10</a></i> to show forgiveness towards <a href=\"/cwcki/Alec_Benson_Leary\" title=\"Alec Benson Leary\">Alec Benson Leary</a> and his crew, or simply cleaning his dirty shower); this was despite the potential reward for properly following the rules being him finally no longer being a <a href=\"/cwcki/Virgin_with_rage\" title=\"Virgin with rage\">virgin with rage</a>. Ultimately, the contest ended with Jackie being too frustrated at Chris to give him some <a href=\"/cwcki/China\" title=\"China\">china</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Videos\">The Videos</span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/cwcki/I_like_Mary_Poppins\" title=\"I like Mary Poppins\">I like Mary Poppins</a> - Chris attempts to dance and sing like the chimney sweepers from <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Poppins\" title=\"Mary Poppins\">Mary Poppins</a></i>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/100_2265\" title=\"100 2265\">100 2265</a> - Chris dresses up as the <a href=\"/cwcki/McDonald%27s\" title=\"McDonald's\">McDonald's</a> mascot, The Hamburglar.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/100_2266\" title=\"100 2266\">100 2266</a> - Chris dresses up as another McDonald's mascot, The Grimace, before pulling out his <a href=\"/cwcki/Gitar_of_Fail\" title=\"Gitar of Fail\">gitar</a> and playing \"Don't Laugh at Me\" by Mark Wills.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/100_2267\" title=\"100 2267\">100 2267</a> - Chris dresses up as <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">Clyde Cash</a>, complete with <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_race\" title=\"Chris and race\">his face</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Don%27tPintheOop\" title=\"Don'tPintheOop\">being fuckin' orange</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/100_2269\" title=\"100 2269\">100 2269</a> - Chris dons a Sgt.
