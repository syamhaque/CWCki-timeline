Aaaaaayy.\n</p><p>Answer: Arthur Fonzerellifrom \"Happy Days\".\n</p><p>I feel like I have shut emotions out to most everyone. It would take a LOT, and only from a woman who was truthfully in love with me for the long haul, in person, for me to take down my emotional walls. It also hurts me, in the heart, when I feel a certain amount of happy or positive emotions. And I think I have mostly forgotten the happier person I was over the half decade ago. Why does my adult life have to be cursed with cruel people not only locally, but Around the Freaking World. I really wish I could go back to 1999 and reroute my future. And the heartaches come about more often, but still mildly, when I am outside of my house.\n</p><p>To change the subject, I have recently downloaded and watched \"Flatliners\" (a 1990 movie starring Joe Schuemaker). I found it very interesting and well put on the theory of what a person may see after dying. It may not be the path towards a light, and not necessary hell, but trapped in a continuous looping of the event of what one has been subconsciously feeling guilty about from their life. It is a thriller that really makes you think more about your life.

Have you considered putting her in some sort of home or having an at home nurse? It would alleviate some of the stress caring for her and give you more time to socialize and get out into the World.\n</p><p>Since you couldn't go to Magfest I'll be going to another convention in March.

You'd definitely need to pick the right one to prevent thieving, but typically there's nothing to be worried about. I'm only worried about your health as well, because it seems the burden of caring for your mother is wearing you down, physically and emotionally. I apologize if this seems too brunt and honest, but at this point your mother is holding you back from having a social life (or any sort of life), let alone a girlfriend. I suggest asking Rocky about this, because I'm sure she has the resources to help you with this. Or at least some ideas to help you get back on your feet. I understand that you want to keep your mother happy, but sometimes it's okay to be selfish every once in a while to keep yourself happy. :)\n</p><p>Which brings me back on the topic of Madicon. Since it's not that far from where you live, you can go down for a day instead of the entire weekend. Its only $15, plus gas money which shouldn't be THAT much.

Some girls use that to draw in eyebrows. But there's plenty of smudge proof eyebrow pencils out there. A lot of girls actually wax their entire eyebrows off and just draw them on everyday. Anyways, you should definitely check out that Crazy Blind Date app. I looked into it a little bit. All you do is pick days and times you're available, then you pick a location for where you want this blind date to happen. People (gals, in your case) can accept and voila, you have a date. It's also vice versa; you can look at a list of girls and where and when they want to meet up and you can accept their's. Apparently OKCupid will scramble your picture so it's like a mystery! :)\n</p><p>Eh, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is okay. I watched it with friends when I was a kid.

It lets me set the location to meet, but not the TIME. And it only looks up certain places, like for Sunday, I wanted to put in my church, but it would NOT highlight it for selection, even from typing its name. Best I can do with it is select the McD in Ruckersville on the days of the week I intend to make my usual tea/coffee break and walk around Wal-Mart. I hang out here at the McD for like an hour or two, solving the Sudoku puzzle in the Washington Post comics, reading a few of said comics and horoscope, checking my email, checking in with my \"Simpsons Tapped Out\" game app, and collecting/counting my thoughts.\n</p><p>Speaking of which, I did note the one photograph on the damn Cwcki of me hanging here and fiddling one day last Summer, definitely will keep my back to the center wall's inside corner and tunnel my vision forward.

Not a lot of people take kindly to Bullying, and I do not take kindly to Trolling.\n</p><p>Tell your crew and crap-filled producers that for Promoting Trolling, you all will Pay unto everyone you have further emotionally damaged and embarrassed on television.\n</p><p>I am not a fan of \"Failosophy\", and I despise your kind of people continuing to Troll for the LULZ.\n</p><p>Sincerely,\n</p><p>Christian Weston Chandler,\n</p><p>Ruckersville, VA, USA.\n</p><p>He swiftly replied:\n</p><p>Thank for being in touch. That wasn't my intention at all. I agree that trolling is just a digital form of bullying. I was told that all the photos on the show have been signed off as ok to be used on air from the original owners/people who took the photos. I'm only ok with doing these jokes as long as the people who took them are in on the joke as well. If that didn't happen with your photo I am truly very sorry. Please accept my apology because that wasn't my intention at all. If there's anything I can do please let me know.\n</p><p>Best,\n</p><p>Hasan\n</p><p>I then replied requesting his more direct contact info, offering my email address and iPhone number, and that I would think it over and consult with my people (Rob Bell). I sincerely think there is a chance of a legal lawsuit, with a settlement. But those details are being discussed between me and Rob at the moment. But according to Hassan's reply, the photos do need to be signed off as ok for airing, FROM the Original Owners/People who Took Them. I took the photo myself, and was not informed beforehand, so chances should be fair to good.\n</p><p>I just have to wait and see what Rob says.\n</p><p>TTYL\n</p><p>Stay Safe,\n</p><p>Christian W.

Let me try to give you some advice:\n</p><p>Your face is really not as big a part of the problem as you think it is. What is a much bigger issue is the parts of your appearance you can control. Your hair probably puts people off a bit because it doesn't really look like you take much care of it - it's all over the place most of the time I see it. You know, the longer hair is, the more work that needs to go into maintaining it. That's why I compared you to that pic of Jeff Daniels (the \"scary\" movie star you reference) - because in that pic his hair was kind of wild. Incidentally, nobody thinks Jeff Daniels is ugly. He has a wife and kids and his life is happy.\n</p><p>Which brings me to my next point. Your appearance alone has little to do with not attracting women. The fact is, you have been on your Love Quest since you were 21, but you really haven't even done much of anything. In all that time you made moves on two girls, right? Megan and Heather? And both turned you down, but every guy friend I have has been turned down by way more than two girls, no matter how good looking they are. I have a friend who has gotten rejected by as many as 10 girls in a night. He still finds girls who like him. He doesn't quit like you did after it didn't work with Heather. You can't say you're failing to get girls because you aren't even trying to get girls. You don't go out and make moves on them.\n</p><p>See, your \"Love Quest\" has never really been a quest. It's more of a \"Love Wait\". You've just been waiting for a girl to come to you. But like I've told you many, many times, that's not how our world works. Girls don't make moves on guys, no matter how good looking they are. Guys make the move. It's not enough to just flirt a little. You gotta be direct and ask if she'd like to go out with you. And you gotta try regularly, no matter how many rejections you get. There's a reason Mario gets more than one life - it's so he can try and try again. You're not gonna defeat Bowser (get a girlfriend) if you quit the game after the first goomba hits you (the first rejection you get).\n</p><p>And yeah, I know you'll say you're shy, but lots of guys are shy and they still work on trying even when it makes them uncomfortable. You've wasted 11 years basically doing almost nothing instead of just trying. Let's say you asked out a girl right after you turned 21 and she said \"NO\" to you and it hurt to be rejected. It would have hurt for a little bit, but would that still matter 10 years later? No, of course it wouldn't. You could have moved on and found a new girl to ask out a week later. And eventually, you'd find someone. You always want to dwell on the past instead of trying something new. You gotta ask yourself, do you want to spend the next 11 years feeling sorry for yourself? Because asking for pity hasn't gotten you anywhere so far. Do you want to be alone for the next 11 years just because you're scared to ask out the next pretty girl you see tomorrow or next week or whenever?\n</p><p>So yeah, there's my advice. Just go out and try! If a girl says no, it's not the end of the world. If a girl has a boyfriend, he's not gonna come beat you up just because you asked her out politely. Life isn't like a zany sitcom where that stuff happens.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris_fucks_himself\">Chris fucks himself</span></h2>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Sat, Apr 19, 2014 at 11:04 PM\n<p>A new feat\n</p><p>I have just randomly done something that would normally be useless and trivial, and it would be something that would be more often done in a dream.

I know if I don't tame my beast of a mane after I shower it's all over the place! I'm going to include some pictures of reference that you can use to help your hair. In one picture, they have pretty curly hair. I think this hair style would definitely suit you since you already have a natural waviness to your hair. I recommend getting a perm if you decide to go that route. I've found that perms suit just about anyone. The second picture, is just straight hair. You can always straighten your hair and it'll help tame your locks that'll blow naturally in the breeze. And don't forget to condition, condition, condition! Even if you have healthy hair, if it doesn't look like you make an effort to style in some sort of way it comes off as lazy, especially to women.

I have a few points:\n</p><p>Women don't ask out men. Sure, it happens once in a rare while, but so does winning the lottery. You can't count on winning the lottery, it's too rare. I don't know where you get this idea that women ask out men regularly but it's not true, take it from an actual woman (me).\n</p><p>When I said you \"made moves\", I meant you made it clear to them that you want to date them. That's what I'm talking about. Just ask a girl if she would like to go on a date with you. You don't have to speak in code.\n</p><p>Meeting girls isn't that complicated. The basics are going up and saying hi. Yes, approaching someone of the opposite sex is scary in the beginning, but the only way to solve that is practice. Getting shot down sucks, I can sympathize. But overall you've gotten shot down by what, a few women? The men who GET women, they get shot down all the time. There are men who get shot down every day of the week. They still get girls because they TRY. That's how you meet girls.

If you bury and ignore them then we don't grow as a person. The reason I asked you to \"destroy\" the negative is to help you understand that your negative traits aren't who make you who you are.

And I already put a lot of frustrations against Snyder, Walsh and Mimms into my lego minifigure remakes of them with torture in a plastic canister shaking, spinning them around and around on a lego water wheel, stomping on them, and stuffing them into my sock and waking around with them to get a stink of feet. So the obvious next opposers were the damn Jerkops, so I defaced \"POLICE\" decals on the car and the Police Station rebuilt for my city-to-be-rebuilt.

I would not call her a \"really big woman.\" Chris, you've just about shot down or criticized everything I've suggested to you. Either be open to what I'm doing or suggesting to you or you can fly solo. I'm not sure how I can put it, so I'll be blunt. You're a person who's not going to have his pick of the litter when it comes to women. If that was the case, you wouldn't need my help. It's not all about the appearance either. You don't have a job and much money. You have a hobby that can easily be seen as childish. Look, even guys who are bombshell sexy have a difficult time keeping a woman around if they don't have a job. You have to really sell what you have, which is going to be difficult for you. So that's why I keep saying you need to keep your options open, even to women who \"are big.\" She could have a charming personality. And when I complimented her on her sunglasses and asked her about the weather, she was willing to respond. You don't even necessarily have to be romantically interested in her. You can just be friends, which can help with your self-esteem and shyness.

I can only help you if you accept the help that's given. I haven't demanded anything that requires an extraordinary amount of effort on your part or anything that is dangerous.
