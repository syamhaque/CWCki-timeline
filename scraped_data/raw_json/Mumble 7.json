I mean, alright, you're looking at the, uh woman, you might imagine her naked, but, I mean, you would respe- I mean, you would, you would still respect, I mean, if you were still respecting that woman, you would appreciate her more for like who she was aside or in addition to the nudity, then that's not as bad as just, as just only doing it for the appearance.<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#03f\"><b>Chris:</b></span> That's why, uh, that's why the playboy magazines, they give you the introductions of the women. It's like letting you know who they are (unintelligible).<br/>\n<b>Fan:</b> Oh but, yeah, but there weren't any, uh, descriptions under the, yeah never mind.<br/>\n<b>Other fan:</b> Thank you for the clarification Chris.<br/>\n<b>Fan:</b> Hey Chris, do you love America?<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#03f\"><b>Chris:</b></span> I'm patriotic.<br/>\n<b>Fan:</b> That's good.

Alright, I'll stay a little while longer.<br/>\n<b>Fan:</b> Yeah, if anyone does, if anyone asks anything that makes him feel uncomfortable, I'm gonna kick you out of the room.<br/>\n(Everyone speaks)<br/>\n<b>Other fan:</b> Chris, could you give me some advice?<br/>\n<b>Other fan:</b> I have a Japanese friend, he's, he's actually 26 and he's never had a girlfriend and we asked him some questions, just joking around one day. And we asked him if his, when he gets married, if his wife wanted to sleep with another man, would he be okay with it, and he actually said yes, as long as she wasn't being forced. Now that kind of bothered us, because us Americans, right, we think that marriage, and you know you're with somebody, they should be faithful, but he doesn't seem to think so, so I wanted to see if you had any advice maybe on what we could do to try and convince him that his viewpoint is wrong.<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#03f\"><b>Chris:</b></span> Well, hmm, it's not necessarily that the viewpoint is wrong. See, the thing is, what, to, to quote, to make it accepta- to make it like as if you're actually cheating on somebody, cheating on your spouse in the marriage, it's like not telling them, not telling him, not telling him or her about it beforehand, but it's like, you know, you, it's like you tell them beforehand and you get their approval, it's, it's okay, even if they don't want to be part of it. But not telling them, that's definitely like uh, cheating on them.<br/>\n(Audio cuts out)<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#03f\"><b>Chris:</b></span> Well that's another thing I would have to think about, cause, got a bit of a, couple of items of destruction that need to be repaired<br/>\n<b>Fan:</b> Oh, I just got, I just talked to that one friend I was talking about who, uh, saw your website, the 18 one, and it turns out he's, he's gay, he's actually gay and he fapped to, uh I mean he masturbated to, uh, Sonichu.<br/>\n<b>Other fan:</b> Hahaha, your friend's a fag.<br/>\n<b>Fan:</b> And I think he's...<br/>\n(Audio cuts out for 15 seconds)<br/>\n<b>Fan:</b> ...about that?<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#03f\"><b>Chris:</b></span> Well, I think in case you would definitely want to let him know that you are straight and you don't want that kind of relationship, and maybe, and you know<br/>\n<b>Fan:</b> Should I tell him just to get the hell away from your site?<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#03f\"><b>Chris:</b></span> Um, I'm not saying that, but like, uh, you know, you don't want that kind, you don't, I mean that's, that's basically confirmed on that note. So, uh, you want, you still wanna be friends but you don't, but you're not into that kind of thing.<br/>\n<b>Fan:</b> I mean, he was looking at your site, like, the 18 site and he was in like, um-<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#03f\"><b>Chris:</b></span> Over 18.<br/>\n<b>Fan:</b> The over 18 site you made.

Do you think that farts attract gay guys to each other?<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#03f\"><b>Chris:</b></span> Now that's stupid! Not only is that stupid, but it's gross.<br/>\n<b>Fan:</b> Here, I'm gonna take that question and I'm gonna, I'm gonna take that question and spin that into something that's less weird. What would you say the best cologne or whatever a guy could wear to get a girl's attention?<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#03f\"><b>Chris:</b></span> I recommend <a href=\"/cwcki/Axe\" title=\"Axe\">Axe</a> body spray.<br/>\n<b>Fan:</b> Oh yeah?

I mean, Old Spice is pretty good. I had, I had like a couple of girls go up to me asking me for dates with Old Spice.<br/>\n<b>Female fan:</b> I actually wore that Orion scent, uhh, still smelling it.

But it was definitely, it was given, but it was offered in this book written by a nine-year-old.<br/>\n<b>Female fan:</b> Mm.<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#03f\"><b>Chris:</b></span> When you're going to uh find yourself a woman, you just try to stay calm.

Don't uh let your nerves get the best of ya.<br/>\n<b>Fan:</b> What should I say, what should I say here, y'know, to the girl?<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#03f\"><b>Chris:</b></span> Start with \"hello\" and \"how are you\".<br/>\n<b>Fan:</b> Should I ask her, should I like do a pick-up line? Do those work?<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#03f\"><b>Chris:</b></span> Hmm. Um, sometimes. But I wouldn't, I wouldn't exactly count on it in a desperate situation. But I mean like uh, talk about yourself a little bit saying like, \"Ooh did you read in the paper today about this article that really caught my eye?\"<br/>\n<b>Fan:</b> I was thinking about standing by the wall with <a href=\"/cwcki/Attraction_Sign\" title=\"Attraction Sign\">a sign</a>.

(Female fan laughs) To other people, so...<br/>\n<b>Other fan:</b> Ohh. (unintelligible)<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#03f\"><b>Chris:</b></span> So I stop- So I stopped- So I stopped doing that a long time ago and, I don't know (what payed attention?)<br/>\n<b>Fan:</b> Oh.<br/>\n(pause)<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#03f\"><b>Chris:</b></span> Mm.

Does wearing that medallion, does that attract females? I was thinking about making my own.<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#03f\"><b>Chris:</b></span> (sigh) You could do what you want, to try and make yourself stand out. Um... But it depends on if you, it depends on other peoples' point of uh you I guess at this point, um... You might want to get a second opinion. I mean it's not like I can see you over da Mumble and uh say what makes you look okay and what makes you look NOT okay. Yeah, g- get a second opinion from somebody else in person.<br/>\n<b>Fan:</b> What about you, do you think that medallion makes you look, y'know, more attractive to girls?<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#03f\"><b>Chris:</b></span> Ehhmmm. Yeah. Yeah I don't know. I don't know.<br/>\n<b>Fan:</b> Yeah I think it looks pretty cool on you. So that's, yeah.<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#03f\"><b>Chris:</b></span> Well you could try it, see if you could try and see if it works for ya.<br/>\n<b>Female fan:</b> Speaking, speaking of the medallion, I noticed you wear it on the outside. Have you ever done any replacing the chain on it to something a little more comfortable?<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#03f\"><b>Chris:</b></span> Uh no. It's fine. It's fine. I mean I'd say that this uh the necklace chain with the like a pair- like a pair of- like a pair of keyrings with a belt buckle on them.<br/>\n<b>Female fan:</b> Mm. Alright.<br/>\n(typing noises)<br/>\n<b>Other fan:</b> Hey Chris in hentai, the uh guys- like the girls usually say no but the, the guy touches her a bit and she gets into it. I was just wondering if you think that really works, have you ever tried that?<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#03f\"><b>Chris:</b></span> Uh. I'm sorry, could you repeat that?<br/>\n<b>Other fan:</b> I said in hentai, y'know the Japanese um, kinda pornography-<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#03f\"><b>Chris:</b></span> Yeah. Yeah-<br/>\n<b>Other fan:</b> -usually, the, the girl kind of says no but then the guy starts touching her boobs or something and she gets real excited and gets into it. I was just wondering if you think that really works. Can you just make a girl excited and into you just like that?<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#03f\"><b>Chris:</b></span> Uhh... Yeah I don't think so. I me- I mean in most of the time I'm sure you would probably just, the girl would probably just turn around and slap you right in the face or kick you in the groin.<br/>\n(Various pained groans)<br/>\n<b>Fan:</b> I don't know, you were saying it's educational. I think I saw that in a porn too.<br/>\n<b>Other fan:</b> Uh. Also (unintelligible) asked \"How far have you gotten with a girl\"?<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#03f\"><b>Chris:</b></span> I've never even been on a first date in my lifetime.<br/>\n<b>Female fan:</b> Ohhh.<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#03f\"><b>Chris:</b></span> At this point.<br/>\n<b>Fan:</b> Hey Chris?<br/>\n(Fans talk over each other)<br/>\n<b>Other fan:</b> I was suggesting uh Chris, I have family in Bristow, Virginia. I've been out there a lot. And you know, they're- I mean, people that I've seen in Virginia don't really like anime and things that much. Have you ever considered maybe trying to meet a girl in the west coast? Because a lot of people, especially universities are into anime culture.<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#03f\"><b>Chris:</b></span> (sigh) Yeah but I'm no- I'm not planning on traveling outside of my state. Plus I would prefer to keep it local.<br/>\n<b>Other fan:</b> Yeah.<br/>\n(pause)<br/>\n(Everyone talks over each other)<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#03f\"><b>Chris:</b></span> Yeah but to see the world means to have to have the money to actually go see the world.<br/>\n<b>Fan:</b> Well You just have to save up a little bit.<br/>\n<b>Other fan:</b> Yeah. I mean you know, trains are good.<br/>\n<b>Female fan:</b> (strange incognizable noise)<br/>\n<b>Other fan:</b> Gas is cheap now.<br/>\n<b>Other fan:</b> You can meet so many people just going on a road trip or just you know, taking the bus or something I mean it's not too expensive, it's cheaper than a plane- (Chris talks over him)<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#03f\"><b>Chris:</b></span> Yeah. Yeah, I hear you on that. But I just like, you know, if I want to go on a road trip I'd uh, I would not like to go it alone. I'd like to have my sweetheart by my side.<br/>\n<b>Female fan:</b> Mmm.<br/>\n<b>Fan:</b> The point is you could always get a job. That's what I did once a-(cut off)<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#03f\"><b>Chris:</b></span> Uh.<br/>\n(Fans talk over each other)<br/>\n<b>Other fan:</b> -and I wanted to meet a girl? I got this t-shirt that says \"ask me about my large and attractive penis\" and I wear that to the mall and it works every time.<br/>\n<b>Fan:</b> Are you kidding, really?<br/>\n<b>Other fan:</b> Yes. (cut off)<br/>\n<b>Female fan:</b> Well that's interesting. (laughs) I have to meet you some time.<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#03f\"><b>Chris:</b></span> Ah boy.

Yeah, that was probably me be- because I was like objecting to the uh, when he was describing what it said on his t-shirt.<br/>\n<b>Fan:</b> Yeah that wasn't cool.<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#03f\"><b>Chris:</b></span> Yeah.<br/>\n<b>Other fan:</b> You guys have no taste.<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#03f\"><b>Chris:</b></span> Yeah-<br/>\n<b>Guy:</b> Disgusting!<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#03f\"><b>Chris:</b></span> Yeah I know.<br/>\n<b>Fan:</b> Okay um.<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#03f\"><b>Chris:</b></span>But it just uh, just it m- just ma- I mean the way I see it, see somebody else wearing that it makes, it uh, it makes- it s- it would appear that guy is only looking for sex and women would be turned by sh- sh- sex right away at that point.<br/>\n<b>Guy:</b> Yeah it kinda sums up (cut off)<br/>\n<b>Fan:</b> Um, so...<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#03f\"><b>Chris:</b></span> Um... (Chris and Fan talk over each other) Yeah let me answer this guy's question. Yeah I don't know much about gentleman's clubs so I can't really answer that question. A, and uh...<br/>\n<b>Fan:</b> What about you though, like when you're looking for a girl, does like sex really matter? Like, to attractiveness?<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#03f\"><b>Chris:</b></span> Uh, er, yeah. Eventually the se- yeah. Attractiveness does matter in one point of view but uh, but if you think about it it's like you want to get to know the person, the woman inside as well. Um, so, (I'd rather be in it?) so like uh, we were very close to each other emotionally and like friends, then the sex. Like uh, how Panda and I were very... close.<br/>\n<b>Female fan:</b> Hmm.<br/>\n<b>Other guy:</b> What happened to Panda?<br/>\n<b>Female fan:</b> Yeah what happened to her?<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#03f\"><b>Chris:</b></span> I haven't heard fermer- I haven't heard from her in over two weeks and then recently there were, there was the fires in Australia close to by where she was.
