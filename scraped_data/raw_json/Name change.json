The Orchestra features an anthropomorphic bear as it's conductor, which with human control is designed to be fully interactive with the audience. The bear can speak to the audience and receive questions, engaging in conversation. Chris became enamoured with the bear and started talking to it. It is most likely that a combination of Chris' mumbling, poor microphone/headset quality and the human operator mishearing him resulted in the Godbear addressing Christopher as Christian. It's unknown to anyone besides Chris why he <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">latched onto</a> this new name, but it couldn't help that his <a href=\"/cwcki/Enablers\" title=\"Enablers\">parents</a> went through with a legal name change at the request of their 10 year old son.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Christian_to_Christine\">Christian to Christine</span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:152px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Court_Record_-_2016_Name_Change_from_Christian_to_Christine_(Chris,_CL16000067-00).png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"137\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/8/82/Court_Record_-_2016_Name_Change_from_Christian_to_Christine_%28Chris%2C_CL16000067-00%29.png/150px-Court_Record_-_2016_Name_Change_from_Christian_to_Christine_%28Chris%2C_CL16000067-00%29.png\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/8/82/Court_Record_-_2016_Name_Change_from_Christian_to_Christine_%28Chris%2C_CL16000067-00%29.png/225px-Court_Record_-_2016_Name_Change_from_Christian_to_Christine_%28Chris%2C_CL16000067-00%29.png 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/8/82/Court_Record_-_2016_Name_Change_from_Christian_to_Christine_%28Chris%2C_CL16000067-00%29.png/300px-Court_Record_-_2016_Name_Change_from_Christian_to_Christine_%28Chris%2C_CL16000067-00%29.png 2x\" width=\"150\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Court_Record_-_2016_Name_Change_from_Christian_to_Christine_(Chris,_CL16000067-00).png\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Court record approving the name change.</div></div></div>\n<p>In May of 2016, after roughly 5 years of exploring <a href=\"/cwcki/Transgender\" title=\"Transgender\">his feminine side</a> Christian decided to officially transition from male to female. Christian submitted a name change request which was approved, officially and legally changing his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/True_and_Honest\" title=\"True and Honest\">True and Honest</a> name to Christine. Chris has at times become annoyed with people referring to him as \"Chris\" or \"Christian\", even though his twitter username contains \"Chris Chan\". He has also paradoxically claimed that he doesn't mind what people call him<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup>, although he contradicts himself almost immediately.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Unofficial_name_changes\">Unofficial name changes</span></h2>\n<p>Chris has gone by dozens of unofficial names, for a more complete list check out <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler\">this page</a>. Below are some of the funniest/most notable.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ricardo\">Ricardo</span></h3>\n<p>Ricardo Weston Chandler is Chris' Spanish <i>nom de guerre</i>. During Chris' Spanish classes through <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Manchester_High\" title=\"Manchester High\">high school</a> he used the name Ricardo whenever speaking or writing in Spanish. It is common that foreign language students may adopt a native translation of their own name, but it is not common for students to pick an entirely new name like Chris had done. Chris continued to use the name Ricardo whenever speaking/typing in Spanish for years after high school, and sometimes used it as an alias during the <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler#Classic_Era\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler\">classic era</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"JenkinsJinkies\">JenkinsJinkies</span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/cwcki/JenkinsJinkies\" title=\"JenkinsJinkies\">JenkinsJinkies</a> was a persona that Chris adopted in <a href=\"/cwcki/2010\" title=\"2010\">2010</a> in order to infiltrate the <a href=\"/cwcki/Trollin_Train\" title=\"Trollin Train\">Trollin' Train forum</a> in order to investigate the plans of infamous <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">trolls</a> such as <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">Clyde Cash</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Billy_Mays\" title=\"Billy Mays\">Billy Mays</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Jack_Thaddeus\" title=\"Jack Thaddeus\">Jack Thaddeus</a> and other members of the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/The_Miscreants\" title=\"The Miscreants\">Miscreants</a>. Using this persona Chris tried to make members of the Trollin' Train forum believe that JenkinsJinkies was a <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">bi-curious</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Pedofork\" title=\"Pedofork\">teenager</a> who lived across the street from Chris at <a href=\"/cwcki/14_Branchland_Court\" title=\"14 Branchland Court\">14 Branchland Court</a>. For bizarre and unknown reasons Chris included graphic details of JenkinsJinkies being raped at 7 years old, and details of homosexual encounters between himself and two gay friends. None of this actually happened to Chris and the assumption is that he included these details because he believed every troll was a homosexual teenager. Chris abandoned the online alias after he got scared that the police would arrest him for being a troll, since he had association to the forum.

In <a href=\"/cwcki/2009\" title=\"2009\">late 2009</a> Chris' <a href=\"/cwcki/YouTube\" title=\"YouTube\">YouTube</a> account CChanSonichu had been hacked and he was forced to create a new account, which he named IBAChandler as a play on words (I-Be-A-Chandler). <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">Trolls</a> quickly picked up on this and accused Chris of being an imposter, named Ian Brandon Anderson for the IBA at the beginning of his YouTube username.

Chris dropped the Carlos Chantor alias by summer 2010 when he shut down his Escorts.com profile, having pleased no clients.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"CPU_Blue_Heart\">CPU Blue Heart</span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/cwcki/CPU_Blue_Heart\" title=\"CPU Blue Heart\">CPU Blue Heart</a> is a CPU Goddess of the nation of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Cwcville\" title=\"Cwcville\">Cwcville</a> and the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Commodore\" title=\"Commodore\">Commodore computers</a>. This <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Autistic\" title=\"Autistic\">autistic</a> alias was implanted on Chris' <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Naive\" title=\"Naive\">naive</a> mind by the <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys</a> in <a href=\"/cwcki/November_2017\" title=\"November 2017\">November 2017</a>. The alias is inspired by an anime <a href=\"/cwcki/Hyperdimension_Neptunia\" title=\"Hyperdimension Neptunia\">Hyperdimension Neptunia</a> which the Idea Guys adopted many concepts from. Chris uses this alter-ego to spout prophecies for the <a href=\"/cwcki/Dimensional_Merge\" title=\"Dimensional Merge\">Dimensional Merge</a>, a fictional belief that <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Dimension_1218\" title=\"Dimension 1218\">our universe</a> and one <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Dimension_C-197\" title=\"Dimension C-197\">containing all the \"OC's\"</a> (Comic book characters, Chris' custom characters like <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a> and movie characters) will collide, resulting in anthropomorphic sonic-pikachu mutants roaming the streets.\n</p><p>Chris sometimes roleplays on Twitter in-character as CPU Blue Heart, mostly posting <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_english\" title=\"Chris and english\">nonsensical</a> ramblings about the incoming merge as a coping mechanism, or praising his devotee's.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Mama\">Mama</span></h3>\n<p>\"Mama\" is a creepy alias that Chris uses for himself in third-person when he claims he is <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/List_of_Chris%27s_Lies\" title=\"List of Chris's Lies\">\"possessed\"</a> by one of his <a href=\"/cwcki/Spirit_possession\" title=\"Spirit possession\">OC's</a>. Chris most commonly uses this in <a href=\"/cwcki/Discord\" title=\"Discord\">Discord</a> messages or <a href=\"/cwcki/Twitter\" title=\"Twitter\">Twitter</a> posts where he LARPS as a fictional character, and praises himself.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Sonichu.2FMagichan\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sonichu/Magichan\">Sonichu/Magichan</span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(character)\" title=\"Sonichu (character)\">Sonichu</a> is one of Chris' fictional characters, and the titular antagonist of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\">Sonichu Comics</a>. Chris will, on occasion, jump on his computer and LARP online about being possessed by this character. As aforementioned he will creepily refer to himself as \"Mama\" and will talk about the happenings in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Dimension_C-197\" title=\"Dimension C-197\">Dimension C-197</a>. <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Magi-chan\" title=\"Magi-chan\">Magi-chan</a> is similar, being a fictional character that Chris created for his comic. After being manipulated by the <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys</a> Chris now believes (or LARPS) that the character is real, and acts as if Magi-Chan is his real life friend and husband. This can be seen most notably during the <a href=\"/cwcki/Incest_Arrest\" title=\"Incest Arrest\">Incest Arrest</a> where Chris warns <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jerkops\" title=\"Jerkops\">police officers</a> that his husband Magi-Chan is punching them.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Jesus_Christ_Chan_Sonichu\">Jesus Christ Chan Sonichu</span></h3>\n<p>In a <a href=\"/cwcki/Jail_Call_-_13_January_2022\" title=\"Jail Call - 13 January 2022\">phone call from jail</a> in <a href=\"/cwcki/January_2022\" title=\"January 2022\">January 2022</a> Chris referred to himself as Jesus Christ Chan Sonichu.
