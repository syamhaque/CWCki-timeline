Many people who have gender dysphoria become <a href=\"/cwcki/Transgender\" title=\"Transgender\">transgender</a>, although this is not always the case. Chris was officially diagnosed with the condition in 2016, after he made efforts to gender transition prior to this point.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-psychologist_1-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-psychologist-1\">[note 1]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Chris's gender identity has been the subject of intense discussion by observers, and it's been debated whether his feelings of gender dysphoria are real and the logical conclusion of Chris's own feelings and lived experiences (given that he overemphasized his own \"straightness\" and acted like what he thought was a stereotypical man, before feeling more comfortable acting like a stereotypical woman and embracing being transgender and <a href=\"/cwcki/Bisexual\" title=\"Bisexual\">bisexual</a> instead), whether they are just the result of a combination of <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">a warped understanding</a> of <a href=\"/cwcki/Hermaphrodite\" title=\"Hermaphrodite\">gender dynamics</a> stemming from being exposed to <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_television\" title=\"Chris and television\">too</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Anime\" title=\"Anime\">much</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_video_games\" title=\"Chris and video games\">fiction</a> combined with <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_manipulation\" title=\"Chris and manipulation\">years of gaslighting and manipulation by trolls</a>, or whether they are just just an elaborate attempt by Chris to find a <a href=\"/cwcki/Boyfriend-free_girl\" title=\"Boyfriend-free girl\">boyfriend-free girl</a> (<a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">or boy</a>), although there is evidence for these different interpretations. No matter what the case may be, the reality is that Chris has began showing preference to crossdressing in early 2011 and later fully committed to a transgender lifestyle since the end of 2014, with some evidence of Chris's gender dysphoria becoming clearer with the power of hindsight.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Psychological_symptoms\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Psychological symptoms</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Chris_&amp;_Dysphoria\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris &amp; Dysphoria</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Early_Signs\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Early Signs</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#The_Butterfly_Effect\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The Butterfly Effect</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Miscellaneous_signs\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Miscellaneous signs</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Autism_and_trans_identity\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Autism and trans identity</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Pre_Tomgirl_Saga\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Pre Tomgirl Saga</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Tomgirl_Saga\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Tomgirl Saga</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#Post_Tomgirl_Saga\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Post Tomgirl Saga</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#More_Extreme_Examples_of_Dysphoria\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">More Extreme Examples of Dysphoria</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1\"><a href=\"#Notes\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">9</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Notes</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">10</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Psychological_symptoms\">Psychological symptoms</span></h2>\n<p>According to DSM-5, the symptoms for gender dysphoria are:\n</p>\n<ul><li>A strong desire to be of a gender other than one's assigned gender.</li>\n<li>A strong desire to be treated as a gender other than one's assigned gender.</li>\n<li>A significant incongruence between one's experienced or expressed gender and one's sexual characteristics.</li>\n<li>A strong desire for the sexual characteristics of a gender other than one's assigned gender.</li>\n<li>A strong desire to be rid of one's sexual characteristics due to incongruence with one's experienced or expressed gender.</li>\n<li>A strong conviction that one has the typical reactions and feelings of a gender other than one's assigned gender.</li>\n<li>Associated with clinically significant distress or impairment.</li></ul>\n<h2><span id=\"Chris_.26_Dysphoria\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris_&amp;_Dysphoria\">Chris &amp; Dysphoria</span></h2>\n<p>Through the years one thing strikingly evident about Chris is the complete and total lack of understanding he has for his own body.

While his daughter has not been personified in any medium Chris has released, she shares his middle and last names, and his sister in the comics bore a striking resemblance to Chris himself at the time of drawing despite only being gender-swapped. In 2008, Chris posted to the Sonichu Girls webforum an introduction to any females that would be on the site.

His tendency to exaggerate or overcompensate for his fragile masculinity could be caused by subconsciously knowing that his intellectual gender does not match his biological sex. The way Chris interacted during the <a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey_calls\" title=\"Kacey calls\">Kacey calls</a> is another piece of evidence; normally, guys subconsciously lower the pitch of their voices to seem attractive to women, but when Chris was trying to woo Kacey, his voice drifted higher than hers. Additionally, Chris is known for his pathological hatred of change, unless the change is beneficial or positive for him. To assume Chris \"became\" trans purely for the quest for <a href=\"/cwcki/China\" title=\"China\">china</a> is fairly extreme, as suddenly identifying by another gender identity is generally a life-changing event for anybody, and Chris has shown that he is incapable of substantially changing himself even with the <a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey\" title=\"Kacey\">promise of a relationship</a> laid in front of him.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Autism_and_trans_identity\">Autism and trans identity</span></h3>\n<p>There is a correlation between <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">autism</a> and trans identity, though the exact reason for this correlation is still up for debate. According to a Dutch study, 7.8% of trans people are on the spectrum.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-10\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">[9]</a></sup> There are a number of similarities between the two disorders. Autistic people have a harder time picking up on social norms, including gender norms. Therefore, autistic people tend to have \"androgynous\" mental qualities and interests, and those people could perceive their brain difference as simply having the brain of the opposite gender. Both autistic makes and non-cis AMABs tend to have mostly <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Gal-pal\" title=\"Gal-pal\">gal-pals</a>, because men tend to be rowdy and more explicitly judgmental. However, they may miss the socially complex and subtle elements of female socialization, and the actual women end up treating them with kid gloves. \n</p><p>The androgyny of autistic people has caught the interest of brain experts. MRI studies reveal that autistic men have \"mosaic minds\", which aren't just androgynous, but are extremely male in some aspects and extremely female in others. The autistic brain parts responsible for general thoughts are more masculine than the average man, with less connectivity and more localization. Autistic men excel at <a href=\"/cwcki/Heart_level\" title=\"Heart level\">systemizing</a> and struggle with <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Kindness\" title=\"Kindness\">empathizing</a>, an exaggeration of the male profile. However, the parts of the brain responsible for sensation, perception and motion are more feminized.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-11\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">[10]</a></sup> Like women, autistics have a high pain tolerance and a low pain threshold – observable in Chris. However, gender differences in the brain are only averages, and saying a man with feminine brain traits has a \"female brain\" is like saying a short man has a \"female skeleton\". Also, the gendering of autism is highly controversial, with many pointing out that the condition is a spectrum. \n</p><p>Kenneth Zucker, a controversial gender expert, found that gender dysphoria manifests as an obsession, and that autistic people may think they're trans if they fixate on the issue of gender.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-12\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">[11]</a></sup>\n</p><p>It's also possible that Chris is genuinely transgender, but his transgender signs were \"scrambled\" through autism. This could be why he adapted nonstandard language for so long, and why he had to \"ease into\" his trans identity instead of coming out outright. For example, he identified as a tomgirl for years before his transgender identity came to the forefront, and he speaks of a \"female soul\" more than a \"female brain.\"\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Pre_Tomgirl_Saga\">Pre Tomgirl Saga</span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:292px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:WantWoman.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"485\" src=\"/w/images/9/91/WantWoman.jpg\" width=\"290\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:WantWoman.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Chris getting in touch with his feminine side by wearing a sports bra in public.</div></div></div>\n<p>Chris was known to experiment with cross dressing many times before officially declaring himself a lesbian tomgirl and crossdressing regularly. In 2008, the identity of <a href=\"/cwcki/Blanca_Weiss\" title=\"Blanca Weiss\">Blanca Weiss</a> asked Chris to take photos of himself wearing his mother's undergarments, to which he happily obliged. Later in 2009, Chris confided in <a href=\"/cwcki/Ivy\" title=\"Ivy\">Ivy</a> that he enjoyed wearing women's underwear. In September of that same year during a call with <a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey\" title=\"Kacey\">Kacey</a>, he told her that he planned on buying a sports bra to prevent the excessive bouncing of his breasts while jogging. Chris purchased some bras, and immediately loved wearing them, claiming that he enjoyed the feeling of donning them and felt confident. This is an effect of Chris' well known aversion to seeing bare male breasts, including his own. Chris would continue to wear these sports bras from this point onwards, and would eventually move on to wearing everyday bras typically used by most women.\n</p><p>In 2010, Chris would experiment wearing these bras in more open and public places. Chris would be spotted and photographed 18 June 2010 at Fridays After Five flaunting a sports bra with \"WANT WOMAN!\" written in permanent marker on the front face of the bra.\n</p><p>In 2011, Chris started to get in touch with his more \"feminine side.\" Chris would admit to being more comfortable using the opposite gender's assigned restrooms in public places. Shortly after that same year on 26 March, Chris sent an email to <a href=\"/cwcki/Jackie\" title=\"Jackie\">Jackie</a> revealing that he had begun fully crossdressing at the start of the month. Then four days later on 30 March, Chris would change the quote on his PSN to read \"I am Tomgirl\" marking the beginning of the Tomgirl Saga.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Tomgirl_Saga\">Tomgirl Saga</span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:352px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:TG23.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"263\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/3/3e/TG23.jpg/350px-TG23.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/3/3e/TG23.jpg/525px-TG23.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/3/3e/TG23.jpg/700px-TG23.jpg 2x\" width=\"350\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:TG23.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>\"Ladies, please.

Later that year on 16 August, Chris recorded a makeup tutorial video and posted it to YouTube titled <a href=\"/cwcki/Kaka_Makeup_Basics\" title=\"Kaka Makeup Basics\">Kaka Makeup Basics</a>. Chris created a new fantasy band in the same vain as <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Christian_%26_the_Hedgehog_Boys\" title=\"Christian &amp; the Hedgehog Boys\">Christian &amp; the Hedgehog Boys</a> aptly named <a href=\"/cwcki/Robee_Sonee_and_the_Tomgirls\" title=\"Robee Sonee and the Tomgirls\">Robee Sonee and the Tomgirls</a> to show his support for tomboys and tomgirls everywhere and the first and only album that was created was leaked on 12 November 2011. Despite still claiming to be a heterosexual male, Chris began to use women's restrooms more frequently, and confided in Jackie that he fantasized about \"fit[ting] in at a lesbian bar<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-13\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">[12]</a></sup>\" before the <a href=\"/cwcki/Tomgirl_Pictures\" title=\"Tomgirl Pictures\">Tomgirl Pictures</a> were taken on 26 April 2011.\n</p><p>Chris' parents were very unsupportive of Chris' new lifestyle. <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bob\" title=\"Bob\">Bob</a> called Chris a \"fag\" and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Barbara\" title=\"Barbara\">Barbara</a> made many negative remarks to try to persuade Chris from continuing being a tomgirl<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-14\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">[13]</a></sup>. On 15 May 2011, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Barbara\" title=\"Barbara\">Barbara</a> would forcefully cut Chris' hair. In his shock, he called her a bitch.

And even worse, she threatens to kill me in her episode of emotional rage. She also took my keys. And shortly later, she tells me to come downstairs, so I go; she tells me to sit down, and she does the worse thing that broke the last straw on my camel's back, she Cuts my Long Hair Short and Butchered. After seeing the butchered hair in the mirror, I was soo in shock, I wield the double-edge sword I have been holding in for weeks since a much earlier fit of emotional rage of hers. I called her a Bitch. With her as a bitch, that makes me a son of a bitch, and it hurts me deep too.

When <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bob\" title=\"Bob\">Bob</a> would pass away later in autumn of that year, he reportedly told Chris that he accepted Chris and loved him for who he is, revealed publicly on page 68 of <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_12\" title=\"Sonichu 12\">Sonichu 12</a>.\n</p><p>On 16 December 2013, Chris would send an e-mail correspondence with a troll pretending to be his old classmate <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Rebeckah_Bentley\" title=\"Rebeckah Bentley\">Rebeckah Bentley</a> further reinforcing his late onset gender dysphoria, stating:\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>I have a personal hatred for 99% of the worldwide population of my own gender.

On 14 August 2014, Chris posted to Facebook revealing that he is a \"Tomgirl, Intersex of Female Soul with Male Body, and a Tranny Cross-Dresser,\" however he would later clarify that he is actually a lesbian in a male body. Chris would contemplate sexual reassignment surgery, also known as gender affirming surgery, around this time in order to transform himself into a \"birth-able\" female. However, Chris has not to this day had any type of procedure done to drastically alter his body. It was revealed in September of that year that he often would force his penis to be tucked using a makeshift harness.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-20\"><a href=\"#cite_note-20\">[19]</a></sup>\nA fan would reach out to Chris during this time, and ask about his preferred gender and pronouns, and Chris would mention that he is indifferent.
