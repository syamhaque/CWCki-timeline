If Not for my Soul Bonding with her and mentally and emotionally healing her with talking of her past, she would have died in the vehicle accident with the van in August, and not in November and survived.

The reason her Body, at the least (check her Aura, Helena) continues to have been alive and at the Sonichu Temple This Long of time was in my own emotional and spiritual processes and developments.\n<p>Had Everfree Northwest gone smoothly and well with my safe return home to the Sonichu Temple, Barbara would have been lost and prematurely migrated into her Rosechu form on C-197 Earth (how I saved her), and I would have suffered emotionally and not have as successful an awakening, rebirth, and revelations as I had. It would have been tougher on me, for I and my Body had not yet fully appreciated our Friends, Allies, and Social/Business Connections to properly prosper and pay off the remaining debts and mortgage.\n</p><p>Also, as I had stated in my Big Talk confession letter, Also, Barbara had become a Burden of Emotional Weight on me. And when it comes to the Legal Restriction of the Courts Never going to allow her and I to be together in the same building (before the Collective Shift’s completion and her full transition to her Rosechu Body), as well as the present Paradox that in ALL of the other Pre-Second Coming Timeline Portions, she and I were Not to be together since last August, Period.\n</p><p>In our time, my Body and I have processed, cried, grieved, and accepted these facts, And her (human) body’s relocation Needs to happen before my Body and I can         -&gt;③ \nReturn Home at the Sonichu Temple; it’s fated/evident.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>③ So, when I had read of your prayer, on top of the Billions of Heard Prayers from our Followers over these months, in regard of her and I getting back together, as well as the inquiry of “Are you excited to see your mom again?”, there is a deep emotional trick that gets triggered within my Body. Because I consciously and unconsciously Know These Facts and Divine Details.\n<p>So, I had made my own sacrifice to let Barbara go; to have her relocated, or or what of the foreknown outcomes Destiny and Fate may manifest on her (human) body and what’s left of her with the partial soul that lingers within her.\n</p><p>Fortunately, I have my plans for after my return home thought out, including on debt and mortgage payment, and settling; I’ll have to help on that as well.\n</p><p>Unfortunately despite my directly telling her of the outcome of June 9’s Court Date and giving her the choice to relocate herself, so she didn’t have to be Forced, Three Weeks later, by Caden’s confirmation, Barbara was still at the Sonichu Temple; Redneck and Stubborn. So, giving him the list of her charable crimes, including pet negigance/mistreatment, suicide threats, emotional manipulation and abuse upon I, and ADA’s law of using someone else’s SSI, I have instructed Caden alone, to call the police on her. I keep this Strictly Offline, because I don’t want to risk Toxic ones abusing her, directly, or any defacement of the Sonichu Temple, itself, or its property span, as well as thefts.
