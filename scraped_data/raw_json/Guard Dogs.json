Now known as the \"Guard Dogs\", this group sought to replace the old guard that had once existed before, and optimistically tried to curb current-day <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Weening\" title=\"Weening\">weening</a>.

He was eventually able to gain his trust, but only by playing along to his <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">delusional beliefs</a>. Chris then revealed to him that he was in a top-secret <a href=\"/cwcki/Discord\" title=\"Discord\">Discord</a> chat with the <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys</a> on a separate account they had created for him. At this point, with the coaching of Marvin, The Captain had multiple conversations with Chris in which he attempted to convince him that the Idea Guys were bad people who had only hurt “fake” characters. Chris eventually came to trust him, but only after using his “mind powers”.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup> In response, he gave The Captain full control to his accounts so he could gather evidence against the Idea Guys.

Their tactics ranged from extortion to threats, and even blackmail. He once again went to Marvin with this information. To stall the Idea Guys so they could collect evidence, the two began roleplaying in the server as Chris. This stalling lasted upwards of a week. Whenever the Idea Guys asked The Captain something he didn’t know, The Captain would ask Marvin and Chris for direction and then reply accordingly. At one point during the week, the Idea Guys became suspicious and asked Chris to post photographic evidence to prove that he was indeed himself. They quickly had Chris take this photograph for them, writing the desired message on a dry-erase board. They were also able to collect the Discord usernames and IPs of <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys#Identities\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Wise, Boyd</a> and another Idea Guy using an IP tracer, as well as the username of a third unidentified Idea Guy.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup> During this time, Chris was told to take a break from the internet for a week, to which he complied. He spent that week catching up on the shows Wise and Boyd had “banned” him from watching, which included <a href=\"/cwcki/My_Little_Pony\" title=\"My Little Pony\">My Little Pony</a> and “nearly everything on Crunchy Roll”.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-a_1-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-a-1\">[1]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Eventually, Marvin managed to build a script that ripped the server's chat logs straight from Discord, archiving the hundreds of pages of the Idea Guys' debauchery. Once all of the images and chat logs had been saved, Chris’ Discord account went silent and remained offline. A couple of days later, Wise and Boyd realized what this new inactivity implied, and began sanitizing the server. They banned Chris from the channel and deleted every private message they had sent him one by one. For them, however, it was already too late.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-a_1-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-a-1\">[1]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Extortion_allegations\">Extortion allegations</span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:252px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:IdeaGuyReceipts1.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"188\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/2/24/IdeaGuyReceipts1.jpg/250px-IdeaGuyReceipts1.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/2/24/IdeaGuyReceipts1.jpg/375px-IdeaGuyReceipts1.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/2/24/IdeaGuyReceipts1.jpg/500px-IdeaGuyReceipts1.jpg 2x\" width=\"250\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:IdeaGuyReceipts1.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Receipts of items Chris bought for Wise and Boyd, which were kept by Chris.</div></div></div>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys#Blackmail_and_extortion_allegations\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys#Blackmail and extortion allegations</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">I get that $6000 isn't the white collar crime that brings down the hammer, but we're talking about unhinged lunatics who are <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_slaps_himself\" title=\"Chris slaps himself\">coaxing mentally ill people into punching themselves</a>.\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:11px; padding:0 0 0 16px; vertical-align:bottom; width:20px\">”\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\" style=\"font-size:smaller; padding:8px 36px; text-align:right;\"><cite>Null, describing his frustrations with law enforcement.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-a_1-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-a-1\">[1]</a></sup></cite>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>Midway through their infiltration of the Idea Guys’ <a href=\"/cwcki/Discord\" title=\"Discord\">Discord</a>, Null was brought into the process, filing reports with the FBI, Greene County Sheriff, and even calling Boyd’s mother.
