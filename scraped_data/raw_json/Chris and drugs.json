It's not clear when he was prescribed the drug, or for what exact reason, but it was likely sometime in his younger days. Since the advent of more sophisticated antidepressant drugs like <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prozac\" title=\"wikipedia:Prozac\">Prozac</a> in the late <a href=\"/cwcki/1980s\" title=\"1980s\">1980s</a>, the use of Imipramine to treat depression and other psychological disorders has grown less and less common.\n</p><p>The same document notes that, as of 2004, Chris had been taking the antidepressant <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxil\" title=\"wikipedia:Paxil\">Paxil</a> for four years in order to deal with his stress and anger issues. One of the survey's recommendations was an increase in his daily dose of the drug, but it's not clear how long Chris continued taking it afterward. In <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_13#Take_Your_Prescribed_Medicine,_Young_Man\" title=\"Mailbag 13\">Mailbag #13</a>, he explained that he had switched to a different medication in order to avoid some of Paxil's side effects, the ones that \"only hit adults.\" However, in his 11th call with <a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey\" title=\"Kacey\">Kacey</a> Chris said that the drug he switched to from Paxil is Paroxetine.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup> Since Paxil is just one of Paroxetine's several trade names and not a different drug, it seems that Chris is still taking the same medication, only under a different appellation. \n</p><p>Chris didn't specify what side effects Paxil caused him, but his language suggests some sort of a sexual dysfunction. Paxil may have been making it difficult for Chris to <a href=\"/cwcki/Mass_debating\" title=\"Mass debating\">achieve orgasm</a>; if his current antidepressant is still Paroxetine (or at least another <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor\" title=\"wikipedia:Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor\">SSRI</a>) then it might explain why it took him around 20 minutes in order to climax when he cybered with <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Julie\" title=\"Julie\">Julie</a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Another of Paxil's more notable side effects is the potential for <a href=\"/cwcki/Obesity\" title=\"Obesity\">substantial weight gain</a>, which couldn't have mixed well with Chris's <a href=\"/cwcki/McDonald%27s\" title=\"McDonald's\">diet</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Biological_clock\" title=\"Biological clock\">sedentary lifestyle</a>.\n</p><p>In a <a href=\"/cwcki/November_2025_social_media_posts##NoToPaxil\" title=\"November 2025 social media posts\">Bluesky thread</a> on 14 November 2025, Chris began to question why he had been on Paxil at all, believing it to have exacerbated the symptoms of his autism. He also claimed to have first been prescribed the medication at age 7 for anxiety.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Prescription_drugs\">Prescription drugs</span></h2>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Prescriptions_for_mental_health\">Prescriptions for mental health</span></h4>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">Autism</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>Due to Chris's autism, he has had to take a variety of prescription drugs over the years. As of 2000, Chris has been taking the antidepressant Paxil for his autism (which increased from 20mg to 30mg after his <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism_papers\" title=\"Autism papers\">psychiatric diagnosis</a>), but sometime before December 2009 he stopped taking it, and instead began taking Paroxetine, citing Paxil's side-effects. Interestingly enough, both have the same chemical composition, meaning both are the same drug with different trade names. If word ever gets out that Chris felt Paroxetine didn't have the same side effects as Paxil, know that this is just an example of the placebo effect. It is possible that Paxil/Paroxetine's side effects included making orgasm harder and increased potential for <a href=\"/cwcki/Obesity\" title=\"Obesity\">weight gain</a>. Sometime afterwards, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Barbara\" title=\"Barbara\">Barbara</a> found out about its side effects and switched Chris to fluoxetine, though Chris still mentioned paroxetine well into <a href=\"/cwcki/October_2017\" title=\"October 2017\">October 2017</a>.\n</p><p>In that same paper, it also mentioned his taking of imipramine, an antidepressant, for unknown reasons.\n</p><p>In <a href=\"/cwcki/November_2025\" title=\"November 2025\">November 2025</a>, Chris claimed to have \"stopped taking fluoxetine about a year ago\".<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup> He also blamed his SSRI meds for a lack of focus emotionally and suggested others trash their SSRI meds.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Prescriptions_for_other_ailments\">Prescriptions for other ailments</span></h4>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_health\" title=\"Chris and health\">Chris and health</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>For the majority of his life, Chris has had cholesterol problems. To combat this, instead of eating healthier and getting exercise, Chris eats junk food and exercises <i>very</i> occasionally while taking Lipitor, a cholesterol-lowering drug. While Lipitor and similar drugs can have a positive effect in lowering the cholesterol levels of those taking it, if one doesn't change their lifestyle as well there will be little change in the cholesterol level. Chris, having taken Lipitor since at least <a href=\"/cwcki/August_2009\" title=\"August 2009\">August 2009</a>, has had some improvement with his cholesterol levels; he got a score of 140 mg/ml, which, while not low, is not high either. Since Chris is very unfit, it's likely that Lipitor seems to be doing a decent job.\n</p><p>It's worth noting that - as <a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey\" title=\"Kacey\">Kacey</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Father_Call\" title=\"Father Call\">her dad</a> pointed out - he started taking the drug in his twenties, when it and other statins are really meant for people above age 40, and are only recommended for younger patients when the risk of early cardiovascular disease is that high.\n</p><p>Chris also takes a drug to combat blood pressure, likely a blood thinner concerning his fat-high diet. It is known that Chris also takes antibiotics for UTIs.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"HRT\">HRT</span></h3>\n<p>Ever since <a href=\"/cwcki/May_2015\" title=\"May 2015\">May 2015</a>, Chris has been taking various forms of <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_hormone_therapy\" title=\"wikipedia:Transgender hormone therapy\">Hormone replacement therapy</a>, or HRT, to successfully <a href=\"/cwcki/Transgender\" title=\"Transgender\">transition</a>.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Oestrogel\">Oestrogel</span></h4>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Like_budderin_bread_-_credit_to_Buck_Mullet.gif\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"169\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/d/de/Like_budderin_bread_-_credit_to_Buck_Mullet.gif/300px-Like_budderin_bread_-_credit_to_Buck_Mullet.gif\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/d/de/Like_budderin_bread_-_credit_to_Buck_Mullet.gif/450px-Like_budderin_bread_-_credit_to_Buck_Mullet.gif 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/d/de/Like_budderin_bread_-_credit_to_Buck_Mullet.gif/600px-Like_budderin_bread_-_credit_to_Buck_Mullet.gif 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Like_budderin_bread_-_credit_to_Buck_Mullet.gif\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Chris believes this is an appropriate form of hormone therapy.</div></div></div>\n<p>Normally, transgender people plan out their gender transitions with doctors to ensure safety throughout the process, especially if they are taking hormones.\n</p><p>Unfortunately, Chris did the opposite. In 2015, he acquired <b>Oestrogel</b>, a hormone replacement therapy cream meant for <a href=\"/cwcki/Barbara_Chandler\" title=\"Barbara Chandler\">post-menopausal women</a>. It is meant to be prescription-only, but Chris got around the requirement to see a doctor by ordering it through Offshore Pharmacy.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup> Oestrogel has health risks, such as fluid retention, weight changes, rise in blood pressure (potentially disastrous for an <a href=\"/cwcki/Obesity\" title=\"Obesity\">obese</a> person like Chris) and blood clots,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-healthrisks_6-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-healthrisks-6\">[6]</a></sup> and that is when it is applied properly via a small dosage on the arm once per day. He even managed to fail at following the directions on the package, as shown in <a href=\"/cwcki/Oestrogel_application_and_Vibrating_Bra,_How_To\" title=\"Oestrogel application and Vibrating Bra, How To\">Oestrogel application and Vibrating Bra, How To</a>, in which he slathers the cream onto his stomach \"like buttering bread\".\n</p><p><a href=\"/cwcki/Kim_Wilson\" title=\"Kim Wilson\">Kim Wilson</a> revealed that he was taking the hormones in May 2015,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-7\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">[7]</a></sup> and Chris mentioned the drug again as late as August 2016.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-8\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">[8]</a></sup> Throughout 2015-2016, he repeatedly complained, via Facebook posts, of feeling dizzy and ill, but failed to connect the dots and think if it could be caused taking over-dosages of a black-market drug without a physician's approval.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Proper_HRT\">Proper HRT</span></h4>\n<p>At some point in Fall 2016, he finally went to a medical professional and was prescribed proper HRT. In his <a href=\"/cwcki/CopperCab\" title=\"CopperCab\">interview with CopperCab</a>, Chris mentions he takes the testosterone blocker spironolactone, which he nicknames \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Spyro_the_Dragon\" title=\"Spyro the Dragon\">Spyro the Dragon</a>\", and estradiol to assist in transitioning.\n</p><p>Chris revealed in his <a href=\"/cwcki/March_2024\" title=\"March 2024\">March 2024</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/March_2024_livestreams#Christ_Chan_Live_Stream:_YouTube_Video_Watching\" title=\"March 2024 livestreams\">Livestream</a> that he has been taking \"Estradiol\" and \"spironolactone\" (Aldactone), for \"years\".<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-9\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">[9]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Alcohol\">Alcohol</span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Sonichurosey.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"256\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/6/60/Sonichurosey.png/300px-Sonichurosey.png\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/6/60/Sonichurosey.png/450px-Sonichurosey.png 1.5x, /w/images/6/60/Sonichurosey.png 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Sonichurosey.png\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Ever since getting married to <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu\" title=\"Rosechu\">Rosechu</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(character)\" title=\"Sonichu (character)\">Sonichu</a> finds that Reeb helps dull the pain.</div></div></div>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Background\">Background</span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Z100_0533.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"450\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/e/ec/Z100_0533.jpg/300px-Z100_0533.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/e/ec/Z100_0533.jpg/450px-Z100_0533.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/e/ec/Z100_0533.jpg/600px-Z100_0533.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Z100_0533.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Finally Loosened up and flew to Long Island June 12, 2009.  <b>Keep It Responsible</b>; ONLY One in a day, or 7 or less in all in a week. <i>(Quote from <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia\" title=\"CWCipedia\">CWCipedia</a>)</i></div></div></div>\n<p>Like many things in his life, Chris has drastically changed his feelings about intoxicating beverages over the years. Chris once described alcohol as a \"slow-acting poison\" in his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/FUTURE_MESSAGE\" title=\"FUTURE MESSAGE\">FUTURE MESSAGE</a> video. He also touched on the subject during <a href=\"/cwcki/Vivitheg%27s_AIM_chat\" title=\"Vivitheg's AIM chat\">Vivitheg's AIM chat</a>, where in line 309, he mentioned that he would not go to a singles bar because of it (and cigarettes). When asked about alcohol in <a href=\"/cwcki/Mumble_2\" title=\"Mumble 2\">Mumble Chat 2</a>, he stated that it \"causes <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_health\" title=\"Chris and health\">liver dysfunction</a> and likely <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_anger\" title=\"Chris and anger\">bar fights</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/6_June_2010\" title=\"6 June 2010\">automobile accidents</a>\".\n</p><p>Chris delivered a particularly effusive tirade in one of his e-mails to <a href=\"/cwcki/Reggie_Fils-Aim%C3%A9\" title=\"Reggie Fils-Aimé\">Reggie Fils-Aimé</a>:\n</p>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">ALSO, I BET YOU PROBABLY SMOKE AND DRINK, don't you?

That type of cocktail isn't recommended for novice drinkers, due to having a rather strong amount of alcoholic ingredients like vodka, triple sec, rum, tequila, and gin. If he didn't choose to drink it based off it being referenced in <i><a href=\"/cwcki/The_Simpsons\" title=\"The Simpsons\">The Simpsons</a></i>, it's possible Chris did so because <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">he assumed, due to its name, that it was literally just iced tea</a> with some alcohol mixed in.\n</p><p>Alcohol was mentioned briefly in a video shortly after, titled <a href=\"/cwcki/I%27m_Sorry,_Dude\" title=\"I'm Sorry, Dude\">I'm Sorry, Dude</a>. In this video, Chris makes an offer to treat Logan to drinks as opposed to his past offers of \"coffee or soda\" to those whom he wanted to get to know. Alcohol was briefly revisited again on camera in <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris%27s_Big_Night_Out_II\" title=\"Chris's Big Night Out II\">Chris's Big Night Out II</a>, where Chris was seen drinking. Chris's first recorded video where he appeared visibly intoxicated was <a href=\"/cwcki/Bless_the_Fans,_Curse_the_Trolls\" title=\"Bless the Fans, Curse the Trolls\">Bless the Fans, Curse the Trolls</a>. Alcohol began a slow and steady progression into Chris's life; this was made obvious in an email to <a href=\"/cwcki/Regina\" title=\"Regina\">Regina</a>, where he said <i>\"I've also tasted Mike's Hard Lemonade, Budwiser [sic], Miller, Micolobe </i>[Michelob]<i>, Samual Adams and a couple of others.

Since his decision to leave the Internet and instead seek real life interaction, Chris has revealed to us that he spent most of his day sitting in bars and playing on his Nintendo DSi. While he once claimed to be a \"Social Drinker\", it is becoming quite obvious that he is anything but. Chris's childlike perception of the world is most likely deafening his awareness to the substance's advancement of relevancy in his life. At this point, he may be turning to alcohol for <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_escapism\" title=\"Chris and escapism\">escapism</a>. Also, alcoholism has been proven to be a telltale sign of <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan_syndrome\" title=\"wikipedia:Peter Pan syndrome\">Peter Pan syndrome</a>, which clearly applies to Chris. In addition, Chris, being the <a href=\"/cwcki/Slow-in-the-minds\" title=\"Slow-in-the-minds\">slow-in-the-mind</a> that he is, is alleged to add raw sugar to his beer on a regular basis.

In <a href=\"/cwcki/July_2016\" title=\"July 2016\">July 2016</a>, Chris, while thought to have been drunk and depressed over lack of progress on his gender transition, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Un-clit_2.0\" title=\"Un-clit 2.0\">sliced open his taint with a knife</a> to simulate the opening of a vagina.\n</p><p>Alcohol made another appearance in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Cherokean_Chant\" title=\"Cherokean Chant\">Cherokean Chant</a> performance, in which Chris states he had five swigs of vodka.\n</p><p>The <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Teen_Troon_Squad\" title=\"Teen Troon Squad\">Teen Troon Squad</a>, aged 18/19, tried to get Chris to buy them Reeb in 2018.\n</p><p>In 2021, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Enabler\" title=\"Enabler\">enabler</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/KwaiiSandbag\" title=\"KwaiiSandbag\">KwaiiSandbag</a> revealed that Chris had told him in messages that he would drink heavily once every few weeks.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-10\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">[10]</a></sup> Even with known accounts of Chris's past alcohol use, this news was surprising and concerning.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/cwcki/Jail_Letter_Gifts\" title=\"Jail Letter Gifts\">Holy Labels</a> which Chris has been sending to fans from <a href=\"/cwcki/Jail\" title=\"Jail\">jail</a> are expressly intended to be used for drinking non-alcoholic beverages.
