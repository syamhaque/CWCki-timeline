Next, <a href=\"/cwcki/Tiffany_Gowen\" title=\"Tiffany Gowen\">Tiffany Gowen</a>; she was really good to me. She reminded me of a Peanuts character, Peppermint Patty, and she and I were close, yet separate, like Patty and Charlie Brown. She also danced with me at the Seinor Prom (I was there with my mother, and I was naive on the subject of dating a relationships... unlike most of the other students, I'm certain); It was so nice and fun; I'll never forget that dance. :)\n<p>The there was the lovely couple, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sarah_Anne_Bevel\" title=\"Sarah Anne Bevel\">Sarah Bevel</a> and Brian Smart.

I was a High-Functioning Autistic Boy who came WAAAAAAAAAY BEYOND OUT OF HIS SOCIAL SHELL, only to get ZILCH, NADA, ZIP; A BIG FAT ZERO! I felt so Devistated and Out Of Sync. :'(\n<p>Secondly, it was a dark, rainy day on the Graduation Ceremony Day...And thirdly, I was leaving my happy days and my friends at MHS...With ALL THAT (mostly the Award thing), I ended up doing what I did when I went up there to accept the diploma; NO HANDSHAKE, TEARS, AND RUNNING AWAY TO HIDE. They don't even have any pictures of that in the Y2K Yearbook; the caption could have read \"Student Christian Chandler is Depressed and Sad for some reasons.
