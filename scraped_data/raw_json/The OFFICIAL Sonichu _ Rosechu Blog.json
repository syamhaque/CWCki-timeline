  "html_content": "<div class=\"mw-body-content mw-content-ltr\" dir=\"ltr\" id=\"mw-content-text\" lang=\"en\"><div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p>Between 13 September and 15 October, <a href=\"/cwcki/2008\" title=\"2008\">2008</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris\" title=\"Chris\">Chris</a> wrote a <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger_(service)\" title=\"wikipedia:Blogger (service)\">Blogspot</a> blog. This blog was one of Chris's shorter ventures, lasting only 32 days. The exact reason of its closure was never revealed, although troll-induced paranoia is a safe bet.\n</p><p>The initial blog posts are about the proposed business venture of a <i>Sonichu</i> game, although even by Chris's standards the writing is abysmal. The initial paragraph veers off in every imaginable direction at once like some sort of literary adaption of Escher's <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_(M._C._Escher)\" title=\"wikipedia:Relativity (M. C. Escher)\"><i>Relativity</i></a>, and the ensuing content is basically a pitch for the game. Chris concedes he's been hogging the spotlight and consequentially the audience doesn't really \"know\" <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(character)\" title=\"Sonichu (character)\">Sonichu</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu_(character)\" title=\"Rosechu (character)\">Rosechu</a>, which, although true, rather overlooks the fact that there's nothing to \"know\" about either of them; Sonichu is just a self-insert for Chris and Rosechu has no character substance whatsoever. Chris goes on to detail exactly what crucial actions HE will perform in the plot, apparently having forgotten his pledge to get out of the spotlight in the space of three sentences.\n</p><p>Later posts concern pornography in his comic (specifically announcing that he's removing it but uploading more porn elsewhere) and some fanart showcasing, as well as urging his fans to join a fan-group. He implores his fans to attack <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/ED\" title=\"ED\">ED</a> with progressively less and less subtlety, as if anybody would. Eventually, as with all things, his personal life becomes the chief subject matter and he laments the late <a href=\"/cwcki/PandaHalo\" title=\"PandaHalo\">PandaHalo</a> for two whole sentences before going on to herald <a href=\"/cwcki/Ivy\" title=\"Ivy\">Ivy</a> as the divinely mandated mother of his child (a position occupied until recently by Panda). The final blog post exists almost purely to contradict existing information and tell everybody that Chris gets his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_Religion#Chris_the_Shaman\" title=\"Chris and Religion\">magic powers</a> from his <a href=\"/cwcki/Amnyfest_Ring\" title=\"Amnyfest Ring\">ring</a> rather than his now-destroyed <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Medal\" title=\"Medal\">medal</a>.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Entries\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Entries</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#13_September\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">13 September</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-3 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#The_Official_Sonichu_&amp;_Rosechu_Blog_from_Christian_Weston_Chandler\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The Official Sonichu &amp;

Rosechu Blog from Christian Weston Chandler</span></h4>\n<p>This is just the start of the Blog; I will update this blog with the Smaller Details to save space on <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC%27s_Sonichu_Site!\" title=\"CWC's Sonichu Site!\">Sonichu.net</a>.\n</p><p>So, be sure to BOOKMARK THIS Blog Page.\n</p><p>Sincerely,\nChristian Weston Chandler.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"An_Important_Update\">An Important Update</span></h4>\n<p>With the Sonichu Fanbase growing wildly with lots of energtic Hype, I am ready to take <b>Sonichu</b> and my world of <b><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Cwcville\" title=\"Cwcville\">Cwcville</a></b> back to Nintendo of America and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/SEGA\" title=\"SEGA\">SEGA</a> of America. And upon the unity in business between <b>Nintendo</b>, the company who provided me with my second gaming system, the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Game_Boy\" title=\"Game Boy\">Game Boy</a>, after my very first <b><a href=\"/cwcki/Commodore_64\" title=\"Commodore 64\">Commodore 64</a></b> computer, <b>SEGA</b>, the company who introduced <b><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog\" title=\"Sonic the Hedgehog\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></b> as not only my Life-Long Hero, after the <b><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/American_Rabbit\" title=\"American Rabbit\">American Rabbit</a></b>, but as the True Role Model Icon I am proud to have learned some of my attitudes and beliefs from since 1991, and myself, <b>Christian Weston Chandler</b>, we will make Sonichu and Rosechu and their world being more Real than I was able to make them by myself with pen and markers in hand, and a vasly-knowledgeable imagination.\n</p><p>You won't be able to truly say you've \"Caught Them All\", until you've caught the Original Sonichu and Rosechu in a CWC Approved Nintendo/Sega Pok'emon Lightning Version on GBA and DS to catch a great share of the other currently avilable <b>Four Hundred and Ninty-Three</b> Pok'emon.\n</p><p>Think you know the ins and outs of Sonichu and Rosechu, wait until Season Two of the Comic Book Series, likely to start within the year 2009. I will withdraw myself from being as intrusive in the series as I have been so far; I've been selfish, and I'm tired of drawing myself so much. See how I take my leave of Cwcville in the Season Finale, to hopefully be uploaded and on the Sonichu Site 4th Quarter, 2008 or 1st Quarter, 2009.\n</p><p>And because I've been hogging the spotlight, you don't know Sonichu and Rosechu as you properly should. In the first CWC Approved Release of the \"Sonichu's Adventure\" video game, with Nintendo and SEGA's help, on Nintendo Wii (although it was intended originally for Gamecube), with compatibility with the Wii Classic Controler as well as Gamecube Contoller, with rumble functionality hopefully. Sonichu is more than Lightning and Lightning-Speed, and Rosechu is more than delightful Bolts and Heart-Felt for Sonichu. Play on, as they rescue each other from the darkest evil that has manifested itself within some recycled nuts and bolts on the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Moon\" title=\"Moon\">moon</a>. And what a storyline it will have, based mostly from the comics with the duo and the <a href=\"/cwcki/Chaotic_Combo\" title=\"Chaotic Combo\">Chaotic Combo</a> as well.\n</p><p>And I HAVE the idea for the Video Game for myself, if I can swing that with SEGA as well, an epic tale of my tragic Adult Life straight from my tortured heart and soul. I will bring the pain to the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jerkops\" title=\"Jerkops\">Jerkops</a>, I will kick <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Mary Lee Walsh</a> into her cauldron to burn, as well as the other villians. And I will have support from my Electric-Hedgehogs, my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Mother\" title=\"Mother\">mother</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Father\" title=\"Father\">father</a>, my Closest Gal-Pals who I've grown to love; <b><a href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Schroeder\" title=\"Megan Schroeder\">Megan Schroeder</a></b> and <b><a href=\"/cwcki/Anna_McLerran\" title=\"Anna McLerran\">Anna McLerran</a></b> to name a couple, sparingly in the game. And I will square-off in the TRULY SELF-EPIC Battle between me, and my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Naitsirhc\" title=\"Naitsirhc\">Dark Half</a>. I plan to have THIS GAME ALONE go Multi-Console between Nintendo Wii, Playstation 2 and Playstation 3 (with downloadable content); screw the <a href=\"/cwcki/HEXBox\" title=\"HEXBox\">HEX-Box</a>.\n</p><p><b>And All This CAN come to Fruition... with YOUR HELP!</b>\n</p><p>The populace of Sonichu, Rosechu and Christian Chandler fans. All I ask for in minimum, is to contact Nintendo of America AND SEGA of America by way of POSTING in their respective FORUMS, sending them E-Mails, and, HIGHLY Recommended, Hand-Written Letters to BOTH Companies, that You Want Sonichu, and that they should get in touch with me, Christian Weston Chandler, via Telephone or Snail-Mail, or In Person.
