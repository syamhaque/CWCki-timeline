Since they didn't appear until <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_9\" title=\"Sonichu 9\"><i>Sonichu</i> #9</a>, one wonders where the hell they've been up until that point, and since <a href=\"/cwcki/Son-Chu\" title=\"Son-Chu\">Son-Chu</a> at least has been around in the comic for a long time, why they haven't been helping <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler_(comic_character)\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler (comic character)\">Christian</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(character)\" title=\"Sonichu (character)\">Sonichu</a> not get their heads kicked in by a variety of <a href=\"/cwcki/Private_Villa_of_Corrupted_Citizens\" title=\"Private Villa of Corrupted Citizens\">implausible super-villains</a> in the comic before that.\n</p><p>If you're wondering about the name, there is actually a plausible reason for it (as opposed to the other strangeness in the comic like <a href=\"/cwcki/Jerkhief\" title=\"Jerkhief\">wooden badges being delicious</a>). The name is actually <a href=\"/cwcki/Things_Chris_has_ripped_off\" title=\"Things Chris has ripped off\">stolen</a> from an <a href=\"/cwcki/Anime\" title=\"Anime\">anime</a> called <i><a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samurai_Pizza_Cats\" title=\"wikipedia:Samurai Pizza Cats\">Samurai Pizza Cats</a></i>, about a gang of anthropomorphic cats who protect their city while running a pizzeria. Chris liked this concept so much, that he felt the need to steal it and incorporate it into his comics, by making the CWCville Autobots maintain disguises as pizza delivery vehicles, complete with the ability to holographically project drivers who would deliver the pizza personally to customers.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Members\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Members</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Son-Chu\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Son-Chu</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Prower\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Prower</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Bumble-Lumba\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Bumble-Lumba</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Excelina\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Excelina</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Armoraxe\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Armoraxe</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Silver\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Silver</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Origins\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Origins</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#Gallery_of_plagiarism\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Gallery of plagiarism</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Members\">Members</span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Son-Chu\">Son-Chu</span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:ModNation_AutobotSonChu.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"352\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/a/a1/ModNation_AutobotSonChu.jpg/300px-ModNation_AutobotSonChu.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/a/a1/ModNation_AutobotSonChu.jpg 1.5x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:ModNation_AutobotSonChu.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Son-Chu's transformed mode in <a href=\"/cwcki/ModNation_Racers\" title=\"ModNation Racers\">ModNation Racers</a>.</div></div></div>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Son-Chu\" title=\"Son-Chu\">Son-Chu</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>Son-Chu is Chris's own personal transformer. In <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_Ego\" title=\"Chris and his Ego\">typical Chris fashion</a>, since the car is his, that means it is naturally the leader of the CWCville Autobots and has the most prominence in the comics, as well as being the only transformer to be spared the indignity of being referred to as a Samurai Pizza Bot. No, instead, Chris refers to his transformer as the leader of the \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Virginia\" title=\"Virginia\">Virginia</a> Autobot Squad\".<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Also notable is that while Son-Chu still has the same stupid logo as the other Autobots, he doesn't actually have a day job delivering pizzas. Son-Chu is instead Chris's own personal transportation. In vehicle mode, he takes the form of the blue '94 Ford Escort that Chris drove in real life at the time. Like the other Autobots, he has the ability to project a hologram of a driver into his seat in vehicle mode to maintain disguise, and being that he is Chris's car rather than a pizza delivery vehicle, he creates a hologram of Chris instead of a hologram of a delivery boy.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup>\n</p><p>In fighting mode, he completely changes most of his entire design. While normally a Ford Escort, his body still changes into the front of a Dodge Viper in robot form anyway, and while dark blue before, while transformed he becomes yellow and battery blue. Notably, this is the same color scheme often associated with <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a> himself, who is mostly yellow and has blue shoes. This <i>could</i> be the reason why the Autobot is named Son-Chu in the first place, but either way, it's probably not a coincidence that the two similarly named characters also have similar color schemes. As far as weapons go, Chris's description of him on <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia\" title=\"CWCipedia\">CWCipedia</a> says that his roof can become a shield, while his hood can become either a \"Plasma Pistol\" or an \"Energon Sword\". He is described as being \"Quick footed, well armored\" and with a \"Strong personality under his hood\".<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup> Note that no such personality is shown in the comic.\n</p><p>For some reason, he can also transform into a concert stage, which he does in <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_10\" title=\"Sonichu 10\"><i>Sonichu #10</i></a> to help <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_and_the_Hedgehog_Boys\" title=\"Christian and the Hedgehog Boys\">Christian and the Hedgehog Boys</a> play a live performance of <a href=\"/cwcki/Revive_Zordon\" title=\"Revive Zordon\">Revive Zordon</a>,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup> with their music being so terrible that it actually <a href=\"/cwcki/4-cent_garbage.com\" title=\"4-cent garbage.com\">causes 9/11</a>. At this point, it is debatable whether or not Son-Chu is really a Decepticon agent in disguise, a theory leant credence by the fact that <a href=\"/cwcki/Megatron_pistol\" title=\"Megatron pistol\">Megatron</a> is clearly also in Chris's servitude.\n</p><p>Notably, Son-Chu appeared before any of the other robots in the comic, though not as a transformer. He made several cameos throughout the series in vehicle mode before he and the Samurai Pizza Bots' first proper appearance, being first seen at the end of <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_0\" title=\"Sonichu 0\"><i>Sonichu #0</i></a>.\n</p><p>Chris created a custom box for Son-chu for his fantasy <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Transformers_Legacy_United_Merged\" title=\"Transformers Legacy United Merged\">Transformers Legacy United Merged</a> toyline. He displayed the box in <a href=\"/cwcki/Light_Powered_Cwclight_Reviews_-_Son-Chu\" title=\"Light Powered Cwclight Reviews - Son-Chu\">Light Powered Cwclight Reviews - Son-Chu</a> but due to his shaky <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Cinematography\" title=\"Cinematography\">cinematography</a> the box bio is unreadable.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Prower\">Prower</span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:ProwerVehicle2.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"150\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/d/d1/ProwerVehicle2.jpg/300px-ProwerVehicle2.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/d/d1/ProwerVehicle2.jpg/450px-ProwerVehicle2.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/d/d1/ProwerVehicle2.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:ProwerVehicle2.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Punchy and <a href=\"/cwcki/Layla\" title=\"Layla\">Layla</a> out on a drive.

He is also the sole justification for the \"Samurai\" part of the Samurai Pizza Bots' name.\n</p><p>For some reason, Chris decided to elaborate more on Prower than any of the other Autobots, giving him an established backstory on the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia\" title=\"CWCipedia\">CWCipedia</a> article for <a href=\"/cwcki/Punchy_Sonichu\" title=\"Punchy Sonichu\">Punchy Sonichu</a>, his owner, in a short backstory subsection called <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\"><i>Friends of the Fist</i></a>. The story explains how Punchy and Prower first met, which basically boils down to Punchy noticing a motorcycle in a cave, talking to it, and it talking back. They then decide to be partners for some reason, and that's why Punchy suddenly has a samurai robot motorcycle working for him in <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_9\" title=\"Sonichu 9\"><i>Sonichu #9</i></a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Being the most fleshed out character of Chris's shitty transformers lineup however is countered by Prower also being the most obvious ripoff of the bunch. He is a blatant copy of the Autobot cyber-ninja <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prowl_(Transformers)\" title=\"wikipedia:Prowl (Transformers)\">Prowl</a> from <i>Transformers Animated</i>, sharing such qualities as their samurai armor which becomes a sidecar, their similar names, their vehicle modes, and the fact that both are ninjas, both supposedly rely on stealth, both use holographic images and both use <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shuriken\" title=\"wikipedia:shuriken\">shurikens</a> to fight.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]</a></sup>\n</p><p>The source of Prower's name is a <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">complete mystery</a>. While it has an obvious basis in the name Prowl, his <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_copyright\" title=\"Chris and copyright\">inspiration</a>, why Chris chose to drop the 'L' is never made clear. The name is confirmed not to be a typo like <a href=\"/cwcki/Chrs-Chan_Pure_Pulse-Jolt_Lance\" title=\"Chrs-Chan Pure Pulse-Jolt Lance\">Chrs-Chan Pure Pulse-Jolt Lance</a> was for instance, because it is used multiple times in the comic and that is the name his CWCipedia article went by, meaning the alternate spelling of \"Prowler\" sometimes used is more likely to be the typo that \"Prower\" is. The strange spelling has been claimed by <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">trolls</a> over time to being everything from a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Racist\" title=\"Racist\">racist</a> joke about how Asians would pronounce \"Prowler\" to the more likely option of being a reference to <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_%22Tails%22_Prower\" title='wikipedia:Miles \"Tails\" Prower'>Tails</a> from the <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog\" title=\"Sonic the Hedgehog\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></i> series, whose real name is Miles Prower – a pun on <i>miles per hour</i>.

He can also really slash Decepticons and <a href=\"/cwcki/Decepti-Clones\" title=\"Decepti-Clones\">Decepticlones</a> with his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/English\" title=\"English\">might blades</a>. His transector can still transform into a shield, big or small.\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Origins\">Origins</span></h2>\n<p>At this point, you're probably wondering where the hell these guys have been since the beginning of the comic, and that's a good question. At first, one would assume that the Autobots first showed up around about the time Chris got lost in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Time_Void\" title=\"Time Void\">Time Void</a>. They could have been called in as extra support after Chris got lost, or perhaps they coincidentally ended up there while pursuing Decepticons and decided to stay and help the city. Then, however, you realize that the leader of this particular group of Autobots is <a href=\"/cwcki/Son-Chu\" title=\"Son-Chu\">Son-Chu</a>, who transforms into Chris's car, and Chris had that same crappy Ford Escort all the way back in <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_0\" title=\"Sonichu 0\"><i>Sonichu #0</i></a>, which through <a href=\"/cwcki/Retroactive_continuity_in_Sonichu\" title=\"Retroactive continuity in Sonichu\">retcons</a> Chris has established took place <i>years</i> before <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_9\" title=\"Sonichu 9\"><i>Sonichu #9</i></a>, and Son-Chu was never seen transforming in between those stories, even in situations where his assistance would have helped out immensely.\n</p><p>This then leads to the second theory. Maybe these aren't exactly the same kind of Autobots that appear in the regular <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Transformers\" title=\"Transformers\">Transformers</a></i> universe. After all, the <a href=\"/cwcki/Decepti-Clones\" title=\"Decepti-Clones\">Decepti-Clones</a> of <a href=\"/cwcki/Private_Villa_of_Corrupted_Citizens\" title=\"Private Villa of Corrupted Citizens\">PVCC</a> were all actually built by <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Mary Lee Walsh</a> and her minions, so maybe the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bill_the_Scientist\" title=\"Bill the Scientist\">top minds</a> of <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a> got together and decided to just build some transforming robots of their own at about the same time, and perhaps Chris's car was stripped down and used for parts during the creation of Son-Chu, and that's why he was a robot in <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_9\" title=\"Sonichu 9\"><i>Sonichu #9</i></a> but not before that.\n</p><p>However, then there's the issue of Prower. He wasn't made in a lab or workshop to defend CWCville. He definitely came from out of town. Punchy found him alone in a cave behind a waterfall, and he claimed to have ended up there by coincidence coming back from a battle with Decepticons outside the city. So he must be the alien kind of transformer. This in turn though raises the question of why he was taking orders from a derivative robot like Son-Chu who was built by humans.\n</p><p>In conclusion, Chris introduced a new group of characters with conflicting origin stories and stupid retcons, and the end result was a mess so devoid of any coherence that no-one can even say for sure where the characters actually <i>came from</i>. In other words, typical <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\"><i>Sonichu</i></a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Gallery_of_plagiarism\">Gallery of
