He doesn't believe that <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ryan_Cash\" title=\"Ryan Cash\">Ryan Cash</a> killed himself.</li>\n<li>Chris says the real reason that Clyde Cash <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">trolls</a> him is because Clyde is a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Homosexual\" title=\"Homosexual\">homosexual</a>.</li>\n<li>The idea that Clyde is straight makes Chris <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress_sigh\" title=\"Stress sigh\">stress sigh</a>.</li>\n<li>Chris says that his last password was: \"J04nE1de4R08i2on\", which is an <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Elder_Robison\" rel=\"nofollow\">author's name</a> (incidentally, one with <a href=\"/cwcki/Asperger_syndrome\" title=\"Asperger syndrome\">aspergers</a>). Kacey says this is leet speak, and Chris says that he's never heard that term before.</li>\n<li>Chris talked to Clyde earlier in the day. Clyde claimed that he tampered with Chris's <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PS3\" title=\"PS3\">PS3</a>.</li>\n<li>Kacey says that Chris should just break his PS3 so Clyde will stop bothering him. Chris claims that he can't break his PS3 because he has a PSP and that would break his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PSP\" title=\"PSP\">PSP</a> too.</li>\n<li>Chris says that video games are not the most important thing in his life, as finding a sweetheart in real life is.</li>\n<li>Chris has an interview next week at <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Target\" title=\"Target\">Target</a>.</li>\n<li>Chris says that he has tricked Clyde into not hacking him anymore by telling him that he doesn't care about his PS3 anymore; Kacey suggests making a video of pretending to give away his PS3 or throwing it in the trash. This idea makes Chris stress sigh.</li>\n<li>Clyde told Chris to unscrew the system and to take out a battery so he can't be hacked anymore.

I'm just guessing off the top of my head.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK that's fine. [computer tone]\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, and uh let's see, you know, my father's 82 so take away 27 from his age, um, 62… He was like 55 and my mother will be 58 this year so, let's see, take away 20… um… Yeah take away 20… 48, and she was 41, so 55 and 41 respectively for my father and mother.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah and I'm currently 5'10”.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Mmhmm.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Mmmm, I'm not sure if I'm the shortest or the tallest. I think Cole and Allan are a little bit taller than me the last time  I was, you know, last time I was with them I was a little bit shorter than them. Mmm, and Carol might be shorter than me I'm not sure.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK, I'll put middle then.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, mm'kay. And you know my eye color, one green and one blue, though they were originally blue, both of them.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Okay then, I'm going to put blue because it has to be genetic.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, OK. I'm not sure about siblings sharing the same eye color.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Ah, yeah I'm right handed, and I'm pretty sure my siblings are right handed too.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I'm brown haired so are Cole and Allan, and I believe Carol was a blonde.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK. [typing]\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Alright, and the fine markings... [long pause]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Also before you get into that, were your half-brothers and your half-sisters on your mom's side or your dad's side, because that's important.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> OK, Allan and Carol were on my father's side. Joseph Cole Smithey was on my mother's side.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Okay, and no defining markings? OK then that's all I need.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> No wait a minute, I do have a defining marking.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK. [breathing sound]\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, on my chest above my left breast [laughs] above my left breast. There's this oval-shaped, badge-like scar that I got from a bicycle accident when I was like five to seven years old.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oh that's not genetic so I don't need that, but thank you. [coughs]\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I mean you said, you know if it's scarring or marking related to include that-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> But it has to be genetically related. A bicycle accident isn't genetic, but thank you.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> OK, that pretty much covers it then.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK, thank you. [laughs] I appreciate it. I need to get a lot more.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I mean that was all the questions you had in the email so far.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Yeah, but I need to get a lot more people to do it, I need like forty people per time zone.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Forty people per time zone?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Wow, there are a lot of time zones.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Yeah for America, everything else you have to do by country. But, if you had an accident doing a bike before maybe you should ride bikes instead of jogging. That would help a lot and get your heart rate up.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Mmm, OK.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> By the way, did you get those emails about heart rate?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah I got your email about heart rate. I haven't listened to that yet but I will look into it.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I was kind of busy between today and yesterday, because this fella who calls himself <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Gregg_Mays\" title=\"Gregg Mays\">Gregg Mays</a>, but I'm pretty sure it's also <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">Clyde Cash</a> because he called me-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I thought he was dead.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I thought so too, but he decided to come back by a different name of Gregg Mays, I also recognized him as such-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> How could someone come back from the dead Chris? What, is he like a zombie or something?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> It's like, you know, this guy was assuming a different, this guy was... [pause] OK, it's like this, aside from his original name, whatever it was, he was going by a different name.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> But he was dead, so he's a zombie.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> No, I mean this guy was pretending to be Clyde Cash, it's like he could kill the pretend person and still be alive himself. Like say-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Wait, so you thinking this guy killed the guy and is pretended to be him, who would be a zombie?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Okay, let me give you an example. Let's say I was going around pretending to be Christopher, okay?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You mean <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Liquid\" title=\"Liquid\">my Chris</a>? You couldn't do that, no way. [laughs]\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> No, no, no, no. Anyway I'm just doing this by a name basis only. But anyway, let's say I was going around the internet picking on this guy who, and I keep telling them my name is Christopher.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> But you do tell everyone that your name is Christopher.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> OK, let me change, let me start over then. OK, let's pretend that I was going around the internet calling myself Dick, alright? Dick. And I was bugging on this guy, bullying him, and then he decides to stand up against me and take down my source of anger against him, and then it's like, “Oh my God OK, I'm going to go kill myself.” So Dick kills himself, and is dead. But that doesn't mean that I, Christian am dead. It's just the character of Dick is dead.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> So the guy kills himself, and he's dead, and he comes back as a zombie. Okay I got it, he must have like, the T-virus or something.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> No, no, no he did not really kill himself, he just killed the character.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, how did he kill the character? That's just crazy! So it's a character-zombie, OK!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [sigh] It's a, OK, you know characters are made up. It's not necessarily the person that did it-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK, how could the character be dead if it's made up?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> OK, you know the guy that plays House on House? His name is not really-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> That's an actor.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I know that's an actor, yeah. That's what I've been talking about, this guy was an actor.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Why would an actor be doing this, that doesn't make sense. Was he getting paid or something?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> No, he's not a real actor. He was just acting in his self-proclaimed role as Clyde Cash. And then, it's like in the show he kills, it's like the character Clyde Cash is dead, but the actor for real is still alive.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> But why would an actor be messing with you? So you think this Clyde Cash person is not Clyde Cash. But he made Clyde Cash dead, and now Clyde Cash is back, therefore the character-zombie. And now he works on House, I got it.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [sigh] No, no, no. The guy who was Clyde Cash, is now pretending to be Gregg Mays. I also recognized the email address. The very same email address that Clyde Cash used those months ago.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well if it's still the same email address then he's pretending to be the same person right? Therefore [sound break] a zombie! [laughs] I mean, just tell him he's a zombie. Be like, “No, you're not a zombie.”\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uh no, he's-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> People don't come back from the dead, they just don't.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah I mean- [stress sigh] Jeez. I mean, come on, in reality this guy is by a whole different name. We're not sure what his real identity is. And he's been fooling around chasing me, and he was chasing me around the internet claiming to be going by the name Clyde Cash. And then, he claims that he's going to kill, he claims that Clyde Cash is going to kill himself. So the character dies, but the actor is still alive, and now the actor returns and goes by a different character of Gregg Mays.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oh so he's like Carmen Sandiego he goes everywhere and he has disguises.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah aliases, yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I mean, why would you think he would come back if he killed himself, or the character-zombie off. That doesn't make sense, why would he come back? And why would you think he's a character anyway? Maybe this guy is real…and undead.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I know the person, the guy is real. But he was pretending to be-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> But maybe he really is this Clyde Cash though, that's what I don't get. People don't just do that, they don't pretend to be different people. Why is he after you anyway? What did you do to him?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I have done nothing to him. I did not know him, until a whole big number of months, like a number of months ago, and then he hacked into my web-hosting site starting with my <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC%27s_Sonichu_Site!\" title=\"CWC's Sonichu Site!\">original Tripod site</a> and then-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Okay, there has to be a reason. What happened? He's got to be a reason for this vendetta.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I have no idea. I never knew the guy personally.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Nothing happened to him that would make him angry at you? I mean-\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I don't-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> That doesn't sound right. Did you ever hurt his feelings, or maybe it was through somebody else that knows him that you know?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [sigh] He's-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> There's no way a random person would just pretend this.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah I know, I know. OK, yeah. Supposedly Clyde Cash's story for him trolling me was that supposedly his quote-unquote brother, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ryan_Cash\" title=\"Ryan Cash\">Ryan Cash</a>, committed suicide, after the one-time threat, after I found the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/ED\" title=\"ED\">ED</a> Page, and I was like, “That's it, I'm not drawing anymore comics.” Then supposedly Ryan killed himself, suicide, because of my little hint there. But then, I did continue on into the comics.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, but then you have to own up to those consequences of your actions. This guy is probably real then. I know I'd be really upset if one of my siblings killed themselves.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. [stress sigh] I did apologize, and I felt sorry for-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Was it a very heartfelt apology?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. But he still trolls me-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well maybe it wasn't enough if he's still after you. I don't think this is an act, or something-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> It's not a game, there's no zombies.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> The only other instinct that he might have against me is because he's an obvious <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">homosexual</a>.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [laughs] OK, what does that have to do with anything?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I'm not particularly fond of homosexual dudes. I think we've been over that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK but how do you think he's gay? How is it obvious? Has he hit on you? Have you seen him having gay sex?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [stress sigh] No, I don't have visual proof, but he just sounds-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Then he's probably not gay.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hmm, OK well-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I mean, unless he's come on to you, or you've seen him, he's not gay.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Well actually I can tell you this. In his recent threat, after he stole my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Playstation_Network\" title=\"Playstation Network\">Playstation Network</a> account the first time, day before yesterday, he wanted me to make a video of my Sonic and Tails plush dolls going on a homosexual date and having homosexual sex.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I think he would just be doing that to bother you because he knows how much you hate gay people. I don't think a gay person would do that, in fact that sounds like something a straight guy would do because they think it's funny.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [stress sigh] Well anyway.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> A gay person wouldn't think that's funny because it's too close to them. That's really proof he's not gay.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [sigh]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Gay people don't act like that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Well, whatever.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> He's probably 100% straight...\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [sigh] Well.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> ...and a T-virus zombie.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Look forget the word zombie right now, OK?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [Laughs] But, that's what it sounds like. I mean, I'm sorry, it's a joke.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> That's what it may sound like but that is not the case, I mean, yeah, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Kim\" title=\"Kim\">Kim</a> can tell you a lot more about Clyde Cash/Gregg Mays when y'all talk next time. Mmm but anyway, yeah, I did not follow up on his, like, as if I'm going to do that. Anyway, then I called Sony and got my account back, 5:30 pm. Thursday? Wednesday? It's Friday now, yeah, Wednesday. I got it back 5:30 Wednesday. I changed the password and the email address. But then, somehow, and I had not even told anybody my new email address and the password [voice gets high-pitched] and at 11:30 he get's into my main Playstation account again!\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well if he's done it before, he's probably really good at it. He probably doesn't need anything to go on, he's probably just some super-hacker. I mean-\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [Stress sigh] Anyway, yesterday afternoon I called Sony and told them about this guy hacking into my account again and they're like, “OK well, since you backed up will changed your Sonichu ID back and get you a temporary password and put your account on hold, on suspension, and our crack team will investigate this guy further, and see how he was able to get into your account.\"\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, do you make it an easy password and login?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> What?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Do you make it easy for someone to figure out? Some people say never make your passwords birthdates or the word “God” or something. Is it easy? Do you use the same password over and over?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Actually no, my password is very complicated. Okay, well I'll tell it to you since it's already used up at this point. The last password I used was capital J, zero, four, lower case N, capital E, one, lower case D, E, four, capital R, zero-eight, lower case I, two, lower case O, N. [J04nE1de4R08i2on]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oh, OK, um. So that's just a random string of words, how do you remember that?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Actually in this case, this was an author's name. I take his name and change some of his letters to numbers. You know, three can look like M, or N's, E or W.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Uh, well. Maybe he's cracked that code. If you use that a lot he knows what it is. I hate leet speak, it's so stupid.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Leet speak?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Leet speak, that's what it's called when you change letters into numbers like that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Leet speak? I've never heard of that before. I just thought it was a fun thing to do. I often like to <a href=\"/cwcki/Reldnahc_Notsew_Naitsirhc\" title=\"Reldnahc Notsew Naitsirhc\">spell words backwards</a>, and say them backwards like that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Maybe you should look it up. But still, maybe he's just cracked your code. He's probably really good at what he does.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Actually I talked, actually while I was waiting for Kim, I picked up on him calling me twice tonight. I also talked to him the night before a little bit. He said that he supposedly tampered with my PS3. I mean other than, I mean, I'm not sure how he could do that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> He could! I mean, there's tons of ways for people to do stuff like that. You should probably listen to him. If he's done it before he's going to do it again.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, but anyway-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Especially with all the times you download stuff to your PSN, yeah he could probably do it.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hmmm, well anyway I currently have my Playstation 3 turned off and unplugged so he cannot get to the new passwords and email addresses from my other accounts aside from the named one. Anyway, aside from that-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Maybe he'll break it or something, but then this would all be over and then it wouldn't matter right?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Maybe he'll break it?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Why not if he can mess with it further? Maybe you should just give up on it. Obviously this guy is going to be after you, is it really worth it?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [sigh] Well I'm not going to give up on my PSN on that note you know, someone will help me-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> It's just video games.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> ...my main account back. Yeah, but still so much I could be able to do only when I have access to my account. Like, you cannot be logged off your Playstation Network Account and copy your PS1 classic or PSP games to the PSP, or even the videos you download through the Playstation Network you have to be logged into the Playstation Network in order to copy the videos and those games to the-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> But still, video games. I mean, it's not going to be a huge loss.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hmmm.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> If you make them so important, of course he's going to go for those. He's probably going after the most important thing in your life right now, which would be video games.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hmm, uh yeah, as if that's the most important thing in my life- I mean most important thing in my life right now is going out in real life and trying to find myself a woman to be <a href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart\" title=\"Sweetheart\">sweetheart</a>.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well... That's not a goal that should be your priority. That's- especially if you hadn't spent most of your time playing video games you might have been successful by now. But still, your priority should be getting a job and getting out of the house and I mean-\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah well fortunately-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> ...keeping your promises.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah well fortunately I am on the verge of getting a job, you know, I got my interview next Tuesday at <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Target\" title=\"Target\">Target</a>.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b> </font>Yeah, well good luck on that. But, I don't know, maybe you should just let it go.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> You're still talking about the video games aren't you?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Yeah especially if you have all this going for you now, you probably should just be like, make him think you don't care.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, well I pretty much given him that impression at this point.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Plus it probably would make you a lot more appealing if you really want a girlfriend.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I should know, I'm a girl.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I know. But anyway, maybe he'll back off a little bit now on that note. Especially since-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well he's not going to if you make it such a big deal, and you keep going after it. You're seriously just going to have to be like, “You know what? Fine, I don't need it anymore.” It's how those psychos think.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hmm…\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> He's going to know you want it back if you keep trying. You're going to have to trick him.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I mean I am tricking him right now, I mean a little bit. When he called-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> No you're not, you're worrying over it. You want to get it back. You're going to have to be serious and say, “I don't care anymore.”\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I mean I did tell him that, yeah. I did tell him that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Make a video of you throwing it away or something, giving it away. Just be like, “I don't need this anymore.” Obviously he's watching you and following you.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [stress sigh]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You've got to give him a direct message. You've got to outsmart him. You're smart, you can do it.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uh, yeah I mean, I don't want to have to give it away for real.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well then he's just going to keep doing this, and you're basically asking him to do it. That's the point of the video though, to just be like, “I don't need this anymore.” Maybe he'll take it at face value. It's worth a shot.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Alright well, I'll think about it. I will think about it.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You should do it. Because when you say, “I'll think about it,” it means you're not going to do it.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> No, when I say, “I'll think about it,” It means I'll think about it, and then I am likely to do it. I mean, I told you I thought about the exercise and sorry, it's just, I thought about calling the doctor and I called the-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well you need to shake this guy, because obviously he's mentally imbalanced. I would do anything I can to get rid of him. Especially if he has anything to do with your PS3 being bugged or something. I'd be like, “Screw this, I don't need this anymore.” I mean he's probably already heard it by now.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> He's probably already heard it?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Yeah, if he's done something to it.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah well anyway, he also told me something else, I should take it apart and remove the battery that's by the Blu-ray Drive, and then that will do something to the mod chip and then put the battery back it. It's not like I'm going to listen to him like that, I'd only do it if Sony suggested I do it. Or like, I need a professional like Kim's boyfriend Logan. She confirms to me that he knows pretty much about that so you know, I told her to ask him that for me about what will happen if I remove the battery from the Blu-Ray drive area there.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well maybe you should do it. If he's really got something in your PS3 he's not just doing it for fun. You probably should listen to him. It couldn't hurt to just look.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, but I'm not sure, I mean- If I remove the battery it might wipe out my user list on my PS3.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> No it won't it's just the battery! Batteries don't hold memory or information, what?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> It's like if you remove the battery from a clock radio, a digital clock radio okay? That's like an internal battery and then the power goes out-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> That's not a computer, that's different. I can remove my hard drive from my computer and none of my stuff is going to be erased.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Alright.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> It's made to hold that memory. It's not going to hurt it. It's not a clock radio, I think it's a little more advanced than that. I mean, I thought you were good at electronics.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I am fairly good at electronics, I mean-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well then you should know something so basic.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Well I just didn't know for sure about what he's saying here.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> No, it should be fine.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hmm.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Haven't you replaced any hard drives before in anything?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah I have-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Nothing gets erased. \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah I mean, I have replaced the hard drive in my PS3 drive twice, from the original-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well then you should be fine.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Alright I'll do it, I'll take it apart and look for the battery, and remove it and then put it back in. I mean, after we finish up this conversation here.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK, yeah. That's fine.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b> </font>Mm'kay.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Alright, I might be late tomorrow because I close, but I'll talk to you later.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> OK well also I'll just let you know, I called up the doctor's [?] office earlier today and I made an appointment to see him this morning at 10:45 or 10:30 I forget which one. Anyway talking about my chest- talking about my <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_health\" title=\"Chris and health\">heart pains</a>.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK, heart pain?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, didn't you and Kim talk about this? She told you had talked about this.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oh, yeah OK, I remember.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I'm gonna go see him about that this morning. Mm'kay. Alright I'll talk to you tomorrow, you take care OK?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK, well if you're having heart pains over this, that's a good reason to get rid of this shit. I'll just talk to you tomorrow, just feel better.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> OK, you stay safe.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Alright, bye.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Bye-bye.\n</p><p>[recording ends]\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n<p><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.4shared.com/mp3/FDRZA4oZce/Kacey_Call_18.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">MP3 Phone Call</a>\n</p>\n<table style=\"width: 90%; max-width: 600px; height: 70px; margin: 1em auto 1em auto; border: 0.15em outset #000; background: #eee; vertical-align: centered; color:#000;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"width: 33%; max-width: 200px; text-align: center; color:#000;\">⇐ <a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey_Call_17\" title=\"Kacey Call 17\">Kacey Call 17</a><span style=\"color: #000\"></span>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33%; max-width: 200px; text-align: center; color:#000;\"><span style=\"color: {{{textcolor}}}\"><strong><a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey_calls\" title=\"Kacey calls\">Kacey Phone Calls</a></strong></span>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33%; max-width: 200px; text-align: center; color:#000;\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey_Call_19\" title=\"Kacey Call 19\">Kacey Call 19</a><span style=\"color: #000\"></span> ⇒\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p><br/>\n</p>\n<center><b>    Chats and calls</b></center>\n<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n</p>\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"navbox\" style=\";\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"padding:2px;\">\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"nowraplinks collapsible mw-collapsed mw-collapsible\" style=\"width:100%;background:transparent;color:inherit;;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<th class=\"navbox-title\" colspan=\"2\" style=\";\"><div style=\"float:left; width:6em;text-align:left;\"> <span class=\"noprint plainlinksneverexpand\" style=\"white-space:nowrap; font-weight:normal; font-size:xx-small; ;;border:none;;\"><a class=\"new\" href=\"/w/index.php?title=Template:Classic_Chris_era&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" title=\"Template:Classic Chris era (page does not exist)\"><span style=\";;border:none;;\" title=\"View this template\">v</span></a> <span style=\"font-size:80%;\">•</span> <a class=\"new\" href=\"/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Classic_Chris_era&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" title=\"Template talk:Classic Chris era (page does not exist)\"><span style=\"color:#002bb8;;;border:none;;\" title=\"Discussion about this template\">d</span></a> <span style=\"font-size:80%;\">•</span> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"//sonichu.com/w/index.php?title=Template:Classic_Chris_era&amp;action=edit\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#002bb8;;;border:none;;\" title=\"You can edit this template.
