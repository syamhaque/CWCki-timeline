As is the case with nearly any work, the article chronicled \"devices and conventions that a writer can reasonably rely on as being present in the audience members' minds and expectations\". Being the massive pile of fail that it is, <i>Sonichu</i> provided plenty.\n</p><p>However, the page also led to vast amounts of edit-warring, trolling, and complaining — all of which have caused many a headache on TV Tropes. Sometime in mid-2010, the main article was locked so that only administrators could edit it, and pared down to have a less negative tone. All the tropes pertaining to Chris in real life were also removed, as TV Tropes admins especially dislike negativity and/or complaining that pertains to real people. The pages for <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Asperchu\" title=\"Asperchu\">Asperchu</a></i> were also cut down in a similar fashion. Many other TV Tropes articles on complaint magnets such as <i>My Immortal</i>, <i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i>, and Fox News Channel have been similarly locked.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup> As with any other page that is locked, those wishing to make alterations to the article may inquire at <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/posts.php?discussion=gsjp7dldjh2dwdelcha2hu17&amp;page=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> thread.\n</p><p>The article once contained subpages for \"Just Bugs Me\" (now called Headscratchers), in which editors could raise questions about a work, and \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Wild\" title=\"Wild\">Wild</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Mass_debating\" title=\"Mass debating\">Mass Guessing</a>\", mainly for making joke-y predictions about a work's future. These were also deleted to help stem the complaining and trolling. At one point, a biographical article on Chris existed at the title \"CWC\". Its contents are unknown, but they were likely identical to the real-life section seen below. The \"CWC\" page was quickly deleted, and it was probably locked around the same time as the main Sonichu article to prevent re-creation. Another Sonichu-related page that disappeared in this timeframe was the one on <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Moon-Pals\" title=\"Moon-Pals\">Moon-Pals</a></i>, although this was as much due to that work going offline as it was for the negativity towards Chris.\n</p><p>Around the time that the Sonichu page was locked, the site introduced several more tabs to help in the diffusion of tropes. \"YMMV\" lists tropes that are subjective in nature; \"Characters\" is meant to list tropes that pertain only to an individual character; and \"Trivia\" for facts on a work that are not really tropes, but still worth noting. (Perhaps unsurprisingly, Sonichu's \"YMMV\" tab is also locked.) Several tropes, such as \"So Bad, It's Horrible\" and \"Wall Banger\", have migrated to a subsection called the \"Darth Wiki\" and their pages explicitly say <i>not</i> to list them on main articles, and \"Wall Banger\" was later deleted entirely.\n</p><p>Below is an archive of the <i>Sonichu</i> article on TV Tropes dating from approximately June 2010, shortly before admins took a chainsaw to it. Note that several tropes have since been renamed, while \"Did Not Do the Research\" has been deleted due to mass complaining and misuse. Also, TV Tropes no longer supports <strike>strikethrough</strike> code due to abuse. Outside correction of TV Tropes-specific links (the former \"Ptitle\" format for punctuated titles has been removed, and pages on works are no longer preceded by \"Main\", but rather by the format of the work), and the updating of links to the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia\" title=\"CWCipedia\">CWCipedia</a> archive and the new <a href=\"/cwcki/Encyclopedia_Dramatica\" title=\"Encyclopedia Dramatica\">Encyclopedia Dramatica</a>, no links have been changed.\n</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>For the Just Bugs Me and Wild Mass Guessing pages, see <a href=\"/cwcki/User:T_K_19/TVTropes\" title=\"User:T K 19/TVTropes\">this page</a>.<i></i>\n</p>\n<hr/>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:152px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:206-SonichuPose.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"225\" src=\"/w/images/a/a3/206-SonichuPose.jpg\" width=\"150\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:206-SonichuPose.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BileFascination\" rel=\"nofollow\">Enjoy</a>, <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyAesop\" rel=\"nofollow\">Learn</a>, and <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveIMentionedIAmHeterosexualToday\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stay Straight</a>.</div></div></div>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">Go!

The comic itself would be remarkable only for how <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Horrible/Webcomics\" rel=\"nofollow\">unbelievably bad it is</a>, but it has in recent years gained notoriety due to the author's antics in response to <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll\" rel=\"nofollow\">troll</a>ing and other harassment. The result is a <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BileFascination\" rel=\"nofollow\">perversely-fascinating</a>, <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionJunction\" rel=\"nofollow\">deeply-dysfunctional</a>, symbiotic relationship - Mr. Chandler's creation has been saved from the curse of obscurity at the price of a \"fanbase\" devoted to <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusAngstMachina\" rel=\"nofollow\">making his life a living hell.</a>\n</p><p><i>Sonichu</i> started as some sort of <i><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pokemon\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pokémon</a>/<a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SonicTheHedgehog\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sonic The Hedgehog</a></i> crossover world, and the first few issues focus on Sonichu's origin, his <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeetCute\" rel=\"nofollow\">meeting</a> with his \"heartsweet\" <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChick\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rosechu</a> (based <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz\" rel=\"nofollow\">heavily</a> on <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/SonicTheHedgehog\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amy Rose</a>), and a supporting cast of other Hedgehog Pokémon of various types. But in issue #2 and from issues #4-7, the series crystallizes into its present form, as <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEmbellished\" rel=\"nofollow\">Christian himself takes center stage</a> and encounters and battles his enemies in <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife\" rel=\"nofollow\">real life</a>, from mall cops to the dean of his local community college to internet <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll\" rel=\"nofollow\">trolls</a>. Needless to say, the supposed main plot, a search for the <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sonichu Bal</a>- sorry, <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sonichu Crystals</a>, in order to use their powers to free Christian's <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart\" rel=\"nofollow\">Distaff Counterpart</a> and \"dream sibling\", Crystal, from a mirror the aforementioned dean have trapped her in, takes a backseat.\n</p><p>Due to criticism over such a self-centered plotline, Christian eventually gets <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus\" rel=\"nofollow\">trapped in a timestream</a>, leaving Sonichu to take up his heroic mantle of defender of <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySuetopia\" rel=\"nofollow\">CWCville</a>. The war against <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EncyclopediaDramatica\" rel=\"nofollow\">Encyclopedia Dramatica</a> and <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImageBoards\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Four-Cent Garbage\"</a> rages on, interrupted by the occasional <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yiff\" rel=\"nofollow\">furry sex scene</a>, until issue #9 <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreShift\" rel=\"nofollow\">changes focus</a> (again) to dating education (<a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IThoughtItMeant\" rel=\"nofollow\">no, not</a> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsALongStory\" rel=\"nofollow\">sex education</a>) and Christian's crude interpretation of how relationships work.\n</p><p>The last chapter of issue 9 depicts a lengthy battle against invading forces from the PVCC, and ends with Sonichu and friends <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSidedBattle\" rel=\"nofollow\">beating them with as much resistance as a team of Mary Sues typically gets</a>. Christian's <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar\" rel=\"nofollow\">Author Avatar</a> is released from the timestream shortly afterwards, and this cues the beginning of Issue #10, which can best be described as a combination of undisguised <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WishFulfillment\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wish Fulfillment</a> and Christian's attempt to get back at his internet antagonizers by turning both his avatar and Sonichu into bigger <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodModeSue\" rel=\"nofollow\">God Mode Sues</a> than ever, via the Sonichu <strike>Crystals</strike> Balls, and depict them punishing in-comic representations of his enemies by either killing or injuring them, destroying their property or making them <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KneelBeforeZod\" rel=\"nofollow\">pray to him for forgiveness</a>. As the story progresses, Christian's feud with his \"enemies\" from real life becomes increasingly more disturbing, and its culmination in issue #10 finale can be most charitably described as the ultimate proof that Christian is in dire need of psychiatric help. It's worth noting that in this issue Christian frequently derailed the plot so he could devote several pages to \"punishing\" comic books versions of people who \"wronged\" him most recently; by contrast, (supposedly) important plot threads (such as Crystal being trapped in Dark Mirror Hole, or Christian's feud with college dean) were <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina\" rel=\"nofollow\">resolved quickly and anticlimactically</a>. This sequence of events create probably the most unplanned and, for newcomers, incomprehensible storyline so far in <i>Sonichu</i>. Christian (once again) promised that in the future issues he will give the spotlight to Sonichu and that his Author Avatar won't appear so often. However, he isn't famous for keeping his promises (having made this exact one before), so future issues can be expected to be similar storyline-wise to <i>Sonichu 10</i>, with new real life-based enemies introduced as more trolling undoubtedly will continue to rain down upon him. (That is, of course, assuming there will be new issues at all, which might not happen in the foreseeable future. Christian hasn't uploaded any new pages since February 2010 and <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_Blog#10_March_2010\" title=\"CWC Blog\">is deeply offended even by mere suggestions that he should update his own webcomic</a>. It seems that <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionDeficitCreatorDisorder\" rel=\"nofollow\">he decided to devote his time to more entertaining activities instead</a>, such as masturbating, playing video games and <a href=\"/cwcki/File:SonicCostumeWhining.jpg\" title=\"File:SonicCostumeWhining.jpg\">whining</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/GameFAQs\" title=\"GameFAQs\">about them</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_Blog#26_May_2010\" title=\"CWC Blog\">on the internet</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/OkCupid#ChrisCSonichu_profile\" title=\"OkCupid\">continuing his</a> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuestForSex\" rel=\"nofollow\">Quest For Sex</a> on the internet, <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite\" rel=\"nofollow\">condemning internet</a> and <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies\" rel=\"nofollow\">claiming that he is \"active within his community\"</a>.)\n</p><p>Since this comic blurs the line between fiction and reality so much, a deep understanding of Mr. Chandler's life and psyche is required to make any sense of it. The best source would be <a href=\"/cwcki/Main_Page\" title=\"Main Page\">the CWCki</a>, an <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWikiRule\" rel=\"nofollow\">entire wiki</a> cataloging Mr. Chandler's life and works (warning: some pages and images are definitely <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSafeForWork\" rel=\"nofollow\">Not Sage For Work</a> or <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainBleach\" rel=\"nofollow\">your mental health</a>), while the even more <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NSFW\" rel=\"nofollow\">NSFW</a> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EncyclopediaDramatica\" rel=\"nofollow\">Encyclopedia Dramatica</a> page that started this whole mess can be found <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://encyclopediadramatica.rs/Chris-Chan\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.

He used to have his own <i>Sonichu</i> wiki which could be found <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://archive.sonichu.com/cwcipedia/index.php?title=Main_Page\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>; however, in response to trolls hacking and vandalizing his precious wiki (again), on 27 May 2010 he announced his decision to <a href=\"/cwcki/100_2188\" title=\"100 2188\">\"relinquish what was the Cwcipedia\" while \"keeping ownership of what it was before yesterday\"</a>. In response Vivian Gee and <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Asperchu\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alec Benson Leary</a> took control of CWCipedia and claimed all rights to Sonichu; at the beginning of June 2010 the control of CWCipedia apparently was taken over by a mysterious individual <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://archive.sonichu.com/cwcipedia/index.php?title=True_and_Honest_FAQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">who may or may not be the TRUE and HONEST CWC</a>.<sup>* Well, actually it's definitely not CWC, but it's fun to pretend otherwise.

The torture scene was awful, but by that point the characters were already irredeemable.\n<ul><li>Right after that there was an intended example, where <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyGuy\" rel=\"nofollow\">Meg Griffin</a> (who Chris <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerverseSexualLust\" rel=\"nofollow\">has a crush on</a>) gushes over Chris and even kisses him, but is then revealed to be Silvana. It doesn't work, though, due to all of the comic's supposed antagonists being more likable than the heroes.</li></ul></li>\n<li>A lot of the things the <i>real</i> Chris has said, talked about, and even spoken about can evoke this.

Combine this with the fact that he has recently <a href=\"/cwcki/100_2188\" title=\"100 2188\">officially relinquished the CWCipedia</a> (the site where he used to post the comic), and chances of any updates in the foreseeable future look more and more remote.\n<ul><li>The series has been picked up by Vivian and Alec and have claimed Sonichu as their own due to the way Chris filled out the copyright form which left a loophole.

Even though it doesn't really parody either <i>Sonic</i> or <i>Pokémon</i> (or any of the other countless shows it references) so much as it slavishly imitates them when Chris isn't <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst\" rel=\"nofollow\">wangsting</a> about his nonexistent love life. Evidence suggests that Chris doesn't even know what a parody is, and thinks of it as just a magic word he can use to stave off lawsuits.\n<ul><li>It's worth mentioning that pretty much all \"fan\" creations are true <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatireParodyPastiche\" rel=\"nofollow\">parodies/satires</a>, and Chris gets riled up when someone makes a parody of <i>his</i> (non-original) work.</li>\n<li>He made his version of characters from <i><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Asperchu\" rel=\"nofollow\">Asperchu</a></i> who are based on characters on Sonichu who are \"parodies\" of Pikachu and Sonic, making it a case of a parody of a parody of a parody.\n<ul><li>Then the <i><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Asperchu\" rel=\"nofollow\">Asperchu</a></i> comics parodied that, so now we have parodies of parodies of parodies of parodies.

Chris's dream sister, Crystal Weston Chandler was removed when she was trapped in the \"dark mirror\" by Mary Lee Walsh and Count Graduon.

Massive walls of text explain everything that's happening, characters will discuss things that any other writer would leave offscreen (i.e. an entire page dedicated to <i>a character getting a soda,</i> with a conversation about getting the change for the soda machine; or Chris and his clone Sammy discussing the difference between their medallions), and as pointed out above, has entire action scenes skipped over in favor of the characters just <i>talking</i> about what happened. It basically boils down to him thinking everyone is as thick-headed as he is, and <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons\" rel=\"nofollow\">thus everything has to be thoroughly explained.</a>\n<ul><li>This also applies to the personalities of his characters. Yes, they do have personalities. Yes, you do need to take a deeper look. No, they never, ever display this. And even then he doesn't follow that, expecting the reader to understand that a character isn't really like that and it's just an example of his \"Random Access Humor.\" And most ironically, the one character who has this as a <i>trait</i>, Punchy Sonichu, never shows this.</li>\n<li>And how does Chris himself justify this? By saying that explaining things in text takes much less time and effort, letting him put out more pages faster and saving on his markers.</li></ul></li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SickeninglySweethearts\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sickeningly Sweethearts</a>: Sonichu and Rosechu.

This is a man's life - his failures, his neuroses, his fantasies, his warped worldview, proudly displayed for the world on paper and pixels. Reading <i>Sonichu</i> and learning about its author is nothing less than a descent into someone's personal hell, made all the more terrible for the fact that the author intends for the experience to <i>entertain</i> people.

So far, aside from a song he played on Guitar Hero, <i>none of the songs have had a guitar.</i> There is something <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrowningMomentOfFunny\" rel=\"nofollow\">unfathomably hilarious</a> about Chris clicking a game controller in pretend-tune to horns and synthesized piano.</li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAnimalsAreDogs\" rel=\"nofollow\">All Animals Are Dogs</a>: Judging by the fact that Chris <a href=\"/cwcki/More_for_the_crabs\" title=\"More for the crabs\">couldn't wait to play with Ivy's hermit crabs</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/For_My_Sweetest_Ivy\" title=\"For My Sweetest Ivy\">wanted to walk them</a>, he seems to believe that crabs behave just like dogs.</li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alternate Character Interpretation</a>: Solid Chris is often called <a href=\"/cwcki/Ian_Brandon_Anderson\" title=\"Ian Brandon Anderson\">Ian Brandon Anderson</a>, taken from one of his account names, and is portrayed by others as a stupid loser troll who tries to steal Liquid Chris's fame and take over his franchise, ruining his name in the process. <a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris\" title=\"Liquid Chris\">Liquid Chris</a>, though obviously the true impostor, is jokingly refereed to as the real Chris, because his videos and songs are much better than Solid Chris's, and because it pisses off Solid. Notably, Liquid Chris has true fans and a good amount of subscribers and friends on Youtube, and a Girlfriend, Kacey, while Solid's fanbase is just a bunch of trolls.\n<ul><li>Also, there's a persistent school of thought that says he must simply be one of the most elaborate, dedicated internet trolls ever, going so far as to get his father in on the gag.

Some of the videos he does related to Clyde Cash in particular almost seem playful or funny, but he's all business and blind rage when it comes to the idea that someone might be trying to draw attention from him.\n<ul><li>It seems to be more that he's afraid of losing the \"fans\" he believes he has or that he's afraid people will actually confuse Sonichu/him and Asperchu/\"Liquid,\" when the difference is actually pretty obvious to most people.

He actually got trolled before trolling even existed (he was locked in a crawl space when he was six when a girl convinced him that Casper lived there). He's become the internet's punching bag and enough painful and embarrasing things have happened to him through his life that the only reason he isn't a Woobie is that he's a \"perverse, narcissistic, homophobic, sexist, racist, overweight, delusional 'high-functioning autistic' virgin man-child\".

This revelation of sorts would then lead to the Liquid Chris Saga, arguably a series of CMoF, whereby <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/CChanSonichuCWC\" rel=\"nofollow\">a guy</a> on <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouTube\" rel=\"nofollow\">YouTube</a> posted videos of himself posing as Chris. They were amusing (and disturbingly accurate) on their own, but how Solid Chris <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage\" rel=\"nofollow\">reacted</a> to him made it even funnier. He even got his own <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrowningMomentOfAwesome\" rel=\"nofollow\">Crowning Moment Of Awesome</a> when he <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6t63XMQfg0\" rel=\"nofollow\">played \"More Than A Feeling\" on guitar</a> after the real Chris posted a video of himself playing the song on <i><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuitarHero\" rel=\"nofollow\">Guitar Hero</a></i>.</li></ul></li>\n<li>The events with the impersonator culminated in Chris-chan challenging him to a <i>singing contest</i> in order to prove his identity as the real Chris. Yes, you did read that correctly. What makes this particularly funny is that, while the impersonator had a relatively decent voice, Chris is pretty much flat-out terrible.\n<ul><li>Liquid Chris won the contest fair and square; <i>one of the real Chris's appointed judges voted for the impostor</i>. The impostor declared himself the winner (and therefore the real Christan Weston Chandler) and excused himself from YouTube to prepare for the future. The videos and phone calls following this are unbelievable.</li>\n<li>Real Chris then backpedalled and claimed the contest was never to prove who was the true CWC, despite the fact that he said it was when he started the whole thing.</li></ul></li>\n<li>The sheer deadpan way the Audiobooks have Sonichu calm down after an anti-homosexual rant: \"Instantly calmed by the promise of intercourse\".</li>\n<li>The end of <a href=\"/cwcki/Alec_Benson_Leary_Phone_Call_5\" title=\"Alec Benson Leary Phone Call 5\">fifth phone call between Chris and Alec Benson Leary</a>. Chris didn't want to talk with Alec so he made up an excuse to finish the conversation <i><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacePalm\" rel=\"nofollow\">by impersonating his own mother</a></i> (not his father, curiously) <i>\"telling\" him that he has to clean up cat poop in their kitchen</i>.\n<ul><li>And then there was <a href=\"/cwcki/Vivitheg%27s_AIM_chat\" title=\"Vivitheg's AIM chat\">the time</a> when he really did have to clean up cat poop, but \"slipped and made a mess\".</li></ul></li>\n<li>CWCki's <a href=\"/cwcki/Encyclopedia_Dramatica\" title=\"Encyclopedia Dramatica\">page</a> on <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EncyclopediaDramatica\" rel=\"nofollow\">Encyclopedia Dramatica</a>, quoting a post Chris made to his own discussion page, potholing \"Why do you hate me so much?\" to \"Frequently Asked Questions\".</li></ul></li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrowningMomentOfHeartwarming\" rel=\"nofollow\">Crowning Moment Of Heartwarming</a>: Liquid and Kacey singing \"A Whole New World.\"</li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrowningMusicOfAwesome\" rel=\"nofollow\">Crowning Music Of Awesome</a>: <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxSpOob2J4w\" rel=\"nofollow\">This</a>, and <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be0JuT7qRQo\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a>, and <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63XxM-Gysfw\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a>... There's a surprising amount of awesome music, really.</li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cursed With Awesome</a>: Chris's laziness. Why? It's the only thing stopping him from trying to sell <i>Sonichu</i> merchandise and getting the pants sued off of him by Nintendo and/or Sega.\n<ul><li>Which is a shame, cause God DAMN that would be funny to watch.</li>\n<li>Very arguably, the trolling if you subscribe to the cliché of it being better to have loved and lost than have never loved at all. Thanks to the trolls, Chris believes he's had several 'sweethearts', which would never have happened otherwise. Then again, since none of them fucked him he probably doesn't care.</li></ul></li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier\" rel=\"nofollow\">Darker And Edgier</a>: Some fics put the series in a darker prospective, <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://sonichufinale.canalblog.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sonichu Finale</a> in particular. More recent examples are <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://sonichu.the-comic.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sonichu Is Dead</a> and <a class=\"new\" href=\"/w/index.php?title=Fan:The_Death_of_Sonichu&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" title=\"Fan:The Death of Sonichu (page does not exist)\">the fic</a> on which it's based.</li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DartboardOfHate\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dartboard Of Hate</a>: Adam Stackhouse, winner of the Parappa contest, was a \"victim\" of this.

And his \"proof\" is how various cartoon characters were shown living together in <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoFramedRogerRabbit\" rel=\"nofollow\">Toon Town</a>. <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMakingThisUpDisclaimer\" rel=\"nofollow\">Seriously.</a>\n<ul><li>Apply some <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fridge Logic</a> to this, and this becomes the reason he adamantly opposes <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollFic\" rel=\"nofollow\">parodies or fanfics</a> featuring his characters: they are <i>changing reality,</i> and so he has to <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon\" rel=\"nofollow\">Retcon</a> any relation to his canon those fics might have had.</li></ul></li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadBabyComedy\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dead Baby Comedy</a>: Chris attempted this by comparing Clyde Cash's imminent downfall to <i>the freaking World Trade Center attacks</i>. Needless to say, it failed. <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternetBacklash\" rel=\"nofollow\">Horribly</a>.</li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap\" rel=\"nofollow\">Death Is Cheap</a>: As far as it applies to real life, Chris honestly believes people who go to heaven can come back whenever. Which explains why he pleads for <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BillyMays\" rel=\"nofollow\">Billy Mays</a> to \"come back soon\". And thinks it's ok to depict the deaths of Ivy and Panda-Halo the way he did, since they didn't have any objections. That or he thinks they're just acting. Also for someone who loved his dog, he sure as hell won't let her rest in peace.</li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DethroningMomentOfSuck\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dethroning Moment Of Suck</a>: Probably the worst thing to come from Chris' magic markers would be ShecameforCWC.JPG, a pornographic drawing of him and his then-friend Megan, first uploaded <i>by himself</i> to <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EncyclopediaDramatica\" rel=\"nofollow\">Encyclopedia Dramatica</a> under the claim of \"replacing negativity with positivity.\" This was evidently the final straw in a relationship already strained by stalker-ish tendencies and sexual harassment, and Megan has since moved as far away from Chris as possible. Chris doesn't seem to understand what he's done, blames Encyclopedia Dramatica for \"twisting\" the image against him, and has since reuploaded the picture that cost him what might have been his only friend, claiming that he \"needed sexy pictures.\"\n<ul><li>For added <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacePalm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Face Palm</a> points, he <i>still</i> refers to Megan as having \"broken up\" with him despite her repeatedly telling him they were never together.</li>\n<li>There's also the infamous drawing of him having sex with three women. He has used this piece of creepy <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WishFulfillment\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wish Fulfillment</a> as proof that he's straight.</li>\n<li>\"Your trope has been read fully, and your thoughts have been inputed and accepted for better improvement.

Apparently he thinks that their demands contributed to the loss of his most recent \"sweetheart\" on pair with trolls' actions.</li>\n<li>Chris making a YouTube video in which he tells his ex-\"sweetheart\" that she should be his girlfriend <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacePalm\" rel=\"nofollow\">because prostitutes are</a> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wallbanger\" rel=\"nofollow\">too expensive for him</a>. <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic\" rel=\"nofollow\">And no, he isn't deliberately trying to insult her -</a> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot\" rel=\"nofollow\">he actually thinks that this \"revelation\" will make her pity him and that she'll agree to be his girlfriend.</a></li>\n<li>Even before Chris uploaded ShecameforCWC.JPG to ED, there was his reaction to the fact someone else won <i><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParappaTheRapper\" rel=\"nofollow\">Parappa The Rapper</a></i>-themed contest he participated in: he <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PSN_Blogs#4_August_2007_—_Adam_Stackhouse!!!\" title=\"PSN Blogs\">insulted and wished death upon the winner and other people that got more votes</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_is_Angry\" title=\"CWC is Angry\">filmed himself shooting a photo of the winner with a toy pistol</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PaRappa_the_Rapper_contest#Aftermath\" title=\"PaRappa the Rapper contest\">created a fake webpage showing him as the \"true\" winner and openly admitted in an e-mail to Sony that he wanted to win the contest because he thought Megan would have sex with him then.</a></li>\n<li>The nude photos. Then the tape of him with his blow-up doll.</li>\n<li>He also put Sonichu's comic on his resume. The saddest part? It forms 80% of his entire resume <i>and</i> he is very demanding about which companies would be allowed to use his makeshift franchise and which products he expects to be made out of it.</li>\n<li>Chris using the word \"Jew\" as an insult to finish the conversation while secretly recording it, then <a href=\"/cwcki/Michael_Snyder_is_ColdHearted_and_Mean\" title=\"Michael Snyder is ColdHearted and Mean\">releasing the audio recording of the event</a>, then <a href=\"/cwcki/File:AskMichaelSnyder.jpg\" title=\"File:AskMichaelSnyder.jpg\">ordering the fans he thinks he has to troll Michael Snyder</a>, and then <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiggingYourselfDeeper\" rel=\"nofollow\">revealing in a comment to</a> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWq4pB_Vikw\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vivian's video</a> that \"I gave him the finger as I left for real (...) right before the final insult\". And he apparently thinks it was funny.\n<ul><li>Although it was something of an accomplishment for Chris that he actually did realize that the video was intended to make fun of him.</li></ul></li>\n<li>Creation of <a href=\"/cwcki/Damien_Antaria_(CWCipedia_page)\" title=\"Damien Antaria (CWCipedia page)\">the CWCipedia article about \"The Wallflower\"</a>, as well as pretty much all Christian's actions described in said article. He stated that trolls discovering her identity was <i>her</i> fault because \"<a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallBanger\" rel=\"nofollow\">SHE HAD TO HAVE A Facebook Page with her REAL NAME and LINKS to her FanFictions on it</a>\", and of course he isn't even remotely to blame for anything. While he was at it, he also once again proved his racism (\"the Trolls HAD to stick their n***** noses into my affair\"). He expected <i>her</i> to apologize <i>to him</i> for cutting off contact with him (<a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode\" rel=\"nofollow\">surprisingly</a>, she didn't do that). And he finished his article about her with the following statement: \"<a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacePalm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Now she'll have to live the rest of her life with the recurring memory of hurting me like she did. Got-Dang Asexual Woman!</a>\"</li></ul></li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidNotDoTheResearch\" rel=\"nofollow\">Did Not Do The Research</a>: <i>A Girl who Brought Down the World</i> accurately portrays Chris as the homophobe he is. However, he is equally fearful of lesbians and homosexual men, despite it being common knowledge that IRL Chris respects the gay population-the female half, to be precise.\n<ul><li>At time the fic was written he liked lesbians, but <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cbx8CBbUsnU\" rel=\"nofollow\">that might not be the case anymore</a> (1:01-ish, if you don't want to expose yourself to too much ear rape).</li>\n<li>Also, Chris has no idea how copyright works; he seems to think that a character is automatically copyrighted the minute you create him, and that mashing together two existing properties makes something legally original. Additionally, he appears to believe that simply drawing a (c) next to the name qualifies them as legal copyrights.\n<ul><li>Though he has <i><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity\" rel=\"nofollow\">legally copyrighted Sonichu</a></i>. <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?Search_Arg=Sonichu&amp;Search_Code=TALL&amp;PID=8CvxbO0K6jQW0cyX7XU19mX&amp;SEQ=20100105230829=25&amp;HIST=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Seriously, look.</a>\n<ul><li>No, actually not. To be technical, he has merely registered when he came up with the \"idea\". A registering is only handy for proving that you were there first, should the case end up in a court, and they are therefore pretty cheap to acquire and is generally quickly handed out without much of a preview process. But it does not give you a full copyright, which is a longer, more complicated and expensive process.</li></ul></li></ul></li>\n<li>He also doesn't seem to know that <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAnimalsAreDogs\" rel=\"nofollow\">you can't take hermit crabs for a walk</a>.</li>\n<li>More recently, he is very tenacious about his belief that autism and <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AspergerSyndrome\" rel=\"nofollow\">Asperger Syndrome</a> are nothing alike, and has received several emails from people trying to convince him otherwise, to the point where he's been forced to open a new mailbag section for these emails. The sad thing is, he's started answering these emails with a generic reply <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyJustDidntCare\" rel=\"nofollow\">where he basically says he doesn't care,</a> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallBanger\" rel=\"nofollow\">and won't listen anyway.</a>\n<ul><li>He also believes that \"Asperger's\" sounding vaguely like \"Assburgers\" or \"Assboogers\" is a legitimate reason for disparaging it. When a letter writer confronted him about this, Chris's only response was to <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacePalm\" rel=\"nofollow\">make fun of the letter writer's name as well.</a></li></ul></li>\n<li>The best example from his Asperger's vendetta would have to be his proclomation that he \"helped cultivate the first generation of autistic people\". <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoYeah\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yeah.</a></li></ul></li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiggingToChina\" rel=\"nofollow\">Digging To China</a>: Not used in the normal sense, but it is bizzare just how low Chris will go in order to score.</li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiggingYourselfDeeper\" rel=\"nofollow\">Digging Yourself Deeper</a>: Much of what is known about Chris was not gained through hidden cameras or in-depth investigating, but <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooMuchInformation\" rel=\"nofollow\">volunteered by the man himself</a> in what was probably an attempt to get the trolling to stop. In other cases, Chris will casually mention in a chat session something that most reasonable people would keep to themselves. For example: Clyde Cash brought up pictures of Chris wearing his mother's undergarments (which only existed due to blackmail), and Chris responded by revealing his severe incontinence. Strangely, Chris doesn't seem at all embarrassed by this, and only gets upset after direct insults.</li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeMen\" rel=\"nofollow\">Does Not Like Men</a>: Chris hates the entire male population for stealing all the women; excluding himself, his father and <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeorgeWBush\" rel=\"nofollow\">George W. Bush</a>, or as he likes to put it, 0,000000000004% of the male population (4% times 10 to the power of -12). Given the present population of the Earth, such a percentage would equal significantly less than one complete person.\n<ul><li>This makes his homophobia quite ironic, because, logically, if every man but him, his father, and Dubya were gay, he wouldn't have to worry about women already having boyfriends.</li></ul></li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeSpam\" rel=\"nofollow\">Does Not Like Pickles</a>: Chris vehemently dislikes pickles because they remind him of <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudWasRight\" rel=\"nofollow\">a certain male body part</a>. This hatred is incorporated into the comics, serving as a <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness\" rel=\"nofollow\">Weaksauce Weakness</a> for Sonichu and a <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton\" rel=\"nofollow\">Berserk Button</a> for Rosechu.\n<ul><li>This is also because one of the more famous trolls is simply known as \"The man in the pickle suit\". Ever since he popped up, pickle hatred has run rampant!</li>\n<li>This actually stems from when he was first discovered by a certain imageboard. They originally were just mocking his art, and a troll decided to pretend to do some \"fan art\" of Sonichu and mail it to Chris out of \"admiration.\" Most importantly was a picture of Rosechu depicted with a penis, which Chris strongly objected to. However, Chris for some reason has an aversion to that word, and absolutely refuses to use it, or any other common phrases to refer to the penis. He instead refers to his own as his \"duck\" (no, that is not a typo), and refers to others as \"pickles.\" When he saw the picture of Rosechu with a penis, he <b>freaked the fuck out,</b> and demanded that the troll, who Chris honestly still believed was a fan at this point, that he draw Rosechu again without a \"freakin pickle!\" The troll responded by sending a picture of Rosechu holding a <i>literal</i> pickle in her hand. Chris was not amused in the slightest, and the rest is history.</li></ul></li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotUnderstandSarcasm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Does Not Understand Sarcasm</a>: Chris has a remarkable inability to tell when he's being insulted; any insult that's not outright calling him a name tends to fly right over his head. Some outstanding examples are his edits to <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EncyclopediaDramatica\" rel=\"nofollow\">Encyclopedia Dramatica</a> and CWCki where the facts that the doesn't edit are obviously sarcastic insults, proudly showing off his letter that was printed in Nintendo Power despite it almost certainly having been posted for people to laugh at, and his Screwattack Europe interview, with Guru Larry dropping lines like \"Yes, you are indeed a role model to us heterosexuals\" or \"Yes, I often get people confused with fictional characters\" while Chris just stares blankly.\n<ul><li>This may be due to his autism more than anything else, leaving him incapable of detecting sarcasm and instead taking everything he hears at face value. Hilariously, this extends to the newly opened mailbag section on CWCpedia where Chris answers reader mail, although he has a separate section for \"hatemail\" or otherwise disruptive messages that he still refuses to ignore, and even answers some of them as sincerely as he can (including advice for buying sex toys).\n<ul><li>Of course, he now just deletes the mails he doesn't like, <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite\" rel=\"nofollow\">and then claims that he is better than Alec and others because he doesn't censor mail</a>.\n<ul><li>Or <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_50\" title=\"Mailbag 50\">makes up his own \"mailbag\"</a> by publishing some posts from Sonichu <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll\" rel=\"nofollow\">fan</a> forum (that, in his opinion, praise him) rather than answering actual emails. Obviously, he fails to realize that these posts also actually mock him.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard\" rel=\"nofollow\">Double Standard</a>: Alec points out Chris' double standard in him hating gay people because of an incident (that he may have been lying about) when he himself does lots of creepy, hateful things which by his logic should put people off straight and/or autistic people. Also, he states that the Bible tells people to shun gay people, even though it also condemns magic, which Chris (believes to) use all the time.\n<ul><li>There's also <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_54\" title=\"Mailbag 54\">a mailbag message</a> where a reader calls him out on his homophobia by explaining how much he hates autistic people for the way they speak awkwardly and how their minds can't function properly to illustrate a <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard\" rel=\"nofollow\">Double Standard</a>. Par for the course, Chris <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompletelyMissingThePoint\" rel=\"nofollow\">completely misses the point</a> by explaining that he himself <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies\" rel=\"nofollow\">has no trouble speaking or thinking clearly</a>, and calls the poster <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite\" rel=\"nofollow\">an ignorant bigot</a>.</li></ul></li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants\" rel=\"nofollow\">Draco In Leather Pants</a>: Mary Lee Walsh is portrayed in trollfics as a beautiful, benevolent woman intent on destroying the <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wretched Hive</a> / <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeoplesRepublicOfTyranny\" rel=\"nofollow\">People's Republic Of Tyranny</a> that is CWCville. The real Mrs. Walsh isn't particularly glamorous, but she seems to be a pretty good college dean.\n<ul><li>Her <i>Sonichu Finale</i> portrayal mixes this with a good helping of <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dark Is Not Evil</a>. Finale!Mary has a mischievous streak in her as well as a <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI\" rel=\"nofollow\">god complex</a> (that is neither particularly illogical given her power nor anywhere near as massive as Chris-chan's in <i>Sonichu</i> proper), and yet she is still a very compassionate woman who <font color=\"#FFFFFF\">cannot even bring herself to kill Chris when she has the chance.</font>\n<ul><li><font color=\"#FFFFFF\">Doesn't help that it was Christopher asking her to kill him. Christopher is a semi-decent person trapped in the body of a stark-raving mad godmanchild, only able to get out during brief moments of lucidity. She wouldn't be killing Christian with her bare hands, she'd be killing Christopher</font>.</li></ul></li>\n<li>Kacey's dad. Disgustingly homophobic, but he sure puts Chris in his place, and... and that <i>voice</i>!</li></ul></li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamingOfThingsToCome\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dreaming Of Things To Come</a>: According to Chris, \"it was fortold [sic] unto me in multiple dreams\" that he would one day be the father of Crystal Weston Chandler, lending divine credence to his Love Quest. He has also been told by GodJesus that several of his internet girlfriends were the future mother of Crystal, which caused him to look like even more of an ass when they revealed themselves as (mostly male) trolls.\n<ul><li>That also could mean that even Jesus is trolling him.</li></ul></li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide\" rel=\"nofollow\">Driven To Suicide</a>: The trolls use this card quite a bit. First off, Ryan Cash's <strike>fake</strike> suicide over Chris threatening to stop making comics was Clyde Cash's motivation for becoming head of <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Miscreants</a> and trolling Chris. After months of trolling did little to affect his target, Clyde followed in his little brother's footsteps and <strike>pretended to have</strike> shot himself in the head. <sup>* Really, one of the other trolls, Ching Chong, thought that Clyde had <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment\" rel=\"nofollow\">derailed</a> his persona somewhat when he started claiming that he really wanted to help Chris and suggested that Clyde killing himself would be the best course of action.</sup> After <i>that</i>, Chris would later hear that Ivy had killed herself after he broke up with her when he found out she wasn't real.

He hates gay men because they're gay; he hates straight men (except his dad) because they're straight and take away boyfriend-free girls; he hates asexuals for reasons currently unknown; and he loves lesbians, because they're gay and take otherwise single girls. His hypocrisy is an endless void filled just as infinitely with flawed logic, and he may never understand.\n<ul><li>Also, in a mailbag where it was pointed out that logically the more gay men there were mean't there would be more single women around, Chris replied that it would make no difference to him.

He doesn't think of cartoons and the like as a storytelling medium; he is convinced that all of them, <i>including his own work</i>, exists in a <i><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoFramedRogerRabbit\" rel=\"nofollow\">Who Framed Roger Rabbit</a></i>-esque Toonland, coexistant to physical reality. This is why he gets so enraged at people who write Sonichu \"fanfic\" and whatnot, because he perceives this as <i>altering reality</i>. Why is this nightmare fuel? Well, hell, just think about it from his perspective: CWC lives in a world where not just he but <i>anyone</i> can change the consensus reality <i>with the mere power of thought and words</i>.

He later sent a complaint to the company about contest participants he thought had violated the rules, saying \"It's not a matter of jealousy or loss; it's the principal of rule violations. Justice will be done to the seven people involved in the four violating videos...\" The astounding thing is not so much his hypocrisy as the sheer off-handedness with which he admits to cheating immediately after whining about how the contest winner broke the rules, as if he has no clue how such behavior <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss\" rel=\"nofollow\">makes him look</a>.\n<ul><li>Furthermore, he is outraged when people steal his characters.

It's possible that at least part of this is due to the <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brutal Honesty</a> mentioned above; it's the clash between Chris's desire to suck up to his fans and his complete inability to control what comes out of his mouth). In fact, let's just say this: When Chris extols the virtues of Truth and Honesty, it's <i>his version of the truth</i> and <i>what he honestly hopes the other guy will believe.</i>\n<ul><li>Similarly, he brings up how Michael Snyder is a Jewish name, brings up how he doesn't have anything against Jews (which, given that he brought up the subject in the first place, is suspect), then ends the video using \"Jew\" as an insult like he was <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SouthPark\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eric Cartman</a>.</li></ul></li>\n<li>The Mailbag feature on his website is a goldmine for Chris' golden nuggets of hypocrisy, as trolls feed him constantly with messages asking for advice, which Chris is more than happy to dispense but never actually take into consideration himself. He frequently lambasts the posters for being immature and telling them to grow up (when he himself <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild\" rel=\"nofollow\">still lives with his parents, spends all of his money on toys and video games and acts like an angry five-year-old when he can't get his way</a>), get a job (while he has only managed to hold a job for two months of his entire life) and stop using his characters without his permission (but he will not hesitate to copy \"fan\"-characters and change them<sup>* i.e. remove any personality they may have had</sup> without bothering to ask first, and will stubbornly claim that the character was his all along when someone calls him out on it, even if that someone is the creator of that character) and slandering him (whereas he is quite content with drawing cartoonish, demonized versions of the people who antagonize him, on the internet as well as real life, and then drawing himself <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution\" rel=\"nofollow\">ruining their lives and/or killing them brutally</a>).\n<ul><li>As an added bonus, the reason why he thinks he has so much power over Sonichu fan-characters is because he has a <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidNotDoTheResearch\" rel=\"nofollow\">Copyright</a> for Sonichu. So that means <i>his</i> mashup is perfectly acceptable in the face of two giant corporations, while nobody but him is allowed to do anything <i>Sonichu</i>-related if he doesn't approve of it.</li></ul></li>\n<li>Chris called <i>Asperchu</i> \"Vulgar Fanfiction\", despite he himself writing a series that takes place in some combination universe of Pokemon and Sonic, with various characters having sex and talking dirty.</li>\n<li><a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://archive.sonichu.com/cwcipedia/index.php?title=Image:SchuComic10P98.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://archive.sonichu.com/cwcipedia/index.php?title=Image:SchuComic10P98.jpg</a> This \"ad.\" (Hotlinking redirected to a virus, copy-paste the address) Yes, that's a <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz\" rel=\"nofollow\">Captain Ersatz</a>.

Chris doesn't use ersatzen because he thinks he's being original rather than knowing he's basing things on other things as a tribute.\n<ul><li>Then how about Chris using not a <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz\" rel=\"nofollow\">Captain Ersatz</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/File:Bugsbunny.jpg\" title=\"File:Bugsbunny.jpg\">but the Bugs Bunny himself</a> to condemn <strike>a troll pretending to be</strike> Jimmy Hill for \"stealing\" <i>Sonichu</i>?</li></ul></li></ul></li>\n<li>Christian expects women to accept the fact that he's autistic and love him anyway... but at the same time <a href=\"/cwcki/File:IwouldntfeelcomfortableMySpace.jpg\" title=\"File:IwouldntfeelcomfortableMySpace.jpg\">he made it clear that he wouldn't be interested in dating autistic women</a>. He even noted: \"Although I, myself, am High-Functionally Autistic, but that's beside the point\", with no hint of him realizing his hypocrisy.\n<ul><li>He doesn't want a girlfriend, he wants a beautiful and obedient <strike>sex slave</strike> <strike><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudWasRight\" rel=\"nofollow\">mother</a></strike> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick\" rel=\"nofollow\">sex slave and mother combined</a>.</li>\n<li>In fact, the whole subject of Christian's attitude towards other people with autism/Asperger syndrome/physical deformities etc. is a goldmine of his hypocrisy. Chris uses his autism as a crutch and feels it entitles him to being a recipient of everyone's pity and admiration; at the same time, he gladly admits that he doesn't like to associate with other people with autism, especially people with low-functioning autism, because \"<a href=\"/cwcki/IRC_(17_December_2008)\" title=\"IRC (17 December 2008)\">it would be like looking through a window to hell to me</a>\", which is why he doesn't want to volunteer to help them.

He also <a href=\"/cwcki/Michael_Snyder_is_ColdHearted_and_Mean#Description\" title=\"Michael Snyder is ColdHearted and Mean\">asks his \"TRUE and LOYAL fanbase\" to troll people he doesn't like</a>.</li></ul></li></ul>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"prettytable collapsible collapsed\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<th>Tropes found in Trolling, Trollfics, and RealLife: I-P\n</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<ul><li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowMortalKombat\" rel=\"nofollow\">I Know Mortal Kombat</a>: You could call <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXMP1XmD-cg\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> a pretty spectacular aversion.

However, it gets harder and harder to feel sorry for him the more you read about him.\n<ul><li>Chris <i>wants</i> to be <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Woobie</a>, (in fact, he seems to think the best way to get a girlfriend is to get women to date him out of pity) but it <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Understatement\" rel=\"nofollow\">doesn't quite work.</a> In fact, one reason the CWCki seems to exist is to make sure that no one is fooled by Chris's \"poor me\" act by presenting and preserving all his abhorrent behavior.</li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bob</a> could also qualify as a <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassWoobie\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jerkass Woobie</a>. A redneck racist and homophobic (he grew up before the Civil Rights Movement, unlike Chris), two of his children want nothing to do with him, the youngest refuses to move out or do anything at all to better himself, and he's stuck in a bad marriage with the youngest's mother. Not to mention that he has to put up with trolling <i>and</i> being plastered over the internet by his idiot son. He seems to be genuinely lonely as well, based on his interactions with trolls.\n<ul><li>Although given what we know about both Bob and <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteSheep\" rel=\"nofollow\">one of his sons</a>, it's likely that the kids are perfectly justified in wanting nothing to do with the sod.</li></ul></li></ul></li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifyingEdit\" rel=\"nofollow\">Justifying Edit</a>: The CWCki will often have sections of pages that will try to explain the contents of the article. For example, they say that Chris's incredibly hypocritical look at the Bible is probably due to his priest (the only authority he acknowledges) being incredibly liberal when it comes to alternate interpretations.</li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kayfabe</a>: For example, <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BillyMays\" rel=\"nofollow\">Billy Mays</a> from PVCC is <strike>not</strike> dead and was <strike>not</strike> replaced by Anthony Sullivan, Ryan and Clyde Cash did <strike>not</strike> kill themselves, Liquid Chris is <strike>an impostor</strike> the TRUE and HONEST Christian Weston Chandler, and Solid Chris is <strike>Christian Weston Chandler</strike> an impostor called Ian Brandon <strike>Anderson</strike> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag\" rel=\"nofollow\">Something</a>.</li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kick The Dog</a>: Chris does this on a regular basis.\n<ul><li>A prime example is poor sonichuizcool, a young, mentally retarded girl who was almost certainly the only genuine fan Chris ever had. He, <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail\" rel=\"nofollow\">of course</a>, mocked her and her disabilities until she went away because he decided, without anything vaguely resembling evidence, that she was a troll. This was before Chris was heavily targeted by actual trolls, so you can't even chalk it up to paranoia.</li></ul></li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidsAreCruel\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kids Are Cruel</a>: Even when he deserved it, one does have to admit that what BlueSpike (13 years) did with Chris (Playing with him, making him do disgusting/humiliating things, including breaking his medallion and <i><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssShove\" rel=\"nofollow\">shoving the pieces up his own ass</a></i>) was cruel. He also seemed to enjoy torturing him.\n<ul><li>And voluntarily spending hours listening to Chris masturbating. It's probably safe to say that he's <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild\" rel=\"nofollow\">got a few screws loose</a> himself.</li></ul></li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kill Em All</a>: What seems to be going on in season 2... which is shaping up to be WAY better than season 1!</li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnifeNut\" rel=\"nofollow\">Knife Nut</a>: Chris somehow managed to obtain a knife. Judging by the fact that in a short period of time he threatened <a href=\"/cwcki/Don%27t_Mess_With_Me\" title=\"Don't Mess With Me\">Clyde Cash</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Tito_Got_No_Luck_Against_We_Brits,_Irish_and_Scots!\" title=\"Tito Got No Luck Against We Brits, Irish and Scots!\">some other troll</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_Blog#14_March_2010\" title=\"CWC Blog\">and the editors of CWCki</a> with it, having a knife makes him feel powerful and he thinks it will solve all his problems. <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode\" rel=\"nofollow\">This of course doesn't make him look creepy and mentally unbalanced at all.</a>\n<ul><li>It makes him look like future Prison or Mental Asylum material if he doesn't puts an end to it.</li>\n<li>You have to wonder just how dangerous a 2-inch penknife really is in the hands of someone who takes <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongFightingAnimation\" rel=\"nofollow\">at least 5 seconds to pull it out and open it with both hands</a>. <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail\" rel=\"nofollow\">When he manages to open it at all</a>.</li></ul></li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar\" rel=\"nofollow\">Knight Templar</a>: Subverted. He tries to make himself look like one, but it's clear that the only thing fuelling his self-righteousness is ego.</li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowNothingKnowItAll\" rel=\"nofollow\">Know Nothing Know It All</a>: Chris repeatedly proves that he knows nothing about relationships, sex, parenting, copyright, drawing and several other subjects. That of course doesn't stop him from considering himself the greatest expert ever on these subjects and offering advice on them to <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll\" rel=\"nofollow\">fans</a>.</li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lack Of Empathy</a>: Chris is a terrifying combination of Autism, which makes it difficult for him to understand when and how to be empathetic, Narcissism which makes him incredibly self centered and a child-like naïvete which makes him simply unaware of what other people consider traumatic. When he <i>comforts</i> people he usually says \"move on\" or starts talking about how his dog died. To provide a particularly grisly example, <a href=\"/cwcki/Twitter#02_March_2010\" title=\"Twitter\">when he tweeted about his father's hospitalization</a> as a result of congested heart failure, his main concern was apparently his own level of stress, thanks to only getting four hours of sleep. His <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom\" rel=\"nofollow\">fanbase</a> had to wait more than two months until Chris finally decided to <a href=\"/cwcki/Some_Favored_Comedians\" title=\"Some Favored Comedians\">briefly mention</a> that his father recovered... even though in the meantime he posted a few tweets and blog entries, as well as several new videos, raging or ranting on various subjects mostly related to himself, but not even mentioning what was happening to his father. Bob is in his eighties and has had four heart attacks; his hospitalization isn't something that should be taken so lightly.\n<ul><li>To be fair, his father isn't the most likable person there is; it's not a very good <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse\" rel=\"nofollow\">Freudian Excuse</a> but neither are great people. Bob's only popular becuase he antagonizes Chris.</li>\n<li>Let's face it, at this point, it's likely that it's finally impossible for Chris to even understand <i>humanity or basic emotion</i>.</li></ul></li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LarynxDissonance\" rel=\"nofollow\">Larynx Dissonance</a>: Mary Lee Walsh in <i>Sonichu: The Animated Series</i>. By her second appearance, she has a very <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVentureBrothers\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dr. Girlfriend-esque</a> voice, despite the fact that every other female character is voiced by either an actual girl or someone at least trying to attempt a girl's voice.</li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLeisureSuitLarry\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Leisure Suit Larry</a>: Chris has elements of this: He's been dedicated to his <i>Love Quest</i> for years now, but his methods have been <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Understatement\" rel=\"nofollow\">modestly questionable</a> (he used to loiter around shopping malls drawing comics and playing with his <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoDS\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nintendo DS</a>, hoping a Boyfriend-Free Girl would eventually notice him). In fact, the only reason the <i>Sonichu</i> comic exists in the first place is so that Chris would have at least one significant accomplishment with which to impress potential mates.</li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legacy Character</a>: Many trolls adopt the persona of the Man in the Pickle Suit, a shadowy and nefarious figure whom Chris believes masterminds the trolling efforts.</li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedWardrobe\" rel=\"nofollow\">Limited Wardrobe</a>: Just like his comic character, he tends to wear the same style of shirts over and over again. A line in the comic about how he couldn't even imagine himself in the lead of a story he was reading unless he looked at himself in the mirror to remember his appearance seems to indicate why he wants his appearance to be as static as possible (and perhaps why he can't see himself as being overweight).</li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMinded\" rel=\"nofollow\">Literal Minded</a>: Due to combination of his autism, unwillingness to learn <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Understatement\" rel=\"nofollow\">and just not being very smart in general</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_English#Semantics\" title=\"Chris and English\">Chris tends to interpret figurative speech literally</a>.</li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters\" rel=\"nofollow\">Loads And Loads Of Characters</a>: Between Chris, his immediate family, his extended family, his gal-pals, his \"sweethearts\", and his trolls, there are easily over 40 people to keep track of.</li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb\" rel=\"nofollow\">Logic Bomb</a>: At one point during <i>A Girl who Brought Down the World</i>, the <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar\" rel=\"nofollow\">Author Avatar</a> must stop Chris from having sex with her. She does this by telling him that he can have sex with her, but only if it's a threesome with another man. Cue Chris leaving the room in confusion.</li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveAtFirstSight\" rel=\"nofollow\">Love At First Sight</a>: Basically every single couple in the comic, while Chandler himself is a big proponent of this as well, falling in love with pretty much any female he has extended contact with, and on one occasion actually <i>proposing</i> to a woman he had never actually met. He seems to think he'll marry the first woman he has a successful date with.</li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouCrazy\" rel=\"nofollow\">Love Makes You Crazy</a>: On the silly end of the spectrum is Chris making videos for his girlfriend's pet hermit crabs and hopping around like the Easter bunny. On the scary end of the spectrum are videos like <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBUzZowEt1E\" rel=\"nofollow\">For My Sweetest Ivy</a>. All for the same girl, incidentally, who made Chris <i>particularly</i> strange.</li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle\" rel=\"nofollow\">Love Triangle</a>: First there was Chris/Blanca Weiss/Sarah Jackson triangle, which ended when Sarah died in a car crash (don't worry, Chris moved on). Later there were Chris/PandaHalo/<strike>BlueSpike</strike>Julie (<a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues\" rel=\"nofollow\">hilarity ensued</a> when Panda and Julie \"<a href=\"/cwcki/IRC_(04_January_2009)\" title=\"IRC (04 January 2009)\">found out</a>\" that Chris was a two-timer) and Chris/PandaHalo/Clyde Cash (who <a href=\"/cwcki/IRC_(21_January_2009)\" title=\"IRC (21 January 2009)\">hinted</a> that he wouldn't mind turning this into an OT3) triangles, which ended when <strike>Panda died in a bushfire</strike> Chris convinced himself that Panda died in a bushfire (don't worry, Chris moved on). And later there was Solid Chris/Kacey/Liquid Chris triangle, which ended with Kacey dumping Solid Chris and marrying Liquid (don't worry, at the same time Solid managed to \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Red_Letter_CWC_Certified_Day\" title=\"Red Letter CWC Certified Day\">copyright</a>\" <i>Sonichu</i>, which was enough for him to <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag\" rel=\"nofollow\">move on</a>).\n<ul><li>He moved on before that. He practically said Liquid could have Kacey as long as Solid was acknowledged as being the real Christian Weston Chandler.</li>\n<li>The Ivy Saga wasn't free of these either. Even though Ivy was the recipient of <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel\" rel=\"nofollow\">particularly memorable</a> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouCrazy\" rel=\"nofollow\">displays of Chris' affection</a>, said affection did't stop Chris from cybering with <strike>a troll</strike> Vanessa Hudgens.</li>\n<li>Christian's videos from mid-March 2010 are somewhat incoherent, but it looks like he is convinced that a mysterious troll nicknamed Surfshack Tito \"stole\" his latest \"sweetheart\" from him. <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse\" rel=\"nofollow\">And for that reason Chris wants to murder him.</a></li></ul></li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyingCreator\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lying Creator</a>: \"Original characters\" my ass.\n<ul><li>One hilarious one that could have easily been averted was accusations that Rosechu was male because she lacks the shortened tail female Raichus have in the 4th Generation Pokemon games. How? By initially explaining how Rosechu was created prior to the 4th generation games. Instead, he edits a portion of his comic to show Rosechu having a blunted tail like 4th Generation female Raichus, and claims it's been this way the entire time. Even if he did edit the source as well, there's still countless things he's drawn with Rosechu that do not have a blunted tail. Because he follows this logic, trolls now acknowledge that Rosechu was always <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transvestite\" rel=\"nofollow\">male</a>.\n<ul><li>In <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_49#Revisionist_history\" title=\"Mailbag 49\">Mailbag 49</a> someone actually pointed out to Chris that he could handle the issue by stating that Rosechu was created before there were gender differences in Pokémon games. <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SureWhyNot\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chris agreed</a>... and then once again claimed that he never drew Raichu with pointed tail.</li></ul></li>\n<li>For a better list on how much he lies, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Lies\" title=\"Lies\">check here.</a></li></ul></li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild\" rel=\"nofollow\">Man Child</a>: Chris is pretty much the dictionary definition of this trope, with a hint of <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild\" rel=\"nofollow\">Psychopathic Manchild</a>: Both his family and his welfare check have allowed him to live as a child eternally, playing <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGames/Pokemon\" rel=\"nofollow\">children's card games</a>, filling his bedroom with toys, spending all his disposable income (<a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_money\" title=\"Chris and money\">and more!</a>) on games and exhibiting the <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_art\" title=\"Chris and art\">artistic abilities</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_anger\" title=\"Chris and anger\">social skills</a> of a 6-year-old.</li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassHypnosis\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mass Hypnosis</a>: In response to an increasing number of <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll\" rel=\"nofollow\">fans</a> who claimed that they won't read <i>Sonichu</i> anymore and that <i><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Asperchu\" rel=\"nofollow\">Asperchu</a></i> is better, Chris released <a href=\"/cwcki/U8C43P2A37A8_y_U8C1N023V0L\" title=\"U8C43P2A37A8 y U8C1N023V0L\">this video</a>.</li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MathematiciansAnswer\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mathematician's Answer</a>: In one of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_28\" title=\"Mailbag 28\">Mailbags:</a></li></ul>\n<dl><dd><dl><dd><b>kaybear@mail.com:</b> You're almost 28.

Yes, he's that cold and self-centered even with his own <i>flesh and blood</i>.</li>\n<li>How about Chris responding to the death of a <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll\" rel=\"nofollow\">fan</a> with a copied-and-pasted message about how \"[their] letter has been read fully, and [their] thoughts have been inputed and accepted for better improvement\"?\n<ul><li>To be fair, the whole thing was blatantly fake.\n<ul><li>Christian thought it was real, though.</li></ul></li></ul></li>\n<li>Don't forget how Christian Chandler attempted to run over a Mall guard with <strike>his</strike> his mother's car after they kicked him out for soliciting sex.</li>\n<li>If Michael Snyder is telling the truth - <a href=\"/cwcki/6_June_2010\" title=\"6 June 2010\">which, if you read between lines, Chris-Chan himself pretty much confirmed</a> - Chris taking photos of Snyder's daughter and attempting to run him over with a car.

The former does sound plausible, given Chris as a person, though it may not be the whole truth. The latter... not so much.</li>\n<li>He shows no distraught over the death of his own father.

Megan, who by all accounts, by even the most jaded trolls, was an absolute saint for wanting to be friends with Chris, continuing to hang out with him even after he endlessly tried to touch her, was convinced they were dating when she made it <i>emphatically</i> clear that they were not, and in general was just an all round Jerkass to her. Then, after he started getting trolled, in a <i>bizarre</i> move, <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticStupid\" rel=\"nofollow\">somehow expecting doing so would make him \"victorious\"</a> uploaded several self made rule 34 drawings, <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive\" rel=\"nofollow\">including one of Megan</a>.

Early \"fan\" artists assumed she was younger and had blond hair and red horns instead of a yellow helmet. The design just stuck afterward.\n<ul><li>That, and because when the people saw her, they interpreted her golden viking helmet, again, due to Chris' terrible art skills, as her being depicted as having Marylin Monroe like blonde hair, and little she-devil horns. Troll's admiration of her calling Chris out on his bullshit, one of the few people who don't know him from the internet, coupled with the crude representation of her in the comics led to them interpreting her as a <a href=\"/cwcki/File:Sonichu_Finale_2_Page_23_by_Plombard.jpg\" title=\"File:Sonichu Finale 2 Page 23 by Plombard.jpg\">sexy blonde she devil who trolls Chris IRL</a>.</li></ul></li></ul></li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexIsCool\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sex Is Cool</a>: This seems to be a central part of Christian's world view. He apparently thinks that because he is obsessed with his \"Love Quest\" and wants to have sex so badly, everyone else should want it as well, and he's unwilling or unable to comprehend that someone <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelibateHero\" rel=\"nofollow\">might not be involved in romantic and/or sexual relationship out of choice</a> and perhaps even <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Asexuality\" rel=\"nofollow\">might not be interested in romance and sex at all</a>. This belief also shows up in his comic, as he finds it necessary to pair his Sonic recolors up and refuses to break them up (because they simply can't be happy if they aren't in relationships), makes <strike>Mary Lee Walsh</strike> Slaweel Ryam say that she became evil because she was never loved and eradicates asexuality in <i>Sonichu 10</i>.</li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShlubbAndKlumpEnglish\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shlubb And Klump English</a>: Chris tends to misuse words and phrases that aren't even in common usage in modern English (phrases like \"I do not care much for\" instead of \"I don't like.\" He even makes up words occasionally (like \"instinctions\" instead of \"distinct instances\"). These made-up words have been dubbed \"<a href=\"/cwcki/CWC-isms\" title=\"CWC-isms\">CWC-isms</a>\" by his <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll\" rel=\"nofollow\">followers</a>.</li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shoutout\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shoutout</a>: <i><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalGearSolid\" rel=\"nofollow\">Metal Gear Solid</a></i> is very popular with CWC trolls, which can be seen in their antics and parodies; shoutouts to the series are so rampant that it warrants its <a href=\"/cwcki/Metal_Gear\" title=\"Metal Gear\">own page</a> on the CWCki. To a lesser extent, <i><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Earthbound\" rel=\"nofollow\">Earthbound</a></i> references (especially of <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel\" rel=\"nofollow\">Giygas</a>) are also common, though mostly only in <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanVid\" rel=\"nofollow\">fanvid</a>s.\n<ul><li>Chris-Chan himself is like a real life version of Porky Minch: Just compare CWCville with New Pork City.

And poor Ivy wasn't mentioned at all. For that matter, neither was Chris' aunt Corrina <i>who died in real life</i>.\n<ul><li>There's also the fact that he doesn't want to kill his Sonic recolors, because <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaydreamBeliever\" rel=\"nofollow\">they are real to him...</a> yet in the comic he gleefully murders (sometimes in a gory way) <i>real people</i> who \"wronged\" him. In fact, Chris in general empathises more with fictional characters than with real people. For example, he was only in a mild disagreement with a troll roleplaying as <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis\" rel=\"nofollow\">Josef</a> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadDoctor\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mengele</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_35#In_which_Chris_almost_figures_it_out\" title=\"Mailbag 35\">who suggested marking the homosexual people and taking them to camps to experiment on them</a>; by contrast, he seemed genuinely disturbed by <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_54#The_continuing_adventures_of_Creepichu_&amp;_Kimmi\" title=\"Mailbag 54\">the other troll's suggestion to include in his comic a character that used to eat baby Sonees (i.e. Sonichus' hatchlings) alive or put them in blenders and drink them</a>.\n<ul><li>And still, even though his Sonic recolors are real, sentient beings for him, and even though he is probably more attached to them than to real people, he killed Simonla just to get his CWCipedia back. Interpret that as you will.</li></ul></li>\n<li>Also, Chris thinks that it's A-OK to show sex and graphic violence in his (allegedly child-friendly) comic, yet censors <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotHeinous\" rel=\"nofollow\">even mild swearing</a>.</li></ul></li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSlacker\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Slacker</a>: At the advice of his father, Chris has declined to seek a job, and instead subsists on his \"monthly tugboat,\" $800 of Social Security funding. Records show that American taxpayers' money have bought Chris a PS3 and <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaughtWithYourPantsDown\" rel=\"nofollow\">literally gone up his ass</a>. He'd fit the trope perfectly were it not for his puritanical views on drugs (although his exposure to drinking may change this).\n<ul><li>Now he claims that he had \"Never been Really Sure on the whole making money thing, or of any other aspirations\"; that he does <i>Sonichu</i> for fun; hates that it's \"being pressured onto me like as if it was a Job\" (read: hates that people try to make him <i>at least update his own webcomic regularly</i>); is \"tired of trying to please MILLIONS\" (because he tried so hard...) and says that fans (or \"fans\", as he put it - apparently he considers only <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lickspittle\" rel=\"nofollow\">those who accept everything he does as perfect</a> to be his TRUE and LOYAL fans) who told him they stopped reading his comic because he failed to update it regularly are \"among the People I am most annoyed with\". In short, apparently he doesn't want to make money off <i>Sonichu</i> anymore, not because he's afraid of Sega and Nintendo, but because he realized that it would require working on his comic regularly.</li></ul></li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo\" rel=\"nofollow\">Small Name Big Ego</a>: Despite there being at most ONE <i>Sonichu</i> fan, Chris has confused the people watching him out of horror for a devoted fanbase, and still entertains dreams of <i>Sonichu</i> video games and merchandise. During the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Miyamoto_Saga\" title=\"Miyamoto Saga\">Miyamoto Saga</a>, Chris believed that the big man of <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nintendo\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nintendo</a> himself wanted to meet with him, and even made a slideshow presentation about a proposed Sonichu game (which turned out to be mostly about Chris and his creations), in which he claimed professional-level drawing skills.\n<ul><li>Even worse, he was certain that Miyamoto would be more honored to meet <i>him</i>.</li>\n<li>Chris's madness has been growing to the point where he seems convinced he can <i>curse people,</i> and has been falling back on \"my Love Quest is a divine mandate!\" more and more. Be afraid.</li>\n<li>Most of Chris's narcissism seems to stem from the few contests he has won during his lifetime, one being a raffle he entered as a child for $1000 worth of Sega games and won by sheer, dumb luck, and another being a GameStop <i><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuitarHero\" rel=\"nofollow\">Guitar Hero</a></i> contest he won after his <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanHaters\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fan Haters</a> voted for him in droves, which lead him to believe that his work had a sizeable fanbase. Ever since then, Chris has been obsessed with success (he threw a massive hissy fit when his high school neglected to reward him for his art skills, and another when he lost a <i><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParappaTheRapper\" rel=\"nofollow\">Parappa The Rapper</a></i>-themed contest and accused the winner of cheating), and frequently appeals to his \"True and Loyal fanbase\" for help against the trolls.</li>\n<li>It's gotten worse: Apparently, Christian has <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_copyright#Copyright_registration\" title=\"Chris and copyright\">applied for a copyright for the name Sonichu</a> with absolutely no thought of the repercussions he could suffer if Nintendo and/or Sega discover his completely unoriginal character. Big Ego indeed. By the way? One fan e-mailed Nintendo.</li>\n<li>Not only that, he seriously believes that <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_Wikipedia\" title=\"Chris and Wikipedia\">he deserves his own article on</a> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOtherWiki\" rel=\"nofollow\">That Other Wiki</a> and believes that his birthday (February 24th) should be a <i>national holiday</i>.</li>\n<li>As it turns out, <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_48\" title=\"Mailbag 48\">he thinks he has \"way over a million fans worldwide\"</a> (perhaps <a href=\"/cwcki/Common_Questions#26_January_2010\" title=\"Common Questions\">even more than a billion of them</a>, though in this case <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritersCannotDoMath\" rel=\"nofollow\">he might not have realized how high the number he typed was</a>).</li>\n<li>Additional proof of both his gargantuan ego and him being completely out of touch with reality: <a href=\"/cwcki/ChrisChanSonichu_and_WikiSysop_correspondence#THAT_DOES_NOT_MATTER_(CCS)\" title=\"ChrisChanSonichu and WikiSysop correspondence\">he thinks he's \"the Mayor of Cwcville, VA, IN REAL LIFE as its Main Creator\"</a>.</li>\n<li>When Chris contacted troll who hacked his PSN accounts, he sent (among others) 17 rather incoherent messages that ended with the phrase: \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Samantha_Thaddeus_E-mails#The_last_straw_7/12/09\" title=\"Samantha Thaddeus E-mails\">thou will only be forgiven truly if thou returns the Accounts thou has stolen from the son of God who truly has Christ in his name and in his heart</a>\" (the \"son of God\" portion referring to <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chris-chan himself</a>). He also threatened the troll that \"God will reign down with a Vengance upon you until you give me back my Japan, Spain, Hong Kong, France and Germany Playstation Network Accounts\".</li>\n<li>Not as spectacular as above examples, but Chris <a href=\"/cwcki/Some_Favored_Comedians\" title=\"Some Favored Comedians\">stated that he'd like Jerry Seinfeld himself to respond to one of his Youtube videos</a>. Apparently he doesn't think it's unlikely that Seinfeld would do that.</li></ul></li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake\" rel=\"nofollow\">Smug Snake</a>: <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowNothingKnowItAll\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chris thinks that he's smarter than everyone else</a>, and frequently tries to use his \"brilliance\" to take advantage of others. In particular, he made several attempts to manipulate people to do something he wanted them to do, forgive him for his misdeeds, agree with him etc. He usually tried to achieve these goals by invoking pity in other people, for example by <a href=\"/cwcki/%22Damian_Antaria%22,_PLEASE,_Don%27t_Leave_Me_-_I_NEED_YOU!!!\" title=\"&quot;Damian Antaria&quot;, PLEASE, Don't Leave Me - I NEED YOU!!!\">bringing up his autism, the fact that he's a virgin,</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_45#Mistakes,_errors,_and_ordeals\" title=\"Mailbag 45\">\"deaths\" of his \"sweetheats\" and constant trolling</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_39#In_which_Chris_describes_a_bad_dream_for_no_reason\" title=\"Mailbag 39\">by describing nightmares he had</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/11052009_Kacey,_I_Love_You,_and_I_Need_You\" title=\"11052009 Kacey, I Love You, and I Need You\">or just by faking sadness</a>. He even tried to make Megan forgive him for creating ShecameforCWC.JPG <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Emails,_2008#Chris_continues_bothering_her_about_ED\" title=\"Megan Emails, 2008\">by telling her that he suffered more that she did</a>. In addition, he lies to achieve his goals (like the time he impersonated Liquid in an attempt to trick Kacey into sleeping with him), makes promises with no intent of keeping them (like promising Kacey that he'll find a job and move out of his parents' house) and tries to weasel his way out of doing things he doesn't want to do (e.g. the whole Simonla saga). He tries to be <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard\" rel=\"nofollow\">Manipulative Bastard</a>, but one small detail prevents him from being one: he is utterly, hopelessly incompetent at manipulating people.\n<ul><li>Ironically, whenever people notices he's attempting to manipulate them, <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutGambitted\" rel=\"nofollow\">they play along and end up manipulating him to do stupid or embarrasing things instead</a>.</li></ul></li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood\" rel=\"nofollow\">So Bad It's Good</a>: Christian's life, from the perspective of his \"fans.\"</li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsHorrible\" rel=\"nofollow\">So Bad It's Horrible</a>: The more you learn about his life, the more it goes from \"funny\" to \"depressing.\"\n<ul><li>A more specific example: <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Christian%27s_sex_joke\" title=\"Christian's sex joke\">Christian's sex joke</a>.</li>\n<li>Chris himself appears to be a rare example of a person who lacks <i>any</i> positive qualities.

For some time, he tried to have it both ways; he stated that he met a new girl and that relationship was progressing, while not revealing her name, and asked everyone to <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_Blog#14_February_2010\" title=\"CWC Blog\">\"leave me with my relationship, and not make me feel intruded by inquiring constantly\"</a>. This, of course, was practically daring trolls to start looking for information about her. Still, while trolls would probably succeed at identifying her anyway, it could have taken months if Chris just shut up... but <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chris being Chris</a>, in March 2010 he revealed one of the pen names used by his \"sweetheart\", thus making it possible for trolls to identify her.\n<ul><li>Of course, most trolls weren't ready to jump on this. They were more interested in seeing how it panned out. Then a random troll points out a link that leads to the CWCki. This resulted not only in her cutting off contact with Chris, but also with Chris having knowledge of CWCki. <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nice Job Breaking It, Anti-Hero</a>.</li></ul></li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeechImpediment\" rel=\"nofollow\">Speech Impediment</a>: His <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth\" rel=\"nofollow\">southern accent</a> notwithstanding, Chris has a notable tendency to slur his speech (for example, pronouncing '<a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EncyclopediaDramatica\" rel=\"nofollow\">Encyclopedia Dramatica</a> page' as 'Encykkapeedya Drammaka Paysh'), drop various letters from words and even switch them around, most likely due to his autism or lack of general verbal contact with other people.

On the 26th of May it happened to the CWCipedia again, forcing Chris to abandon it to the trolls for good. It remains to be seen where he will go from here.\n<ul><li>Probably he will never try to recreate it elsewhere.

The result was <a href=\"/cwcki/THAT_IS_MY_HOUSE\" title=\"THAT IS MY HOUSE\">this infamous video</a>, where Chris pleads his personal army to take down every mirror of the video.

Where did it all go so wrong?\n<ul><li>Y'know, people laugh at this guy and his antics (including this troper) but when one gets down to it, this really is sad. If not for super shitty parents Chris could actually have become a functioning person with autism. Instead we have one more racist, homophobic, arrogant, elitist, jerk-ass in the world who can't even function or learn that it's not okay to be so homo/race-phobic.

He's on record as claiming that he'd do it on the second date if the girl was OK with it.\n<ul><li>Looks like he ultimately decided that he doesn't even want to wait until the second date - <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.okcupid.com/profile/ChrisCSonichu\" rel=\"nofollow\">on his OkCupid profile</a> he stated that he wants to be contacted by women who \"are cool with getting to the bedroom as quickly as right after the First Date\", along with naming his Hook Cafe profile 'direct2sex'.</li></ul></li></ul></li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tomato In The Mirror</a>: The alternate ending to <a class=\"new\" href=\"/w/index.php?title=Fan:CWCVille_1984&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" title=\"Fan:CWCVille 1984 (page does not exist)\">\"Cwcville 1984\"</a> reveals that <font color=\"#FFFFFF\">the narrator was Sonichu all along.</font></li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive\" rel=\"nofollow\">Too Dumb To Live</a>: Chris... or so you'd think, except for the fact that he somehow manages to survive.\n<ul><li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother\" rel=\"nofollow\">An overbearing mother</a> and a \"monthly tugboat\" might have something to do with it.</li></ul></li>\n<li><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooSpicyForYogSothoth\" rel=\"nofollow\">Too Spicy For Yog Sothoth</a>: The #tropers <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MST\" rel=\"nofollow\">MST</a> channel's attempt to take on the comic led to several contributors taking a break from MSTing and the MSTing system being completely revamped.
