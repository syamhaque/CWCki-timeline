Their physical appearance is also a source of much disgust, as it is an overload of conventionally \"cute\" characteristics, done horribly wrong. Chris basically tried too hard to make them cute, and the result is deeply unappealing.\n</p><p>The appearance of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_and_Rosechu%27s_Children\" title=\"Sonichu and Rosechu's Children\">Sonichu and Rosechu's Children</a> in \"<a href=\"/cwcki/A_Sonichu_Day\" title=\"A Sonichu Day\">A Sonichu Day</a>\" is especially revolting, as Chris not only writes their typical awful dialogue but even reads it aloud with an attempt at a cute voice.

According to Chris her so-called \"cuteness\" always gets the awe of her enemies, and when she falls, her skirt acts as a parachute. This last feat is physically impossible, but never mind <i>that</i>, because it offers an <a href=\"/cwcki/Pedofork\" title=\"Pedofork\">opportunity</a> for panty-shots; that is, it would if they had panties, and the fact that they don't only makes it even worse. It is implied that Roseys are born without any clothing, and shoes and skirts are purchased separately. The Rosey form of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bubbles\" title=\"Bubbles\">Bubbles</a>, for instance (see right), was never born with a skirt. The birth of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sandy\" title=\"Sandy\">Sandy</a> appears to confirm this,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-7\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">[7]</a></sup> but as always there are problems with consistency throughout the franchise.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Biologee\">Biologee</span></h2>\n<p>A cursory examination of the birthdates of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_and_Rosechu%27s_Children\" title=\"Sonichu and Rosechu's Children\">Sonichu and Rosechu's Children</a> implies that Rosechus have a gestation period of around three months. This amount of time would, for an intelligent mammal like a Sonichu, be woefully inadequate, even for monotremes, which possibly explains why Sonees and Roseys always appear <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Retarded\" title=\"Retarded\">retarded</a> and half-<a href=\"/cwcki/Yawning_Squirtle\" title=\"Yawning Squirtle\">baked</a>. However, <a href=\"/cwcki/Pok%C3%A9mon\" title=\"Pokémon\">Pokémon</a> eggs hatch quite quickly, but this is simply an in-game mechanic for the sake of playability, and usually are based on steps, depending on the Pokémon breed.\n</p><p>Sonees and Roseys seem to vary a lot in intelligence. As infants, the <a href=\"/cwcki/Chaotic_Combo\" title=\"Chaotic Combo\">Chaotic Combo</a> could only say their own names \"Sonee/Rosey\" (which is supposed to be <a href=\"/cwcki/Things_Chris_has_ripped_off\" title=\"Things Chris has ripped off\">how Pokémon communicate in the anime</a>). Also, the \"original\" Sonee and Rosey can only say \"Goo-Goo,\" suggesting they start with even less intelligence. However, the Sonichu children are capable of speaking in complete (albeit mangled) sentences: Sandy was able to talk right after she was born. This rather gigantic discrepancy in intelligence has been addressed in <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_23\" title=\"Mailbag 23\">Mailbag 23</a> in which Chris states that <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_and_Rosechu%27s_Children\" title=\"Sonichu and Rosechu's Children\">Cerah, Christine and Robbie</a> learned English from their parents and that the Chaotic Combo didn't have English-speaking guardians, which is a flagrant contradiction as <a href=\"/cwcki/Angelica\" title=\"Angelica\">Angelica</a> grew up around <i>human nuns</i>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bubbles\" title=\"Bubbles\">Bubbles</a> started speaking English while trying to rescue her \"mother\", <a href=\"/cwcki/Wild_Sonichu\" title=\"Wild Sonichu\">Wild</a> knew English as a Sonichu without apparently being taught it, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Punchy\" title=\"Punchy\">Punchy</a> was in a dojo among humans, and spoke when Mypoe ripped his tail off, and <a href=\"/cwcki/Magi-Chan\" title=\"Magi-Chan\">Magi-Chan</a> was spoken telepathically in English by Mewtwo. This should also mean that Wild and Bubbles should only speak in \"Venusaur/Scyther\" and \"Swampert\" respectively, and Magi-Chan would possibly be mute. Even if these things weren't patently made up, they don't address why Sandy could speak right after being born. To further confound the situation, <a href=\"/cwcki/Magi-Chan\" title=\"Magi-Chan\">Magi-Chan</a> informs the readers via the customary textwall that Wild had to teach Sandy English <i>after</i> she demonstrated fluency with the language, implying that she didn't know it beforehand.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-8\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">[8]</a></sup> Regardless of this, they are all still of inferior intelligence.\n</p><p>It is also worth noting that Sonees and Roseys do not wear the white gloves that Sonichu and Rosechu wear at all times; acquiring the gloves is likely a rite-of-passage type scenario. Disturbingly, Sonees and Roseys have rounded stumps rather than hands which gives them the appearance of thalidomide babies, but knowing Chris, he probably ripped them off from the creatures from the <i>Sonic</i> games known as Chao. The <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Animal_Crossing\" title=\"Animal Crossing\">Animal Crossing</a></i> designs and a teddy-bear creature from <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Excel_Saga\" title=\"Excel Saga\">Excel Saga</a></i> called \"Puchuu\" may also have substantial influence on the design of Sonees and Roseys. Despite having no opposable thumbs, the mutant baby Pokémon are somehow able to perform tasks that require them with their stubby arms, such as baking cookies and playing <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PSP\" title=\"PSP\">PSPs</a>.\n</p><p>There's also the strong possibility that Sonichu and Rosechu's children are not representative of the typical Sonee &amp; Rosey Poké-type. In <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_10\" title=\"Sonichu 10\"><i>Sonichu</i> #10</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Sandy_Rosechu\" title=\"Sandy Rosechu\">Sandy Rosechu</a> went from hatching from an egg to her mature form and the intellectual skills of a fourth grader inside of a  single week<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-9\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">[9]</a></sup> while <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Punchy\" title=\"Punchy\">Punchy</a> evolved to his full form in a single day, even though he had his tail traumatically amputated. Magi-chan also took about two weeks to transform while meditating. This leaves us to formulate the hypothesis that Sonichu's children are kinda <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Retarded\" title=\"Retarded\">slower than the average</a> to evolve into their adult forms  <s> (so far only <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_11\" title=\"Sonichu 11\">Christine</a> has achieved it]]</s> as all three children have now hatched, taking as long as about ten years to evolve. Another possibility is that Sandy evolved rapidly because <a href=\"/cwcki/Wild_Sonichu\" title=\"Wild Sonichu\">her father</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_10#The_Final_Countdown\" title=\"Sonichu 10\">lavished attention on her</a>, while Cerah, Christine and Robbie are left with <a href=\"/cwcki/Heather_Iglesias\" title=\"Heather Iglesias\">the nanny</a> while their parents are forced to fulfill the wishes of <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler\">a deranged tyrant</a>. Yet another theory is that Sonees and Roseys evolve more rapidly under stressful situations (see <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bubbles\" title=\"Bubbles\">Bubbles</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Punchy\" title=\"Punchy\">Punchy</a>), thereby suggesting <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Wild\" title=\"Wild\">Wild</a>'s attention is a <a href=\"/cwcki/Pedofork\" title=\"Pedofork\">lot less wholesome than the comic would lead you to believe</a>. According to Chris, Angelica supposedly evolves while being happy with a Soothe Bell, despite her comic evolution taking place while asleep one night.\n</p><p>The reasons for their evolution seem to differ, and at differing ages \n</p>\n<ul><li>Angelica randomly evolves one night (unknown age)</li>\n<li>Bubbles evolves diving down to save her 'Mama' (unknown age)</li>\n<li>Cera evolves after \"leveling up\" and defeating a Jerkop (roughly 8-9 years old)</li>\n<li>Christine evolves during the school's Christmas play (roughly 2 years old)</li>\n<li>Magi-Chan evolves while meditating (2 weeks old)</li>\n<li>Punchy evolves after getting his tail ripped off (right after hatching)</li>\n<li>Robee evolves after coming out as trans and being enveloped in a hug by his sisters (about 10 years old)</li>\n<li>Sandy evolves happily playing in Soft Sand (about 1 week old)</li>\n<li>Wild evolves during some exercises (unknown age)</li></ul>\n<p>(Sonichu, Rosechu, and Blake did not experience the same evolution- Blake was genetically created from Sonichu's DNA, Sonichu evolved from a Pikachu being smacked into  Super Sonic, and Rosechu evolved from Raichu being showered in a rainbow from Sonichu's evolution)\n</p><p>While evolution may be some odd form of 'puberty' for this species, they all evolve in their pre-pubescent ages and nowhere near the age a human would start to hit puberty (Christine being only 2 when she evolves into a fully-developed body)\n</p><p>The Sonee/Rosey forms of Sonichu and Rosechu's children are also able to attend elementary school, despite supposedly being just babies.\n</p><p>It is also confusing as to if Sonee and Rosey's are hatched from eggs or live birth. In <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_8#Rage_Against_the_Garbage\" title=\"Sonichu 8\"> Sonichu 8</a>, Rosechu talks about her genitals and how they are used to carry her children until they 'emerge for their glorious birth'- which implies she carried her children to term and did not lay eggs. Her children were also never shown to have hatched and just kind of appeared.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Galleree\">Galleree</span></h2>\n<center>\n<ul class=\"gallery
