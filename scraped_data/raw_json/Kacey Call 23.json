Um. So how have things been for you?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I've been doing fair... I mean, you know, things could be better if I didn't have to worry about the trolls, but...you know...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> What are they doing?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Oh, just trying to get on my nerves... but lately I've been, uh, handling the situation much better. I don't even bother to open their e-mails. So I just expand on the e- on the sender's address and then add them to my block list.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oh, that's good! That's good.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, well, let's see, aside from that, um... Yeah, I've been, I've been, been... I've been pushing myself a little further, jogging a little bit longer.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>coughs</i>] That's good.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> And, uh... And I still haven't heard back from <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Target\" title=\"Target\">Target</a>, so that's probably a no-go, but the other thing is a new CVS in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ruckersville\" title=\"Ruckersville\">Ruckersville</a> and I'll probably apply to that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oh you should!

So, um, how is your <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Copyright\" title=\"Copyright\">copyright</a> coming?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Oh... Yeah, I have, I've called the copyright office and I, uh, I got back access to my account and, ah, it's all good. The copyright is mine.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oh! Well that... that's awesome.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I mean, like, yeah, I read somethin' on the internet about this, ah, about this image that, uh, Gregg May-, uh, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Gregg_Mays\" title=\"Gregg Mays\">Gregg Mays</a> slash <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">Clyde Cash</a>, you know, that like, he, uh, it's about like, this, uh, this image about like, supposedly about him having the copyright, but that document is false. I think-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>interrupting, talking right over Chris the whole time which he doesn't even seem to notice</i>] Well, yeah, because obviously you have the papers now, right?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I don't have the papers yet, I-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>interrupting</i>] Well then how do you know it's yours?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>pause</i>] Beca-, because I called the copyright office and t-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>interrupting</i>] Well, it's not going to help until you actually have the papers. You need proof. It's like saying you have a diploma but you <i>don't</i> have a diploma with you. I mean, you're gonna have to get those papers.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I mean, I know, I won't get the, uh, document for... for a few more weeks.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> They should send them right away.

So, I was like, you know, I didn't ar-, argue. I didn't want to argue with them. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, I mean, this troll could do a lot of damage, you need to rush it. I mean, I've seen these things take months, really, but... I mean, if you say so.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. Don't worry about it. It's--, don't worry about that. It's a-, it's all good. I'm still working on the comic pages.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, I know there's one thing you aren't working on, because I saw your video. Your room looks like it got <i>messier.</i> I thought you said you were going to work on taking things down and doing that for me.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>sigh</i>] Well, that's only the, uh, one side of the room, and... you saw that side of the room in the last picture, a-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>interrupting</i>] Well, you haven't given me any more pictures like you promised me or anything, and I mean it looks... bad.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> ...Yeah, well, I'll-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I mean, you... you said that you were going to get this done like weeks ago. And... it's not even halfway done.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> It is mostly done, believe me. I'll send you some pictures tomorrow, OK?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK. I hope that they're promising.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. [<i>sounding annoyed</i>] They are, OK? They are. Yeah, well, aside from that, anything going on with you, lately?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Um... no, I've just been going to class and everything. I've been trying to hang out with my friends more, get a little more social because I just feel, you know, totally overwhelmed. Um, I'm pretty much doing what you're doing and ignoring all the trolls an-... you know, just not really caring. They're not worth my time.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. I hear that. I hear that. Anyway. My plans for tomorrow are go to class. I've got another yoga class tomorrow.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oh, OK.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I'm not sure I pronounced that right.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>talking over Chris</i>] But I mean, like... you really don't read the e-mails at all? I mean, sometimes I do just, you know, for a good laugh. And I mean, sometimes, you know, I am paranoid that... you know, because these people, they mean business. I am kind of worried that sometimes I'll miss something, and they'll actually do something. I mean, I don't wanna ignore problems, either.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> It's like, you know, can pretty much judge what they're gonna say in the e-mail, but, by reading subjects. [<i>pause</i>] And like, you know, if the subject just is like, you know, don't really... don't really care about that stuff. Yeah, so I just assum-, leave that closed.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, I know, but, Cameron and I talked about how you need to take your problems head on. Like, I told you, you don't need to <i>really</i> let them get to you, but you can't ignore them outright totally, either.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah... I, I, that's what I do mostly. After they realize they can call Gregg Mays or Clyde Cash out, you know, because he's sent one identity of Clyde Cash, and assumed the identity of Gregg Mays, and you know, neither of them were, neither of them were, neither of them really existed, really.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> How do you know that?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Well, I know it's the same person. Assuming different identities, and both of them are obviously fake, I mean-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>interrupting</i>] Well then, what's his real name?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Wha- He's never actually showed hims-, he's never actually showed... his face or his identity or anything-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>interrupting</i>] Well... most people don't do that, but I mean, if you had his real name you could force him to apologize. I mean, turn the tables on him. \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, well, I... that's why... the one thing I don't have is real name. So I can't really do that, now can I? But still, I call him out, I, I, I challenged him...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>interrupting</i>] Well, do some research. I mean, you can at least try.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I did try, I... I searched the names Gregg Mays and Clyde Cash and I didn't get much.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, I mean, I don't know how much research you are going to do because, uh, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Kim\" title=\"Kim\">Kim</a> and I were... talking about this, you know, and, she was saying how, um... you haven't read the entirety of the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/ED\" title=\"ED\">ED</a> page, yet you say it's all lies and slanders... and then you turn around and say that there is truth to it. I mean...\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah... yeah, I talked to Kim about that and I'm planning on... and I'm reading on... through the, uh, texts, on-, only the texts on the ED page. And I'm... I'm gonna print them out and I'm gonna add them, and then, so I can, so I can sort out the, uh, <i>facts</i> from the fiction.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Right. Well, maybe you should look more closely at these e-mails. Especially, I mean, if this guy has been bothering you so much that he seems to be able to get to you, and he has connections, you should probably, um, make sure. I mean, maybe he made a mistake. Maybe... he... left a clue to his identity. If he's hacked you before maybe you should totally like, at least listen to him.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I tried that, I m-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>interrupting</i>] Well, I mean if you just ignore him, what if he does something way bigger?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I mean... yeah, you know, I don't know if I've told you, but, you know, when he, when he, first time he hacked into my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Playstation_Network\" title=\"Playstation Network\">Playstation Network</a> account, a couple of d-, a few weeks ago, a couple weeks ago... I got an address, but it turned out to be an elementary school in, I think it was... Kentucky.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, maybe he works there!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Or maybe he's a student there.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> An elementary school. You're telling me you were fooled by an elementary school student over and over again?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Mm...it's a possibility.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Maybe he's a teacher! You really think that an elementary schooler has gotten the best of you? Over and over?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>short pause</i>] ...Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I think he's probably a teacher. [<i>laughs</i>] Because if not, you're telling me that some six-year-old... to... eleven-year-old has outsmarted you when you're twenty-seven, several times. Think... think about that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I mean, I have considered that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I mean, how does that make you feel? This... little... kid that hasn't even hit puberty can outsmart you so many times.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Well, I'll admit that... [<i>sigh</i>]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Talk about <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Slow_in_the_mind\" title=\"Slow in the mind\">slow in the mind</a>, right?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>sigh</i>] OK. OK. Kacey, please stop, you're pressin' a few, you're pressin' a few buttons, here.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, Chris! This is ludicrous. You're trying to tell me that you think some young kid is doing this. [<i>coughs</i>] I mean have.. have you... you said in the video that you heard him. What does he sound like?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, he sounds like... I think he sounds, I thinks he sounds more like... more like an adult. He's got kind of a high pitched tone but he sounds strong. Kinda whiny.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, can you imitate him for me? Since you're good with voices?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> ...Let me think a moment... um... [<i>pause</i>] Ahh... [<i>starts talking very drawn out and deeper</i>] I'm trying... to... see if I can... find the voice [<i>voice goes deeper</i>] by deepening my voice to the appropriate levels... no... [<i>mumbling and humming for about 20 seconds</i>] I thiiiink I'm getting there but I'm not really... [<i>voice spikes</i>] suuuure... If I knew a man from Nantucket who... [<i>voice returns to normal</i>] I'm just saying words here until I find the right tone.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Go ahead.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>voice goes deeper again</i>] If I knew a man from Nantucket [<i>voice returns to normal</i>] I would know what his voice 'cause I would have heard it a few times before and I'm not really sure until I find the right pitch. And when that happens I would tell it to you right away. Ahh... Ahh... I think I'm nearly there. Aaa-ahhh... Kinda sounds like... I think I'm just about hitting it. Um... yeah. [<i>voice doesn't change at all, identical to his regular voice a little deeper</i>] I think he sounds kinda like this, I'm not really sure. I think this sounds real right, I'm not... I'd have to hear it again. This is pretty close, I think.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Say something one more time.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I think I hit the note. Abouuut...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Because... all I really heard was you. You made him sound like you, but lower pitched. That... doesn't sound higher pitched.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I think he sounds kinda like, uh... [<i>trying to impersonate Clyde - again, sounds identical to himself but a little deeper, speaking very, very rapidly</i>] Hey Chris, how ya doin'? Hey Chris, how ya doin'? Hey Chris, how ya doin'? Hey Chris, what'er you doin'? Hey Chris, what'er you doin'? Hey Chris, what'er you doin'? Chris, what are you doin', man, I...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, I mean, you have a really high pitched voice too, and you're making him <i>lower</i> pitched, so...\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I'm trying to find it...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK. OK. I'll be patient.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I'm trying to find it... um... [<i>attempting to alter his voice, yet again</i>] If I knew the sound of the voice, I would get there. But I've heard it a number of times before. Ummmmhhhhhaaaaaa... yeah, I think I've just about got it... duuuhhhaaahhhh... Hey Chris, hey Chris, hey Chris, hey Chris, hey Chris, hey Chris, hey Chris, hey Chris, hey Chris, hey Chris, hey Chris, hey Chris. Heeeeyyyyy Chris, hey Chris, h-hey... I thi- I think I got it. I think... yeah, I think I got it, this is what he sounds like right here. [<i>Chris's voice has not changed at all, sounds exactly like himself.</i>] Listen to me right here, this is what he sounds like. Hey Chris, he-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>interrupts, talks over Chris</i>] So he sounds like you with a cold. Got it. [<i>laughs</i>]\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hm. Yeah. That sounds about right. ...Good guess. Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font>[<i>pause</i>] ...Oookay.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Like me with a cold... Heh...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Yeah!\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I like that. That's a fun comparison. [<i>laughs, clearly forcing it</i>] Huh huh huh. Huh huh huh. Ahh... that's fun. [<i>pause</i>] I mean, if he... heh, you know, that's... I never thought of that before.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>giggles</i>] Well, you know, he seems like he means business, so, you know, I'd at least keep my eye on him. I mean, what else has he done? I mean, I'm sure he's done more.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Well, let's see, I think I told you about the time he flew... about the time he said he flew to Australia and raped my <a href=\"/cwcki/PandaHalo\" title=\"PandaHalo\">Australian gal-pal</a> and impregnated her...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>pause</i>] Oh. He... he did?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Supposedly, yeah, but I'm not the latest in that, because you know... so many multiple identities. Like...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK, just 'cause he's assuming multiple identities doesn't mean it didn't happen. I mean, that would be horrible for you to ignore someone being raped like that, Chris...\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I know. It was hard for me to ignore.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, you shouldn't have ignored it. Rape isn't something that should be ignored. I mean, she got raped, right?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> It happened... yeah, it did happen about last December or January.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oh my gosh.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, but anyway... but anyway, so, last time I heard it that poor girl got burned to death... got burned, got burned to death and died in that brush fire, so... in Australia that January.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> That's horrible. So she got raped and then died?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. I... I know, I was broken up by it too, I mean, I miss her.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oh my gosh. I mean, OK. This guy really seems like he means business.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>pause</i>] Yeah, well. It may or may not... it may, uh, it may just be... I mean, he may actually just <i>sound</i> like he means business, but... he may not actually have the business. I mean, you know, he may not actually have the skills to pay the bills, with that expression.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> But, I mean, he has hacked your stuff before, I mean, how can you say that? I mean, apparently he's got some skills.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I, yeah... I mean, aside from trying to find a multiple identity and not finding much, I don't know that much about him.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, if he could hide himself that well, he could probably take himself off stuff like that. I mean, especially if it's just Google.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hm. Yeah. He could take himself off?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> It's really easy to get yourself off... taken away from, you know, like, web searches and all that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hm. Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I mean, maybe you should ask your fans to help find him.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I, I, I, I-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You know, maybe you can reform some trolls. Maybe they'll betray him. Maybe he's such a jerk, they don't like him either.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hmm... Bring in the trolls to try helping take down <i>this</i> troll?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I mean, they are trolls. They do do that. I mean, you've gotta use everything in your power, Chris.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hm. Yeah. Alright, well, fortunately, I do have... I do know about the <a href=\"/cwcki/Encyclopedia_Dramatica\" title=\"Encyclopedia Dramatica\">Encyclopedia Dramatica</a> forums page, I do know that... I have it bookmarked. I could look in there, see if I could find some information about, ah... about the guy.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> It's a good start. Maybe.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. But, you know, Kim's helping me as well. She's doing searches on her own, her part.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> But I mean, how do you know Clyde even goes there?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> What, to the elementary school in Kentucky?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> No, no, no, to the ED forums.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Wh-...It's a possibility. They do talk about him on there. Among all the other, among all the other things, and around... around, and involving me.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Right.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. [<i>sigh</i>] I feel all worn out after tryin' to find that... find that pic-, find that pitch where he sounds like...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>chuckles</i>] Well it happens...\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> ...like me with a cold, heh...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Yeah, exactly. You with a cold...\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, heh...That was almost as hard as trying to find the, uh...find the...<a href=\"/cwcki/Donald_Duck_impersonation\" title=\"Donald Duck impersonation\">imitate Donald Duck</a> for the first time.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>chuckle</i>]\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Took me a while, but I eventually got it.

I got it. [<i>laughs</i>]\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Yeah. It does take practice.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. It <i>does</i> take practice. At least by default, I almost sound like Frank Sinatra.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>laughs</i>]\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I do, seriously, I mean... you've heard Frank Sinatra, haven't you?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Of course I have.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, well, you know he's got, like... the singing voice on the side, on the uh... with the high pitched... somewhere along with his deep tones. At least he has the... at least he has the power and the practice to balance between it and make good-sounding tones for when he's playing his tracks.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b> </font>Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yep. Makes me think a little further, though. How I could sing a little better. Huh. [<i>sighs</i>] Anyw-, anyway... pfew, I'm a little tired right now. If it's OK, I'm gonna go ahead and let you go, and I'll talk to you tomorrow night.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK, I shouldn't be at work <i>too</i> late tomorrow, so I should... I'll call you tomorrow.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Alright. You take care and be safe.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK, you too. Alright.
