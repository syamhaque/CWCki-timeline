Had less than 50 dollars between pocket <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Money\" title=\"Money\">money</a>, and only a couple of bucks or so in my bank account, NO money in my PayPal, <a href=\"/cwcki/Patreon\" title=\"Patreon\">Patreon</a> was not due for a payout until Sunday and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tugboat\" title=\"Tugboat\">SSI</a> was not coming into my bank until Tuesday. <a href=\"/cwcki/Aunt_Harriet_and_Uncle_Tom\" title=\"Aunt Harriet and Uncle Tom\">Harriet and Tom Ashby</a> caste me out before I even arrived to Midlothian. <a href=\"/cwcki/Son-Chu\" title=\"Son-Chu\">The Van</a> was not majorly uncomfortable. Josh had wired a thousand to my bank that Friday, But it would not arrive until After or on Monday. Little <a href=\"/cwcki/Obesity\" title=\"Obesity\">food</a> and Options, and you try bumming in Any Parking Lot without feeling insecure and paranoid. I Needed Safety and Comfort As Quickly As Possible. THAT is why I transferred that money. I <u>WAS</u> going to pay it back in full; EVEN had $150 from Patreon on Sunday the 1st that went <u>Straight</u> to Barbie Chan's bank account. I <u>WOULD</u> have paid the remaining 600 Monday or Tuesday, BUT <u>NULL</u> had to FAIL HIS DESTINED TEST And Betrayed Me, like I was betrayed and jailed with a Kiss over 2000 years ago. NOW, and as of the past-arrest, I have absolutely NO Way to fulfill that repentence, OR anything else Digital.
