I was all, \"I can not believe this, it has been TWO YEARS and I am not forgiven? And I can not believe that man is STILL working here.\" And he was \"Well, it doesn't matter, he is the manager\" (more like <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Manajerk\" title=\"Manajerk\">ManaJerk</a>) \"if he has not given you permission to come back, and you don't leave right now, I will have to call the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Police\" title=\"Police\">police</a>.\" So I asked if he was there; <a href=\"/cwcki/Michael_Snyder\" title=\"Michael Snyder\">Michael Snyder</a> was not there, but he will be there tomorrow. I have just written/drawn up the game plan, with the goal in mind being getting the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ban\" title=\"Ban\">ban</a> lifted off of me (relieving me of one less Major Worry). I plan on handling this as peacefully as possible; I pray he won't get violent; if he does, I will defend myself. And with the recorded evidence I'll have from his own words, if it is good enough, and he does not forgive me or allow me back in, I may call the police on him.\n</p><p>I'm right now still recovering from the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress\" title=\"Stress\">angst</a> from the setback, but I'll survive, and I will win.\n</p><p>*deep breaths*\n</p><p>On a more pleasant note, during her sermon, my pastor, Elizabeth, had informed us of a fun 90+-year old dude who was silent, yet comedic. :) \n</p><p>He died recently, but she shared printed copies of a questionnaire he filled out for the Young Adult Group (of which Elizabeth gave her support on his honorary membership); his answers were very good, honest and fun to read.\n</p><p>I took a copy for myself; the questions are good, and I thought it would be fun for you and me to answer these as well.\n</p><p>1) If you could build your house anywhere, where would it be?\n<br/>-I would likely build my house here in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ruckersville\" title=\"Ruckersville\">Ruckersville</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Charlottesville\" title=\"Charlottesville\">Charlottesville</a>, or move back to Chesterfield County; all good places to live, plus my life is revolved around the three areas mostly.\n<br/>2) What's your <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_fashion\" title=\"Chris and fashion\">favorite article of clothing</a>?\n<br/>-I like my Jeans.\n<br/>3) What's your favorite physical feature of the opposite sex?\n<br/>-I like the face, because most of the time I look at the face, and I can see some of the personality behind it. Like behind your face, Jackie, I see a <a href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart\" title=\"Sweetheart\">sweet and fun-loving woman</a>. And from what I have heard from you so far, an honest and compassionate one, and I feel it is a woman like you I would want to be with for a long time. &lt;3\n<br/>4) What's the last CD (and/or MP3) that you bought?\n<br/>-The last CD I bought was Celtic Woman, \"Songs From the [Heart]\", and the last MP3 I purchased was A Taste of Honey's \"Boogie Oogie Oogie\".\n<br/>5) Where's your favorite place to be?\n<br/>-<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris%27s_room\" title=\"Chris's room\">My bedroom</a>.\n<br/>6) Where's your least favorite place to be?\n<br/>-Any place that is filled to the brim with <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tobacky\" title=\"Tobacky\">smokers</a>.\n<br/>7) What's your favorite place to be massaged?\n<br/>-My shoulders.\n<br/>**Check out George's answer, \"Depends on the definition of \"place.\" One place is Healthsouth, 6910 Richmond Hwy. Ask for Michelle.\"\n<br/>8) What's most important, strong in mind or strong in body?\n<br/>-I like to think a strong mind is important, because not only does it store our personalities and intelligence, but also stores our will to be strong in body too.\n<br/>9) What time do you wake in the morning?\n<br/>-When I wake in the morning, it's usually <a href=\"/cwcki/Biological_clock\" title=\"Biological clock\">between 8 and 9 AM</a>.\n<br/>10) What's your favorite <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/TV\" title=\"TV\">TV</a> show?\n<br/>(I already asked this last e-mail; see that for my answer as well)\n<br/>11) What's your favorite kitchen appliance?\n<br/>-Microwave.\n<br/>**George said \"Chair\".\n<br/>12) What's your favorite childhood memory?\n<br/>-Building with <a href=\"/cwcki/Lego\" title=\"Lego\">Lego</a> bricks and pieces.\n<br/>13) What makes you laugh?\n<br/>-I'm going to agree with George on this one, <a href=\"/cwcki/Random-access_humor\" title=\"Random-access humor\">\"Mostly things unexpected.\"</a>\n<br/>14) What makes you really <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Angry\" title=\"Angry\">angry</a>?\n<br/>-Again, with George, \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">Mostly things expected, but better forgotten.</a>\"\n<br/>15) If you could play any instrument, what would it be?\n<br/>-I would say <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Gitar_of_fail\" title=\"Gitar of fail\">Guitar</a>, although my father showed me his Trumpet. I did try the Trumpet for a while, but it didn't work out for me.\n<br/>16) What's your favorite restaurant?\n<br/>-Country Cookin'.\n<br/>17) What was the scariest moment of your life?\n<br/>-When there is a chance I'm losing a really close friend or relative.\n<br/>18) If there was a movie about you, what current/former Hollywood Star would play you?\n<br/>-Peter Cullin (He was the voice of the original, and new movies, <a href=\"/cwcki/Optimus_Prime\" title=\"Optimus Prime\">Optimus Prime</a>); I feel he is capable of maintaining a noble type of personality that I feel I have, as well as the emotional ups and downs like I have felt, and still maintain the determination to move forward.\n<br/>19) Do you believe in afterlife?\n<br/>-Yes, and I also feel reincarnation is a possibility too.\n<br/>20) What was your favorite children's book?\n<br/>-\"The Berenstain Bears and the Bad Habit\".\n<br/>21) What is your favorite season?\n<br/>-Spring; it's getting warmer, but it's not too hot yet, and the plants are in bloom with life.\n<br/>22) What is your least favorite household chore?\n<br/>-Garbage duty; it ain't clean, but someone's got to do it.\n<br/>23) If you could have one super power, what would it be?\n<br/>-Psychic: Telekinesis, Teleportation, Seeing into the Future.\n<br/>24) If you have a tattoo, what is it?\n<br/>-I do not have any tattoos.\n<br/>25) Who was your first <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Love\" title=\"Love\">love</a> and at what age?\n<br/>-(I said it before) Tiffany Robinson; 9 years old.\n<br/>26) What's the song you wish you had written?\n<br/>-Have Written It; a song about <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">Autism</a>, it's called \"<a href=\"/cwcki/A-U-T-I-S-M\" title=\"A-U-T-I-S-M\">A-U-T-ISM</a>\"; it's on my \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Christian_%26_the_Hedgehog_Boys\" title=\"Christian &amp; the Hedgehog Boys\">Christian &amp; the Hedgehog Boys</a>\" CD Album (currently solely in my posession <i>[sic]</i>). I may redo that song to better elaborate what Autism is. LOL.\n<br/>27) Do you prefer cats or dogs?\n<br/>-I like them both; they're fun, mostly cute, and they love you anyway.\n<br/>28) What's in the trunk of your <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Car\" title=\"Car\">car</a>?\n<br/>-A car jack, a few blankets, and sometimes stuff that either has to be brought into the house or donated to a Goodwill.\n<br/>29) Who are some people likely to respond to this questionnaire?\n<br/>-They're asking for a name or two, but I say anyone who is willing to spare the time.\n<br/>30) Least likely?\n<br/>-People who are <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris\" title=\"Chris\">too engorged in their own selves</a>.\n<br/>31) What is your favorite day of the week?\n<br/>-Friday.\n<br/>32) Using only one word, describe yourself.\n<br/>-<a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">Noble</a>.\n</p><p>Wow, 31 more questions to answer in addition to the last e-mail I sent you; we're really getting to know each other here, Jackie-Heart.

I think \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_stress\" title=\"Chris and stress\">stress</a>\" is a word I hear way too often. People all around me at school always complain about stress they're having, but it turns out to be an excuse not to do the hard work they need to be doing.\n<br/>If you could build your house anywhere, where would it be? Probably in Montenegro or the Peleponnese... such beautiful places.\n<br/>Where's your favorite place to be? A football field.\n<br/>Where's your least favorite place to be? Probably cooped up in my room.\n<br/>If you could play any instrument, what would it be? I already play one, the piano. I love it.\n<br/>Do you believe in the afterlife? I don't know, I'm more concerned with being a better person in this life, I'm not going to concern myself with trying to get to the next one.\n<br/>Using only one word, describe yourself: Selective.\n</p><p><br/>\nYou should learn to play the guitar, since you have plenty of time! I'd really love to hear you sing for me, Chris, but I'd love even more <a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris\" title=\"Liquid Chris\">if you could play your guitar for me too</a>. (Although it takes a long time and hard work to learn an instrument, so I can wait on that. But why would you want Peter Cullen to play you? I looked him up but he's really old, like 60.

How many hours a day do you spend working on it? What exactly do you do with it each day? This is kind of an important subject to me, Chris, I want to be with a man who is working for a living.

Firstly, you called this Michael Snyder person a jew at the beginning? Why did you do that? You said you his name mean he was \"possibly a jew\" as <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_race\" title=\"Chris and race\">if that was a bad thing</a>, what does that mean? And then on your way out you shouted \"JEW\" at him, what the hell was that about? And it sure didn't sound like he was being mean or anything like you said he would, he was just standing his ground. Can you explain to me your history with the Game Place a bit better? It feels like you might not be telling me everything.\n</p><p>And I encouraged you to stand your ground and settle your business peacefully and maturely. Instead, you shouted \"JEW\" and ran away after two minutes. Is that supposed to impress me? I'm going to let you know right now, this makes me mad. Do you have some kind of problem with jews? Maybe Snyder IS discriminating against you because you're autistic - but you just left after a few minutes? I thought you were going to be patient, do a sit-in, get the truth out of him. But at the first sign of resistance, you fled. You said \"noble\" was the one word you would use to describe yourself, but running away after two minutes isn't noble, it's childish. So now you don't KNOW that he hates you for being autistic. You also don't KNOW that he's a jew, either. Because you left in such a hurry, you don't know anything, you found out nothing. I think you need to go back and do this right.\n</p><p>I'll be waiting to hear from you,\n</p><p>Jackie\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris_lies_about_The_Game_Place\">Chris lies about The Game Place</span></h4>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Chris<br/>\n<p>April 13, 2010 - 2:44am<br/>\nThat is very cool that you play the piano; are you pro with it, or do you play for fun?

A trial was held, and thanks to my volunteer work at the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Pok%27emon\" title=\"Pok'emon\">Pok'emon</a> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/TCG\" title=\"TCG\">TCG</a> League I was doing back then, I was found innocent and released of the charge.\n</p><p>As for The Place History, I was going there for about 5 or 6 years for Pok'emon League, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Yu-Gi-Oh\" title=\"Yu-Gi-Oh\">Yu-Gi-Oh</a> Tournaments and Universal Fighting System TCG. I was a volunteer \"Gym Leader\" (with Second-In-Command in that title), because the main leader was Tony Wayne, Physics Teacher at Albemarle High School. I worked hard keeping the younsters under control, constructing decks from their scattered collections now and then, and being Gym Leader and distributing all stamps and prizes appropriately (more so when Tony could not make it some Fridays). Also happened then throughout, my thing with <a href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Schroeder\" title=\"Megan Schroeder\">Megan Schroeder</a>; farthest I got from her was an \"I Love You\" before she did an 180 and was scared of me for being too close; she and I were very close friends, and I was very sad to see the friendship fade away. <a href=\"/cwcki/Daniel_Mimms\" title=\"Daniel Mimms\">Daniel Mimms</a> and his accomplice, <a href=\"/cwcki/Lucas\" title=\"Lucas\">Lucas</a>, were good dudes, but then I later learned that they STARTED up that page on <a href=\"/cwcki/Encyclopedia_Dramatica\" title=\"Encyclopedia Dramatica\">Encyclopedia Dramatica</a> against me; Lucas took that vintage photo of me in my green/purple stripe shirt while I was playing a round of TCG with a lad. That same Saturday, and at that moment, I was in a state of shock from seeing Megan and (her short-lived romance) Christopher MAKING OUT. That Should Have Been Me. After seeing them like that, I was nearly paralyzed with shock, and for a while, I was static in motion and speech like a robot.\n</p><p>I do not, and probably will never, understand why Michael hated me, but he had that attitude against me for quite some time before that Wii incident just before June, <a href=\"/cwcki/2008\" title=\"2008\">2008</a>. The only things I can recall way back in the years that may contribute to his angst against me...\n</p><p><br/>-As Gym Leader, I was always early, and I set up the tables/chairs, and I go into the back area to get the Big Tub of League Stuff. Michael may have had issues with me going into the back, even for the simple retrieval of the League Stuff for the weekly setup.\n<br/>-One Friday, there was chaos going on; some of the players were not playing fair, some were roughhousing, some were just being too loud; I tried to calm things down and get things back in order, but it was just too much, and I exploded with a very loud, short yell. Such uproar may have frightened Mike as well.\n<br/>-Shortly after finding the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/ED\" title=\"ED\">E.D.</a> page in late October, <a href=\"/cwcki/2007\" title=\"2007\">2007</a>; I was seeking help in taking that site down, and even finding the perps who took that picture of me that was on that page from that Friday (the one of me in the green/purple stripes). My family and I went to and sat down with Mimms and Lucas, because we had known from the detective work that it was between those two that picture was taken then uploaded onto E.D. I think Mike may have had a fright from that event; it was like the police questioning the suspect while he/she was in a single chair under a single lamp. He may have had his own scandals that would have lead him into that situation eventually or previously.\n</p><p>Another thing I should mention about him, the Friday in June, '08 I was banned from the store, my mother was with me; she was 66 then, but we three met together in the back. During the whole thing, HE did NOT offer my mother a chair to sit in, and there was only ONE in the back, while there were others that were set up for the League that was starting up that week. My mom made that clear and raised her own fit about that to Mike, and when talking to the later-arrived police officer.\n</p><p>That's all I have in my memory about that. I would not be surprised if Mike DID have such criminal charges or sins against him, and that only HE knows and lives with that. Still, he did NOT have to be such a cold-hearted S.O.B.\n</p><p>Sit-In or not, I did not want more trouble with the police than the two times I've had already. And I would never want to end up in Jail either; it would be just as terrible, or worse, as if I had ended up in that Winchester Mental Institution... Restricted from bettering myself in life, being alone for the rest of my life, and such other tortures.\n</p><p>*sigh*\n</p><p>Also, I work on Sonichu about 2 or 3 hours a day; I have not gotten it off of the ground yet. I have said before that I am currently on S.S.I. for my income, and I am looking to be employed at the new <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Wal-Mart\" title=\"Wal-Mart\">Wal-Mart</a> here.\n</p><p>I'll TTYL, Sweetie.

I was never on a school team but I was a better player than half my school team in high school.\n</p><p>So, if you have no problem with jews, why were you talking about them? You screamed \"JEW\" at him like an insult, you didn't address that even though I asked you why you did it in my last email. You can't just say \"I have no problem with jews\" when your actions show you obviously do, Chris. Don't lie to me. It's not manly to lie to a woman you're trying to court, Chris. You made a lot of talk about acting like a big man and standing up for your rights here, but once you face a little bit of resistence <i>[sic]</i>, you run away. So now you're not even going to try again? What did you think was going to happen, you'd win with absolutely no effort? What do you think a \"sit-in\" is? And you're in the right anyway, why would the police arrest you? I'm disappointed Chris, I think you need to go back and man up to your problem.\n</p><p>And what does it matter anyway if this Michael Snyder has criminal records or whatever like you speculate? What would that have to do with him keeping you out of the store? You shouldn't try to deflect the matter by smearing him, Chris. All you know about this guy is that he doesn't want you in the store, by your own admission you don't even know why. You don't know that he's a criminal. Instead of ask, you just assume again.\n</p><p>So why do you get social security? How much do you get each month? I thought you were getting sonichu published, but you only work on it a couple hours each day? What else do you do with your time? If you're getting paid by the government, you really should be trying to get on your feet, Chris. I heard about that new Wal-Mart, and it's good that you want to get a job, but why are you so set on applying there? It won't even be open for a few months, at least. There are plenty of stores and places that have jobs available now, why wait for Wal-Mart? I want a man who can take care of himself, Chris.\n</p><p>And Chris, why are you talking about some girl that you \"should have been making out with\" when you're writing to ME? That doesn't really make me feel too special. Are you still hung up on some other girl? Wasn't this YEARS ago? I really wish you would make up your mind, sweetie. I'm trying to make this work with you, but honestly you're making me worry about this racism and other stuff. Please quell my fears, Chris, because I really like you and want this to work.\n</p><p>XOXOXO\n</p><p>Jackie\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h4><span id=\"Chris_lies_furiously.2C_hates_the_homos.2C_fails_at_getting_a_job\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris_lies_furiously,_hates_the_homos,_fails_at_getting_a_job\">Chris lies furiously, hates the homos, fails at getting a job</span></h4>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Chris<br/>\n<p>April 13, 2010 - 11:17pm<br/>\nAnd I am sorry about that statement on <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Megan\" title=\"Megan\">Megan</a>. That was years ago, and I have move on from her. I did not mean to sound hung up. Sometimes when I am recollecting on a hard time in my life, I am likely to feel again the emotions I felt back then, but those temporary relived emotions do not last long, and they mostly are not coherent with today. In this case, it was Definitely not coherent.\n</p><p>As for that \"Jew\" shout, I was feeling frustrated that I was not getting through with that man, and on the way out, I just shouted the first word that I had linked to him on my mind. It was a bad impulse, that is all. I assure you, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_race#Not_a_racist?\" title=\"Chris and race\">I am not a racist</a> or anything like that.\n</p><p>The only hang-up I have, which is not a major one these days, is that I don't get along well with other <a href=\"/cwcki/JERKS\" title=\"JERKS\">MEN</a> in general. All of my life, I have been getting along better with women. That hang-up is why I don't have many dude-pals. Most of it comes from my homophobia, and the rest comes from my past detest of men due to them being A) Mostly Mean, Cruel and Vicious, and B) <a href=\"/cwcki/Infinitely-High_Boyfriend-Factor\" title=\"Infinitely-High Boyfriend-Factor\">Having taken all of the pretty women</a> leaving me with none to choose from in my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart_Search\" title=\"Sweetheart Search\">Sweetheart Search</a>.

And I AM working on self-publishing my books with Lulu; I have found on the site in the start of the project creation that it will cost me a bit to get it started. I will get it started.

What exactly is it that you wanted me to see? Because I'm reading a lot of things I don't like. Like, you had this Australian girlfriend named \"<a href=\"/cwcki/PandaHalo\" title=\"PandaHalo\">PandaHalo</a>\", the site says that she was <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Rape\" title=\"Rape\">raped</a> by someone, and you promised that you would always love her regardless, but like two days later you heard there were fires in Australia, and you just assumed this girl was dead? And you didn't even check to see if she was or not, you just jumped immediately to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Julie\" title=\"Julie\">some other girl</a>. What would happen if I got hurt? Would you just jump to the next girl you saw, without caring about me at all? And then there was another girl named <a href=\"/cwcki/Ivy\" title=\"Ivy\">Ivy</a>, who you cheated on??\n</p><p>And that Panda girl, the article says something else that worries me: it says that she promised to come to you if you were willing to prove that you could make your comic a success, but you refused to do it, and just let her go. Are these all lies like you say, Chris? Because I'VE been trying to get you to show me that you actually WORK on something or have some kind of drive, but you don't show me anything, either. So which part of that website is lies and which is true? How am I to know?\n</p><p>Chris, I'm starting to have second thoughts about this whole thing. I ask you to send me a video - not upload one to youtube, just send it to me - and you won't do it.

PandaHalo was <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sarah_Cassandra_McKenzie\" title=\"Sarah Cassandra McKenzie\">Sarah Cassandra McKenzie</a>, the raped woman I have told you about earlier. After learning of the bushfires, I had assumed the worst. I tried contacting her by e-mail, but she had not responded in weeks. I did not \"immediately jump to another woman\"; I had wept and cried over the loss of Sarah for weeks before I could move forward. I would be totally depressed if you died, Jackie, I WOULD CRY AND CRY AND CRY, and it would take me loong over a month to feel I could move on with my life again.\n</p><p>As for Ivy, I did not cheat on her. She and I did have our own romance for a while, but later on, my father and I met with a Charlottesville Detective. He found NO records on Ivy OR her family, and her father was supposedly a Police Officer. Then I started suspecting she was a troll, and I stopped communication for like three months. Then she calls me back to try to restart the relationship; I hesitated and felt unsure. I later learned she committed suicide by hanging herself. I cried for her too. I never have cheated on Ivy; that is a lie they made up.\n</p><p>I am starting work on clarifying and sorting out the truths and lies from those pages and posting the True stories in my own honest words.\n</p><p>I can not send you a video for A) the troll risk, and B) There is a Size Limit on my E-Mail account, and a video would be way too big. And I assure you, I am very ambitious and serious about our relationship. I do not want there to be ANY Doubts between us. Please believe me. I get a ton of mental stress worrying about your safety, trying to keep our relationship strong, and making sure I don't lose you. For you, I am most capable of coping with these and a lot more. I Love You, Jacklyn, and I do not want to lose you.\n</p><p>XOXOXOXO<br/>\nChristian.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Jackie_knows_Chris_cheated\">Jackie knows Chris cheated</span></h4>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#F2CECE; border:1px dotted #BFA3A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Jackie<br/>\n<p>April 18, 2010 - 7:37pm<br/>\nChris, they're not lies. You're lying to me right now! Why do you not think I'd discover the truth? You DID cheat on Ivy. Don't you ever try and lie to me about anything on that site. I know you're lying about the Ivy thing because I'm sitting here watching a video where you apologize for it. Who was Vanessa? The cwcki says you had cyber-sex with her or something while you were professing your \"love\" for Ivy. There are tons of videos of yours on that site. Don't you dare lie to me about anything on that site. A lot of things they say come right from stuff you yourself say and do in videos YOU make. They can't fake that. And they say that you went to a girl named Julie after only a day or something after Panda died, all around <a href=\"/cwcki/January_2009\" title=\"January 2009\">January 2009</a>. I mean, you say how much you love Panda in a video in late January and you start promising your heart to Julie in the beginning of February, that's hardly \"loong over a month\". Did you really care about any of these girls at all?\n</p><p>And another thing, I asked you to give me a reason why you are on social security (a strong 28-year-old man in the prime of his life should be able to work) and you just avoid the question. You say that it's hard for you to find a job, even when you apply lots of places - and that's understandable, it's difficult for a lot of people to get jobs these days. But come on, you live at home with your parents. Being unemployed doesn't explain being on welfare. How long have you been on welfare? Why does a strong, smart, capable man need welfare?\n</p><p>As for the video, those are all excuses. You could upload a video to a secure site like mediafire and just send me the link, no one would know about it. You keep bugging me to call you but when I ask you to do something you just make excuses. Don't make excuses to me, Chris. If you actually want this to work, then PROVE it. Stop telling me why you can't do things and DO something.\n</p><p>Jackie\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h4><span id=\"Chris_.22forgot.22_he_cheated_on_Ivy\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id='Chris_\"forgot\"_he_cheated_on_Ivy'>Chris \"forgot\" he cheated on Ivy</span></h4>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Chris<br/>\n<p>April 19, 2010 - 10:37pm<br/>\nI apologize for bringing up excuses, and I was wrong about that cheating thing with Ivy; I had forgotten that portion.

You loved Ivy, but another girl came onto you, and that's all it took? What if we're together and another girl comes onto you one day? Are you just going to cheat on me, too? You say you \"resisted as long as you could\", but you didn't resist at all, really. If you had resisted you could have told her to leave you alone or blocked her or something. Why was the temptation so great, anyway? Every time I have had a boyfriend, I've been hit on by cute guys. But I never had the urge to cheat on my boyfriend, because our relationship was way more important than just fucking some random hot guy. Did you not care about your relationship with her, or what?\n</p><p>And Chris, in <a href=\"/cwcki/For_J-R%27s_Eyes_Only.MOV\" title=\"For J-R's Eyes Only.MOV\">this video</a>, you call ME Ivy. Right about three and a half minutes in, you say \"seriously, IVY, I really do want you.\" What the fuck is that? Why the fuck did you call me Ivy?\n</p><p>And don't bother telling me that it's because you were thinking about Ivy since the subject came up, and you just got the names confused. Because while that may be true, all it shows is that you don't really see much difference between me and Ivy. You know, I'm glad that I haven't met you in person yet, that we haven't gotten that close yet. Because if we were in an actual relationship then what you did would be FUCKING DEVASTATING to me. So please stop telling me that you \"love\" me, because obviously you don't. Love takes time to build, Chris. Maybe you would know that if you didn't just tell me you love me because you think it's what I want to hear. You confused me with your ex-fucking-girlfriend, for christ's sake. Are girls just all the same to you, or something?\n</p><p>I'm glad that you made a video for me, finally. But maybe in your next one you can think of a way to explain to me why I should believe you even care about me at all. Or, if you don't really care about me, you can just admit it, but maybe at least get my name right.\n</p><p>Oh, and you still haven't answered my question about why a strong-willed, able-bodied man in his late 20's lives with his parents and collects free money from the government. You're getting really good at dodging that one, makes me think you don't have a good explanation. There's this article on the cwcki: <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_money\" title=\"Chris and money\">Chris and money</a>. It says a lot of bad things about your idea of income.

And for the question of why or how I can still live in the lifestyle I am living, I can't really say. The only thing that I feel is likely holding me back is, among other things, the \"Ritualistic\" trait of <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">Autism</a>. It just has set me off and on with routines, and with that, my house I am living in, with my seinor citizen parents, is like the home base of my routines. It is a MAJOR adjustment for me to make such heavy changes cold-turkey. That's just the way I am at this point in my life.\n</p><p>I answer your questions with care, and I also say the following out of care and due respect...\n</p><p>Obviously this relationship is not working out, and it is MY fault that it has been going downhill. I should not have mentioned anything about the CWCki, or my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Internet\" title=\"Internet\">internet</a> business. Referring to the CWCki, a Troll Site, to back up my point of how they wrongfully found and downloaded videos from sites like MegaUpload. BTW, I checked, 25 other people downloaded the video I sent to you; the file is deleted now, but now I fear the trolls now have another piece of wood for their fire.\n</p><p>With all that, I feel it's probably for the best you and I went back to our separate ways. I want you to know that I deeply appreciated your genuine kindness, compassion and sweetness; it made me feel better. And you are a very beautiful woman; I guess I wasn't good enough for you. Also, just to advise you, facial jewelry (from piercings) are okay, but I feel you would look better without them.\n</p><p>Perhaps our paths will cross again in the future, but until then, I bid you a blessing for good health and safety.\n</p><p>Peace,<br/>\nChristian W.

Not that it matters now, because apparently you value continuing to be someone who relies on welfare and <a href=\"/cwcki/Alec_Benson_Leary_Phone_Call_7\" title=\"Alec Benson Leary Phone Call 7\">who does nothing all day</a> more than you value changing yourself to be the kind of man I would want. You won't put out any effort for me at all. I guess that shows how much you \"love\" me, eh? You throw around the word \"love\" like it's just a meaningless phrase. Which apparently, it is to you, because none of the stuff that usually comes with real love is evident here. For future reference, no girl is going to want to be with you if you are so averse to work and effort. Although from what I read on the cwcki, apparently I'm not the first girl to tell you that, so I don't expect you to listen this time, either.\n</p><p>And another thing. Do you pay attention at all to anything I say? I'm not mad because I saw the cwcki. I'm mad because you don't work, you don't change yourself, and because you tell me you \"love\" me all the while you won't show any effort when I ask you to, you repeatedly dodge my questions about your life because you know I won't like the honest answers, and YOU CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER MY NAME. That's all YOU, Chris. Don't blame that cwcki site for me not liking you. Don't blame others for your problems. Because I'm pretty sure that even if you had never shown it to me and I had no idea about your internet life, I still would have realized what a snaky little shyster you are being. So don't just assume that that dumb website caused the problem here, because it really annoys me that you are going to walk away from this thinking I'm so stupid that I would have fallen in love with you if not for the \"lies\" that some website told me. I'm capable of discerning fact from fiction, Chris. I can judge the truth for myself.\n</p><p>I was looking forward to a relationship with you, but you showed that you apparently aren't ready. Maybe if you showed me some effort I'd feel differently. maybe you shouldn't just give up on a girl you \"love\" the first time she gets mad at you. So you know what, Chris? Let me make this clear to you: I am still open-minded here. If you show me that you can behave like a man, then maybe we can have something.\n</p><p>Jackie\n</p><p>P.S. Don't worry so much about the other people that downloaded the video. It was just some of my girlfriends, I had to show them the guy who claims to love me and can't even remember my name.
