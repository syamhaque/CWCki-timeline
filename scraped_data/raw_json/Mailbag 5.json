There are many instances in which he takes on an insulting, superior tone, as though he can't believe what he has to put up with here. Another notable departure is Chris's complete lack of censorship in this mailbag. All the letters originally posted are answered, regardless of how little Chris likes them. \n</p><p>In his replies Chris likens the mentally handicapped to zombies, thinks \"benevolent\" is an insult, says he isn't deeply about politics despite being mayor of <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a>, states that he has an aversion to typing the word \"swastika\", and thinks <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">homosexuality</a> is also caused by drinking during pregnancy. He also reiterates his idea that Aspergers' Syndrome is incomparable to autism.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Answered\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Answered</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href='#Chris_does_not_know_what_\"benevolent\"_means,_or_how_government_works'><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris does not know what \"benevolent\" means, or how government works</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Role_Reversal\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Role Reversal</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Daniel_Tammet/Punching_your_baby_will_make_it_gay\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Daniel Tammet/Punching your baby will make it gay</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Is_Magi-Chan_incontinent?\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Is Magi-Chan incontinent?</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Art_advice_and_gay_rights\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Art advice and gay rights</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Admission_of_ignorance\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Admission of ignorance</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#That_wacky_Hitler\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">That wacky Hitler</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#In_which_Chris_assumes_Clyde_Cash_would_punch_him\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">In which Chris assumes Clyde Cash would punch him</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Chris_still_won't_admit_he's_wrong_about_Asperger's_syndrome\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.9</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris <i>still</i> won't admit he's wrong about Asperger's syndrome</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#Chris_hates_the_HexBawks\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.10</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris hates the HexBawks</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#In_which_Chris_speaks_ill_of_the_handicapped\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.11</span> <span class=\"toctext\">In which Chris speaks ill of the handicapped</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Answered\">Answered</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Chris_does_not_know_what_.22benevolent.22_means.2C_or_how_government_works\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id='Chris_does_not_know_what_\"benevolent\"_means,_or_how_government_works'>Chris does not know what \"benevolent\" means, or how government works</span></h3>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #B48246; padding:5px; background-color:#FCC\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>From: <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_characters#Kanto_Gym_Trainers\" title=\"wikipedia:List of Pokémon characters\">Lietenant Surge</a> &lt;lt_surge_1776@fsmail.net&gt;\n<p>Dear Chris,\n</p><p>I've been a long-time fan of your series, it's one of the few comics I'll allow my children to read as it promotes straight Christian values.\n</p><p>I'm becoming concerned at how you portray your fictional town Cwcville, however. It doesn't seem to promote the values of the United States of America, and, one patriot to another, I'd like to address some of these issues and have you reply \npersonally, schedule permitted.\n</p><p>Cwcville at times seems like a communist dictatorship. There doesn't seem to be much free enterprise in the town, and you might want to think about showing some of the characters setting up their own business and becoming entrepreneurs. As a businessman yourself, I am sure you can appreciate wanting to teach the kids about the American dream.\n</p><p>The next issue is that there does not seem to be any functioning democracy in Cwcville or any elected representatives of the people. Only one benevolent Mayor, who although may have good intentions, rules in absolution and runs in elections seemingly unopposed. Maybe it would be good if Cwcville had a House of Representatives, or just more candidates in the election?\n</p><p>Again, I appreciate your crusade to promote straightness, but in order to be a true lightening American like myself, you must also promote free enterprise and democracy at all costs.\n</p><p>I named my e-mail address after my favourite pokemon character, my real name is Chris too ;)\n</p><p>- Chris Palmer, Chicago.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>On the contrary, all rights in Cwcville are Free; the citizens within it have every right just like in these United States. I do not care much that you refer to me as \"benevolent\"; it sounds derogatory. Plus we do have a House of Representatives; they meet in the Cwcville Trade Center Building and relay all decisions and discussions to my office at the Mall, where I offer my input, and accept theirs, and sign the documents to agree or disagree accordingly. Free Enterprise and all that is encouraged highly. And F.Y.I., I am a Moderate; in the MIDDLE between Democrats and Republicans.

However, I would really appretiate it if I could get some responses from you!\n</p><p>As you know, high-functioning autistic people are usually incredibly smart or talented. You are an example of such a person. Not only are you an incredibly talented artist, but the stories and characters in your comics are extrememly interesting, origional and creative. A non-autistic person would not be able to create such amazing work! \n</p><p>Perhaps you've also heard of Daniel Tammet, a high-functioning autistic man who some people consider to be the smartest man in the world. According to his <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Tammet\" title=\"wikipedia:Daniel Tammet\">wikipedia biography</a>, he was able to memorize the number pi to 22,514 digits, and can fluently speak 12 languages, can learn whole languages in only a week, and even invented his own language! However, even though he is such an amazing person, I read on his wikipedia biography that he is homo, so I hate him and I hope he dies because I hate homos.\n</p><p>I really hope to have an autistic child one day, as smart and talented as you or David Tammet. If it is a boy, I will name him Christian, and if it is a girl, I will name her Crystal.\n</p><p>I do not know much about autism though. Will I increase my chances of having an autistic child if I make my wife drink <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Alcohol\" title=\"Alcohol\">alcohol</a> while she is pregnant, or punch her in her pregnant belly? Or when the baby is born, should I beat it or terrorize it to make it autistic? My wife is willing to do anything to have an autistic baby, and she already gave me permission to punch her if it means our child will be autistic. I just hope it's not a homo like David Tammet!\n</p><p>Sorry for the long email. Like I said, I know you're busy.\n</p><p>Thanks,\n</p><p>Ricky\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>I would not hate the guy for just the ONE reason; I liked Stephen Fry's vocal work on <a href=\"/cwcki/LittleBigPlanet\" title=\"LittleBigPlanet\">LittleBiGPlanet</a>, but I do not hold his lifestyle against him; he did his work and did a good job.

Although, you may look up Autism on <a href=\"/cwcki/Wikipedia\" title=\"Wikipedia\">Wikipedia</a> to see the mental problems of the child to further prove the point. Also, For God's Sake, NEVER EVER let your wife drink, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tobacky\" title=\"Tobacky\">smoke</a> or be physically abused or hurt while she is pregnant.
