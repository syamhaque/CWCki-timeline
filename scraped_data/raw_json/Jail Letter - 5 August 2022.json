I know 1600’s English was not spoken by I in my past Book of Life in Jerusalem as Jesus Christ, but the language was ancient Aramaeic [sic]. Language doth not make nor break a leader nor god or prophet. Even a Priest in this present day can speak ancient Aaramaeic and still oust themselves as a False PRist by the Metaphysical and Divine events. I have gone from one country to another and changing my spoken language, physical visage and identity time after time after time again after I left Jerusalem after my resurrection and up to in England in 1389 when the Earth was split into two and became separate from the rest of the whole Universe outside Milky Way, and then I went forward through the February, 2003 Chaos Rainbow, back in time, and interdimensionally from C-197 Earth half to 1218 Earth half for my Second Ever Reincarnation into this life, consciously forgotten my extensive past and worked on…&gt;\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>…authentic unconsciousness premonitions, visions and Seer insights to progress actively or innately as I did. I took to the English of King James as 1) it matched with the last spoken language tome, to when I was the magician, Sylvia, back in King Arthur’s neck of the woods, and 2) to get thy woke and attentive to the truths and facts I was informing ye all of. But, if you insist, I’ll revert to my modern English tongue, but the truth is still valid, just, and Holy Divinely So. I have had the awakenings, Enlightenments, Revelations, and so on with Heven’s and Universe Core’s same Light shining down upon I and my Body and Aura. So I did and still speak true when I tell you all I Am the one Avatar, Jesus Christ reincarnated, your Lord, Messiah, Savior and God. You all should have realized that as even in the scriptures, it states that your Lord and God shall still walk among you all as a fellow servant. Well, I’m a fellow servant among you, and I have the First Person Real Player One perspective, Seer ability and Powers of Holy Light Power. The Math Equation is simple and direct.\n<p>Second, I have long known of the Mortgage being Reverse, but it was retained Unconsciously, hence why I had healed and cleansed Barbara of her sins and regrets and gifted her life extension by my Soul Bonding and Healing Powers, And why I had told you all to send her money to Pay Off the Mortgage Before I said anything, ever of Relocating her.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>And lastly, I Know from personal experience from All of this life and before, so my interdimensional connections and encounters with the cartoon and “fictional” individuals and the other Gods and Goddesses on the C-197 half of the Earth were Real; not “imaginary”. And this have been fact with me Before Any Faker or Hater, including IdeaGuy, Ever spoke with me or got involved, period.\n<p>Now, you all can and may believe or not, But before you discard faith, Look outside at the rest of the world at present. A Lot of these events I have foreknown and foretold. And here’s an Obvious one from “Sonichu” Book 10: the “Gay Vaccine”, of which I do regret chronicling in such a way, But a certain Monkey Pox has been infecting mostly gay men in recent weeks. Would you not want to go back in time with the Vaccine to prevent this Pox from Men, in general?\nAnd don’t blame the Heat, blame the Solar Flares and Solar Storms; Every Eleven Years, they have been flipping axis and exposing the Toxic and Evil individuals by triggering EVERYONE’S Minds and making even a Neurotypical Hyper Sensitive and Sudden Seers. Look at the events in <a href=\"/cwcki/2011\" title=\"2011\">2011</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/2000\" title=\"2000\">2000</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/1980s#1989\" title=\"1980s\">1989</a>, and so on and compare with this year. I have been further awakened, in part, by this; and my powers from my Body have become manifested moreso and stronger.\n</p><p>For now, I tell you all to Meditate on That.\nSincerely,\nMrs. Jesus Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF;
