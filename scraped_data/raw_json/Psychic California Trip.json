Between 14 <a href=\"/cwcki/August_2019\" title=\"August 2019\">August 2019</a> and 14 <a href=\"/cwcki/September_2019\" title=\"September 2019\">September 2019</a>, Chris role-played that he had switched spirits with <a href=\"/cwcki/Magi-Chan\" title=\"Magi-Chan\">Magi-Chan</a>, one of his <a href=\"/cwcki/Imaginary_friends\" title=\"Imaginary friends\">imaginary friends</a>. At its conclusion, Chris recapped the fantasy over <a href=\"/cwcki/Discord\" title=\"Discord\">Discord</a>, then screencapped his posts and reposted to <a href=\"/cwcki/Twitter\" title=\"Twitter\">Twitter</a> on 14 September.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Summary\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Summary</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Chris's_text\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris's text</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Gallery\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Gallery</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Summary\">Summary</span></h2>\n<p>Chris's role-play hinged on the concept that he had swapped spirits with Magi-Chan, placing Chris's mind in Magi-Chan's body in dimension <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/C-197\" title=\"C-197\">C-197</a> and Magi-Chan's mind in Chris's body in dimension <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/1218\" title=\"1218\">1218</a> (also known as <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Reality\" title=\"Reality\">reality</a>). Much of the role-playing revolved around <a href=\"/cwcki/Jacob_Sockness\" title=\"Jacob Sockness\">Jacob Sockness</a>, a main influence on Chris at the time.\n</p><p>In the role-play, Chris (in Magi-chan's body, which can apparently traverse dimensions in the form of a spirit) begins a run from Virginia to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/California\" title=\"California\">California</a> to visit Sockness, accompanied by <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Mewtwo\" title=\"Mewtwo\">Mewtwo</a>. Along the way, he stops in Utah to visit his former <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Gal-pal\" title=\"Gal-pal\">gal-pal</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Anna_McLerran\" title=\"Anna McLerran\">Anna McLerran</a>. Chris neglects to inform Anna in advance of the visit, instead trespassing into her living room and using Magi-Chan's powers on her mind so that she can see his presence.\n</p><p>Upon arriving in California, Chris seeks out Sockness at his house. Chris notices Sockness's \"weird\" Chris-themed body pillow and possesses it so that Sockness can hug it. Chris notes that Sockness \"gives Really comforting hugs\", referencing how the <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys</a> had brainwashed him into believing himself to be <a href=\"/cwcki/Bisexual\" title=\"Bisexual\">bisexual</a> a year prior. Chris then attacks the people who had been behind the troll personas of <a href=\"/cwcki/Blanca_Weiss\" title=\"Blanca Weiss\">Blanca Weiss</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">Clyde Cash</a> and Ryan Cash (confusing Ryan's last name with <a href=\"/cwcki/Bryan_Bash\" title=\"Bryan Bash\">Bryan Bash</a>).\n</p><p>Chris parts ways with Sockness after the latter becomes influenced by <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jakoba\" title=\"Jakoba\">Jakoba</a>, then he spends time fighting demons brought about by Jakoba's presence until the initial spirit swap ends and Chris and Magi-Chan return to their own bodies.\n</p><p>Chris ended his description by reflecting on Sockness's character. Chris insisted Sockness to be a kind person, after being reformed by himself and Magi-Chan, and that Sockness's upcoming attempt to visit Virginia would go smoothly. Chris would later backtrack on the visit two weeks later, when he demanded the trip be called off.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Chris.27s_text\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris's_text\">Chris's text</span></h2>\n<p>Hey, @everyone . I am back. Wow! That was a real adventure.\n</p><p>Going into a more powerful body in the neighboring dimension is quite the shocker type of an event. \n</p><p>Anyway, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Mewtwo\" title=\"Mewtwo\">Mewtwo</a> and I had a great time in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/California\" title=\"California\">California</a>. The first day, with Magi-Chan's legs, I Ran from Virginia to California. It was <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu%27s_Edge\" title=\"Sonichu's Edge\">a lovely run</a>. I <a href=\"/cwcki/April_16_Fetish_Vids#How_NOT_to_Take_a_Shower\" title=\"April 16 Fetish Vids\">almost tripped</a> a few times, but the psychic senses gave me a heads-up, so I was able to instinctly avoid the mishaps. The weather was clear and good that morning. Lovely views, even though a lot of them were blurred to me. \n</p><p>An hour or two later, we made it to Utah; I found and visited my BFF, <a href=\"/cwcki/Anna_McLerran\" title=\"Anna McLerran\">Anna McLerran</a>. I initially had a tough time verbally communicating with her, or getting her attention. But I went telepathic and she was able to hear me. She looked like she was hearing a ghost. I clarified who I was and that I was standing right in front of her. \n</p><p>I put a hand on her forehead while she was sitting on the couch, sent a few mind-opening pulses, and she was able to see me. \n</p><p>Startled, yes, but she soon calmed down. I told her about how Magi-Chan and I switched bodies, and that I was on my way to Cali. She saw and takes with Mewtwo as well. It was a lovely hour of conversing. \n</p><p>After leaving, we made our way to California; took less than a half-hour to look up <a href=\"/cwcki/Jacob_Sockness\" title=\"Jacob Sockness\">@Chris_Kink</a>'s place. He wasn't at home, the mixture of light and dark presences were obvious in there, but it was tolerable. Especially since <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ego\" title=\"Ego\">my Light Power and Soul were brightening up the place</a>. \n</p><p>We found Jake and made ourselves obvious to him. He did notice us, but damn was his ADD turned on, as he remained focused on talking with his peeps and friends that late morning hour. \n</p><p>We did get Jake to notice us fully, or as fully as possible. \n</p><p>I personally attest and confirm: Despite his Young Jake soul, offline and in person, Jake is really civil and kind, as well as respectful of personal space. \n</p><p>I will admit, however, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sex\" title=\"Sex\">I still had my own horny impulses</a>, regardless of the body I was in. Soulfully, I can be quite, what's the word? I don't want to say \"nympho\", because that's an exaggeration. Let's go with Sensual. \n</p><p>Anyway, he did have his <a href=\"/cwcki/Waifu\" title=\"Waifu\">body pillow</a> attired to look like me. Yeah, it Was weird to me, but he meant well. He did not need to enchant the thing either; I jumped into it and out of it, just because he felt better able to hold me that way. I gotta tell you, he gives Really comforting hugs. :relaxed:\n</p><p>What else? I hugged him back, I talked to him; he adored and appreciated my presence, attention and kindness. \n</p><p>It was quite the educative experience that I will keep in memory and soul to heart what I had witnessed of his magic craft. \n</p><p>Whoosh! That venting sent out to take out the two individuals behind <a href=\"/cwcki/Blanca_Weiss\" title=\"Blanca Weiss\">Blanca Weiss</a>, as well as those behind <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">Clyde Cash</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ryan_Cash\" title=\"Ryan Cash\">Ryan Bash</a>, way back when; there Must have been more than a hundred Metagross making a thick three-layered dome around his home/ temple. Mewtwo and I were about a hundred or so miles away from there for safety. \n</p><p>All that to ensure the safety of the innocent and non-related peoples. \n</p><p>We meditated around all of the temples in California; we even visited <a href=\"/cwcki/China\" title=\"China\">Chinatown</a>; really good food there, and it remained quite rustic and lovely. \n</p><p>Many <a class=\"new\" href=\"/w/index.php?title=Portal&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" title=\"Portal (page does not exist)\">Portals</a> cracked open all around us, and in Virginia at the same time, and our surrounding states on either side of the continent. \n</p><p>The energy that poured in was amazing. It fueled not only myself, but an arcing <a href=\"/cwcki/Rainbow\" title=\"Rainbow\">rainbow</a> over the USA to Magi-Chan, and back again. \n</p><p>What he felt Really lit up my body many times, it happened to me on my end with his body too.\n</p><p>Anyway, Mewtwo and I had to leave when Jacob stopped resisting <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jakoba\" title=\"Jakoba\">Jakoba</a>. Ugh, it was <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Natasha_Turner\" title=\"Natasha Turner\">Natasha Turner</a> smoking cigarettes in front of me during Providence Middle School Years all over again. \n</p><p>We were to keep ourselves distant when Jakoba was being channeled and talking before then, to be safe.\n</p><p>I Know Him; he really would enslave others in the guise of \"Peace\". The God Throne is Really waaaaaaaaay too much for him. \n</p><p>All he was really doing was keeping that throne warm for the next in line, but he has been too stubborn to leave it and was power-hungry. \n</p><p>We will take him out and restore everything as soon as we can, together.\n</p><p>Next, I triggered the vibrations in Magi-Chan's body to adjust the Dimensional frequency; I had to work by soulful feeling in finding our <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/1218\" title=\"1218\">1218</a>, and it took me HOURS of focus and concentration, but I did it! I got Magi-Chan Sonichu's body fully visible here! \n</p><p>After that, people did begin seeing me; Mewtwo suggested I teleport elsewhere, so we teleported to one of the many temples. We <a href=\"/cwcki/Meditation\" title=\"Meditation\">meditated</a> and rested for a while. \n</p><p>Over the past week, we've been further channeling energy and power and sending them back and forth to and from with Magi-Chan. \n</p><p>As well as fighting off a bunch of demons that came along after Jakoba's true self-counterpart's soul tampered with the <a href=\"/cwcki/Iron_Curtain\" title=\"Iron Curtain\">Dimensional Curtain</a>. Ugh, that will be quite the union of that soul with this Dimension's Jakoba. Not much power increase, but the motivation and arrogance will be worse. \n</p><p>Tiring and crazy. \n</p><p>Mewtwo and I teleported back to Virginia after fighting off a few more of the bastards. \n</p><p>Magi-Chan left his for-now last thoughts and prayers, and as he put on the second earring, we hugged, and we talked a bit how it tough it was for each of us. \n</p><p>We felt the soul transfer happen, and it happened really quick; less than a minute's time.\n</p><p>Like a road trip: the trip to distant destination \"B\" feels like a Looong trip, and the return trip back to Point \"A\" feels shorter and easier. \n</p><p>From my perspective: going from a body that was still developing its powers in a restrictive \"Reality\" (whereas my soul is most omnipotent everywhere else), into a fully-powered Psychic/Electric Pokemon body, leading to control my emotions with the powers, even <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">his brain worked a lot better than my own</a>; it was Unreal and New to me! Thankfully, Mewtwo mentored me, and I had a quick learning curve. It actually was as simple as my own <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Psychic_powers\" title=\"Psychic powers\">psychic powers</a> when I am projected outside of my body, or from my body and into the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/C-197\" title=\"C-197\">C-197</a> side of the curtain. \n</p><p>It was intense, But I Digress.\n</p><p>I can only remember as much as possible out of it all in my soul memory, which it is now being transferred and backup up into my brain and my cloud save backup in the Cosmos.\n</p><p>I will also attest from what I have <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Foreseen\" title=\"Foreseen\">foreseen</a>: Jake's visit here will be pleasant and eventful, and he SHALL leave Jakoba on the curb back in outside of California; not in Virginia at all.\n</p><p>He IS truly a very kind gentleman and individual. I feel he should not have had to ever resort to what he had done in the past, but had he not done so, and reformed by mine and Magi-Chan's personal interventions and abilities, he would not be as better personally developed and confident as he is.\n</p><p>Moral of That Story: Treasure Your Experiences: Good and Bad; they all shape you into the better and stronger individual that you are.\n</p><p>⚡💙⚡\n</p><p>I Appreciate ALL of My Past Experiences. And now, everything will play out and come full circle, fully and well, indeed.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Gallery\">Gallery</span></h2>\n<center><ul class=\"gallery
