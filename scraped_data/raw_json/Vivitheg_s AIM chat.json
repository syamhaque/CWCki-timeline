Our fellow Vivian was fed up with <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris\" title=\"Chris\">Chris</a>'s bullshit and thought it was time to talk some damn sense into him, and after rummaging around the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Internet\" title=\"Internet\">internet</a> for a while, she finally found Chris's AOL account. She then proceeded to have a chat with Chris, trying to address his many personal and psychological issues, from the <a href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Schroeder\" title=\"Megan Schroeder\">Megan Schroeder</a> saga, to his <a href=\"/cwcki/Attraction_Sign\" title=\"Attraction Sign\">Attraction Sign</a> and his arrest by <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jerkops\" title=\"Jerkops\">jerkops</a>, to the first <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Trolling\" title=\"Trolling\">trollings</a> from 2008.\n</p><p>Chris proved to be so <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_negotiation\" title=\"Chris and negotiation\">stubborn, self-centered and unable to take responsibility for his actions</a>, that any attempt to reason with him failed. Any time Vivian made him think about his actions, the answer she received from Chris was always one of his stock phrases. Never did she managed to get him to think about his actions, thus cementing the theory that Chris is <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ego\" title=\"Ego\">egotistical</a> and always thinks he's right. After 3 long, excruciating hours, during which Chris presumably slipped on <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Cat\" title=\"Cat\">cat</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/DIRTY,_CRAPPED_BRIEFS\" title=\"DIRTY, CRAPPED BRIEFS\">dung</a> and knocked the Internet gateway, Vivian declared defeat, and it was after this chat that she converted from being a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/White_knight\" title=\"White knight\">white knight</a> to a full-on <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Troll\" title=\"Troll\">troll</a>.\n</p><p>Fortunately for her and the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Private_Villa_of_Corrupted_Citizens_(message_board)\" title=\"Private Villa of Corrupted Citizens (message board)\">PVCC</a> forums, the resulting chat log was of the first insights on Chris's mind, and the psychological information obtained from its analysis proved to be decisive for the coordinated trollings in <a href=\"/cwcki/2009\" title=\"2009\">2009</a>. \n</p><p>The following section has a series of highlights from the chat.

color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> well actually wait\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> why were you banned\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> what did you do\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> that's probably a better question\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> and UVA's Alderman Library is a lot better than a singles bar.\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> how do you konw\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> know\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> they just didn't like me hanging around there; they're all a bunch of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jerks\" title=\"Jerks\">jerks</a>.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> basic instinct.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> so, I wasn't spending money there; what should they care?\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> you're withholding information\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> you must have done something\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> to draw attention to yourself\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> specifically, I was NOT TOTALLY BANNED, but I can only be there with one of my parents.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> the situation with Hanna.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> as read in the comic; it was the anguished cry.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> so I was litteraly loud; big whoop; those jerks still hated my guts.\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> well, that does draw attention\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> like a lot of men in this state.\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> and distract people who are trying to concetrate\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> on their job/buying stuff\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> you don't do that kind of thing in public\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> which is why you got kicked out\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> YOU may think it was just a loud cry\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> well, it was called for; my heart was toyed with.\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> but OTHERS may think it was a distraction\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> what would OTHER PEOPLE around the area think\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> probably that somebody got Seriously Hurt, which was WHAT DID HAPPEN.\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> maybe seriously hurt physically\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> I was the victim.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> the physicallity; <a href=\"/cwcki/Heart_level\" title=\"Heart level\">my heart</a>.\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> no\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> that is not physically\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> losing an arm is physically\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> getting an emotional stab to the heart is physical.\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> to others\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> it just looks like someone yelling nooo\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> for no apparent reason\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> it was still called for.\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> no it wasn't\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> but forget about that.\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> you have to realize\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> that your behavior\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> is not suitable for the public\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> you have to change yourself\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> that was years ago that happened.\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> still\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> you don't seem to recognize why that was wrong\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> for you, maybe it was right, but you have to consider the other people\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> I DID RECOGNIZE.\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font>\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> they just didn't like me hanging around there; they're all a bunch of jerks.\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> You seem to blame them\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ego\" title=\"Ego\">not yourself</a>\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> the other people didn't have their heart played with terribly.\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> i mean you weren't suspicious at all?\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> people just don't go up to another preson and say I need a boyfriend\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> that's not how it works\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> REWIND; I, myself, NEED a Girlfriend.\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> yes\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> But you didn't think twice\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> about someone coming up to you out of the blue\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> I was desperate then.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> as well.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> and I still didn't know better.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> I am a mess.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> a mess of issues.\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> yes\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> you need to see a professional\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> i can't help you\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> i've realized that now\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> you need to seek professional help\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> ask your parents\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> i'm sure they will help you with that\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> I have seen a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_psychology\" title=\"Chris and psychology\">psyciatrist; no help</a>. and my parents are old; still no help.\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> no\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> i mean they can most likely help you\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> find a professional\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> i mean\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> a professional what?\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> therapist\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> someone\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> who helps people deal with their problems\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> therapist = Psyciatrist.\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> okay sure\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> just look for one\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> you have a new set of problems\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> maybe looking for one now\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> will be the best choice\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> because i honestly can't help you\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> i've tried for 3 hours now\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> and it's like fighting a wall\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> i can't beat the wall no matter how hard i try\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> eventually, you make a dent.\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> yes\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> but with the help\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> of someone else\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> look for a therapist, psyciatrist\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> whatever\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> just do it\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> trust me\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> you may not think they help\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> but at least you tried looking for help\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> finding a girlfriend is the least of your problems\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> you have more issues to deal with\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> yes I did.\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> before you can even begin to i don't know\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> just\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> a job maybe\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> school maybe\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> something\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> a therapist costs money; what I really need is a close gal-pal.\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> you seem to have plenty of money\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> the government gives you mony\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> ey\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> money\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> i can type i

spend it on\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> I am not Mr. Joe Millionaire.\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> get some help\n<br/><font

help\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> I don't want to.\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> You have to let go chris\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> those things shouldn't mean such\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> a attachment\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> material goods\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> is not something that brings happiness\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> i know this\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> you don't think I didn't know that either.\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> then why won't you sell them\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> I just don't want to.\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> why\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> and I don't need to.\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> that's not a good reason\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> because\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> you apparently\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> don't have money\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> so get some\n<br/><font

what kind of help are you thinking of\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> and I don't need a professional.\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> Yes you

how are they going to help\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> <a href=\"/cwcki/Wesley_Memorial_United_Methodist_Church\" title=\"Wesley Memorial United Methodist Church\">my

color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> so far\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> chris\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> because <a

color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> go read it, or join a church.\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> why\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> so you can learn for yourself.\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> the lessons behind God's will.\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> do you think god will help

color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> why 3 years?\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> because that is how long\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> i believe you will realize\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> that god is not going to help you\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> in that amount of time\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> you will be much worse off than you are now\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> that is what i believe\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> what are you, an athiest?\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> daoist\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> what is

color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> the way of being able to live life through non-action\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> which means that you should not do anything rash\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> unless you wish your life to be a living hell\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> I see.\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> the believe in that you should be an active person\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> I am\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> and help others\n<br/><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>CWCSonichu:</b></font> I do\n<br/><font color=\"#0B3B0B\"><b>VIVItheG:</b></font> and what is your problem
