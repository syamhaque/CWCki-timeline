The reason he got banned from the game place is in part due to his blatant <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Racism\" title=\"Racism\">racism</a>. Also, because he would frequently blow up when losing to small children, he had scared off some good business, so Mike really wanted him gone. Lets not discount the fact the His parents threatened to take me to court. Also, There were some <a href=\"/cwcki/Niggos\" title=\"Niggos\">black kids</a>, age 12-15, who would frequent the <a href=\"/cwcki/Yu-Gi-Oh!\" title=\"Yu-Gi-Oh!\">Yugi-oh</a> sessions (actually good kids) who he kind of picked on because he always acted like they wanted to steal from him. No one wants to be discriminated against, so there was a bit of animosity between Chrissy and the group of black kids. His final banning is due largely to the fact that he got in a <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_anger\" title=\"Chris and anger\">scream contest</a> with one of the kids and of course the \"adult\" should be responsible, but not Chris. Essentially Mike was looking for any reason to ban him at this point and this was good enough, because he was tired of having long time patrons harassed by this retard. He was asked to leave and to not come back Mike, so Chris calls his parents. Mike Calls the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jerkops\" title=\"Jerkops\">cops</a>. The result was hilarious. watching his <a href=\"/cwcki/Barbara_Chandler\" title=\"Barbara Chandler\">fossilized mother</a> get put in her place by a jerkop was pretty fulfilling.\n<p>(sorry if that was long winded)\n</p><p>Other fun stuff... He had about a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Wall_of_Originals\" title=\"Wall of Originals\">20 different custom cards</a>, but never played any of them. He was very rarely left in charge of the Pokemon league because he had such a short temper and hated dealing with all the little kids' wins and losses, so I real adult needed to be present. <a href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Schroeder\" title=\"Megan Schroeder\">Megan</a> would usually stand/hide behind me and Lucas to avoid him, especially after the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Shecameforcwc.jpg\" title=\"Shecameforcwc.jpg\">drawings</a> of her got leaked. I'd prefer to leave her out of this to be honest, as it was a traumatizing experience for her. She and I are still friends for the record. Chris would rarely ever shake anyones hand after a game, and when he did, he quickly followed up with hand sanitizer. I received a My little pony for Xmas one year from him, cuz I treated him like a person for the longest time. If you care to look it up, I got Mimbo-boboruto. It had a green pompom 'fro, because I had a green 'fro (no joke). It should also be know that he played the game Universal Fighting System (UFS) wherein you can play as nearly any fighting game character. He always picked a steriotypical bimbo as his character, usually Cassandra and sometimes <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_Fighter\" title=\"CWC Fighter\">Chun-li</a>.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Follow-up\">Follow-up</span></h2>\n<p>After the initial message and popularity on PVCC, four more questions were sent to Mimms:\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>1) Did Chris lose a lot at <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Yu-Gi-Oh\" title=\"Yu-Gi-Oh\">Yu-Gi-Oh</a> and/or <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Pokemon\" title=\"Pokemon\">Pokemon</a>? I and someone else are curious at how good Chris was at <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/TCGs\" title=\"TCGs\">TCGs</a>, like if he won a lot or if he frequently lost to 10 year olds.\n<p>2) Chris seems to cite this story about how he went behind the counter at <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/The_Game_Place\" title=\"The Game Place\">the Game Place</a> to get something, and they banned him for that. Obviously you cite a different story and I was wondering if there was any merit to Chris's story about going behind the counter that got him banned.\n</p><p>3) To what extent did Chris lead the Pokemon League? Your story about how he was rarely left in charge is particularly interesting, considering Chris says his \"greatest contribution to society\" was leading the Pokemon League and he equates his experience at The Game Place as the volunteer gym leader as actual work experience (yes, as in the kind he would put on a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Resume\" title=\"Resume\">resume</a> if he actually applied to a job) and as charitable volunteer work. He said his experience there helped him develop \"leadership skills like Optimus Prime\" (I shit you not, those are his words).\n</p><p>4) What's this about an interrogation? [he offered to tell me about the interrogation he got when they found out about the infamous blurry picture]\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#F2CECE; border:1px dotted #BFA3A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>1) Chris was pretty awful at all the games he played. he had rediculous themed decks that never worked in pokemon and he never used any trategy at all in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Yugi-oh\" title=\"Yugi-oh\">yugi-oh</a>. He only won 1 tournement of yugi-oh durring a regional event when most of our good players were gone. There must have been about 6 people including Chris and myself at the tourney and when he won he was jumping up and down a yelling \"I'm the level up king!\" Since that was the theme of his deck. Other than that he would lose to small children and rarely made it past the first round in organized events.\n<p>2/3) He wasnt actually a gym leader for Pokemon league, but on a few occasions the regular gym leader couldnt be there, he happily volunteered to sub in because he never missed a Friday session of Pokemon anyway. After a few reports of him raising his voice to impatient children it was clear that something had to be done about him. One day when he was taking the place of gym leader, he went to the back room to get the box of prize support and badges and whatnot without permission. Since he is neither an employee or a gym leader, Mike decided to use it as an excuse to ban him for one month. That was his first ban. The other ban story I told was the second and permanent ban.\n</p><p>4) The interrogation came a week<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup> after I took the famed blurry picture. Keep in mind that Chris still liked me at this point and that he is very very gullible. I come and sit down like any other friday, start chatting and playing a round of Pokemon with Lucas and some other players and these two old people walk up and ask if they can talk to me. The conversation starts kind of slow talking about Chris disability and how they struggled as parents and seem rather bitter that their son is far from normal. They then ask if I took the dreaded picture. I say yes and then play dumb as far as how it got on the internet. They then threaten to take me to court for misusing his likeness with out his consent. At first I was really shaken by this, but then I realized they were full of shit and couldn't actually do anything of consequence to me. So then I put on the smug bastard face and ask them if they're done and if I can go back to my game. Later, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Mike\" title=\"Mike\">Mike</a> tell Chris if his parents ever do anything like that again, he'll call the cops (cuz Mike has my back). This is also a big push to Chris down his slippery slope to being banned, probably the biggest one, in fact. anyway, thats the basic gist of the interrogation.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span id=\"Q.26A\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Q&amp;A\">Q&amp;A</span></h2>\n<p>Mimms was asked to join the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Private_Villa_of_Corrupted_Citizens_(message_board)\" title=\"Private Villa of Corrupted Citizens (message board)\">Private Villa of Corrupted Citizens</a> along with Lucas, and they were flattered by the invitation.\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #CEF2CE; border:1px dotted #A3BFA3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>So uh, what's up guys.
