tall to even match a\nradio\ntower hey what's up everybody jesus\nChrist Jan Soni Prime here once again\nwith another quick like review video and\ntoday we are reviewing the second\nVoyager in the way in the third wave of\nTransformers Legacy Diverge PVC Citizens\nConractor the\nFirst i forgot the joke i forgot to joke\ni got I can only do this one more time\nbut first okay back to the\nshow all right anyway so here we are and\nthere he is and first and foremost as\nalways we'll take a quick look at the\npackaging so right from here we got Mr\ncrector being all vetting all blue and\njetting all the way look at those bluees\ncoming out the uh thrusters in this back\nand just hey you got to love the\nimproved art quality on these so\nanyway he is a forger\nclassifier\nclassif on this side of bots you got the\nuh artwork of uh Crack to the first and\na nice dynamic pose right there and his\narm and the gun on his right hand\ncontinues into the uh other into the\nfront panel and just a big old shot\ncloseup of Tractor and there is his name\nin\nCybertronian on this side of the box you\ngot half of the uh lovely artwork right\nthere the poster you got the top half\nright here and there you go anyway so\nyeah there's the top and there's the\nbottom with the words things barcodes\nand uh on the back of the box you have\nyour obligatory processes this that the\nother combined to make a bigger robot\nand a lovely bio if you'd like to read\nthat here or you may go to the quick\nlight and that's basically it for the\npackaging\nso moving right along here we have big\nold crack the first and he had decreased\nfrom being like you know essentially uh\nwhen every when we was just everybody\nPVC citizens everybody was essentially\ndeluxe class like the uh pun slabs and\nthe savvs of course that includes the\ncrafters they were deluxe class as well\nand that was no different with this big\nguy here who got really promoted by\nMegatron just a bit of that extra all\nspark energy and they had my combination\ngave this guy a really sizable upgrade\nfrom Deluxe class to\nVoyager let's get a let's get a closeup\nhere look at the details so just\nessentially got the big old nose cone\nright there and\nuh also more detail going on just\nessentially just uh look at the top of\nthe jet mode here but yeah got lots of\nnice details you got a shiny Decepticon\nsymbol center right there and you got uh\nthe badge of glory from Megatron on\neither wing over there lots of more of\ndetail going on and side of B oh and\nthese little fins right here that makes\nup the lang gear they are patched\nseparately in the bots you got put these\nin yourself you see they are like that\nthey're meant to be this way cuz that is\nmeant for Mr crafter the first so\nthere's the side of this Jeff mode and\nthere's the uh back yep and uh so yeah\nanyway so we just we've seen the top and\nuh there's the bottom and the side from\nhead is essentially visible everything\nwhich is just pretty much common with\nthe jet formers and he does slide as\njets tide ride for flying sliding big\nold jet jet jet jet jet jet jets Jetson\nso now for comparison here is Craft of\nthe First with the\nCC82 a little tank with a big jet was\nthat supposed to be a big joke yeah\nyou're going to hear a lot of big\ninfluences and commentary throughout\nthis video\ncracktor\nwith Christian Prime right here\nand we're gonna just do go all out here\nright this one so here you go here he is\nwith\nprime big old truck with trailer and big\nold jet can't get any better than that\ncan\nwe yes all right so because I realized\nit's a bit too hard or difficult to get\nthe group shop so we'll just do\nindividually so we'll just uh here is\ncrack to the first with wave\nand here is crafted the first of the\nremaining Quickville Autobot Comb of\nAubberats Roll Out Chapper and\nFireshot\nwith\nSonu and now we have the trio together\nin their group comparisons so Kraton the\nfirst SAV the first and Punlab the\nfirst all right and here is Cracktor the\nFirst with the Deceptic Clones SAVV and\nCracktor yeah look at that big Jet small\njet\nshar and here he is with Glammy Makoto\nand\nCrusher\nwith\nStarscream hey the Decepticons are not\nthat great but they shall fight\nalongside this guy\nand of course\nwith\nbigs big jet big\ntank and now for the considerable mold\ncomparison here is Kratch the first with\ncombiner wars\nsilverbolt and here you go now we can\nfinally do this from K the from before\nCrack the first here he is with\nTransformer Cybertron\nThundercracker because it's\nprecious oh so Thunder Kraken crackctor\nprecious so there you\ngo all right now so let's run through\nthe accessories he only comes with just\na few obviously two which are important\nthat's his\nuh pair of guns right here the rifles\nand just obviously so you can get a\ncloseup of the uh details right there\nand that's good molded in details on\nboth sides and uh back front bunch of\ngray plastic and yes he has the uh\ncombiner mode feet he's got feet both of\nthese big feet right here put one right\nthere see got the molded details all\naround on the foot all around yes and\nthe little foot in the back and you've\ngot a slot for a Titan master or prime\nmasteraster right there and of course\nthe incorporation of these is uh you\nknow obviously simple so you got uh 5 mm\nports underneath there on the bottom and\nyou got the the hands right there on\neither side so they can hold the uh\nweaponry so obviously\nwe'll have him holding his own\nguns and just that's simple and elegant\nenough as is but here we go but if you\njust you still want to do it anyway you\ncan put these in those holes in the\nbottom and\nwell that's a\nthing that's a thing you could say he's\na lacrosse valkyrie walker or pretending\nto be anyway and if he's pretending to\nbe one that's pretty much the worst\nimitation right\nthere all right so that's basically it\nfor vehicle boats let's get down to\ntransformation shall we let's All right\nso we're going to go into combine mode\nfirst because this guy becomes the torso\nof Pornocra Penrave Bay so let's see for\nstarters we're going to flip the tail\nfins down and we're going to pull the\nwings out and\nup and then uh actually leave them up\nthat way we're going to go ahead take\nthe uh nose cone cockpit that cockpit\nyeah and then rotate there's like a tab\nright there that goes to this slot right\nhere and just make sure you get that in\nthere there you go all right so there\nyou go now you got visible head syndrome\nyep no but all right so anyway you take\nthe uh arms and uh you're going to\nrotate the fractious joint and\nuh yeah this is the front yeah rot like\nthat and you go make a video mode you\nwant to take the hand there and uh flip\nit up so it's like that and same thing\non the other side just rotate that down\nand those are going to become the thighs\nfor the kabay mode and then you got\nlet's see and then you want to go under\nhere see make sure I remember I get this\noh that's right all right so you want to\npull on this first i take a little I\nfigured out or screwdriver or\nsomething get this out come on come on\nthere we go yeah you take that out pull\nthat up you got this little slot right\nhere\nthis tab right here is going to go into\nso you're going to flip that down like\nthat and pull that up and there you go\nthe head is in place and then these will\ncome all done off the side and just flip\nthese in and they're going to meet in\nthe middle and become the chest oh I\nforgot so you got take this flip it up\nso you got that and then you do and then\nyou do this all right so there you go\nthere is the punctctor V torso and the\nhead yes and yep it's quite the thing\nand we'll go for the for the Oh I forgot\nto mention so these right here you want\nto flip these down for the arm\npieces so that's just let you know about\nthat\nokay but yeah so like I said we'll go\ninto further detail when we go into my\nmode but I will mention this so let's\nget a little closer look there's that\nhead scope right there lots of uh silver\nsome grays the blacks right there and uh\npromote Decepticon symbol right there\nthere's like this little thing in the\nbelly and there you go and then just uh\nlooking up the back got all this going\non right here all right so that is the\nKabotes let's get down to transformation\nagain shall we lights so we got to take\nthese put them down the middle and put\nthem put them back where they\nwere this will get flipped back down\nwe're going to take the combine mode\nhead pull that down rotate that back and\nflip that back in we can flip them\nupside down at this point they\ndefinitely recommend they got these in\nthe center so the legs so fold them out\nthere's like a little slot right there\nthis tab right here goes into for when\nyou're going back into vehicle mode so\nyou rotate that down\noh flip those back in yep okay now you\ngot like a little things try to pull it\nout right there you better off just\npushing right here to get the foot to\ncome out do that and then Yep push like\nthat or you can use your fingernail\nright there get the heel to come out and\nthen you rotate that forward and uh put\nthat there and then second purse just\nlike the first pull that\nout push the foot out push the heel out\nput that in rotate that and um yeah\nthat's a weird looking superhero type of\nthing goop from this perspective it kind\nof looks like an eagle it reminds me of\nan eagle face or something that's funny\nanyway so we'll flip his hands back in\nwe're going to rotate these down pull it\nto the mouth rotate that down put that\nout and on a soft click so you got just\ndo that to this to engage the elbow\njoint and then we'll pull on this and\nthen push that out to flip the head out\nwe'll put the wings out a little bit\nfurther and\nuh so essentially yep there you go that\nis Mr collector the first off center in\nhis robot mode he's quite fat in robot\nmode look at how beefy and big and tall\nhe is he's just all over the place here\nso let's get a closer look and look at\nlook at the details not at that belly\nbut at the head that there's no enough\nwith the big jokes i'm not going to take\nany more big jokes to the narrator or\nthe\naudience is\nthat all\nright no actually you know what that\ncame in perfect time so we get great\nWell there you go yes so we get great\nlook at the head sculpt there lots of uh\nreds and silvers and the eyes are red on\nthe red as well and then yep lots of\ngood molding detail over Papey forearms\nred shoulders blue orange and the faux\ncockpit and then going down there got\nlots of uh the blues and even some\ndetails on the uh a little bit of detail\non the feet and uh going back up the\nside little bit of uh more detail on the\nheel and uh all that and uh with that\nparticular type of landing gear he's got\nthis look going on and that's uh\ndecently cool all right\nanyway\nso articulation wise what have we got\ni'm going to tell you so the head is on\nball joint so you got you got a little\nbit of wiggly wiggly wiggly right there\ncan look up a tiny bit uh he can't\nreally look down on just a little bit if\nyou use that transformation joint at\nleast a little bit he can get to\nsquirrel and hunch into his shoulders\nand hard to rotate a full 360 uh these\nwings can move in and out depending on\nthe how you want them the arms can\nrotate a full 360 on a ratcheted joint\nand they can move and they ar move in\nand out on that ratchet joint you got\nbicep rotation and then you have\nuh slightly under 90 degrees bend there\nat the elbow uh the hands do not rotate\nbut you can put them upward if that's of\nany use to you uh there's no waist\nrotation the way he transforms and then\nlegs can move forward that far and um\nback that far and outward\nyeah you can do the full splits and then\nsome you got thigh rotation and then\nuh you got full you got full range of\nknee movement right\nthere and then\nuh feet uh can't really move up beyond\nthe certain point on the uh foot but\nthey can move down quite a lot and the\nuh heel joint can move down and up there\nas well\nall right so let's talk about the uh\nweaponry once again so the big feet and\nthe big guns so you have uh ports on\neither Popeye form right there if you\nwant to remove these they can uh expose\na couple of five mess right there and\nthen you can be stored in the hands or\nin the uh forearms be like\nuh some sort of\nuh knifer dagger i don't know there you\ngo there's that option they definitely\nshould they're definitely better off\nback there all right so typically the\nguns will be stored on the Papey\nforearms in a way similar to uh the\nseekers so you got that going on and uh\njust when in storage mode I just like\nhaving them uh flipped this way like you\nknow it's like you know they're not\nengaged so I feel like that works\ndecently well and then uh yep these you\ncan just you can put them in the\nforearms or you can just uh put them in\nhis hands and you can hold them like a\ncouple of big old blasters right there\nso you got your pew pe bag pew pe bag\nand all that good stuff going on right\nthere\nbut yeah I feel like the uh answer is\npretty obvious as uh get him to stand\nright dude dude come on come on dude all\nright but anyway\nyes these\nwhat these weapons are indeed Blush\ncompatible that's right so we get our\nblue effects here so pop a blush here on\nthe uh tips of the tips of his normal\nguns and we'll pop bushes into these\nuh bush okay yeah there we go yeah I\nthought they weren't gonna I thought\nthat was not going to hold for a\nsecond\nokay well that's a bit of a bummer why\nis that not holding there oh well um you\nknow what we'll just do it with the uh\ntwo guns right here just\nuh Yeah there you go all right i guess\njust that don't work out all right but\nI'll do this anyway so we can uh pretty\nmuch got ourselves a big old cracker in\nthe first\nand a kraken but now it's all cracked up\nto be\nblouch and now for\ncomparison here is Crash of the First\nwith the CCA2 and\nSonu\nwith Christian Prime and Octopus\nPrime that's definitely a good size\ncomparison right there so there is cr of\nthe first in comparison with the all by\ncombiner team wave fire shot roll out\narmorats and\nchapper and the firstly trio are now\ntogether in their dynamic group shot so\nKatr the first path the first and\nscoundrel as vessel the first and here\nis crack the first with\ndecept and little cracker it's like a\nlittle family going on right here isn't\nit and here is Cracktor with the Gwen\nMakoto and Crusher and here he is with\nthe Screamer and the\nMegs let's see what See how big they are\nthe big boys are in town again it sure\nlooks like\nit and then of\ncourse here he is in comparison with\nCombiner Wars\nSilverbbo okay that's looking good yep\nand then of course last but not least\nbut most importantly here he is with\nTransformer Cybertron Thundercracker\nbecause it's you know what it is it's\nprecious so there you go and there you\nhave big old character the first and I\nsay yes quite a decent big old figure\nright there the joints are secure and uh\nhe's got like quite all the physique\ngoing on and just uh just there's quite\na bit of appeal to this big guy i mean\njust uh hey how high he can get as far\nas he can go without actually feeling a\nbit dizzy because that's how it started\nout when he went from Deluxe class to\nVoyager class he got dizzy quite a bit\nso of course he just feels sensitive\nabout his height and then you got to\nfeel empathy for those that uh just have\na hard time well being short like\nLightning Bliss but just still give him\nrespect appreciation me no offense\nanyway this you know big guy this big\nbad guy right here so of course I have\nright to mess with this guy\nanyway so yeah this essentially get\nquite a decent figure and obviously\nwe're gonna have a good time with the\ncombined mode in a little while so uh\nyeah there you go now I picked this up\nat Target now these figures are pick are\npopping up in your Targets your Walmarts\nyour Amazon.com the Big Bad Toy Store\nEntertainment Earth and all other toys\nsell toys things whatnot and uh don't\nforget to look me up for look me up on\nblue sky and of course uh find me on the\nquick light i'll put all the links to\nthose and uh where you can read the bio\nof this if you didn't read the box in\nthe description down below and uh yeah I\nthink that's pretty much it so this is\nTransformers Legacy Diverg Mr corrector\nthe first and this is Jesus Christ ch\nyou prime s remember you don't stop play\nbecause you grow you go because you play\nbe g be proud and crush the\ncracker all right everyone listen up we\nhad a quite a failure the last time we\ntried in attacking that electric plant\nbut this time we will not fail i was\ndown last time because my wings were out\nof order and they needed lots of repair\nbut the time has passed the moment has\ncleared we have made more of all of you\nand we are ready to make the next attack\nmakoto still wants us to get what we can\nfrom that electric power pet so we will\ngive that another crack but also she's\nasking us to get more goods and\nresources and John from the active\nvolcano on the nearby island just off\nthe coast a bit of a flight but we all\nwill be able to make it we'll be\nable we will succeed this time my big\nbody forces here and nobody is going to\nmake another big joke about me ever\nagain do I make myself clear sir yes sir\nwe will do our best for you sir yeah all\nright then everyone get to your

to you better\nnot be thinking what I am thinking that\nyou are thinking as I me there is no way\nyou're going to be bigger than me there\nis no way you're going to be able to\ntake me down with that big gun of yours\nif anything that requires a big joke is\nto be made is that gun how is the\nweather up there you dang blasted gun\nit's actually looking pretty good right\nnow okay I need to work on new material\nuh excuse me pl Slav first sir yes for\nthis young fellow i just have a question\nif I may all right go ahead ask a\nquestion we'll give you an answer you\nlike it or not all right then

like we have a\nbit we'll have a bit more success at the\nvolcano and that we probably just\nwasting time so why don't we send our\ntroops over to the volcano sir oh yes\nyou know what i have a ship in\nthat boss lady it's her command we don't\nargue with boss\nlady and that's that's pretty much it to\nsay\nso we'll make sure we have a good number\nof our deceptic cloud and troops all\nover the
