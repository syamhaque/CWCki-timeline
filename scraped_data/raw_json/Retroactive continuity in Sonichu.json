In literature, \"retroactive continuity\" is a conscious alteration within a story's canon to change established facts or events within its continuity. This is usually used in ongoing stories to accommodate further stories that would not have been possible without the change in continuity, or to resolve chronological errors. While many comics use retcons to this outcome through use of subsequent revelations, such as Marvel's <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_Disassembled\" title=\"wikipedia:Avengers Disassembled\"><i>Avengers Disassembled</i></a>, or even large-scale cosmological events, such as DC's <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_on_Infinite_Earths\" title=\"wikipedia:Crisis on Infinite Earths\"><i>Crisis on Infinite Earths</i></a>, these are usually plausible in-universe and are done for good reason. However, nigh all of the retcons that occur in <i>Sonichu</i> are sudden, unexplained and usually unnecessary, almost always having been changed because Chris changed his mind about something, wanted to shoehorn a contrived new plot into the comic, or because <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">trolls</a> told him to.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Background\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Background</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Name_changes\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Name changes</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Gallery_of_retcons\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Gallery of retcons</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#External_links\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">External links</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Background\">Background</span></h2>\n<p>In the case of names, Chris changed many of them on the advice of <a href=\"/cwcki/Shigeru_Miyamoto\" title=\"Shigeru Miyamoto\">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Jay_Z\" title=\"Jay Z\">Jay Z</a>, who told Chris that they can't make a game with the names of real people. Even though he found out that <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">Clyde Cash</a> impersonated them, Chris has kept the name changes <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">\"just in case\"</a> Nintendo or Sega decides to pick up the game. \n</p><p>Some changes are a result of troll attacks, others come from Chris trying to appear to be a <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_race\" title=\"Chris and race\">tolerant</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Pedofork\" title=\"Pedofork\">law-abiding</a> person when he has unwittingly depicted himself otherwise. Black Sonichu was renamed <a href=\"/cwcki/Blake\" title=\"Blake\">Blake</a> after Chris was accused of being a racist. More notably, the iconic <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_Balls\" title=\"Sonichu Balls\">Sonichu Balls</a>, which play a major role in the later comic issues, have become Sonichu <i>Crystals</i>, after <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">\"gay\"</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Gay_4_Sonichu\" title=\"Gay 4 Sonichu\">\"fans\"</a> and trolls pointed out that it's pretty gay for him to want to get as many BALLS as he can to FREE him. Likewise, the infamous \"Rainbow <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler_(comic_character)\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler (comic character)\">Chris</a>\" image from <a href='/cwcki/Sonichu_1#Sub-Episode_2:_Christian_Chandler_in_\"The_Rise_&amp;_Fall_of_My_Heart\"' title=\"Sonichu 1\">Sub-Episode 2</a> was changed (bizarrely) to a background with the gates of Heaven when it was pointed out that rainbows are the international symbol of gay pride (unintentionally leading to the possible interpretation that his <a href=\"/cwcki/Love_Quest\" title=\"Love Quest\">Love Quest</a> is over because he's dead).\n</p><p>Another retcon, though more minor, is the updating of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu\" title=\"Rosechu\">Rosechus</a>' <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Rule_34\" title=\"Rule 34\">\"feminine physique\"</a>. In several places, most notably in <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_8\" title=\"Sonichu 8\"><i>Sonichu</i> #8</a>, many of the female characters have had their breasts and <a href=\"/cwcki/China\" title=\"China\">vaginas</a> more prominently outlined. This is probably a desperate attempt made by Chris to STAY STRAIGHT in the face of all those homosexual college professors, using <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(character)\" title=\"Sonichu (character)\">Sonichu</a> to support gay pride. \n</p><p>Chris has also altered the storyline in several places, such as the birth of Sonichu (explaining that they have aged in real time in the comics, due to complaints that 16-year-old Sonichu was having sex with 15-year-old Rosechu) and later adding that Sonichu and Rosechu got married, which would have justified their sex in <i>Sonichu</i> #8 (though Chris still fails to account that Rosechu would have been 17 when the two would have been married, which would still be statutory rape under <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_consent_in_North_America#Virginia\" title=\"wikipedia:Ages of consent in North America\">Virginia law</a>). Pressed to make peace with <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Mary Lee Walsh</a>, Chris wrote a new story on <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia\" title=\"CWCipedia\">CWCipedia</a> about how she and Slaweel are two separate people, which defeats the purpose of needing a separate name for a separate Mary Lee Walsh. However, in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Official_Videobooks\" title=\"Official Videobooks\">Official Videobooks</a>, Chris accidentally used the name \"Mary Lee Walsh\" on several occasions before quickly correcting himself with \"Slaweel Ryam\".\n</p><p>Chris has also changed <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_5#Alternate_versions\" title=\"Sonichu 5\">the ending to Sonichu 5, episode 13</a>, where the original shows him and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Megan\" title=\"Megan\">Megan</a> hugging on page 50 followed by a disclaimer at the bottom of page 51. It says that Rosechu \"sets the record straight\" by clarifying that the hug \"didn't happen for real\". Likely due to Megan telling Chris to back off, page 50 was replaced with a closeup of <a href=\"/cwcki/Sailor_Megtune\" title=\"Sailor Megtune\">Sailor Megtune</a>'s face, where she whines about how bad she feels for Chris, and Rosechu's speech was simply changed to a white box with the words \"to be continued...\". Interestingly, the version of the comics Chris posted on <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia\" title=\"CWCipedia\">CWCipedia</a> reflects the original, <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://archive.sonichu.com/cwcipedia/index.php?title=Issue_5/Page_51\" rel=\"nofollow\">with both the hug and Rosechu's disclaimer intact</a>, whereas the <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_5_Official_Videobook#Episode_13\" title=\"Sonichu 5 Official Videobook\">videobook version of episode 13</a> is the alternate one, with the grotesque closeup of Sailor Megtune's face and the edited page 51. In <a href=\"/cwcki/Quizzes#Sonichu_Quiz_2\" title=\"Quizzes\">MyBuzz quizzes</a>, Chris flat out points out that there is a difference between the \"director's cut\" and the other version.\n</p><p>Aside from retconning his own work, Chris also frequently attempts to \"improve\" the work of others. This mostly manifests itself in renaming of characters: <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Megan\" title=\"Megan\">Megan</a>'s character <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Megagi\" title=\"Megagi\">Megagi</a> was originally called \"Spunky Skunk\", <a href=\"/cwcki/Ivy\" title=\"Ivy\">Ivy</a>'s <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Layla_Flaaffy\" title=\"Layla Flaaffy\">Layla Flaaffy</a> was originally called \"Luckett[e]\", etc. In the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_Personal_Sonichu_Presentation\" title=\"CWC Personal Sonichu Presentation\">CWC Personal Sonichu Presentation</a> Chris takes things in another direction by trying to \"fix\" a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Troll\" title=\"Troll\">fan's</a> vastly superior artwork by redrawing it and making extremely minor changes. The most blatant moment, however, is in <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_10\" title=\"Sonichu 10\"><i>Sonichu</i> #10</a>, where Chris tries to rewrite the world of <a href=\"/cwcki/Asperchu\" title=\"Asperchu\">Asperchu</a> to be substantially more one-dimensional and boring. This stems from his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Autistic\" title=\"Autistic\">ludicrous</a> belief that cartoon characters are real (as in, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">they literally exist on another plane of existence and the events in the comics have actual consequences</a>), and he believes that he needs to \"fix\" his characters, lest the comics drawn by others somehow change them.\n</p><p>Chris has also attempted to retcon the actual events of his life, whenever convenient. While it's likely that many of the stories Chris tells of himself are fabrications or exaggerations, there is little evidence to support either theory. What can be proven, though, is Chris's alterations to his <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia\" title=\"CWCipedia\">CWCipedia</a> article for <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Simonla\" title=\"Simonla\">Simonla</a>, which originally stated (correctly) that the character was a derivative of <a href=\"/cwcki/Evan\" title=\"Evan\">Evan</a>'s character, Simonchu. After Evan started to take legal action against Chris for his <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_copyright\" title=\"Chris and copyright\">misappropriation of the character</a>, Chris simply edited the page to claim otherwise. In fact, he claimed that Simonla was <i>not</i> based on Simonchu, and their myriad of similarities was entirely coincidental. He had simply credited Evan for the character because he was <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Autistic\" title=\"Autistic\">confused</a>.\n</p><p>In order to not appear as a <a href=\"/cwcki/Pedofork\" title=\"Pedofork\">Pedofork</a> for drawing Rule 34 involving the <a href=\"/cwcki/Chaotic_Combo\" title=\"Chaotic Combo\">Chaotic Combo</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Silvana\" title=\"Silvana\">Silvana</a>, Chris retconned the birthdates by stating that the eggs traveled in time to 1989.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:ChrisChanDamageControl.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"410\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/b/b5/ChrisChanDamageControl.jpg/300px-ChrisChanDamageControl.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/b/b5/ChrisChanDamageControl.jpg 1.5x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:ChrisChanDamageControl.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>\"I'm not a pedofork you dorks!\"</div></div></div>\n<p>Chris has also attempted to retcon the name origin of Sonichu—he states in <a href=\"/cwcki/The_Sonichu_Chronicles\" title=\"The Sonichu Chronicles\">The Sonichu Chronicles</a>, that Sonichu's name is NOT a portmanteau of Sonic and Pikachu, like it was \"rumored\", but rather a play on Sonic's \"Japanese\" name \"Soniku\"<i>[sic]</i>.\n</p><p>After <a href=\"/cwcki/Jackie\" title=\"Jackie\">Jackie</a> reprimanded Chris for his treatment of Alec Benson Leary in the controversial end to Sonichu #10, Chris changed the Asperpedia Four's fate in the comic. Now, instead of being executed, the four would be exiled to an Amish community for the rest of their lives. Chris showed off the new ending in <a href=\"/cwcki/Book10Replacement\" title=\"Book10Replacement\">a video from 30 October 2010</a>, albeit in a very rough form even for Sonichu. He ultimately wouldn't finish the ending for five years, also changing most instances where Chris bashes homosexuality.\n</p><p>He would also go on to retcon Simonla's death multiple times. He first did this on Facebook in 2014, saying that he \"revived her.\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup> She officially returned at the end of <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_11#A_Sonichu_Christmas\" title=\"Sonichu 11\">A Sonichu Christmas</a>, when it turns out that she survived the Voltorb attack from the previous book, thanks to a healing ability.\n</p><p>After getting in contact with the Idea Guys, Chris would make several changes to Sonichu canon. Mostly, this resulted in birthdates for some of the characters being changed to allude to <a href=\"/cwcki/Pedofork\" title=\"Pedofork\">pedophilia</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Nazis\" title=\"Nazis\">Nazism</a>, or <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_sex\" title=\"Chris and sex\">the number 69</a>, but it also established that there were <a href=\"/cwcki/The_69_Destined_Sonichus_and_Rosechus\" title=\"The 69 Destined Sonichus and Rosechus\">69 Electric Hedgehog Pokémon</a> that came from the <a href=\"/cwcki/Rainbow#In_the_Comic\"
