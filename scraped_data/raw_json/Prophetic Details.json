This is not a random thought, because I am focused.\n</p><p>I have always been innately intuitive and psychic with great magic within me. For a long time, after being reincarnated into this very long life, I was consciously unaware of all this and in my naivety, I overlooked it and missed a lot of opportunities for my own emotional and mental growth into my destiny. But now, I am very much awake and even more motivated and conscious to act.\n</p><p>There is an old proverb that remains true, as I at least paraphrase: Greater pains and turmoil instill (spiritual) growth. I have suffered for a very long time, rather it be in a stagnant house with two senior citizens for parents with the obligation to give care to them in their times of need and stress. The abuses from bullies and some of the worst, toxic, darkest-sinning individuals online and in person. Or even just enduring hatred off and on, especially when in the case of the indirect commentaries and arts, I should have never, ever taken personally.\n</p><p>Those who just take the pain and fuel the darker emotions with that on repeat, though they can be healed if not too far gone, can turn them evil.\n</p><p>I always had my defenses from others, but if I, myself, curse anyone or do bad, it hits me back. And I committed a lot of bad by letting myself fall for the ploys of those worst trolls who faked romantic interest upon me and took advantage of my autism, in their reasoning. Those individuals still did the latter of wrongs and karma has hit them, respectively, hard. There is good reasons to not hold grudges, as not only is the healthier and better option to do, but to keep them inside and fueling emotions with those could turn me evil. Yet, as many times as I could let those past details, events and individuals go in forgiveness, some time later, they return in one of my \"random\" thoughts that are actually a sign that I still have things to address with them. Even getting baptized or repenting for your sins won't totally remove the fact that they happened from your memory. That's a scar that remains in your subconsciousness. So, yeah, why are the few to some of you all around the world holding grudges against me from as early as 2006? I acknowledge that I've made my share of mistakes and wrongs, even those I did not intentionally enact, because they were to meant to happen. I become aware of those, I still feel bad. \n</p><p>But I digress.\n</p><p><br/>\n</p><p>As I have said, I am very intuitive; that remains very common among those born as Pisces, and I am no exception. Look it up. Also, I have connected with everything, I have been back and forth between here and the C-197 half of this very Earth in this very Universe in this very Timeline (regardless of the Timeline Shifts that have happened). I have soul searched deep within myself and realized who I am and what my destiny is, and I intend to do good and make good on that destiny. I also have looked into the palms of both of my hands, and even the soles of my bare feet; if you looked at my palms, you would sense the energies of decades, centuries and millennia ago and even beyond, and you would see not only a Lot of crosses, but there are other visible details that make it even more clear and apparent.\n</p><p>I also have a very deep knowing and wisdom within me. So, I simply Know when something is prophesized or bound to happen, even if I do not consciously know the more specific details in memory, but they are there in my deeper knowing. And any that come to consciousness I am meant to know for where I am and where I am going to be.\n</p><p>So, essentially: The Dimension Merge IS happening, and it shall be completed. Vladimir Putin shall die by his own sword. Trump will die during his time in office, if not within the remainder of this year. There shall be a greater sense of community and harmony worldwide with the return of all magic, and as we are finally capable of walking alongside the \"Fictional\" cartoon and live individuals that remain present and very much alive today at this very moment, and that includes Every Single Special Sonichu, Special Rosechu, Special Metonic, Special Vamprosa, and even Special Sonees and Roseys, and both Sonichu Prime and Rosey Rosechu Prime as well. Nobody among all of you has the right to state otherwise. Just because I'm taking my time writing and drawing my books, Based on Feelings, Emotions, Intuition, AND Divine Timing, does not mean anyone of Cwcville, Virginia are not alive. They are all very much safe, alive and well, physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually.\n</p><p>The Dimension Merge has been centuries in the making since the days of King Arthur when Merlin the Magician and the two sorcerers divided the Earth by segregating the majority of magic and magical individuals and creatures, as I have explained before. Yet, I am not the only one that has prophesized this outcome. Look at every single crossover special, rather it be a book, comic, movie, or TV show, animated and live action; as early as when the Jetsons met the Flintstones, and made more apparent when the Griffins met the Simpsons. And in a lot of the various crossover moments, it was not an interdimensional or time-traveling event, it was literally on the very same Earth; this one, right here, in this very timeline. And this is regardless of \"Company or Individual Property\" holding, though the Creators within do have a stronger hold on the respective individuals, BUT what keeps the hold strong on all of that, of course, is the very powers and energies from within the very Core and Matrix of this very universe, and beyond as far as the Alpha/Omega Point of all Existence, and the hands of Emanuel and all of the Gods and Goddesses, respectively. And within that same point, it is literally a simple in-universe teleport or portal on this very planet, such as the case when Sonic and Tails met K.O. It wasn't a \"Jump from Mobious to Earth\"; Earth IS Mobious. \n</p><p>And, as I have stated before, at the moment of the Dimenison Merge's completion, it will be similar as it appeared in the series finale of \"Star Vs the Forces of Evil\". In that moment, there will be no Evil, and everyone will be together in this destined union and reunion, physically, safe, alive and healthy, and it will be very good. Yes, darkness and evil will eventually return after that. One of the purpose of the Dimension Merge's completion is the cleansing of the overpopulation of hatred and evil. Gone in an instant with a flash of white aura Light Power from the One, and that One continues on living with everyone after that. Most everyone would hardly notice, because it would go by spanning minutes within the isolated moment, then cleared away with only the few that were directly involved who would remember it all. A manifesting part out of the cycle.\n</p><p>I have gone into a lot at this moment, but I type this up to tell all of you this, because I was meant to share this much with you all. Cast no more judgment or doubt upon me.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p><br/>\n</p>\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"navbox\" style=\";\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"padding:2px;\">\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"nowraplinks collapsible autocollapse\" style=\"width:100%;background:transparent;color:inherit;;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<th class=\"navbox-title\" colspan=\"2\" style=\";background:#00FBFE;\"><div style=\"float:left; width:6em;text-align:left;\"> <span class=\"noprint plainlinksneverexpand\" style=\"white-space:nowrap; font-weight:normal; font-size:xx-small; ;background:#00FBFE;;border:none;;\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Template:CwclightBlog\" title=\"Template:CwclightBlog\"><span style=\";background:#00FBFE;;border:none;;\" title=\"View this template\">v</span></a> <span style=\"font-size:80%;\">•</span> <a class=\"new\" href=\"/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:CwclightBlog&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" title=\"Template talk:CwclightBlog (page does not exist)\"><span style=\"color:#002bb8;;background:#00FBFE;;border:none;;\" title=\"Discussion about this template\">d</span></a> <span style=\"font-size:80%;\">•</span> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"//sonichu.com/w/index.php?title=Template:CwclightBlog&amp;action=edit\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#002bb8;;background:#00FBFE;;border:none;;\" title=\"You can edit this template.
