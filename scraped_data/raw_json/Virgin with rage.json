His <a href=\"/cwcki/Twitter\" title=\"Twitter\">Twitter</a> and Facebook updates in the weeks, months, and years since showed him sliding deeper into depression. An April 2012 post on Twitter stated, \"The virgin-breaker was a Great Milestone for me, and it made me feel more self-confident, but still, it was One thing. I still require my Sweetheart. :_( ...&lt;3\" In August 2013, Chris even mentioned that he was more stressed, and in <a href=\"/cwcki/August_2014\" title=\"August 2014\">August 2014</a>, the <i><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonic_Boom\" title=\"Sonic Boom\">Sonic Boom</a></i> <a href=\"/cwcki/Saga\" title=\"Saga\">Saga</a> – which saw Chris incensed over a very small change to a video game franchise and would eventually lead to him <a href=\"/cwcki/26_December_2014\" title=\"26 December 2014\">committing a felony</a> – began.\n</p><p>After the <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys</a> planted their ideas into Chris's mind, however, Chris had found a (relatively) more fulfilling way to conclude his <a href=\"/cwcki/Love_Quest\" title=\"Love Quest\">Fuck Quest</a> – by getting into a <a href=\"/cwcki/Polyamorous_marriage\" title=\"Polyamorous marriage\">polyamorous marriage</a> with his <a href=\"/cwcki/Imaginary_friends\" title=\"Imaginary friends\">imaginary friends</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Magi-Chan\" title=\"Magi-Chan\">Magi-Chan</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Cryzel_Rosechu\" title=\"Cryzel Rosechu\">Cryzel Rosechu</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Sylvana\" title=\"Sylvana\">Sylvana</a>, and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Mewtwo\" title=\"Mewtwo\">Mewtwo</a>.
