While many people have an independent or bipartisan opinion, one has to realize the true nature of Chris's decision-making: that Chris doesn't favor what's good for the working class, or any class, or America, or the world, but rather <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">what's good for Chris</a>. As such, he was against gay marriage because he hated da <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">homos</a>, and supported <a href=\"/cwcki/Barack_Obama\" title=\"Barack Obama\">Barack Obama</a> because he \"saw himself in him\".<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Another political insight is the vague statement \"I agree with gun control.\",<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup> despite Chris's numerous <a href=\"/cwcki/Death_threats\" title=\"Death threats\">death threats</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_Special_4\" title=\"Sonichu Special 4\">vigilante plans</a> that would require a firearm.

Nowhere is this more apparent than in the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Mailbags\" title=\"Mailbags\">Mailbags</a>, where Chris will often dodge giving his opinion on issues <i>every</i> voter should have an opinion on, simply because <i>he has no opinion</i>, though he did vote for <a href=\"/cwcki/Barack_Obama\" title=\"Barack Obama\">Barack Obama</a> in 2008 and 2012.\n</p>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">I disagree with more of the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(US)\" title=\"wikipedia:Republican Party (US)\">Republican</a>'s views than the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(US)\" title=\"wikipedia:Democratic Party (US)\">Democrats</a>.

As a result, he often came across like a weathervane, just repeating whatever opinion that most recently lodged itself into his head. His frequency of vacillating his opinion about President Obama is a good example of this; he first parroted what <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bob\" title=\"Bob\">his father</a> had told him about it, then he changed his mind because of a documentary, and then he reverted his opinion because of his father again.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Modern_Era\">Modern Era</span></h3>\n<p>Chris's political stances became both more consistent and left-leaning as the 2010's continued. This is likely a blend of his worldview changing with his new adopted gender identity and also the passing of Bob, leaving him with no omnipresent conservative voice to sway him. By the time of the 2016 presidential elections, Chris had become a vocal <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(US)\" title=\"wikipedia:Democratic Party (US)\">Democrat</a>. He does remain largely self-serving in his outlook however, he now ardently supports LGBTQ initiatives, though he at first still stuck to his dislike of gay men (rendering his support disingenuous at best) until 2015. His financial woes have also made politics related to welfare and state support a focus for him but he never forms thoughts on the subject beyond the vague belief that one party or the other is inherently good. Like many things with Chris, his outlook on politics is unbridled by civility or even common sense. In November 2016, Chris went so far as to openly call for the assassination of president-elect <a href=\"/cwcki/Pmurt\" title=\"Pmurt\">Donald Trump</a>, something even the most die-hard liberal politico would consider madness to say aloud.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Understanding_of_government\">Understanding of government</span></h2>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_politics\" title=\"Chris and politics\">Chris and politics</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:CWCVilleTrueFlag.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"150\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/2/20/CWCVilleTrueFlag.png/300px-CWCVilleTrueFlag.png\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/2/20/CWCVilleTrueFlag.png/450px-CWCVilleTrueFlag.png 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/2/20/CWCVilleTrueFlag.png/600px-CWCVilleTrueFlag.png 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:CWCVilleTrueFlag.png\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>What Chris's ideas actually amount to in <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">reality</a>.</div></div></div>\n<p>Chris's grasp of how the government works, much like Chris's grasp on <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">reality</a> as a whole, is very tenuous. One of the most telling examples of this is his ignorant stance on taxation and <a href=\"/cwcki/Monthly_tugboat\" title=\"Monthly tugboat\">welfare</a>. Because Chris is jobless, he pays no taxes. However, he still thinks of himself as a contributing member of society, because he pays <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_taxes_in_the_United_States\" title=\"wikipedia:Sales taxes in the United States\">sales taxes</a> on the massive amount of crap he buys.\n</p>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_money\" title=\"Chris and money\">My spending that money ends up going to others who get such welfare and all as well....

Chris also fails to understand that, in the USA, sales taxes are collected by state and local governments, while his Social Security Disability check comes from the federal government.\n</p><p>Chris also seems to have difficulty understanding what the true purpose of government actually is. The U.S. government's duty is to follow the will of the majority while respecting the rights of the minority, to protect its citizens from danger, and to ensure the continued prosperity of the nation. Chris, however, would like it to be totalitarianism and ideally to be the one running it, allowing him to enforce his deranged fantasies on the American populace:\n</p>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">All Men and Women would be paired up in straight couples, leaving none alone; any remaining will be saved for upcoming men/women respectively.

Chris's reasoning is simply that since he wants a <a href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart\" title=\"Sweetheart\">sweetheart</a>, <i>everybody</i> must want a sweetheart, and if everybody wants a sweetheart, the government needs to make it happen. Similarly, since he is uncomfortable with gays personally, every single gay person in the country must be forced into a heterosexual lifestyle.\n</p><p>Over the years, Chris has proposed a large number of laws, even sending letters to President <a href=\"/cwcki/Barack_Obama\" title=\"Barack Obama\">Barack Obama</a> demanding legislation against <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">trolls</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">homos</a>. This is completely futile for myriad reasons, but two are most pressing: one, the President of the United States has much more pressing concerns than making an insane manchild in Ruckersville, VA, happy, and two, the US President <i>can't make laws</i>. Separation of powers and checks and balances in government are concepts Chris has no time for — <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a>, after all, is a hereditary dictatorship.\n</p><p>Oddly, the closest analog for how Chris views his government is how Chris views his <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_religion\" title=\"Chris and religion\">religion</a>. He treats both the U.S. government and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/God\" title=\"God\">God</a> as things that can be completely ignored unless he has a personal problem, at which point they should immediately act as instruments of his will. He believes that both have a deeply vested interest in himself, often at the expense of everybody else.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris_on_patriotism\">Chris on patriotism</span></h2>\n<p>As established, Chris has a very <a href=\"/cwcki/Na%C3%AFve\" title=\"Naïve\">naïve</a> view of American politics and how the federal government operates. Despite these setbacks, Chris has developed a unique brand of patriotism he brings up quite often, usually either in <a href=\"/cwcki/Father_Call\" title=\"Father Call\">defense of his character</a> or dehumanization of his <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">enemies</a>. As a result, these stabs at <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingoism\" title=\"wikipedia:Jingoism\">jingoism</a> often feel forced or out of place.

Therefore, if <a href=\"/cwcki/Encyclopedia_Dramatica\" title=\"Encyclopedia Dramatica\">ED</a> satirizes <i>him</i>, they insult <i>all</i> U.S. citizens. This would become something of a recurring theme, with a later video claiming that any attack on Chris or <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">his fictional \"utopia\"</a> was equivalent to mocking any 'C-ville' in America.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-15\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">[15]</a></sup> On a shallower level, it's an obvious ploy for sympathy, a façade of reasonable nationalism that aims to make him the 'good guy', and by extension, <a href=\"/cwcki/Jason_Kendrick_Howell\" title=\"Jason Kendrick Howell\">Jason</a> the 'bad guy'. Thus, patriotic symbolism is thrown in, without really even considering whether or not it makes sense in context. Chris is patriotic simply because he believes that's what will win him <a href=\"/cwcki/Scale_of_Respect\" title=\"Scale of Respect\">respect</a> and reprieve. \n</p><p>His attempts to prove his patriotism are undermined, however, by his tendency to <a href=\"/cwcki/Twin_Falling_Towers\" title=\"Twin Falling Towers\">mock national tragedies</a> and his <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_music\" title=\"Chris and music\">complete inability to sing even the most well-known patriotic songs.</a> If anything, Chris's attempts to prove himself a \"true American\" end up having the opposite effect.\n</p><p>However, his bumbling enthusiasm isn't reserved for the USA alone. Like many Americans, Chris has contrived of a highly dubious ancestry for himself, starting from <a href=\"/cwcki/Anne_Boleyn\" title=\"Anne Boleyn\">Anne Boleyn</a>, a Queen of England who was executed in <a href=\"/cwcki/Pre-1980#Pre-1900\" title=\"Pre-1980\">1536</a>. This was almost instantly proven false when her ultimate descendant Queen Elizabeth I, also known as <a href=\"/cwcki/Virgin_with_rage\" title=\"Virgin with rage\">\"The Virgin Queen\"</a>, died in 1603, childless. Then Chris tried in vain to co-opt British, Scottish, and Irish national sentiment in his kilt-clad tirade against <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Surfshack_Tito\" title=\"Surfshack Tito\">Surfshack Tito</a><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-16\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">[16]</a></sup> as a means of intimidation. Also, while not a standard country per se, he also evoked his relation to the Cherokee nation in his infamous <a href=\"/cwcki/War_Paint_Video\" title=\"War Paint Video\">War Paint Video</a>. Finally, Chris attempts to use the fact that February 24 is Mexico's Flag Day to justify <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Love_Day\" title=\"Christian Love Day\">turning his own birthday into a holiday</a>; an <i>American</i> holiday. Note that all of these cases, Chris's total ignorance of other nations means he fails spectacularly at representing them and appearing patriotic.\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n<h2><span id=\"Chris_for_President.3F\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris_for_President?\">Chris for President?</span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Idealworld.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"197\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/a/a5/Idealworld.jpg/300px-Idealworld.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/a/a5/Idealworld.jpg/450px-Idealworld.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/a/a5/Idealworld.jpg/600px-Idealworld.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Idealworld.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Chris's <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">promised America</a>.</div></div></div>\n<p>In an <a href=\"/cwcki/October_2010\" title=\"October 2010\">October 2010</a> video, Chris outlined what he would do if he were elected President. He declared he would <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_money\" title=\"Chris and money\">cut taxes in half</a>, build \"soup hotels\", give <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Merried_Seinor_Comic\" title=\"Merried Seinor Comic\">senior citizens</a> increased funds for medications and special services, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_Special_4\" title=\"Sonichu Special 4\">restrict guns to law enforcement personnel only</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">allow gay marriage</a>, and <a href=\"/cwcki/TrollBusters\" title=\"TrollBusters\">form a special police force that focuses entirely on capturing Internet trolls.</a><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-17\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">[17]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Aside from his failure to deliver a good speech, this video also showcases his complete and utter ignorance of how government and taxes work. Building luxury hotels for the homeless<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-18\"><a href=\"#cite_note-18\">[18]</a></sup> and increasing social security for <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler\" title=\"Bob Chandler\">senior citizens</a> would cost a gigantic amount of money to do, yet he also proposes cutting taxes in half (again thinking that all tax is federally mandated), thus also reducing the amount of money the government can spend in half. Given that Chris probably has <a href=\"/cwcki/Honor_roll\" title=\"Honor roll\">no knowledge of economics</a>, he likely assumes that money can be printed endlessly without fear of inflation.\n</p><p>Chris's restrictions of guns to professionals only is a blatant violation of the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution\" title=\"wikipedia:Second Amendment to the United States Constitution\">Second Amendment</a>, which explains the right of American citizens to own a wide array of weaponry can never be infringed. While there are certain restrictions on who can own a gun and what types, generally differing on the state level, a flat-out ban on weapons would be found unconstitutional. Then again, Chris isn't exactly big on <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">respecting</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Asperchu\" title=\"Asperchu\">the</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Schroeder\" title=\"Megan Schroeder\">rights</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_31\" title=\"Mailbag 31\">of</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Niggos\" title=\"Niggos\">others.</a>\n</p><p>His departure from his previous stance on gay marriage is surprising, as he was influenced by <a href=\"/cwcki/Jackie\" title=\"Jackie\">Jackie</a> when he made the video. Despite his decree of equal rights, he does finish up his point by imploring <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">gays</a> to <a href=\"/cwcki/Sex_tape\" title=\"Sex tape\">\"keep it to yourselves in your room, just don't force it upon everybody.\"</a> Meanwhile, Chris can <a href=\"/cwcki/Fridays_After_Five\" title=\"Fridays After Five\">flaunt his depravity</a> in public to his heart's content.\n</p><p>While taxes, government spending, gay marriage, and gun control are all big issues, Chris finishes up his video by proposing his most important change: the establishment of a special <a href=\"/cwcki/TrollBusters\" title=\"TrollBusters\">TrollBusters</a> unit of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_the_Law\" title=\"Chris and the Law\">law enforcement</a>, apparently dedicated to finding trolls who make fun of people online, and incarcerating them. While a Cyber Crime unit already exists for the FBI, they spend their time pursuing actual criminals like <a href=\"/cwcki/Pedofork\" title=\"Pedofork\">pedophiles</a>, scam artists, hackers, and terrorists, not people who make fun of fat manbabies online.\n</p><p>Chris was also asked in <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_55\" title=\"Mailbag 55\">Mailbag 55</a> to list the laws he would like to see put in place. As well as stating that he wants a ban on smoking, he also wishes for all men to wear a <a href=\"/cwcki/Muscle_bra\" title=\"Muscle bra\">muscle bra</a> and that all women who are currently in a relationship should be forced to wear a ring. Not only are such laws inane and draconian, but the latter two would also only help <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">Chris's ego</a> and nobody else.\n</p><p>Also, the fact that Chris is willing to suspend constitutional rights and spend countless theoretical millions to incarcerate people that make fun of him on the Internet is proof that Chris is neither a Republican nor Democrat, capitalist or socialist, right-wing or left-wing, authoritarian or libertarian, liberal or conservative, communist or fascist, elitist or egalitarian, individualist or collectivist, religious or secular, extremist or moderate - or really any political stripe at all. <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_politics\" title=\"Chris and politics\">His politics truly begin and end
