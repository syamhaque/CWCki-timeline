Your digestive system is not at all connected to your reproductive system. When you ingest your semen, it will go straight to your stomach, where the acid in there will KILL all the sperm. Sperm are very fragile and cannot survive for long outside of the protection of your testicles.

That way you can later have a doctor put the frozen sperm into your wife.\n</p><p>Hopefully this has helped you in your quest for your future-daughter Crystal.
