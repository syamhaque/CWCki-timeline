This is just SOO FUNNY!\"\n</p><p>It appears that Chris doesn't understand the show's presentation of characters like Cartman. While Cartman (and to a lesser extent his friends, when they're in their more sociopathic modes) is meant to come across as a selfish little snot devoid of any redeeming qualities, Chris apparently views him as some kind of role model or example of appropriately entertaining behavior, hence his obvious pleasure at the comparison Vivian's video created. Further evidence of Chris having a positive view of Cartman appears in <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_35#In_which_Chris_tells_us_that_we_need_to_go_look_up_what_he_stole_from\" title=\"Mailbag 35\">Mailbag 35</a>, where Chris seems to see Cartman as a good Christian looking to save the souls of rest of the children on the show<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup>, though in <a href=\"/cwcki/Update:_2/25/16\" title=\"Update: 2/25/16\">some cases</a>, perhaps not.\n</p><p>Chris rarely understands any moral dispensed by television. When he does take one, it's because he's decided that it can be used to justify whatever tomfoolery he's been up to. Unsurprisingly, Chris often misses the original point completely. For example, while attempting to justify his attempt to pretend to be Liquid in an attempt to steal his girlfriend, he claimed that he was \"Wrong, but for the right reasons.\" This comes from another episode of South Park called \"Best Friends Forever\", where, after a satire of the Terri Schiavo controversy, it is stated that Cartman was \"Right, but for the wrong reasons\". In context, it meant that his goal of shutting down the vegetative Kenny's life support was the right thing to do (for reasons involving the fate of the universe that are too complex to explain here), but his motivation was completely off mark: he only did it because he knew that Kenny's death would cause him to inherit his PSP. Meanwhile, Stan and Kyle were \"Wrong, but for the right reasons\", as they wanted to keep Kenny alive in a perpetual vegetative state even though they should just let him die, but they were doing so because they actually cared about Kenny, rather than exploiting the situation for their own benefit like Cartman was. Chris seems to have interpreted this as \"If you do a bunch of bad things, like pretending to be someone else in order to steal their girlfriend, you are completely justified in doing so if your dishonest actions lead to a positive outcome, like proving that you are the TRUE and HONEST Christian Weston Chandler and getting laid\".\n</p><p>His fear of homosexuals destroying the future, incidentally, emerged from an episode of <i><a class=\"mw-selflink selflink\">South Park</a></i> called \"<a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goobacks\" title=\"wikipedia:Goobacks\">Goobacks</a>\", which was a satire on the controversy of illegal immigration. In the episode, a group of rednecks who had lost their jobs to the illegal immigrants from the future decided that the best way to get their jobs back was to destroy the future by making everyone gay so there wouldn't be anybody in the future. It should be noted that although Chris undoubtedly believes South Park is anti gay, the show itself actually preached tolerance towards homosexuals in the episode \"Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride\", which was only the fourth episode of the show's run and introduced the recurring character Big Gay Al, who has been portrayed positively in each of his appearances. In addition, the show openly supported gay marriage in the 2005 episode \"Follow That Egg\". Show creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone are members of the Libertarian Party, which is known for their support of gay marriage, and would probably be none too pleased with Chris's interpretation of the show's stance on homosexuality.\n</p><p>Chris believes that every fictional character in existence, including his own, inhabits some alternate plane of reality where they can interact with one another. This belief may have partially stemmed from the episode \"Imaginationland\", which depicted such a locale.\n</p><p>The episode \"<a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Queer-O\" title=\"wikipedia:Guitar Queer-O\">Guitar Queer-O</a>\" parodied the <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Guitar_Hero\" title=\"Guitar Hero\">Guitar Hero</a></i> series by depicting the rise-and-fall narrative of many musician stories through the lens of the game, and had characters treating genuine guitar skill dismissively. At one point, a character is stated to be able to play the game \"acoustically\", shown by having him play an unplugged <i>Guitar Hero</i> controller and produce an indecipherable clicking of buttons. This episode could well have influenced Chris's <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_music#Instruments\" title=\"Chris and music\">belief</a> that playing <i>Guitar Hero</i> is just as impressive as the real thing, and <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_Music_Video_Holding_Out_For_a_Hero\" title=\"CWC Music Video Holding Out For a Hero\">a few videos</a> show similar acoustic performances.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Other_mentions\">Other mentions</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Chris left <a href=\"/cwcki/IRC_(16_October_2008)\" title=\"IRC (16 October 2008)\">IRC (16 October 2008)</a> because \"<a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_Cancer_Show_Ever\" title=\"wikipedia:Breast Cancer Show Ever\">Breast Cancer Show Ever</a>\" was coming on.
