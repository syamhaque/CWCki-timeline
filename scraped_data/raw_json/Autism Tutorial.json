The levels, just as most of Chris's other <i>LittleBigPlanet</i> projects, consist entirely of non-interactive cutscenes. Due to Chris's <a href=\"/cwcki/100_2357.MOV\" title=\"100 2357.MOV\">break</a> from <a href=\"/cwcki/YouTube\" title=\"YouTube\">YouTube</a> around that time, he did not upload videos of the levels to YouTube, but others on the site recorded and uploaded footage of the levels.\n</p><p>In theory, the levels are about <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">autism</a>, along with an epilogue discussing <a href=\"/cwcki/Asperger_syndrome\" title=\"Asperger syndrome\">Asperger syndrome</a>, which is part of the Autism spectrum. However, contrary to what the name suggests, and in line with any project Chris takes on, he does not keep on topic but quickly moves on to bitter rambling about the main struggles of his life, such as his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/High_school\" title=\"High school\">high school</a> graduation, being <a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_places_that_have_banned_Chris\" title=\"List of places that have banned Chris\">banned</a> from places, and losing his <a href=\"/cwcki/Gal_pal\" title=\"Gal pal\">gal pals</a>. In classic Chris fashion, he uses most of the tutorial to blame everybody else for these problems, ranging from <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler\" title=\"Bob Chandler\">Bob</a> for seeding <a href=\"/cwcki/Barbara_Chandler\" title=\"Barbara Chandler\">Barb</a> at a late age, to <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Mary Lee Walsh</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Michael_Snyder\" title=\"Michael Snyder\">Michael Snyder</a> for banning him for his behavior, and random strangers on the street for not <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ego\" title=\"Ego\">acknowledging</a> him. He also refuses to accept that Asperger's is connected to Autism in any way.\n</p><p>The majority of the presentation pertains to Chris's abject loneliness, as \"quitting the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Internet\" title=\"Internet\">Internet</a>\" clearly hasn't led to the varied social life he envisioned. Chris also complains about the entire <a href=\"/cwcki/Ian_Brandon_Anderson\" title=\"Ian Brandon Anderson\">Ian Brandon Anderson</a> incident during these videos, but ironically enough, Chris's Sackboy avatar more closely resembles <a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris\" title=\"Liquid Chris\">Liquid Chris</a> than it does himself.\n</p><p>These levels were uploaded shortly before Chris <a href=\"/cwcki/File:I_am_tomgirl.jpg\" title=\"File:I am tomgirl.jpg\">announced himself</a> to be a \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tomgirl_Saga\" title=\"Tomgirl Saga\">Tomgirl</a>\", on 30 <a href=\"/cwcki/March_2011\" title=\"March 2011\">March</a>. The sackboy version of himself in these episodes wears the clothing of pre-Tomgirl Chris, including his \"classic\" sweater. This suggests that the tomgirl transition was rather sudden. He told <a href=\"/cwcki/Jackie\" title=\"Jackie\">Jackie</a> on 26 March that he had \"gone through an emotional 180, more or less, within the past month\".<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup> Chris's avatar does, however, have the long reddish-blonde hair that would later become a staple of his Tomgirl look (which, when combined with his <a href=\"/cwcki/Pedo-Glasses\" title=\"Pedo-Glasses\">Pedo-Glasses</a>, makes his avatar look oddly like Chuckie from <i>Rugrats</i>), even though Chris didn't experiment with this hair color in real life until around <a href=\"/cwcki/July_2011\" title=\"July 2011\">July 2011</a>.\n</p><p>In <a href=\"/cwcki/2016\" title=\"2016\">2016</a>, Chris <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC%60s_Autism_Tutorial_with_Director_Commentary\" title=\"CWC`s Autism Tutorial with Director Commentary\">streamed himself</a> replaying these levels in <i>LittleBigPlanet 3</i>, showing that he's rather embarrassed by them.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Videos\">Videos</span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/cwcki/Autism_Tutorial_Part_1\" title=\"Autism Tutorial Part 1\">Part 1</a> - Chris reads off the <a href=\"/cwcki/Wikipedia\" title=\"Wikipedia\">Wikipedia</a> entry on autism.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Autism_Tutorial_Part_2\" title=\"Autism Tutorial Part 2\">Part 2</a> - Chris rambles about how he wants to be treated.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Autism_Tutorial_Part_3\" title=\"Autism Tutorial Part 3\">Part 3</a> - Chris talks about himself and his experiences at <a href=\"/cwcki/Manchester_High_School\" title=\"Manchester High School\">Manchester High School</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Autism_Tutorial_Part_4\" title=\"Autism Tutorial Part 4\">Part 4</a> - Chris talks about offline socialization and how he thinks it should work.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Autism_Tutorial_Part_5\" title=\"Autism Tutorial Part 5\">Part 5</a> - Chris demonstrates how people should make friends before beating up <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">Clyde Cash</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Autism_Tutorial_Part_6\" title=\"Autism Tutorial Part 6\">Part 6</a> - Chris rants about the <a href=\"/cwcki/Friend_zone\" title=\"Friend zone\">friend zone</a> and a cure for autism.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Autism_Tutorial_Extra\" title=\"Autism Tutorial Extra\">Extra</a> - Chris mocks <a href=\"/cwcki/Asperger_syndrome\" title=\"Asperger syndrome\">Asperger syndrome</a> - and beats up Hans Asperger - because he doesn't like the way the word sounds.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/CWC%60s_Autism_Tutorial_with_Director_Commentary\" title=\"CWC`s Autism Tutorial with Director Commentary\">Great Director Commentary</a> - uploaded in 2016.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Jackie_E-mails_24\" title=\"Jackie E-mails 24\">Jackie E-mails 24</a></span>\n</li>\n</ol></div>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCached time: 20240818230234\nCache expiry: 86400\nReduced expiry: false\nComplications: []\nCPU time usage: 0.058 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.298 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 59/1000000\nPost‐expand include size: 0/2097152 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 2/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/100\nUnstrip recursion depth: 0/20\nUnstrip post‐expand size: 299/5000000 bytes\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%    0.000      1 -total\n-->\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key cwcki-1_:pcache:idhash:15245-0!canonical and timestamp 20240818230233 and revision id 326105.
