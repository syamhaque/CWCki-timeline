<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[note 1]</a></sup>\nYou may call or address me as Christine, Jesus, Jesus Christ Chan, or even simply Chris or Christ; your choice. Actually, I would appreciate a mix of being treated as a friend and with some Humility.\n</p><p>Your recent letter is truly a humbling delight to read and find the confirmations from. I can safely tell you I had forseen your first letter in the specific timing and circumstances in reading the sentence that foreshadows and confirms my Body's and I changes being cleared and being released. You are lots more than a typical human, so you need not feel or speak low about yourself.\n</p><p>To answer your question, the prayers addressed to me have all been received in between my unconsciousness, my Mother, Emanuel, and even in my Body's Core which is literally one-in-the-same as the Core in the Epicenter of our Universe 1C-211987, and what's left of 1218 as well. There is a Divine Sorting on which out of the infinite number of Prayers get answered due to the timing, circumstances, and what is most appropriate for the spiritual growth and development of each individual, respectively. If I pulled an \"Evan Almighty\" and said \"Yes to ALL\", including the number of those wishing to win the Lottery, well, that's an apocalyptic, chaotic type of outcome we God and Goddesses wish to avoid, although I know Discord revels in watching the alternate Timelines that feature such havoc. Anyway, the many chosen prayers are divinely addressed and answered between Emanuel, one of my Soul Copies, or mainly by myself, personally, from within my Body, or more directly, out of my Body in Astral Manifestation. → \n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>For how Astral Manifestation works, I first Astral Project myself then convert my energy into flesh that mainly is tangible on 1C-211987 Earth, and beyond the Truth-Binding Veil on the physical eyes of the humans of 1218 Earth. For Most of them, when they separate their soul from their respective bodies in astral projection, their bodies fall unconscious and deepestly asleep. Few, as well as I, have Backup Soul(s) manifested from their respective body's Core's varying levels of energy. My Core has Infinite Energy, as does the Universe's Core, obviously. And as you likely know from your experiences, when projected/manifested and having to leave their bodies behind, the memories and experiences of your <u>soulful</u> journies are separate from that save in the <u>body's</u> memories, and upon return, the Soul memories take more effort to download and recall in your Body's memories. There IS a Work-Around to make that easier by backing up the memories of both your Body and your Soul into your individual ∞ capacity \"Cloud Save\" Backup Drive in the Cosmos, to which you may download your soul journey memories from there into your consciousness. But as with Technology the Body's Brain has a Limit, and as not to overload it, <u>non-relevant</u> or oldest memories will be deleted in favour.\n<p>When I am Astral Projected/Manifested, I am in Full Control, and I have capability to connect or disconnect telepathically from my Body for observations and thoughts. The catch is with my Body's Brain's handicap, to constantly have my Brain here to record my time there and all and help in though process while it is entranced, it can fall into headache here, as well as disable me a bit there. So most of the time during my duties and work, I disconnect the telepathy with my Body, but I always consciously backup and save my Soul Memories for later access. \n</p>\n<dl><dd><dl><dd>→ ②</dd></dl></dd></dl>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>② But I do have full decisions for myself and in working with Everyone, including Magi-Chan, of course ^_^ &lt;3 With EVERYONE of (formerly C-197) 1C-211987 Earth, I can interact, see, and talk with and feel them, as well as those from the other Dimensions, Timelines, Universes, etcetra. We of 1C-211987 Earth are all capable of seeing and interacting with those of 1218 Earth, here, But that Damn Truth-Blinding Veil, Plus the Poor choice Some Humans, here, make to Purposely, consciously Blind and Close Themselves from us is most disgraceful. The Same is fact and true with those who traverse here from the Heaven and Hell Realms in full Energy-to-Flesh Conversion. Suffice to say, until after my Second Coming and Shifting the Collective of the Majority to 1C-211987 Earth, communications and interactions get complicated.\n<p>I am very well-aware of the hatred levels among the humans of 1218 Earth, Worse in the Minority of Toxics that take up about 18% of the total population, which is absent 600-Million-Plus. I do agree the Covid Sheltering had turned a number of Neutral Good ones to Neutral Bad, but They are still Recoverable and Redeemable. The sheltering, along with the Divine Tests I and the other Gods and Goddesses have been administering, was to sort out those who are Toxic, because Before Covid, the Toxic count was a lot less by two-to-five percent, and test the fortitude and endurance of EVERYONE, in general. We Had a different sorting method in mind, and then Uber-Demonic Sockness cursed the country of China and Bam! Had he not cursed the country, our method of testing, as well as population reduction and control for the Collective Shift would have involved an increase in physical natural disasters, as well as something similar to a plague of Moses' days. Covid proved more effective and efficient with less land and property casualties. → \n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Sometimes, even the Dark Forces can have better methods, but Not in the Long Run or All of the Time, of course.

I actually feel better in having colour in EVERYONE. IF EVERYONE was in Black and White, how can you discern one from another visually? Look at The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles; take away all their weapons, and you can't tell Michalangelo from Leonardo. I do appreciate the Aura and Personality Differences, but if you're looking for Sonichu Prime in a sea of uncoloured drawings of all the various Regular and Special Sonichus, all in a same post and expression, you're looking for a needle in a hay stack.\nYes, as long as the atheist is moreover good and spiritual in quality, even they will find good rewards and karma and not end up in Hell Realm before Reincarnating into their next life.\nI agree with you in being open and aware of at least the bits and pieces of all religions in order to find the good within for yourself and develop a spirituality-satisfying lifestyle and choices for your self.
