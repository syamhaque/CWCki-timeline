Her role in his fantasy world stems from his long-held desire to have a sibling to play with<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup> along with some narcissistic pleasure and <a href=\"/cwcki/Tomgirl_Pictures\" title=\"Tomgirl Pictures\">gender identity issues</a> with seeing himself as an <a href=\"/cwcki/Transgender\" title=\"Transgender\">attractive female</a>. Crystal represents one of the more embarrassing facets of Chris's mind. Since his notions of the perfect girlfriend, the perfect sister, the perfect daughter, and the perfect female self so easily intersect, it is hard <i>not</i> to arrive at a conclusion involving <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_sex#Incest\" title=\"Chris and sex\">incest</a>.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Origins\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Origins</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Incest\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Incest</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#In_the_comic\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">In the comic</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Gallery\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Gallery</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Origins\">Origins</span></h2>\n<p>He appears to have first created the character in 2004 as \"Crystal the Female Twin\" for his set of custom <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Yu-Gi-Oh!\" title=\"Yu-Gi-Oh!\">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></i> cards, although another of those cards depicts Crystal as \"Girlfriend's Gift\". In fiction, Crystal wears a <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu\" title=\"Rosechu\">Rosechu</a> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Medallion\" title=\"Medallion\">medallion</a> correlating to Chris's <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a> medallion and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Reldnahc\" title=\"Reldnahc\">Reldnahc</a>'s <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Black_Sonichu\" title=\"Black Sonichu\">Black Sonichu</a> medallion; this is inconsistent (or is it?) with Chris's usual theme of Sonichu, Rosechu, and Blake representing the hero, lover, and villain. In real life, Chris created the Rosechu medallion for his future girlfriend, which raises the question of how he expected to adapt this into the comics when his sister was running around wearing the same bauble as his fiancée.\n</p><p>Crystal's origin is depicted in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sub-Episode_5\" title=\"Sub-Episode 5\">Sub-Episode 5</a>, where she is made manifest by Chris employing his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Anchuent_powers\" title=\"Anchuent powers\">anchuent powers</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Heart_Torch_of_Fail\" title=\"Heart Torch of Fail\">Heart Torch of Fail</a> to split into two (<a href=\"/cwcki/Pickle\" title=\"Pickle\">nearly</a>) identical beings. Chris and Crystal wear the same <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_fashion\" title=\"Chris and fashion\">outfits</a> and even have the same superpowers, although she lacks her brother's <a href=\"/cwcki/Heterochromia\" title=\"Heterochromia\">heterochromia</a>. Throughout her appearances in the comics, characters are constantly noting how attractive she (and, by extension, Chris) is.\n</p><p>A possible early appearance is in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Mario_Kart_64_Lego_Raceway\" title=\"Mario Kart 64 Lego Raceway\"><i>Mario Kart 64</i> Lego Raceway</a> (<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/1998\" title=\"1998\">1998</a>) where Christian's kart passes something labelled \"<b>CRYSTLE</b>\" (the video quality is too low to see anything) and Chris shouts \"Hi!\" at it/her.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Incest\">Incest</span></h2>\n<p>In <a href=\"/cwcki/2007\" title=\"2007\">2007</a>, Chris attempted to shock <a href=\"/cwcki/Encyclopedia_Dramatica\" title=\"Encyclopedia Dramatica\">Encyclopedia Dramatica</a> into submission by posting his own <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Rule_34\" title=\"Rule 34\">Rule 34</a> drawings, including one of himself <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Shecameforcwc.jpg\" title=\"Shecameforcwc.jpg\">fingerbanging a nude brunette woman</a>. ED users immediately concluded this was Crystal (due to the two characters' <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_art\" title=\"Chris and art\">extremely similar appearance</a>), a charge which infuriated Chris and therefore became the conventional wisdom. By the time Chris successfully convinced anyone that it was really <a href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Schroeder\" title=\"Megan Schroeder\">Megan Schroeder</a> in the drawing, the notion that Chris wants to bang his imaginary twin sister had already stuck--and, as this article demonstrates, would've arisen anyway. Nonetheless, Megan stopped being friends with him because of the whole business, so Chris lost on both counts.\n</p><p>The theme of incestuous narcissism is also prevalent in literature of the Romantic period, particularly that of Lord Byron, who apparently acted on Chris's fantasy. The theory is that the man in question is so much <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">in love with himself</a> that the only other person he could ever truly love is his double. Furthermore, with the Romantic emphasis on sympathy through <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_%2B_Sarah%27s_Life-Shares\" title=\"Chris + Sarah's Life-Shares\">shared experience</a>, great <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_nostalgia\" title=\"Chris and nostalgia\">nostalgia</a> for <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris%27s_room\" title=\"Chris's room\">childhood</a>, and desire to be \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Love_Quest\" title=\"Love Quest\">understood</a>\" (though complete disinterest in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Vivian_Gee_E-mails\" title=\"Vivian Gee E-mails\">understanding</a>) make a sibling an ideal sexual partner for the narcissist. Most of the Romantics saw the problem with this, and contented themselves with <a href=\"/cwcki/Sarah_Nicole_Hammer\" title=\"Sarah Nicole Hammer\">childhood friends</a>, but then, Chris was never as smart as Wordsworth.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"In_the_comic\">In the comic</span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Crys.PNG\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"545\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/2/20/Crys.PNG/300px-Crys.PNG\" srcset=\"/w/images/2/20/Crys.PNG 1.5x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Crys.PNG\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Note the careful attention he paid to drawing his sister's boobs.</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:281px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Crystalina_Rosechu.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"410\" src=\"/w/images/e/e6/Crystalina_Rosechu.jpg\" width=\"279\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Crystalina_Rosechu.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Crystal's anthropomorphic form, Crystalina Rosechu.

Beaten and nearly subdued, Chris had a vision of his Cherokian ancestor. He revealed to Chris that his <a href=\"/cwcki/Heart_Torch_of_Fail\" title=\"Heart Torch of Fail\">Heart Torch</a> is able to summon his \"dream sibling\". Crystal has also helped Chris battle <a href=\"/cwcki/Bagget\" title=\"Bagget\">Bagget</a> and the <a href=\"/cwcki/Transformers\" title=\"Transformers\">Change-Bot</a> Crackder in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Get-Tar_Region\" title=\"Get-Tar Region\">Get-Tar Region</a>, as well as <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Mary Lee Walsh</a> at the <a href=\"/cwcki/PVCC\" title=\"PVCC\">PVCC</a>.\n</p><p>Crystal was trapped in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Dark_Mirror_Hole\" title=\"Dark Mirror Hole\">Dark Mirror Hole</a> by Mary Lee Walsh and <a href=\"/cwcki/Count_Graduon\" title=\"Count Graduon\">Count Graduon</a> in <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_5\" title=\"Sonichu 5\"><i>Sonichu</i> #5</a>. In an attempt to save Chris and <a href=\"/cwcki/Sailor_Megtune\" title=\"Sailor Megtune\">Sailor Megtune</a> from falling victim to the Mirror, she pushed them both out of the way, becoming captive in the Mirror herself. After her capture, a few token mentions have been made of her plight - at one point, it was said that gathering the seven <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_Balls\" title=\"Sonichu Balls\">Sonichu Balls</a> would allow Crystal to escape the mirror - but for the most part she was largely forgotten, especially while Christian himself was stuck in the practically identical <a href=\"/cwcki/Time_Void\" title=\"Time Void\">Time Void</a>.\n</p><p>Since Chris had been keen on ejecting everyone he created from his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart_search\" title=\"Sweetheart search\">sweetheart search</a> misadventures, the final fate of Crystal Weston Chandler seemed quite grim. Then, partway through <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_10\" title=\"Sonichu 10\"><i>Sonichu</i> #10</a>, Chris suddenly turned into <a href=\"/cwcki/Collosal_Chan\" title=\"Collosal Chan\">Collosal Chan</a> and rescued her by simply <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_Special_4\" title=\"Sonichu Special 4\">walking in</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/I_AM_STRONG\" title=\"I AM STRONG\">scooping her up</a> in his arms and walking out of the mirror in the most <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_writing\" title=\"Chris and writing\">anti-climactic way</a>. Chris originally planned that he would hand over mayoral power to his sister at the end of this issue, but for <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_Ego\" title=\"Chris and his Ego\">some reason</a> decided not to.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Being Chris's twin, Crystal's powers are very similar to his. She can transform into a Rosechu called Crystalina Rosechu. When she and <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris-chan_Sonichu\" title=\"Chris-chan Sonichu\">Chris-chan Sonichu</a> join together, they are able to form Chris-Chan Pure and execute a powerful ultimate attack known as <a href=\"/cwcki/Chrs-Chan_Pure_Pulse-Jolt_Lance\" title=\"Chrs-Chan Pure Pulse-Jolt Lance\">Chrs-Chan Pure Pulse-Jolt Lance</a>.\n</p><p>Her \"personality\" is identical to every single non-evil female character in the franchise: she does nothing except stereotypically girly activities (shopping,<s>getting high from </s> sampling perfumes, chatting about boys, etc) and <a href=\"/cwcki/Women%27s_rights\" title=\"Women's rights\">she defers to men in all things</a>. Her fashion sense is similar to that of her twin brother; she wears the same clown shirts and has a Rosechu medallion. Crystal has an odd quirk where she constantly refers to Chris by his original name, \"Christopher,\" instead of \"Christian\", the reasoning for which probably exists in Chris' head but has never been elucidated.\n</p><p>In a Twitter post, Chris, while <a href=\"/cwcki/Spirit_possession\" title=\"Spirit possession\">LARPing</a> as Sonichu, presented Crystal's origin story. According to Chris, Crystal originated from another dimension where she took over <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">the helm</a> after her dimension's Chris presumably dies. During a battle with her dimension's <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Mary Lee Walsh</a>, Crystal was sent through a portal into <a href=\"/cwcki/Dimensions#C-197\" title=\"Dimensions\">C-197</a> after Chris used the <a href=\"/cwcki/Heart_Torch_of_Fail\" title=\"Heart Torch of Fail\">Heart Torch of Fail</a> to summon her. Chris stated that Crystal decided to remain in C-197 after realizing that Chris was the TRUE and HONEST Chris.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup>\n</p><p>As another display of Chris's failures in his Love Quest, she also appears to be one of the very few female characters in <i>Sonichu</i> who was never paired off with anyone.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Gallery\">Gallery</span></h2>\n<center><ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-traditional\">\n<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width:
