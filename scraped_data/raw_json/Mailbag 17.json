Feel free to not answer the question if it is relevent to a future plot point, but if not, it would be interesting to know what the life expectancy of the Sonichus is.\n</p><p>2. Do <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Rosechus\" title=\"Rosechus\">Rosechus</a> go through the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Barbara\" title=\"Barbara\">menopause</a>?\n</p><p>3. Are <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonichus\" title=\"Sonichus\">Sonichus</a> and Rosechus different species? If not, what is the collective term for the species?\n</p><p>4. Do Sonichus and Rosechus base physical attraction on colour? There appears to be little or no physical difference between Sonichus other than their colour which is confusing enough, but they all have identical beliefs and similar personalities. Are all Sonichus and Rosechus sexually attracted to one another? If not, how do they pair up?\n</p><p>5. What do Sonichus eat? Do they hunt animals or do they eat grass?\n</p><p>6. Do all Sonichus have the same \"job\" - protecting <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a> - or are some of them in other industries? I imagine one Sonichu could probably power the whole of CWCville constantly. Is it possible for Sonichus to \"tap into\" their powers to use their natural electicity as a source of cheap power?\n</p><p>7. If Sonichus create electricity, does that mean that they have to <a href=\"/cwcki/Obesity\" title=\"Obesity\">eat more frequently</a> than <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonic\" title=\"Sonic\">Sonic</a>? Do they give off heat or any other natural by-product of power production? How eco-friendly is a Sonichu?\n</p><p>8. When a Sonichu's penis is flaccid and retracted into their abdomen, are they identical to Rosechus? Surely all they must have visible on the outside is a little slit. <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">Do Sonichus ever mistake each other for Rosechus</a>?\n</p><p>By the way, I liked the ending of <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_9\" title=\"Sonichu 9\">Sonichu 9</a>.
