I actually just got into upstate New York early this morning, I'm visiting my friend Heidi, I'm soo tired here. Heidi was my friend in grade school but went to a different high school and we lost touch, but then last year we discovered we had a class together! We've become so close since then, if I ever get married she's going to be my maid of honor. We spent most of today just lounging around talking because I'm so tired from driving, but tomorrow we're going around town and out to dinner and stuff. Toronto was fun but went by too fast. I'm spending the next few days here in New York, then we're going to visit another friend in Rhode Island, then coming back and heading down through Connecticut to visit ANOTHER friend. Long road trip... but rewarding.\n</p><p>Heidi has a DSi, she doesn't use flipnote but maybe I'll try it out while I'm with her. What's your new flipnote ID? I'd like to see your stuff.

What's your plan? You've got me really curious about it. Tell me all about it! And do you have a disguise for the video yet? Maybe you could wear like a white sheet on your head like a ghost or something, simple but effective. Just one idea, I'm sure you have some too. And make sure to disguise your voice, just make it a low grumble, that'll do. Those trolls are stupid, they'll never catch on. After all, they were stupid enough to talk about their plans with me in that chatroom when they hadn't even confirmed who I am.\n</p><p>But nevertheless, I'm still a little worried, and I'll feel better once you've gotten in with them. If you get the evidence on them, you can get them sent to jail for this credit fraud stuff... but you have to act quick, because even though it's illegal, if they go forth with it the damage will be done and your <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Playstation_3\" title=\"Playstation 3\">Playstation 3</a> will be gone. Even when thieves and con-artists are caught, there's always a very low chance of the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Police\" title=\"Police\">police</a> finding the stuff they stole. Prevention is a lot better than cure here, Chris.\n</p><p>I don't think my school has 5-year reunions so I'll have to wait a while for my 10-year reunion. You should call up this Tiffany, sounds like she was a good friend in high school, she probably knows something about the reunion. Or maybe go to the high school itself, they can surely tell you something.\n</p><p>I'll write a little more later today. Let me know what's up when you wake up!\n</p><p>XOXO\n</p><p>Jackie\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h4><span id=\"Chris.27s_brilliant_ideas\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris's_brilliant_ideas\">Chris's brilliant ideas</span></h4>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>July 26, 2010 - 7:55pm\n<p>Well, the plan is simple really. Firstly, I've already informed my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Church\" title=\"Church\">church</a>'s Reverand, Elizabeth and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Rocky\" title=\"Rocky\">Rocky</a> of the incriminating information on the JenkinsJinkies Talk page of the plot for Credit Fraud. They will be informing our local detective at the P.D. shortly by forwarding him that information.\n</p><p>I have recorded <a href=\"/cwcki/JenkinsJinkiesCwckiApplication.MOV\" title=\"JenkinsJinkiesCwckiApplication.MOV\">the video</a> earlier today, using a dark shirt covering my whole head (no <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Glasses\" title=\"Glasses\">glasses</a>). I've performed my own voice-check with my DSi's Voice-Recording Program; I've found the best method to completely change my voice is to go deep, and also pucker my lips while I spoke. It really worked.\n</p><p>Shortly, I will be creating a new e-mail address, followed by a Mega Upload account, for J.J., then I will inform the dude of the Cwcki of the video from J.J.'s e-mail address. Then it's pray time for getting IN from there. I shot in a different location, a decorated restroom at my local Goodwill.\n</p><p>Also, I don't have Tiffany's phone number, and I have searched online and could not find much current info on her (aside from what the Trolls are saying against her on the Cwcki).\n</p><p>What else has been good for you all in New York, New York?\n</p><p>\"It's a wonderful town; the bronx is up and the battery's down; the people ride in a hole in the ground. New York, New York.\" That was a fun song from \"On the Town\" starring Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra.\n</p><p>I'll check in again later.\n</p><p>Stay Safe and Sweet.<br/>\nXOXOXOXOXO &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3<br/>\nChristian.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Trolls_not_actually_breaking_any_laws\">Trolls not actually breaking any laws</span></h4>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>July 26, 2010 - 8:10pm\n<p><a href=\"/cwcki/JenkinsJinkiesCwckiApplication.MOV\" title=\"JenkinsJinkiesCwckiApplication.MOV\">http://www.megaupload.com/?d=UM0F9TJQ</a>\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #B48246; padding:5px; background-color:#FCC\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>July 26, 2010 - 8:42pm\n<p>Ooh, I like the video! Simple but effective. Good job getting that done today. But remember Chris, the purpose of getting in with the troll circle is to actually FIND evidence. You don't have evidence yet - the police won't be able to do anything with what's on the JenkinsJinkies talk page because no one has admitted to any wrongdoing there. In fact, nothing illegal is even at all suggested there, all the trolls say is that they \"could go to jail\" if they're found out, but that alone doesn't actually MEAN anything. So the cops will just turn that away. If you want to have something the cops can use, you need to get in and FIND something.\n</p><p>This is why I've been pushing you to do this Chris, because as things are now the cops won't have anything to go on. The cops aren't magic, they can't just arrest anyone simply because the person says something that sounds bad if it's not actually incriminating, which nothing you have so far is. So get in there and start schmoozing Chris, find out more of their information.\n</p><p>As for other stuff, you should try researching the class reunion itself maybe, Tiffany might not know anything either for all you know. And I'm not actually going into New York City, just staying upstate, close to Utica, actually.\n</p><p>Jackie\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h4><span id=\"Correspondence_between_.27troll.27_and_Jenkins\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Correspondence_between_'troll'_and_Jenkins\">Correspondence between 'troll' and Jenkins</span></h4>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>July 27, 2010 - 8:04pm\n<hr/> Forwarded Message ----<br/>\n<p>From: Amanda Hugnkiss<br/>\nTo: &lt;&gt;<br/>\nSent: Mon, July 26, 2010 9:47:51 PM<br/>\nSubject: Re: Megaupload file delivery: JenkinsJinkiesCwckiApplication.MOV (20.25 MB)\n</p><p>Ok, well, thank you for your application.

And that he had a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Gay\" title=\"Gay\">gay</a> experience at summer camp at 7; he was not thrilled with it afterwards. Years later, he has two dude friends who are gay, but he keeps them at bay with his straightness. Although, curious at 14, he asks one of them to do him one night, so that happened. And at the end, he was Terribly NOT Thrilled at all; to go into extensive details, he Came and Threw Up Simultaneously. Definitely Straight. I even felt like I was going to throw up myself from imagining the whole thing. I also came up with his birthday being on July 16, as well as a few other stories from when he hitch-hiked from Boston to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ruckersville\" title=\"Ruckersville\">Ruckersville</a>, VA.

Obviously John is gay, but I did not hold it against him in listening to his opinions. I felt sorry for the chicken that was killed, but then I learned it was a chicken that was going to be killed anyway. I also saw something else in that movie, the heavy topic of being Trolled like Babs was, yet justice WAS done to the Trolls (The Marbles) in the end.\n</p><p>I'll log in later to talk with the trolls.

I am game for anal sex, as long as you're my partner, and you wore <a href=\"/cwcki/Sex_toys\" title=\"Sex toys\">a strap-on or used a butt-plug</a> in me (as long as it is not <a href=\"/cwcki/Penis\" title=\"Penis\">penis</a>-shaped). I also would like oral sex, swing set, pole dancing (me, you or both at once), three-way (with two women), role-play, and others I can't remember right now. Feel free to suggest other sex-play topics, and I'll let you know if it's cool with me or not.\n</p><p>It's no problem; we're not having sex yet, so we can talk about it freely; you and I are close (metaphorically until we meet in person when we'll be a LOT closer). ;) You turn me on with your kindness and understanding, and your pretty self adds well to it. I want to kiss you, Jackie.\n</p><p>For now, it's a compliment, but don't hold back when after we hang out for a while and you want to kiss me too.\n</p><p>I'll TTYL.<br/>\nStay Sweet and Safe,<br/>\nChristian.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>July 28, 2010 - 3:55am\n<p>I forgot something\n</p><p>XOXOXOXO &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3\n</p><p>:)\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p><br/>\n</p>\n<table style=\"width: 90%; max-width: 600px; height: 70px; margin: 1em auto 1em auto; border: 0.15em outset #ff00ff; background: #ffdddd; vertical-align: centered; color:#000000;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"width: 33%; max-width: 200px; text-align: center; color:#000000;\">⇐ <a href=\"/cwcki/Jackie_E-mails_4\" title=\"Jackie E-mails 4\">Jackie E-mails 4</a><span style=\"color: #000000\"></span>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33%; max-width: 200px; text-align: center; color:#000000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000\"><strong><a href=\"/cwcki/Jackie_E-mails\" title=\"Jackie E-mails\">Jackie E-mails</a></strong></span>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33%; max-width: 200px; text-align: center; color:#000000;\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Jackie_E-mails_6\" title=\"Jackie E-mails 6\">Jackie E-mails 6</a><span style=\"color: #000000\"></span> ⇒\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p><br/>\n</p>\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"navbox\" style=\";\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"padding:2px;\">\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"nowraplinks collapsible mw-collapsed mw-collapsible\" style=\"width:100%;background:transparent;color:inherit;;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<th class=\"navbox-title\" colspan=\"2\" style=\";\"><div style=\"float:left; width:6em;text-align:left;\"> <span class=\"noprint plainlinksneverexpand\" style=\"white-space:nowrap; font-weight:normal; font-size:xx-small; ;;border:none;;\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Template:Emails\" title=\"Template:Emails\"><span style=\";;border:none;;\" title=\"View this template\">v</span></a> <span style=\"font-size:80%;\">•</span> <a href=\"/cwcki/Template_talk:Emails\" title=\"Template talk:Emails\"><span style=\"color:#002bb8;;;border:none;;\" title=\"Discussion about this template\">d</span></a> <span style=\"font-size:80%;\">•</span> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"//sonichu.com/w/index.php?title=Template:Emails&amp;action=edit\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#002bb8;;;border:none;;\" title=\"You can edit this template.
