People who do this are often referred to as <b>White-Knights</b>. White knighting of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris\" title=\"Chris\">Chris</a> is especially prevalent because of the sheer volume of abuse he's taken ever since he found his <a href=\"/cwcki/Encyclopedia_Dramatica\" title=\"Encyclopedia Dramatica\">Encyclopedia Dramatica</a> page in <a href=\"/cwcki/2007\" title=\"2007\">2007</a>.\n</p><p>Thanks to events following from the Idea Guys, most white knights now fall into a sub-group referred to as <b>Anti-Trolls</b>, those who try to ward other trolls and Tetrad members away from Chris to have him for themselves, rather than for noble purposes. These are not to be confused with the other sub-group of White Knights, counter-trolls, who primarily fight against trolls to protect Chris, rather to troll him themselves. \n</p><p><b>Counter-trolls</b> are those who take Chris's side to spite his <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">trolls</a>. Some do this because trolling one gullible idiot is less satisfying than trolling trolls, who actually have the ability to understand what is going on. Others have decided that Chris has jumped the shark and are trying to make everyone else leave him alone to put a stop to an old meme, which is effectively gatekeeping. \n</p><p>In the broader internet trolling community, a wide range of people, from neutral observers to even his greatest trolls, are accused of being white knights. This is mostly due to Chris's \"fans\" discouraging <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Weening\" title=\"Weening\">Weening</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Enablers\" title=\"Enablers\">Enabling</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/A-Logging\" title=\"A-Logging\">A-Logging</a>, acts which, to outside observers, could be misinterpreted as an attempt to reduce trolling. So when the label \"white knight\" gets thrown around, take it with a grain of salt. \n</p><p>A meta-topic within the broader Chris saga has been the merits of attempting to help Chris stop being a lolcow, and whether he is deserving of such assistance, or even beyond help. Opinion on the matter is somewhat divided on whether Chris is capable of improvement, although most agree that if Chris is going to improve, it will not be in any large part due to the efforts of third parties who only interact with him over the Internet.\n</p><p>Some believed that Chris was improving on his own, albeit slowly and in small increments, as seen in his gradual abandonment of his homophobia, which began with him declaring tolerance for lesbians, which he eventually extended to gay men. Others believed that Chris had not tangibly improved and that he has merely moved sideways, rather than forward. Chris showed signs of \"improving\" from mid-<a href=\"/cwcki/2015\" title=\"2015\">2015</a>, having found <a href=\"/cwcki/Impulse_Gay_Social_Club\" title=\"Impulse Gay Social Club\">a new hangout</a> where it seemed he was finally making friends and improving his social skills. Moreover, he finally found a way to cash in on his e-fame, delighted his fanbase by resuming the comics <i>and</i> made his dreams of a Sonichu media empire a reality, albeit probably on a much smaller scale than he once envisaged.\n</p><p>Since Chris's arrest for <a href=\"/cwcki/Incest\" title=\"Incest\">incest</a> in <a href=\"/cwcki/2021\" title=\"2021\">2021</a>, many of his white knights abandoned him, and he is now at the mercy of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/A-logs\" title=\"A-logs\">A-logs</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Weens\" title=\"Weens\">weens</a>.\n</p>\n<div

href=\"/cwcki/Nudes\" title=\"Nudes\">nudes</a> and the <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_Chan_Update_21_October_2008\" title=\"Chris Chan Update 21 October 2008\">video</a> in which he reacted to the loss of his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Medallion\" title=\"Medallion\">medallions</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Blanca\" title=\"Blanca\">Blanca</a>, many people, including trolls, felt sorry for him. They had not expected it to be possible for him to be trolled so hard or for him to appear so shattered.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Empathy\">Empathy</span></h3>\n<p>The internet is full of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Autistic\" title=\"Autistic\">autistic</a> people, manchildren, and self-absorbed morons. Many of them are right here, fascinated with Chris. All of them see something of themselves in him, whether it's his <a href=\"/cwcki/Obesity\" title=\"Obesity\">obesity</a>, his all-consuming need for female companionship, or his fervent belief that his homemade comics matter. A lot of white knights have made at least some of the mistakes Chris has made and have since wised up. They think they can help improve Chris by offering the benefit of their experience.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Circumstances_beyond_Chris.27s_control\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Circumstances_beyond_Chris's_control\">Circumstances beyond Chris's control</span></h3>\n<div class=\"rellink boilerplate seealso\">See also: <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_manipulation\" title=\"Chris and manipulation\">Chris and manipulation</a></div>\n<p>Chris fails to identify people, a possible sign of <a href=\"/cwcki/Facial_blindness\" title=\"Facial blindness\">prosopagnosia</a>. <a href=\"/cwcki/BlueSpike\" title=\"BlueSpike\">Julie and her brother Max</a> used the same voice, and yet Chris couldn't recognize that they were the same person. <a href=\"/cwcki/LoveYouLongTime\" title=\"LoveYouLongTime\">LoveYouLongTime</a> played numerous real-life characters, and yet Chris fell for every one of them. Pictures of different women were used to depict <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Blanca\" title=\"Blanca\">Blanca</a>, and yet Chris thought they were the same person. Chris believed that pictures of <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Fox\" title=\"wikipedia:Megan Fox\">Megan Fox</a> were of <a href=\"/cwcki/Vanessa_Hudgens\" title=\"Vanessa Hudgens\">Vanessa Hudgens</a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup> In high school, Chris memorized his appearance in the mirror because he had trouble recognizing himself.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup> Since he's never \"updated\" his self-image, this is a possible explanation regarding why he denies being overweight.\n</p><p>Chris's autism also means that he thinks, and sees the world, in simplistic, binary terms; he cannot easily \"read between the lines\" or detect sarcasm, or practically any kind of nuance or subtlety. He's interpreted <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Family_Guy\" title=\"Family Guy\">Family Guy</a></i> as actually being against homosexuality.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup> When two male acquaintances at <a href=\"/cwcki/The_GAMe_PLACe\" title=\"The GAMe PLACe\">the GAMe PLACe</a> exchanged sarcastic homosexual remarks, Chris concluded that they were gay.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]</a></sup> It is also thought that his decision to go <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tomgirl\" title=\"Tomgirl\">tomgirl</a> was at least partially due to him taking advice to \"get in touch with his feminine side\" literally.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_trolls_are_even_worse_people_than_Chris\">The trolls are even worse people than Chris</span></h3>\n<p>Another frequently heard line of reasoning is that the trolls have gone way too far, and have demonstrated that they're even worse than Chris, or at least equally pathetic. For example, BlueSpike's <a href=\"/cwcki/Julie_Reveals_Herself\" title=\"Julie Reveals Herself\">sadistic abuse</a> of his control over Chris <a href=\"/cwcki/BlueSpike#Reaction\" title=\"BlueSpike\">outraged even trolls</a>. The same can be said for the <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys</a>, who convinced Chris to do extremely degrading things, permanently damaged his way of thinking, and even tried <i>extorting</i> him. The less sophisticated bulk of the trolling was the work of <a href=\"/cwcki/A-Logs\" title=\"A-Logs\">A-Logs</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Weens\" title=\"Weens\">weens</a>, who are frowned upon even by trolls, and rightfully so. And, of course, who <i>really</i> has no life here: Chris, or the people who <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCki\" title=\"CWCki\">obsessively document and debate everything he does</a>?\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Attention_Whores\">Attention Whores</span></h3>\n<p>Some of these white-knights, the aforementioned anti-trolls, desperately seek attention from the community that surrounds Chris, sometimes faking their protecting of Chris. A lot like <a href=\"/cwcki/Enablers\" title=\"Enablers\">enablers</a>, these people cannot contribute anything to society and therefore will never get a Wikipedia page of their own, so the CWCki or Geno's Documentary series is the next best alternative. White Knights with attention on their mind often pretend that they are protecting Chris for noble purposes, when in actuality are trying to gain confirmation from the community through morally questionable techniques.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Arguments_against_white_knighting\">Arguments against white knighting</span></h2>\n<div class=\"boilerplate metadata\" id=\"incomplete\">\n<table cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"background-color:#ffff88; border:5px outset #06c4ff;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Stress.jpg\"><img alt=\"Stress.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"91\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/2/2c/Stress.jpg/120px-Stress.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/2/2c/Stress.jpg/180px-Stress.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/2/2c/Stress.jpg/240px-Stress.jpg 2x\" style=\"vertical-align: bottom\" width=\"120\"/></a>\n</td>\n<td><p style=\"text-align: center;\"> <span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms\"><b>This article is still yet to be completed due to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress\" title=\"Stress\">stress</a>.</b></span></p><p> <span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms\">We get a lot of stressful torture in our lives that makes us crash into slumber.

Maybe you feel like you have a solid plan that'd truly help break Chris out of his godlike delusions, and/or actually take steps in improving his life, all without any sort of ill intent whatsoever. However, no matter how good your intentions may be, you shouldn't even bother trying to do this, and there are many reasons why.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris_is_beyond_your_ability_to_help_at_this_point\">Chris is beyond your ability to help at this point</span></h3>\n<p>The trolls that allegedly wanted to teach Chris some unpleasant truths about life, along with previous White Knights who wanted to shield Chris from criticism while genuinely wanting to prepare him for the real world, have consistently come to the conclusion that Chris is simply incorrigible – nothing helpful that anyone says or does has actually stuck with Chris in a long-term capacity, while he is more than willing to pick up more harmful habits. Even <a href=\"/cwcki/Null\" title=\"Null\">Null</a>, the closest person who Chris had to a friend since the trolling began, and was the only advisor that Chris would actually listen to, came to the conclusion that Chris not only refuses to learn anything if it even slightly inconveniences him, but that he is actively malicious and will ignore you or betray your trust if it benefits him. Even medical professionals are believed to have a hard time helping Chris, particularly when considering that Chris was just as delusional, if not <a href=\"/cwcki/Messiah_complex\" title=\"Messiah complex\">more so</a>, after <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_mental_healthcare\" title=\"Chris and mental healthcare\">three months of time</a> in a <a href=\"/cwcki/Western_State_Hospital\" title=\"Western State Hospital\">psychiatric hospital</a> as he was going in. While Chris is a victim of circumstance, he can only get help if he actually seeks it, and that feels like extremely wishful thinking at this point.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"White-Knighting_Chris_now_takes_on_a_completely_different_connotation\">White-Knighting Chris now takes on a completely different connotation</span></h3>\n<p>An unfortunate shift in the character of Chris's Internet adversaries has developed in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys</a>' wake. Having caused Chris to believe himself <a href=\"/cwcki/Polyamorous_marriage\" title=\"Polyamorous marriage\">married</a> and a <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_religion#Delusions_of_godhood\" title=\"Chris and religion\">a goddess</a>, traditional methods of reaching to Chris, as pretending to be a <a href=\"/cwcki/Boyfriend-free_girl\" title=\"Boyfriend-free girl\">boyfriend-free girl</a>, have become obsolete. And in recent times, there have been an overwhelming number of people who are confident that playing make-believe with Chris will either help him in the long run, or will turn them into trolling legends. Because of this newfound confidence built by playing make-believe with Chris, it has been abused several times, and likewise became the means of weeding them out, regardless of their intentions. White-Knighting as a whole has taken a much more negative connotation in the Chris Chan community than it ever has before.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Protecting_Chris_from_specific_trolls_does_not_automatically_make_you_a_.22hero.22_in_the_Chris_Chan_saga\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id='Protecting_Chris_from_specific_trolls_does_not_automatically_make_you_a_\"hero\"_in_the_Chris_Chan_saga'>Protecting Chris from specific trolls does not automatically make you a \"hero\" in the Chris Chan saga</span></h3>\n<p>It goes without saying, but just because you divert trolls away from Chris, doesn't exclude you from being a subject of critique, as you have involved yourself in the drama in the first place. No matter the intention, interacting with Chris has always been discouraged by the community surrounding him. Chris's story doesn't really have heroes in it, anyways – it can basically be described as a sad tale of villains, victims, victims who become villains, villains who become victims, and those who watch the whole sorry story play out.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"White-knighting_Chris_is_not_worth_the_stress\">White-knighting Chris is not worth the stress</span></h3>\n<p>In order to get close to Chris, white knights have to spend at least as much time and effort as trolls to keep up-to-date on his activities. Most have to lie and pretend to be a goddess of another dimension, or a random <a href=\"/cwcki/OC\" title=\"OC\">OC</a>, to even capture his attention. This, combined with Chris's habit of pushing away anyone who tries to connect with him, is enough to make any sane non-psychologist crash into slumber. A key example of this is the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Enabler\" title=\"Enabler\">enabler</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/MKRNightVee\" title=\"MKRNightVee\">MKR</a>, who frequently came into conflicts with <a href=\"/cwcki/Jacob_Sockness\" title=\"Jacob Sockness\">Jacob Sockness</a> and his other enabling ilk while trying to warn Chris of the danger of letting Sockness get close – though for narcissistic reasons, as to some extent MKR simply wanted to keep Chris to herself. Regardless of whether they're white knighting for their own gain, or out of some misguided effort to help Chris, white knights will find themselves experiencing unprecedented levels of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress\" title=\"Stress\">stress</a>; this is one of the reasons why many simply give up.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris_will_not_even_read_your_message\">Chris will not even read your message</span></h3>\n<p>For a long period of time, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_manipulation#Blocking_help\" title=\"Chris and manipulation\">trolls had control over his e-mails</a>. Messages sent to him by white knights were often deleted before he could read them. Even back in the days of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag\" title=\"Mailbag\">Mailbag</a>, any emails submitted to it, if they even got published, would've been <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_29\" title=\"Mailbag 29\">given one-word replies and ignored</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Being_overly_nice_to_Chris_might_have_molded_him_badly_and_still_does\">Being overly nice to Chris might have molded him badly and still does</span></h3>\n<p>Tempting as it is to feel sympathetic for Chris (despite <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Affair_With_Mother\" title=\"Affair With Mother\">certain events</a>), doing so would only benefit him for all the wrong reasons. Chris's youth wasn't one without acts of kindness from others, albeit mainly people who were <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Manchester_High\" title=\"Manchester High\">well-meaning yet misguided</a> at best or <a href=\"/cwcki/Barbara_Chandler\" title=\"Barbara Chandler\">flat-out spoiled him at worst</a>. As a result of others generally opting to shield Chris from even the slightest negativity (<a href=\"/cwcki/Virginia_Jeanine_Sanford\" title=\"Virginia Jeanine Sanford\">with a few attempts at genuine advice going in one ear and out the other</a>), he has grown accustomed to receiving, or expecting to receive, nothing but complete satisfaction with no strings attached from anyone who gives him the time of day.\n</p><p>Not only has it led to Chris's tendency to become hostile to anyone trying to show him the error of his ways (and of course doesn't give him everything he wants), but it has also allowed opportunities for <a href=\"/cwcki/Enablers\" title=\"Enablers\">enablers</a> to entertain his bizarre delusions, only making him worse than he was before his online infamy. To make matters worse, it has even effectively created a paradox where benefiting Chris prevents him from getting what would <i>actually</i> benefit him (i.e. <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_mental_healthcare\" title=\"Chris and mental healthcare\">therapeutic aid he needs but refuses</a>), so even the best of intentions will ultimately yield no positive results whatsoever.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Chris_won.27t_ever_learn_his_lesson.2C_no_matter_what_you_tell_him\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris_won't_ever_learn_his_lesson,_no_matter_what_you_tell_him\">Chris won't ever learn his lesson, no matter what you tell him</span></h3>\n<p>Due in no small part to the fact that Chris had been mollycoddled by <a href=\"/cwcki/Borb\" title=\"Borb\">his parents</a> from the very beginning and had his hand held through school by <a href=\"/cwcki/Manchester_High_Leaks\" title=\"Manchester High Leaks\">teachers who were sympathetic to a fault</a>, he is flat out resistant to any harsh truths pointing out his countless shortcomings and the objective fact that the general public by and large isn't going to absolve him of responsibility for his antics.\n</p><p>He <i>will not</i> take a moment to reflect on his actions (let alone use memories of these experiences to avoid repeating the same mistakes ever again) because he is thoroughly convinced that <a href=\"/cwcki/Kick_the_Autistic\" title=\"Kick the Autistic\">he is a righteous victim of an unfair society that horribly mistreats autistics</a>, thus anyone who goes against his ideals (i.e. denies him what he feels entitled to have) is an irredeemable villain in his eyes. As such, he won't accept any words that don't match what he believes in and/or wants to hear, so even simply trying to be nice and reasoning with Chris won't convince him you're not a dang dirty troll.\n</p><p>Even ignoring the numerous altercations Chris got into during his <a href=\"/cwcki/Love_Quest\" title=\"Love Quest\">Love Quest</a> (resulting in portraying authorities doing their jobs as <a href=\"/cwcki/Jerkop\" title=\"Jerkop\">one-dimensional</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">villains</a> for him and his league of OCs to triumph over) and the brutally honest tongue-lashing he's received in <a href=\"/cwcki/Father_Call\" title=\"Father Call\">many a</a> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/The_End_For_Real\" title=\"The End For Real\">phone call</a>, a particularly notable example of a white knight unable to make Chris wake up and smell the coffee was none other than <a href=\"/cwcki/Vivian_Gee\" title=\"Vivian Gee\">Vivian Gee</a>. <a href=\"/cwcki/Vivitheg%27s_AIM_chat\" title=\"Vivitheg's AIM chat\">After <b>three hours</b> of trying to do just that</a>, she eventually gave up, understandably equating the experience with \"fighting a wall\".\n</p><p>Supposing that Chris <i>does</i> consider you to be trustworthy, that still doesn't necessarily mean he will benefit from your attempts to help him. A good example would be <a href=\"/cwcki/Rocky_Shoemaker\" title=\"Rocky Shoemaker\">Rocky Shoemaker</a>, who he considered to be better than a much-needed therapist yet consistently failed to follow just about <i>every</i> word of advice she gave him, her best efforts to prevent trolling schemes notwithstanding. Going back even further, Chris fondly remembered <a href=\"/cwcki/Virginia_Jeanine_Sanford\" title=\"Virginia Jeanine Sanford\">Virginia Jeanine Sanford</a> being his favorite middle school teacher, proclaiming her to be \"the most influential person of (his) life\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-7\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">[7]</a></sup> who taught him \"better social skills\", how to deal with bullies and so forth<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-8\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">[8]</a></sup>. He even kept her parting message advising him how to avoid showing others his \"weak points\"; and yet, judging by the fact that <b><a href=\"/cwcki/CWCki\" title=\"CWCki\">this mere wiki</a></b> exists, he obviously never took such words to heart.\n</p><p>In short, as long as your words are not 100% in line with his childlike and egocentric point of view, it's utterly futile to try and help Chris.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Examples\">Examples</span></h2>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/White_knight_emails\" title=\"White knight emails\">White knight emails</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"YouTube\">YouTube</span></h3>\n<p>Among the most notable of Chris's white knights was a <a href=\"/cwcki/YouTube\" title=\"YouTube\">YouTube</a> counter-troll who claimed to be a 21 year-old Russian model named Svenka. Via her YouTube account, <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/hottiee96\" rel=\"nofollow\">hottiee96</a>, she released an inordinate number of screencaps from troll conversations on <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_IRC\" title=\"Sonichu IRC\">Sonichu IRC</a>, including private conversations between Chris and Panda. She also released an image of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Man_in_the_Pickle_Suit\" title=\"Man in the Pickle Suit\">Man in the Pickle Suit</a> who would later steal Chris's first date, <a href=\"/cwcki/Emily\" title=\"Emily\">Emily</a>. Were Chris less thick-skulled and even slightly willing to accept irrefutable evidence, Svenka may have made somewhat of a negative impact on the organized trolling effort against Chris, but ultimately she was ineffectual. Svenka also had a unhealthy obsession with the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/CWCville_Library\" title=\"CWCville Library\">CWCville Library</a>'s original curator, Arjen Van Dierten.\n</p><p>On 6 <a href=\"/cwcki/May_2009\" title=\"May 2009\">May 2009</a>, YouTube user xThexPinchx/NorthxStar7/ThePinchisDaBomb tried to blackmail major trolls, claiming to have information on them. He was easily called on his bluff by someone who had not trolled Chris at all.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-9\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">[9]</a></sup> The Pinch has also threatened <a href=\"/cwcki/BlueSpike\" title=\"BlueSpike\">BlueSpike</a> saying he has information from his friends, forgetting the fact that BlueSpike <i>has no friends</i>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Facebook\">Facebook</span></h3>\n<p>From 2012 until 2017, Chris took to using <a href=\"/cwcki/Facebook\" title=\"Facebook\">Facebook</a> as his main means of expressing himself. Inevitably, this has not only attracted the attention of trolls, but, in 2013, a slew of White Knights as well, in particular, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/William_Elliott_Waterman\" title=\"William Elliott Waterman\">William Elliott Waterman</a>, who taunted the trolls to come after him instead of Chris (<b>Spoiler:</b> Nobody did, because nobody actually cared what he had to say).\n</p><p>However, as we've come to expect of Chris, anybody who tells him something he doesn't want to hear are people that needed to be brushed off until they stop saying those mean, awful things to him. A good case in point is his <a href=\"/cwcki/September_2013_Facebook_Posts#Chris_Expresses_His_Outrage_for_Walmart\" title=\"September 2013 Facebook Posts\">anger-laced tirade in September 2013, when he got thrown out of Walmart and started calling names</a>. The white knights typically chimed in with their support...<i>until</i> he revealed that he <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_the_law\" title=\"Chris and the law\">vandalized</a> an Xbox One display in the store. Several of them then told Chris that this was not right of him to do, and that the manager had every right to throw him out. His response to that?\n</p>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">They do not.\n<p>And if they do, they are most in the wrong, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">because they are most abusive and overzealous of their \"authoritative power\" that never has existed ever</a>.\n</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:11px; padding:0 0 0 16px; vertical-align:bottom; width:20px\">”\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\" style=\"font-size:smaller; padding:8px 36px; text-align:right;\"><cite>– Chris's response to Chris Rhodes</cite>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"TV_Tropes\">TV Tropes</span></h3>\n<p>The TV Tropes <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Sonichu\" rel=\"nofollow\">article on <i>Sonichu</i></a> used to have a white knight message as the first text of the article, with a link back to this very page.

Thank you for your time.</a>\n</p><p>In another move that was appeared to be White Knight-ish to onlookers, the page was also locked in order to prevent <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Weening\" title=\"Weening\">Weens</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/A-Logging\" title=\"A-Logging\">A-Logs</a> from derailing a page about <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\">Chris's stupid webcomic</a> to instead flood it with a trope list covering his entire life, with entries on Chris and the effort to troll him taking up about two-thirds of the page as a result of overzealous editors piling on an easy target instead of talking about the comic itself. However, the mods took action not out of a desire to protect Chris, but because troping a creator in such a fashion was strictly prohibited, and <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCki\" title=\"CWCki\">going into Chris's life in such detail</a> constituted an <a href=\"/cwcki/Honest_Content\" title=\"Honest Content\">invasion of privacy</a> that was in direct violation of the site's rules. The subsequent cleanup led to several <i>Sonichu</i>-related pages being locked, with the main page covering the work getting a milquetoast and somewhat insincere message explaining that the article was being locked over excessive negativity, rather than the page flagrantly being warped by its editors to serve a different purpose than what the site was actually made for.\n</p><p>Some <i>Sonichu</i> pages were eventually unlocked and the message was eventually removed, with the goal of actually providing examples of tropes in <i>Sonichu</i> being realized. However, following the <a href=\"/cwcki/Affair_with_Mother\" title=\"Affair with Mother\">incest</a> reveal, the pages were locked once more, and all discussion of Chris's personal life was prohibited on the threat of suspension.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-10\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">[10]</a></sup> The site even toyed around the possibility of removing all of the <i>Sonichu</i> articles and forum threads, but ultimately chose to (begrudgingly) keep them up.\n</p><p>A recreation of what that page looked like before being overhauled by the mods of TV Tropes can be seen <a href=\"/cwcki/User:Canine/TV_Tropes\" title=\"User:Canine/TV Tropes\">here</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris_as_a_White_Knight\">Chris as a White Knight</span></h2>\n<p>In 2017, Chris himself began (attempting) to white knight the crew of <a href=\"/cwcki/Planet_Dolan\" title=\"Planet Dolan\">Planet Dolan</a>, particularly <a href=\"/cwcki/DoopieDoOver\" title=\"DoopieDoOver\">DoopieDoOver</a>, after he misinterpreted one of Doopie's tweets about being tired of harassment from Chris himself as referring to <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">trolls</a> harassing her. To this end, he started the #<a href=\"/cwcki/HarassCWCdirectly\" title=\"HarassCWCdirectly\">HarassCWCdirectly</a> campaign in which he exhorted the supposed trolls to take aim at him and leave Doopie and friends alone. This might well have been a misguided effort to <a href=\"/cwcki/Love_Quest\" title=\"Love Quest\">win Doopie's affections</a> after she emphasized that she considers him nothing more than a customer, not even a <a href=\"/cwcki/Gal_pal\" title=\"Gal pal\">friend</a>.
