After their November break-up, there was a two-week interlude in their e-mail communication. In December, Jackie casually renews her correspondence with him, and Chris says that he is still bitter about the trolls and the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Internet\" title=\"Internet\">internet</a> in general. After a brief, lackluster interaction, there is another lull. Jackie wishes him a happy <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Birthday\" title=\"Birthday\">birthday</a> in <a href=\"/cwcki/February_2011\" title=\"February 2011\">February 2011</a>.

We're both looking into the future, you know how it is.\n</p><p>I guess I was confused when you said the internet was bad. What exactly about internet socialization is so bad? Is it just about the <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">trolls</a> you've met?

I know you used to do well talking to people there a long time ago. And plus, the thing about facebook is that trolling can't really work on facebook. Maybe join a group on there and chat up some new people, share your common interests.

It's a dating site for people that are kind of shy like yourself and are sometimes socially awkward, so they're much more open and understanding to your sort of situation. Now I know what you'll say, you don't want to meet people online, but this site has an extremely stringent scanning process to weed out fake information - there's no possible way for a troll or faker to get membership. You'll have to give your real address and other such information in order to confirm yourself, and everyone else has to do the same.

On the other hand, now the Trolls are stalking me through my PSN; they're claiming a \"bug\" is in my console, but the ONLY real bug was in my Friends List, with ANY of the latter being their \"reporter\".

At least since\nFeb. 25 when you sent me the birthday greeting. First off, the e-mails\nI am sending you are strictly confidential; do not share the content of\nanything I sent to you with anyone, including Lars. I have gone\nthrough an emotional 180, more or less, within the past month. In a\nnutshell, I have grown my <a href=\"/cwcki/Hair\" title=\"Hair\">hair</a> out, and continuing to let it grow. I\nhave learned the best term to describe me, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tomgirl_Saga\" title=\"Tomgirl Saga\">Tomgirl</a>. :) Yes, I am a\nTomgirl, and I am damn proud of it. I have embraced and appreciated my\nfeminine side. I am still totally heterosexual. Otherwise, I would be\na full-blown <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">you-know-what</a>. I also have had my ears pierced with\n<a href=\"/cwcki/Amnyfest_Ring\" title=\"Amnyfest Ring\">amythest</a> studs (my birthstone) recently. I have been more\nself-confident, and I have a sweet sashay walk, hair and wink flirts,\nand I am greeting women left and right. Hello. ;) Also, here is\nanother way to consider me, I am a Ken doll any Barbie CAN dress in her\nclothes, and I would feel most comfortable in them and to model them\nfor her. Come shopping with me, sweetie. ;)\n</p><p>In addition to this update, I am sending you some <a href=\"/cwcki/Tomgirl_Pictures\" title=\"Tomgirl Pictures\">fun photographs</a> I\ntook recently (Only Linnea has seen them so far, and I do not want anyone\nelse to see them either; strictly confidential between the three of\nus). I am being sassy in these photos; enjoy for your considersation alone.\n</p><p>Also, sadly, the local <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Police\" title=\"Police\">police</a> have been on my back, because a Troll is pretending to be me, in simulated voice, AND in IP address. I have unplugged my wifi router and cable modem for the time being; only\nplugging them in when I intend to go online at home. And my out-of-order PC Tower has been unplugged from power and internet. I am\nsending this pair of e-mails from a laptop at <a href=\"/cwcki/Best_Buy\" title=\"Best Buy\">Best Buy</a> at this moment.\nAnd at the moment, I am having trouble loading the AOL log-in page on\nmy consoles, so that's a bust at the moment. Please relay your replies\nto me through Linnea, or hit me on my cell phone (if you still have my\nnumber).\n</p><p>I have had you run through my mind now and then, Jackie; consider\ndashing back for some Tomgirl sweetness. ;)\n</p><p>Stay Safe with Love,\nChristian.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #B48246; padding:5px; background-color:#FCC\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>April 18, 2011 - 4:01pm\n<p>Hey Chris!

I know self-confidence has always been something you needed a little help with, I'm so glad that you've found something that gives you confidence and happiness.

Good for you!\n</p><p>I hope you're not mad, but I was so turned on by those pictures, I just couldn't keep it to myself... I showed those pictures to a friend of mine to see what she thought.

You know what, as much as I like having you as a friend, I would be willing to consider taking it further again, but I don't want to rush into it right away. Let's re-establish our relationship on solid footing and take it from there. And besides, I'm still a tad reeling from Lars and I cooling off, I just want to make sure I'm in the right place before I do a heavy relationship again.

I understand, and I absoloutly would like to take your breath away in full swing. On one hand, I empathize with you on the loss of that relationship and worry, and on the other hand it is good news for me to hear that you're breaking it off with him on the romance.\n</p><p>Let's do it better this time; I feel it most beneficial for you to call me on my cell at least twice a week; perhaps at about 8:00 PM on Tuesdays and Fridays (negotiable). I feel it better to communicate directly in verbal conversations over e-mails. I want you and me to meet in person as soon as possible, at least mid-May; I allow you the few weeks to recover, and it can be delayed with good reason and discussion. It has been about half a year or so; a newer photo would be appreciated. I've kept all of the previous photos of you saved on a little-used memory card here all to myself alone.\n</p><p>I took another look at them; you use a similar eye-shadow to what I use. :) So, shared makeovers between you and I could be something else fun to look forward to. :) I also feel uncertain of the nose and lip jewelary; in person, I would feel better if you leave them off only for like the first few times we meet, at least up until our first kiss (I am still a mouth-virgin in that sense), and it would give me something to compare later on if the lip jewelry would make it better.\n</p><p>I will also share something else with you in confidence; for a while after I had learned my word was \"tomgirl\", <a href=\"/cwcki/Barbara_Chandler\" title=\"Barbara Chandler\">my mother</a> felt uncomfortable for a while after I shared that info with her (being almost 70 and old-fashioned-minded). She got used to the idea after a couple of weeks, then I started up with the makeup, which did make me more self-confident, pretty and happier. My mother felt ill at ease upon first instance. And later, she told me that she would not complain about my makeup and tomgirl ways. Today, she was a major, complaining bitch; she hurt me heavily emotionally with that back-stabbing indian-giver attitude. And she just came up here shouted out more and more commands and complaints. Obviously she has something else going on that is affecting this mood-swing, and she may go back to being nice soon. She still hurt me; I am damn happy being a Tomgirl, and she is not going to change that. She is also paranoid of me turning damn <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Gay\" title=\"Gay\">gay</a> or becoming a <a href=\"/cwcki/Hermaphrodite\" title=\"Hermaphrodite\">transvestite</a>. Neither of which is the case; I am very attracted to women, including your sweet self, Jackie. I am feeling that she won't let up until I finally bring home a girlfriend who loves me for me, and appreciates my tomgirl ways. And I do not know to many tomgirls around here in person to attempt to put her mind at ease.  \nStressful.\n</p><p>I'll be okay, especially now that we're talking again, sweetheart. :)\n</p><p>Please call me very soon. I still have true feelings for you, Jacklyn, and it would mean a Lot to me if this time is THE time and you and I stay together for the remainder of our lives. But I digress. There's not that much rush; we have plenty of time.\n</p><p>&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3\nXOXOXOXO\nChristian.\n</p><p>P.S.\nDana is doing good, and I will send the photos from a library computer tomorrow.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #B48246; padding:5px; background-color:#FCC\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>April 22, 2011 - 7:35pm\n<p>Hey Chris!\n</p><p>I'm so sorry your mom is causing you grief right now. I guess the major change you're undergoing is a little bit of a shock for her, but she should still be supportive. What kinds of commands and complaints is she making to you? Do you have any idea what the thing going on in her life that is causing her to have a mood swing? Maybe you can help her with it. But it's good that you're standing your ground and refusing to stop being who you are and doing what makes you happy.\n</p><p>Now, about Lars... Please don't tell me how much time I need to get over MY relationship. These things can't just be planned out so exactly, when you break up with someone you can't just say \"I need X days to get over it and then I'll be perfectly okay\". It's a process. I'm not saying May is out of the question, I just can't put the cart in front of the horse. So let's just keep talking for right now. Like you say, there's not a rush, we have plenty of time, right?\n</p><p>Anyway, I'd love to talk to you on the phone, but my phone broke a couple months ago and I don't really have the cash to get a new one. There's a fancy new pair of chopsticks at the Asian store down at the mall I want to pick up and I'm saving my money for that. (Did I ever tell you that I like eating food with chopsticks? I just enjoy it better than using forks. Just a little quirk of mine, I guess.) So we might have to wait a while before I have a phone number to give you. Oh, and I'm gonna keep my piercings and makeup on the way I like too, by the way. Those things are part of what defines me, kind of like how being a tomgirl is what defines you. Isn't that part of why you like me? For what makes me me?\n</p><p>I look forward to seeing those photos tomorrow! I'll try to dig up a more recent photo of myself and get it to you.\n</p><p>XOXO\n</p><p>Jackie\n</p><p>P.S.

I meant mid-May to be for when you and I can meet up; again, we can discuss the meet date.\n</p><p>That is neat you have a thing for eating with chopsticks; I am capable of eating with chopsticks too; I have had good practice in the past with the grub I ate at the korean church in Chesterfield Co. my family and I went to. I relate with your desire for fancy and pretty things.  \nAlthough IMHO, I would consider which is more of a \"Want\" or a \"Need\".  \nDo you need or want those chopsticks? Wouldn't that cell phone replacement be more beneficial to you? Only food for thought.\n</p><p>I have actually shared how I felt with mom recently, and she listened.  \nShe also let off a few monkies off her back; speghetti dinner that was refused by dad and me the night of our final move back to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ruckersville\" title=\"Ruckersville\">Ruckersville</a>. I couldn't help it if I did not feel like spaghetti that night; she gave up cooking for us after that for one. I deeply apologized for that. And recently, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Robert_Chandler\" title=\"Robert Chandler\">my dad</a> had colon cancer surgery; the recovery, helping him and putting up with his constant complaints, arguement-starters and such has put further wear and tear on her.\n</p><p>On another topic, I've double-checked the <a href=\"/cwcki/Wikipedia\" title=\"Wikipedia\">Wikipedia</a> search for \"tomgirl\"; I was redirected to \"effeminacy\". I had reffered to it as \nnothing upon first finding weeks ago. I read a little bit of it an hour ago; most of which was, while reasonable from the author's viewpoint, offensive to me and I felt I just could not put up with.  \nThere WAS a \"Tomgirl\" page, and in its first publish time, it was simple and true, spelling corrections were needed; \"opposite of tomboy\"; \"males who enjoy feminine things\", and \"Tomgirls are straight\". After I get that laptop, I am going to undo the redirection, and add MORE words of tomgirl wisdom into it.\n</p><p>The laptop is an inexpensive one from <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CVS_Pharmacy\" title=\"wikipedia:CVS Pharmacy\">CVS</a>, designed for internet browsing, and upgradable I am sure with a greater capacity internal HDD (Hard disk drive). It is only $99, and it will be good for what I'll need it for, even before upgrading.\n</p><p>I've asked Tiffany to forward you the confidential tomgirlly photos.  \nPlease let me know ASAP when you are able to call me.\n</p><p>Stay Safe and sweet,\nChristian.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #B48246; padding:5px; background-color:#FCC\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>April 23, 2011 10:04pm\n<p>So that sucks about your mom. When was the speghetti dinner? Do you mean way back when your family moved to Ruckersville, years ago? That seems like an odd thing for her to bring up if it was so long ago.\n</p><p>Your dad had colon cancer though??? You should really be more understanding of his being in a bad mood. That is a HUGE strain on a family. I'm sure your mother is strained to the breaking point from seeing the man she loves go through this life-threatening dilemma; I mean, you guys are lucky he survived at all. Chalk that up to God's grace, I guess. You should be more understanding to your parents' needs.\n</p><p>Well, as far as the chopsticks, I actually busted a pair of mine a couple weeks ago. It was a really ornate pair, I had it for years and I carried it with me every time I went out to eat. But I left them on the roof of my car after leaving a restaurant and my dad accidentally drove over them and turned them into splinters. I was crestfallen, but I decided I would replace them as soon as possible. I look forward to having a nice pair of chopsticks again. I mean, I'd love to have a phone so I could talk to you, and you are definitely more important, but all things considered, until confirmation of details I'll continue to wait til we get our relationship back on its feet.\n</p><p>Anyway, I had more to say, sorry I have to cut this email short but I have to get up early tomorrow morning for my usual family Easter lunch, we do like an all-day family party thing and I need my sleep beforehand.

Obviously I can empathize with that; I still have my chip on the shoulder from <a href=\"/cwcki/Michael_Snyder\" title=\"Michael Snyder\">Michael Snyder</a> banning me from <a href=\"/cwcki/The_GAMe_PLACe\" title=\"The GAMe PLACe\">the Game &amp; Hobby Place</a> and being soo still unforgiving and closed-minded of accepting <a href=\"/cwcki/Apology_to_Game_%26_Hobby_Place\" title=\"Apology to Game &amp; Hobby Place\">my apology</a>. I even wish heavily for the Place to be blown up and burn to the ground while there was nobody inside.\n</p><p>It is understandable of confirming the details before getting the phone. I really would like this relationship to work, and soo better than in the past. Until when you get a cell phone, I will continue to e-mail you daily at best (granted I may miss a day sometimes).\n</p><p>There was a good Easter service at my church today, and there was also a baptism of a baby girl today; I took some photos with my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/DS\" title=\"DS\">DS</a> that I will print out for the family ASAP.\n</p><p>I also finally found and got a vial of Nail Art polish (silver) today, and I painted \"TOM\" on my right hand's middle three nails, \"GIRL\" on my left's index to pinkie, and a star, flower and heart on the other three. Put my two hands together, they spell \"*Tomgirl\". I will send you a photo after I get the laptop. More info on the laptop, it is a <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvania_Electric_Products\" title=\"wikipedia:Sylvania Electric Products\">Sylvana</a> brand with Wi-Fi capabilities, 3 USB ports, Windows CE and such. More details on it can be found on the box at your local CVS ($99.99), or if you can find it online, that works too. :) Also, I am planning on getting a tattoo and a belly button ring next month. I haven't decided on the B.B. ring yet, but the tattoo is going onto my lower back; I'll send a photo later, but roughly it is a combination of the (pink) mars and (blue) venus symbols, a pair of (violet) wings on either side, a white star behind it, and \"Tomgirl 4Ever\" underneath it all.\n</p><p>What else has been good with you since September? Are you still a <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Baldwin_College\" title=\"wikipedia:Mary Baldwin College\">Mary Baldwyn</a> journalist? How about them \"Crash Test Dummies\"? And anything else that comes into your mind; I want to hear/read all about it.\n</p><p>You and me, Jacklyn, let's make up for lost time and keep goin' strong.\n</p><p>TTYL.
