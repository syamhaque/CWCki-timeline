Often infamously described as \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Schroeder\" title=\"Megan Schroeder\">Megan Schroeder</a>'s heiress\", the Wallflower was one of the few girls Chris has managed to associate with in his post-<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/High_school\" title=\"High school\">high school</a> years who is not (as far as can be seen) a direct result of trolling. In <a href=\"/cwcki/March_2010\" title=\"March 2010\">March 2010</a>, she joined the long list of would-be <a href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart\" title=\"Sweetheart\">sweethearts</a> with whom Chris failed to lose his hated virginity. However, similar to her predecessor, The Wallflower only saw her relationship with Chris as them being \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Friend_zone\" title=\"Friend zone\">just friends</a>\". Also like with her predecessor, this wouldn't stop Chris from making frequent advances on The Wallflower or continually declaring her as his \"girlfriend\".\n</p><p>After Chris had inadvertently revealed the Wallflower's pen name in one of his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Little_Big_Planet\" title=\"Little Big Planet\">Little Big Planet</a> levels, trolls on the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki//cwc/\" title=\"/cwc/\">/cwc/</a> imageboard were able to dox her, which led to them leaking portions of her personal life and tons of her rather unique fanfiction, and her getting harassed by said trolls. Eventually, one of the trolls, <a href=\"/cwcki/Surfshack_Tito_(troll)\" title=\"Surfshack Tito (troll)\">Surfshack Tito</a>, sent a link to the newly created CWCki page to The Wallflower,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup> which put a significant damper on her relationship with Chris, believing that Chris was the one who set up the page himself, and with Chris only exacerbating the problem.\n</p><p>Nevertheless, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_introspection\" title=\"Chris and introspection\">in typical Chris fashion</a>, he has taken it upon himself to blame those goddamn trolls for the destruction of this friendship, making several <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_anger\" title=\"Chris and anger\">rage-filled</a> videos and posts where he rants about them while also not considering that maybe <i>he</i> was part of the problem.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Aliases\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Aliases</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Wallflower_Codename\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Wallflower Codename</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Prologue\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Prologue</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href='#The_\"relationship\"'><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The \"relationship\"</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href='#The_\"break-up\"'><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The \"break-up\"</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Chris's_Reaction_to_Anonmization\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris's Reaction to Anonmization</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Aftermath\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Aftermath</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1\"><a href=\"#Notes\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Notes</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">9</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Aliases\">Aliases</span></h2>\n<p>During her interactions with Chris, The Wallflower went under the pen name \"<b>Damien Antaria</b>\", her primary online persona which she used when writing and publishing her fanfictions online.

This is considering the site is all about an autistic weirdo who overshares constantly and has many aspects of his personal life on full display. The site also already has the information of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Virginia_Sanford\" title=\"Virginia Sanford\">those who</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Schroeder\" title=\"Megan Schroeder\">inadvertently wound</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">up in</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Michael_Snyder\" title=\"Michael Snyder\">the crosshairs</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Adam_Stackhouse\" title=\"Adam Stackhouse\">of Chris's life</a>, many of whom wouldn't even begin to fathom how infamous Chris would become in later years. Removing the information of such major players, regardless of how much they \"deserved\" to get doxed, also risks putting significant holes in the narrative if their role with him was crucial to understanding him. For the Wallflower, on the other hand, a very special set of conditions was in place that allowed her censorship. \n</p><p>Originally, before <a href=\"/cwcki/Champthom\" title=\"Champthom\">Champthom</a> deleted the original page, this article focused more on the Wallflower than Chris and intruded into parts of her life that had nothing to do with Chris. Feeling that she was in danger as a result of a troll sending her a link to the page, the Wallflower prompted the former CWCki owner, <a href=\"/cwcki/Cogsdev\" title=\"Cogsdev\">Cogsdev</a>, on 11 March 2010, to request that the article be reworked to refer to her under a pseudonym and avoid direct references to her personal life and identity. <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">Clyde Cash</a> announced this on the page's talk page on the same day.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-old_4-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-old-4\">[4]</a></sup> It was determined that omitting the Wallflower's identity (which wasn't made public until Chris carelessly revealed her pen name and trolls actively searched for it); in addition to details surrounding her personal life not related to Chris; wouldn't majorly affect the perception of Chris's story, and the CWCki's administrators agreed to this request, considering the Wallflower a relatively minor player in Chris's story who had stumbled upon him by happenstance and had no prior knowledge of him.\n</p><p>The Wallflower policy was then implemented on the CWCki. This involved censoring the Wallflower's real name where it is most prevalent or wherever Chris stated that he was in a relationship with her, as well as discluding information about her that isn't public or otherwise related to Chris. Otherwise, information about the Wallflower that was dropped by Chris, which included her first name, as well as images of her, were allowed to be showcased in passing, but wouldn't be linked to this page. The Wallflower's pen name, \"Damien Antaria\", was also permitted to be used on the CWCki. The codename \"The Wallflower\" originated from the fact that Chris had once referred to her as a \"wallflower\" due to her apparent hesitancy in a relationship with him in <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_46\" title=\"Mailbag 46\">Mailbag 46</a>, where he referred to their friendship as them being \"two hip wallflowers\".<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup>\n</p><p>The Wallflower policy later served as inspiration for its inbred<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[note 1]</a></sup> (and eventually <a href=\"/cwcki/User:Anaxis/The_Case_Against_the_Suitress_Policy\" title=\"User:Anaxis/The Case Against the Suitress Policy\">mercy killed</a>) sibling, the Suitress policy, which took more extreme steps in censoring the gal-pal <a href=\"/cwcki/Fiona_Cooper\" title=\"Fiona Cooper\">Fiona Cooper</a>, following drama surrounding her getting doxed by <a href=\"/cwcki/Naught\" title=\"Naught\">Naught</a> following her being framed by <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bella\" title=\"Bella\">Bella</a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-7\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">[note 2]</a></sup> Unlike the Wallflower, Fiona was an active member of the CWCsphere, knew a great deal about Chris, actively sought out Chris, didn't ask for censorship, and actively went against all attempts at it when she did an AMA on a Reddit throwaway. Also, like the Wallflower policy, the Suitress policy threatened to ban users who used Fiona's real identity on pages. Because of the issues this caused, both policies were lessened so that using either of their identities would only result in the edits being reverted, but otherwise, no bans would ensue.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Prologue\">Prologue</span></h2>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">I have read some of your work, and I am enjoying your writing style; you have a great imagination and you are very creative.

Emotionally distraught, he speaks in vague terms about troll interference in his life, and of the pains of a broken heart. At the same time, in a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Cwc_blog\" title=\"Cwc blog\">Captain's Log</a> entry on the CWCipedia, Chris mentioned \"BREAK-UPS FROM BEING EVEN SIMPLY FRIENDS WITH ME,\" which presumably refers to her cutting off all contact with him.\n</p><p>In the wee hours of 11 March 2010, Chris released <a href=\"/cwcki/Don%27t_Mess_With_Me\" title=\"Don't Mess With Me\">a second video</a>, in which he acted out a theoretical meeting between him and an imaginary <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">Clyde Cash</a> that ended with Chris slitting an invisible Clyde Cash's throat. Going by that, it's likely that Chris initially blamed the loss of The Wallflower on his old nemesis.\n</p><p>However, on 14 March 2010, Chris uploaded a new video and shifted the blame to another troll, <a href=\"/cwcki/Surfshack_Tito_(troll)\" title=\"Surfshack Tito (troll)\">Surfshack Tito</a>. In between delivering <a href=\"/cwcki/Tito_Got_No_Luck_Against_We_Brits,_Irish_and_Scots!\" title=\"Tito Got No Luck Against We Brits, Irish and Scots!\">bizarre threats of violence</a>, Chris makes a resolution to \"regain the love and trust and friendship\" of his gal pal. It is not clear why Chris believes he can accomplish this goal by donning a kilt, waving around a small knife, putting on a grotesque attempt at a Scottish accent, and generally presenting a hideous affront to the culture and people of an entire nation.\n</p><p>Later that same day, Chris made <a href=\"/cwcki/%22Damian_Antaria%22,_PLEASE,_Don%27t_Leave_Me_-_I_NEED_YOU!!!\" title=\"&quot;Damian Antaria&quot;, PLEASE, Don't Leave Me - I NEED YOU!!!\">another video</a> where he again referred to The Wallflower by her pen name, and literally begged her to sleep with him because his life was so hard, and otherwise he would have to pay $100 for sex with a hooker.\n</p><p>In the <a href=\"/cwcki/Surfshack_Tito_E-mails\" title=\"Surfshack Tito E-mails\">Surfshack Tito E-mails</a>, leaked four days later, Chris was mocked by Tito claiming to have had sex with The Wallflower. While Chris was initially incredulous, in a <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_Drops_the_N-Bomb\" title=\"Chris Drops the N-Bomb\">later video</a> he expressed outrage at Tito for \"taking her from [him],\" as Wallflower had recently begun to back up his claims.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/cwcki/Wallflower_E-mails_3\" title=\"Wallflower E-mails 3\">third set of e-mails to The Wallflower</a> finally confirms what had happened. As seen, The Wallflower was outright shocked at the vastness of information on her page within the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCki\" title=\"CWCki\">CWCki</a>, assumed that Chris had set the page up himself, and ended their friendship. Chris, however, kept trying to salvage their relationship long after it became obvious that he didn't have a chance, angering her even more. She also asserted her hatred of Chris by first saying that Tito was indeed her boyfriend before giving up and just telling him that she was asexual.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Chris.27s_Reaction_to_Anonmization\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris's_Reaction_to_Anonmization\">Chris's Reaction to Anonmization</span></h2>\n<p>Chris is convinced that the anonymization of the Wallflower took place because of the angry threats he made in his video of 10 March 2010 (roughly around the time the edits were made), when in fact it had nothing to do with him. The changes to this page led him to believe that he could insist on sweeping edits to many other pages, which he listed in the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_Blog#14_March_2010\" title=\"CWC Blog\">14 March 2010 Captain's Log update</a> on the CWCipedia. Those demands were ignored.\n</p><p>The e-mails from The Wallflower seem to paint a fuller picture to this. It appears that when The Wallflower discovered her page on the CWCki, she got pissed at Chris and demanded that he remove that information. However, he did it through his <a href=\"/cwcki/YouTube\" title=\"YouTube\">YouTube</a> videos. Annoyed, she went to the CWCki herself.\n</p><p>Chris, in the meantime, continued to drop her first name and pen name in his videos, including <a href=\"/cwcki/%22Damian_Antaria%22,_PLEASE,_Don%27t_Leave_Me_-_I_NEED_YOU!!!\" title=\"&quot;Damian Antaria&quot;, PLEASE, Don't Leave Me - I NEED YOU!!!\">one</a> which had it in the title.\n</p><p>Chris later also uploaded <a href=\"/cwcki/Gal-Pals_and_Past_Sweethearts_(CWCipedia_page)\" title=\"Gal-Pals and Past Sweethearts (CWCipedia page)\">a list of his former gal-pals and sweethearts</a> on the CWCipedia which included her full name. Chris goes on to blame the existence of her <a href=\"/cwcki/Facebook\" title=\"Facebook\">Facebook</a> page for the leak of her identity and the end of their budding relationship. \n</p><p>Continuing with this theme, 19 <a href=\"/cwcki/April_2010\" title=\"April 2010\">April 2010</a> would see Chris adding an <i><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Damien_Antaria_(CWCipedia_Page)\" title=\"Damien Antaria (CWCipedia Page)\">entire article</a></i> about her to the CWCipedia. In addition to the usual fits of megalomania and delirium, the page sported a copy-pasted version of this page. Conspicuously absent, however, was this very section.\n</p><p>To this day, he believes the entire debacle was the Wallflower's fault for having a Facebook page for trolls to discover. <a href=\"/cwcki/Calling_Out\" title=\"Calling Out\">Recently</a>, though, Chris has seen fit to <i>partially</i> <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_remorse\" title=\"Chris and remorse\">accept blame</a> for what happened.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Aftermath\">Aftermath</span></h2>\n<p>It seems that, years since the events of that March morning, Chris has yet to forget her as, <a href=\"/cwcki/Calling_Out\" title=\"Calling Out\">returning to the Internet</a>, he <a href=\"/cwcki/Calling_Out_%22Tito%22_-_Don\" title='Calling Out \"Tito\" - Don'>calls out Tito</a> and demands that he apologize to her for breaking them up, still referring to her as his \"girlfriend.\" However, a few days later, Chris made <a href=\"/cwcki/Correction_of_EX_relationship_status\" title=\"Correction of EX relationship status\">a retraction video</a>, apparently clarifying that they were indeed just friends. The description of the video seems to suggest that she found out about the video and demanded he correct it.\n</p><p>Interestingly, though he hasn't forgotten about her, he hasn't \"forgiven her\" for it.\n</p><p>In September 2012, Chris texted her, in the hopes of getting back in touch with her, though it is unknown if she responded or if she had long changed her number by then.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-17\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">[13]</a></sup> This remains the last known communication between the two, and Chris has most likely forgotten about her in the intervening years, while she did her best to wipe out her Internet presence (including giving up her fanfiction writing hobby) to avoid being further pestered by him or by weens.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/cwcki/Fiona_Cooper\" title=\"Fiona Cooper\">Fiona Cooper</a> - Another gal-pal who Chris tried to keep secret, and temporarily received a similar treatment on this wiki.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Flutter\" title=\"Flutter\">Flutter</a> - Yet another gal-pal Chris tried to keep secret.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Wallflower_E-mails_1\" title=\"Wallflower E-mails 1\">Wallflower E-mails I</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Wallflower_E-mails_2\" title=\"Wallflower E-mails 2\">Wallflower E-mails II</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Wallflower_E-mails_3\" title=\"Wallflower E-mails 3\">Wallflower E-mails III</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notes\">Notes</span></h2>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-6\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-6\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Pun intended.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-7\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-7\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Think of what most people think the Wallflower policy is and you basically have the Suitress policy.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-8\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-8\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">On 27 January 2010, Chris <a href=\"/cwcki/Vivian_Gee_E-mails,_2010#i_noticed_you_made_a_donation_to_haiti_—_27_January\" title=\"Vivian Gee E-mails, 2010\">wrote to Vivian</a> that he was \"attending [his] first Young Adult Social Group Meeting last Friday, where [he] also met and hit it off well with a nice and pretty 23-year old woman.\" <a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.timeanddate.com/date/weekday.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">timeanddate.com</a> tells us that 27 January 2010 fell on a Wednesday, and the last Friday before that was 22 January.</span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-10\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-10\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.timeanddate.com/date/weekday.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">timeanddate.com</a> tells us that 28 January 2010 fell on a Thursday;
