In the case of <a href=\"/cwcki/Christian_Weston_Chandler\" title=\"Christian Weston Chandler\">Christian Weston Chandler</a>, however, one would be mistaken. Women's rights, at least in Chris's mind, refer to the right of women to strip without interference, and the right of a woman not to be accused of having a <a href=\"/cwcki/Pickle\" title=\"Pickle\">pickle</a>.\n</p><p>Given his admitted love of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Pre-1980#1960s\" title=\"Pre-1980\">1964</a> classic <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Poppins\" title=\"Mary Poppins\">Mary Poppins</a></i>, he presumably took the concept from the character of Mrs. Banks, who is a suffragette in 1910 London.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup> Of course, Chris wouldn't have the first idea of what <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/women%27s_suffrage\" title=\"wikipedia:women's suffrage\">women's suffrage</a> is, let alone the impact it had on world history, and why it was being shown in the movie in the first place (<a href=\"/cwcki/Manchester_High_Leaks\" title=\"Manchester High Leaks\">especially given what's known about how Chris well did in high school</a>).\n</p><p>Some of Chris's views suggest that he actually has a chauvinistic, if not outright misogynistic, idea of what a woman's role in a family must be. While Chris regularly talks up how great most women he's interacted with are (regardless of whether or not said praise is actually warranted), Chris's ideal woman is ultimately someone who will do all the work in caring for the family, while working a full-time job, and while mothering Chris while having <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_sex\" title=\"Chris and sex\">sex</a> with him whenever he wants. Oddly, his views haven't changed much in spite of the fact that he now identifies as a <a href=\"/cwcki/Transgender\" title=\"Transgender\">transgender</a> woman – <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_hypocrisy\" title=\"Chris and hypocrisy\">Chris sees himself as having an exemption</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_work\" title=\"Chris and work\">from these same responsibilities</a> in a hypothetical relationship, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">because he's \"special\"</a>.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Origin\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Origin</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#In_the_comic\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">In the comic</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#In_real_life\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">In real life</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#See_Also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See Also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Origin\">Origin</span></h2>\n<p>As stated, Chris's extreme zeal for \"women's rights\" probably comes from Mrs. Banks, the mother of Jane and Michael in <i>Mary Poppins</i>, a 1964 Disney film based on the book series by P. L. Travers. As the story is set in 1910 London, women did not yet have the right to vote, but there was a mass uprising of campaigns for women's franchise around this time, particularly from groups like the radical Suffragettes and the more moderate Suffragists. Mrs. Banks is the mother of the children and sings the second song, \"Sister Suffragette\", during which she mentions prominent women's campaigner <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmeline_Pankhurst\" title=\"wikipedia:Emmeline Pankhurst\">Emmeline Pankhurst</a> being arrested (again).<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Mrs. Banks and her friends were depicted as struggling for the greater cause of being treated as an equal, with the same rights and opportunities as men. Chris, however, takes it to mean they simply want to remove their clothes and fuck whenever they want.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"In_the_comic\">In the comic</span></h2>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">Proving something about woman's rights or something by having a girl strip naked...that's a conflicting message.

Similarly, when they go shopping, they buy clothes specifically to wear for their significant other/crush. They have stereotypical female attributes which Chris clearly believes are legitimate, such as them eating salad at McDonalds and <a href=\"/cwcki/Bionic_the_Hedgehog\" title=\"Bionic the Hedgehog\">squishing over male characters</a>, while being motivated only by the desire to <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_9#Episode_19:_Date_Ed_(Even_Though_the_Idea_Sounds_Dated)\" title=\"Sonichu 9\">find a mate</a> and please him with <a href=\"/cwcki/Sandy_Rosechu\" title=\"Sandy Rosechu\">offspring</a>.\n</p><p>Chris's most prominent reference to women's rights occurs at the end of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Episode_17\" title=\"Episode 17\">Episode 17</a>, in which the <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu_(species)\" title=\"Rosechu (species)\">Rosechus</a> of <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a> <b>strip naked</b> to celebrate their victory over <a href=\"/cwcki/Jason_Kendrick_Howell\" title=\"Jason Kendrick Howell\">Jason Kendrick Howell</a> (during which <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu\" title=\"Rosechu\">Rosechu</a> <i>rapes</i> Howell (she's supposed to be the hero)) and assert their dominance over <a href=\"/cwcki/4-cent_garbage.com\" title=\"4-cent garbage.com\">4-cent garbage.com</a>.  This scene also implies that women cannot vote in CWCville, because at one point, the Rosechus start singing the \"votes for women\" portion of the song \"Step In Time\", ironically failing to realize that the song was supposed to be about women in Edwardian England being unable to vote. \n</p><p>Despite their <a href=\"/cwcki/Private_Villa_of_Corrupted_Citizens\" title=\"Private Villa of Corrupted Citizens\">phenomenal talent for fighting evil</a>, Chris depicts Rosechus as passive <a href=\"/cwcki/Sex_toys\" title=\"Sex toys\">sexual objects</a> for <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(species)\" title=\"Sonichu (species)\">Sonichus</a>. Reflecting Chris's own distorted image of women, the Rosechus in his comics tend to exhibit a desire to engage in stereotypical behavior, with occasional aggressive sexual overtures. Women also tend to act as deus ex machina plot devices - occasionally leaving their role as irrelevant supporting characters to engage in acts of great bravery and heroism. Often, the female characters offer nothing of any substantial narrative value. <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu\" title=\"Rosechu\">Rosechu</a> is seen more often being rescued from <i>damsel-in-distress</i> situations then actually being a competent hero.\n</p><p>It is obvious that Chris is <i>aware</i> of the idea that objectifying women is frowned upon; every time he makes his female characters use their feminine qualities (to put it altogether too mildly), he is quick to add a disclaimer that he respects the women for <i>both</i> their minds and bodies, and/or make the claim that the characters are doing it because they want to fight for the rights of women. However, due to his <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism\" title=\"Autism\">mental block</a>, he fails to understand that disclaimers like these make him appear to be a <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_hypocrisy\" title=\"Chris and hypocrisy\">hypocrite.</a>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"In_real_life\">In real life</span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Punchylaylalove2.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"243\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/3/37/Punchylaylalove2.jpg/300px-Punchylaylalove2.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/3/37/Punchylaylalove2.jpg/450px-Punchylaylalove2.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/3/37/Punchylaylalove2.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Punchylaylalove2.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div><a href=\"/cwcki/Layla\" title=\"Layla\">Layla</a> performs a woman's highest duty.</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:RosechuTheIncredibleLioness.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"395\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/d/d4/RosechuTheIncredibleLioness.jpg/300px-RosechuTheIncredibleLioness.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/d/d4/RosechuTheIncredibleLioness.jpg/450px-RosechuTheIncredibleLioness.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/d/d4/RosechuTheIncredibleLioness.jpg/600px-RosechuTheIncredibleLioness.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:RosechuTheIncredibleLioness.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>The very essence of femininity, according to Chris. How else are we supposed to interpret this?</div></div></div>\n<p>Chris allows himself to be controlled by his own desires, and has soaked in all sorts of knowledge about women primarily from <a href=\"/cwcki/Anime\" title=\"Anime\">anime</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Video_games\" title=\"Video games\">video games</a>, and in particular <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Pornography\" title=\"Pornography\">pornography</a>, which Chris considers \"educational\".<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup> He has had several problems realizing the difference between exaggerated stereotypes and the reality, as also evidenced by his <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_race\" title=\"Chris and race\">racist remarks</a>.  \nDuring the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tomgirl_Saga\" title=\"Tomgirl Saga\">Tomgirl Saga</a>, he states that he uses the female bathroom, and that there is \"no going back for him\", not realizing that he is blatantly intruding upon the privacy of the women present, and disregarding their feelings (which, undoubtedly, can be summed up as pure terror).\n</p><p>This delusion regarding females is painfully obvious in Chris's interaction with women during his <a href=\"/cwcki/Love_Quest\" title=\"Love Quest\">Love Quest</a>. Chris takes on a completely passive role in his attraction strategy, waiting to be approached by women whom he thinks will take interest in his appearance, and who when in a relationship with him will look after him both financially and physically - essentially, a <a href=\"/cwcki/Barbara_Chandler\" title=\"Barbara Chandler\">maternal figure</a>. Rather than aiming to better himself, Chris is looking to be fulfilled and served by women. Rather than having the full potential to use their talents in society, women's rights are the rights of women to bring pleasure to men as Chris sees fit. When Chris claimed to have lost his virginity to a hooker in <a href=\"/cwcki/April_2012\" title=\"April 2012\">April 2012</a>, he also said, quite bluntly, <i>\"My future sweetheart will find out about it\",</i> giving off the impression that whoever hooks up with him will just accept him sleeping with a prostitute right off the bat, and relegating the woman who finally took away his <a href=\"/cwcki/Virgin_with_rage\" title=\"Virgin with rage\">hated virginity</a> to being nothing more than an organic <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Fapcup\" title=\"Fapcup\">Fapcup</a>. This was proven true when in December 2014, he wrote this as a <i>vow</i> <a href=\"/cwcki/Catherine#Leaked_Information\" title=\"Catherine\">on a card</a> to his latest <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">sweetheart</a>, Catherine.\n</p><p>Much of Chris's sexism in relationships is <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_hypocrisy\" title=\"Chris and hypocrisy\">hypocrisy</a> – for example, he thought that if he was married to <a href=\"/cwcki/Ivy\" title=\"Ivy\">Ivy</a> and was <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress\" title=\"Stress\">stressed</a>, he could go to a <a href=\"/cwcki/Zelina_Rosechu\" title=\"Zelina Rosechu\">strip club</a>, but of course she could not; similarly, he suggested a MFF threesome with many of his sweethearts, but was horrified when Ivy suggested a <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">MMF threesome</a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]</a></sup> He even <a href=\"/cwcki/Mumble_7\" title=\"Mumble 7\">supports the notion</a> that it's okay to cheat on your spouse <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">as long as you have permission</a>, but he himself has shown nothing but utter contempt towards <a href=\"/cwcki/JERKS\" title=\"JERKS\">anybody he deems a threat to his relationships</a>. In a nutshell, this means that it's okay for <i>him</i> to sleep around just as long as he tells his girlfriend about it, but not okay for any sweetheart to do the same to him.\n</p><p>When confronted with his sexism, Chris becomes extremely indignant and offended.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-7\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">[7]</a></sup> When his sexism is pointed out, he gets upset and clarifies that he would never harm a woman (though he has no problem <a href=\"/cwcki/Death_threats#Vivian_Gee\" title=\"Death threats\">threatening to kill them</a>). Chris seems to be under the impression that \"sexism\" basically means \"physical abuse\", and doesn't think portraying women as sexual objects obsessed with shopping is offensive or damaging.\n</p><p>Also of note is that, despite deeming women to be superior over <a href=\"/cwcki/JERKS\" title=\"JERKS\">JERKS</a>, any females who seemingly inconvenienced Chris somehow weren't spared his <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_anger\" title=\"Chris and anger\">considerable wrath</a>. Good examples would be <a href=\"/cwcki/Mary_Lee_Walsh\" title=\"Mary Lee Walsh\">Mary Lee Walsh</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Megan_Schroeder\" title=\"Megan Schroeder\">Megan Schroeder</a> (his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/SheCameForCWC.jpg\" title=\"SheCameForCWC.jpg\">disregard for <i>her</i> women's rights</a> was the final straw for their ailing companionship) who Chris accused of orchestrating his life's abundant woes, even though conflicts with both women were pretty much entirely his fault. Plus, he coined \"Janekop\" as official term for a female <a href=\"/cwcki/Jerkop\" title=\"Jerkop\">Jerkop</a>, proving that whilst he <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_hypocrisy\" title=\"Chris and hypocrisy\">preaches about the importance of \"women's rights\"</a>, refusing to let him get <a href=\"/cwcki/Love_Quest\" title=\"Love Quest\">the love and sex he craves</a> will make you pure evil in his eyes, even if you're female.\n</p><p>It seems that in recent years, Chris has gotten even more demanding and aggressive in his attitude towards women. Read <a href=\"/cwcki/Catherine_E-mails#It_IS_Your_Fault.21\" title=\"Catherine E-mails\">this E-mail to Catherine</a> leaked in 2014, where Chris gets annoyed when Catherine says no to a relationship (<i><a href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart#Will_Chris_ever_have_a_Sweetheart.3F\" title=\"Sweetheart\">big surprise</a></i>), where he basically insults the woman and blatantly <i>claims that he's entitled to her</i>, right before whining about how depressed he is. He even goes on further to say that she should \"appreciate the  the hard work and effort I had put into US!!!\", even though shortly before that he was <a href=\"/cwcki/I_Love_You,_Catherine\" title=\"I Love You, Catherine\">abusing her friends and telling her what she can and can't do</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See_Also\">See Also</span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_gender\" title=\"Chris and gender\">Chris and gender</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/cwcki/Hermaphrodite\" title=\"Hermaphrodite\">Hermaphrodite</a></li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<div class=\"mw-references-wrap\"><ol class=\"references\">\n<li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-1\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\"><a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_Chris%27s_edits_to_Encyclopedia_Dramatica\" title=\"List of Chris's edits to Encyclopedia Dramatica\">List of Chris's edits to Encyclopedia Dramatica</a></span>\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-2\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-2\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">Lyrics from \"The Life I Lead\": \"It's grand to be an Englishman in 1910 / <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VII_of_the_United_Kingdom\" title=\"wikipedia:Edward VII of the United Kingdom\">King Edward</a></span>'s on the throne / It's the age of men!\"\n</li>\n<li id=\"cite_note-3\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"><a href=\"#cite_ref-3\">↑</a></span> <span class=\"reference-text\">\"Take heart!
