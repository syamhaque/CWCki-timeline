Predictably, his measuring stick in this regard was seemingly based on how \"pretty\" he deemed them, or how much he liked them, much like with Bailey, who he admitted having conflicting feelings about, and even apologized to after she admitted to being hurt by Chris's comment. Inversely, he refused to show any sort of respect towards <a href=\"/cwcki/Jeff_Ouzuo\" title=\"Jeff Ouzuo\">Francine</a>'s identity, calling her voice shrill, and making comments about how little she did in terms of transitioning.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-gatekeeping_3-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-gatekeeping-3\">[3]</a></sup> Chris however, never applied this criteria to himself, deeming himself as a sort of <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">paragon of femininity</a>, depicting himself as such when he deemed himself a CPU Goddess, and boasting about his own transition milestones, despite many people noting he didn't look much different from how he did before.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-gatekeeping_3-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-gatekeeping-3\">[3]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Chris however stated a couple times that if he were to have a \"hermaphrodite\" for a child, he'd  raise them as a boy.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-hit_4-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-hit-4\">[4]</a></sup> When asked about raising an intersex child, or a child \"whose sex cannot be determined\", he took this to be referring to his oddly specific definition of the term, saying that he'd also raise them as a boy for not having ovaries, even referring to them by he/him pronouns, in the hopes of them scoring all kinds of women (including lesbians), further indicating he also views biological sex through the lens of a person's genitals.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-cupid_2-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-cupid-2\">[2]</a></sup> Chris also seems to deem trans women that do get surgery as \"fully female\", as evidenced by him referring to Rosechu and Sylvana as such after having their penises removed, giving further credence to this. \n</p><p>Despite this, Chris also believes that all bodies, regardless of them being \"male\" or \"female\", all have the same physiological functionalities under the correct circumstances, and that someone's sex can be easily changed. He, for example, believed that those with a penis <a href=\"/cwcki/Pregnant_Act\" title=\"Pregnant Act\">can get pregnant</a>, theorizing that it may be possible by his mate's egg winding up inside him, and getting fertilized by his sperm. Chris similarly proposed the idea that those that are born male may actually have a vagina inside of them, misconstruing the biological fact that human fetuses have \"female\" organs (such as nipples and developing vulvas) before getting a Y chromosome, leading to the <a href=\"/cwcki/Self-inflicted_taint_wound\" title=\"Self-inflicted taint wound\">second instance</a> where he mutilated his own taint.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup> Chris had also shared two clickbait articles on Facebook, which stated that one's sex is merely what one is assigned with at birth, to which <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/William_Elliott_Waterman\" title=\"William Elliott Waterman\">William Elliott Waterman</a> pointed out was factually incorrect, sharing another article.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]</a></sup> Chris also believed that trans women can get periods the same way that cis women do, as evidenced by a reply he had made towards the trans influencer LifeofBria, where she conflated getting period-like symptoms as a result of being on hormone replacement therapy with having a full-on period, a process primarily defined by the shedding of the uterine lining in preparing for a potential pregnancy.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-7\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">[7]</a></sup> Chris unequivocally agreed with this, stating his own mood swings were his \"period\".<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-8\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">[8]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Understanding_of_Gender_Identity\">Understanding of Gender Identity</span></h2>\n<p>Besides his complicated views on biological sex, Chris also had a difficult time articulating his views on gender identity, a topic which he wouldn't explore until he himself tried to experiment with his own gender and presentation.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Terminology\">Terminology</span></h3>\n<p>Prior to transitioning, Chris has used a number of pejoratives to refer to trans people. As stated previously, Chris often grouped trans people together with the homos, particularly the ones that he refused to respect the identities of, and referred to them as such. This was because he viewed homosexual men through the stereotype of them being innately effeminate or flamboyant, and even cited them \"forcing their flamboyancy\" on other people after he had gotten discovered on <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Tomboys_and_Tomgirls_of_Virginia\" title=\"Tomboys and Tomgirls of Virginia\">Tomboys and Tomgirls of Virginia</a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-9\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">[9]</a></sup> It was only natural then that Chris would also wind up using the term on people he strictly viewed as \"effeminate men\", leading to some degree of confusion on what he was referring to in some cases.\n</p><p>While exploring his gender identity, Chris navigated a linguistic minefield of <i>transgender</i>, <i>transsexual</i>, <i>transvestite</i>, <i>intersex</i>, <i>bisexual</i>, <i>hermaphrodite</i>, and his own <i>tomgirl</i>, leading to some confusion as he adapted and experimented. On his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/OKCupid\" title=\"OKCupid\">OKCupid</a> profile, when asked, \"Would you date a transgender person,\" he replied, \"Yes, as long as she was born female and was still female (or a tomboy).\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-cupid_2-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-cupid-2\">[2]</a></sup> He told <a href=\"/cwcki/Jackie\" title=\"Jackie\">Jackie</a> that the fact that he loved wearing women’s clothing did not make him a “transvestite.”<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-jackie_10-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-jackie-10\">[10]</a></sup> He told gal-pal <a href=\"/cwcki/Rebeckah_Bentley_E-mails\" title=\"Rebeckah Bentley E-mails\">Rebeckah Bentley</a> that the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Unclit\" title=\"Unclit\">unclit</a> made him “bisexual” when he meant intersex; he promptly flipped his shit when Rebeckah asked if he wanted to fuck dudes now.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-11\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">[11]</a></sup> Chris also used the term <i>tranny</i> to describe himself prior to actually committing to being transgender, which is a can of worms due to its association as a derogatory term against trans people.\n</p><p>Chris also appears to believe that intersexuality is a special condition involving ANY sort of gender non-conformity within a person, including being transgender or having one's genitals changed. As stated previously, Chris has also at a time used the terms \"transgender\" and \"intersex\" interchangeably, believing that they both mean the same thing. For example, Chris on several occasions referred to himself as \"intersex\", due to having a penis, but having a \"lesbian soul\", failing to understand that the term is explicitly used for individuals that have BOTH male and female gametes, which he doesn't have.\n</p><p>On 14 <a href=\"/cwcki/August_2014\" title=\"August 2014\">August 2014</a>, he came out publicly, although as what exactly wasn’t certain, given his garbled and inconsistent vocabulary. The initial announcement was that he was \"a Tomgirl, Intersex of Female Soul with Male Body, and a Tranny Cross-Dresser.\" Apparently unbeknownst to Chris, intersex is a chromosomal condition causing ambiguous genitalia and can present in many forms, none of which appear to be true of Chris. Then he said he was a \"Lesbian Identified Man and a Cross-Dressing Tranny.\" Two weeks later he was telling <a href=\"/cwcki/Catherine\" title=\"Catherine\">Catherine</a> that he was a \"Lesbian tomgirl transgender male\" but also \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Three-Quarter_Woman\" title=\"Three-Quarter Woman\">three-quarters woman</a>.\" By September he seemed to have settled on \"Lesbian Transgender (a Female, Lesbian Soul trapped in a male body).\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-12\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">[12]</a></sup> In <a href=\"/cwcki/April_2015\" title=\"April 2015\">April 2015</a>, apparently no longer a \"man,\" he changed his Facebook pronoun to \"she\" and his name to \"Christine\".<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-13\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">[13]</a></sup> This month also saw the beginning of a flurry of Facebook \"likes\" for all sorts of progressive transgender issues, such as restroom choice and gay marriage. Whatever he was, he was certainly proud of it, and wasted no time trying to persuade his new L(G)BT personal army to wage war against local manajerks.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Pronouns\">Pronouns</span></h3>\n<p>Chris tends to use the preferred pronouns of other transgender people that he likes, such as the MTF violet4151<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-14\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">[14]</a></sup> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Miss_Cherry\" title=\"Miss Cherry\">Miss Cherry</a>, and the FTM Lukas of the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Teen_Troon_Squad\" title=\"Teen Troon Squad\">Teen Troon Squad</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Nowacking\" title=\"Nowacking\">Nowacking</a>.\n</p><p>The exceptions to this occurred under troll manipulation, in the case of <a href=\"/cwcki/Jack_Thaddeus\" title=\"Jack Thaddeus\">Jack Thaddeus</a>, who he claimed would never be a part of \"femdom\" after getting a sex change, and when he flip-flopped between referring to the troll transwoman character <a href=\"/cwcki/Jeff_Ouzuo\" title=\"Jeff Ouzuo\">Jeff Ouzuo</a> with female and male pronouns.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cis_People_and_Gender_Roles\">Cis People and Gender Roles</span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Females\">Females</span></h3>\n<div class=\"rellink boilerplate seealso\">See also: <a href=\"/cwcki/Women%27s_rights\" title=\"Women's rights\">Women's rights</a></div>\n<p>Chris repeatedly asserts his reverence of women, and seems to have a comparatively glowing opinion of them, stating that he finds women \"empathetic\". But, as stated at the beginning of the article, the truth is more complicated. While Chris has <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_socialization\" title=\"Chris and socialization\">always preferred female friends</a>, and is known to be far more accommodating of <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_sexuality\" title=\"Chris and sexuality\">lesbians than gay men</a>, even going so far as to <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">identify as one himself</a>, in truth, Chris has a distinctly sexist view of <a href=\"/cwcki/Women%27s_rights\" title=\"Women's rights\">women</a>. Based on his failed attempts at getting girls at the mall, Chris views females as <a href=\"/cwcki/Sex_tape\" title=\"Sex tape\">hyper-sexual</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Mall\" title=\"Mall\">preoccupied with shopping</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Animal_Crossing_Documentary\" title=\"Animal Crossing Documentary\">given to conversing with others for hours</a>, and fixated on <a href=\"/cwcki/PlayingHouse\" title=\"PlayingHouse\">getting married and having children</a>. This is highly evident in his female characters in <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\">Sonichu</a></i>. As a matter of fact, In <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_9\" title=\"Sonichu 9\"><i>Sonichu</i> #9</a>, he referred to women as another species. This seems to be hyperbole, but considering Chris's abysmal knowledge of the sciences, it is difficult to be sure. <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu_(character)\" title=\"Rosechu (character)\">His Rosechu character</a> who is a living embodiment of how Chris believes all women behave, has a \"personality\" which consists solely of the traits listed above, which is considered ironic as Chris constantly tries to show Rosechu with a passion for <a href=\"/cwcki/Women%27s_rights\" title=\"Women's rights\">Women's Rights</a>. Despite trying to portray them as being equal in power to their <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(species)\" title=\"Sonichu (species)\">male counterparts</a>, Chris rarely depicts <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu_(species)\" title=\"Rosechu (species)\">Rosechus</a> fighting, more often simply leaving them on the sidelines of a battle to wail like damsels in distress, even when their boyfriends are in mortal danger. Even outside battle, they tend to be little more than organic sex toys for the Sonichus.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Males\">Males</span></h3>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/JERKS\" title=\"JERKS\">JERKS</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>Chris has harbored a deep hatred for <a href=\"/cwcki/JERKS\" title=\"JERKS\">men</a> ever since his teenage years, because he was bullied in grade school (largely because of his bloated <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ego\" title=\"Ego\">ego</a> making him extremely annoying to be around), not to mention the fact that Chris is known to fly into fits of <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">jealous</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_anger\" title=\"Chris and anger\">rage</a> whenever he sees <a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris\" title=\"Liquid Chris\">a man more successful than him</a>, especially if <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">that</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Infinitely-High_Boyfriend-Factor\" title=\"Infinitely-High Boyfriend-Factor\">man</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Wes_Iseli\" title=\"Wes Iseli\">is getting some</a> and he isn't. This gradually blossomed into a general distaste for masculine traits such as body <a href=\"/cwcki/Hair\" title=\"Hair\">hair</a>; indeed, in his <a href=\"/cwcki/Nudes\" title=\"Nudes\">nudes</a> it is apparent that he is surprisingly meticulous in shaving his body hair, certainly compared to <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_health#Chris_and_hygiene\" title=\"Chris and health\">other aspects of grooming</a>. He also has stated, as shown in this <a href=\"/cwcki/04232010_-_Autism_Awareness_%26_Men_Should_NEVER_be_Topless\" title=\"04232010 - Autism Awareness &amp; Men Should NEVER be Topless\">video</a>, a disgust for \"topless men\" and <a href=\"/cwcki/Brassieres_For_Males\" title=\"Brassieres For Males\">encourages men</a> to wear <a href=\"/cwcki/Muscle_bra\" title=\"Muscle bra\">muscle bras</a> so he doesn't have to see their nipples. He even made a (now outdated) short list of the men he doesn't consider \"jerks\", which included himself, his <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler\" title=\"Bob Chandler\">father</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Santa_Clause\" title=\"Santa Clause\">Santa Clause</a> <i>[<a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_English\" title=\"Chris and English\">sic</a>]</i>. Chris's misandry continued after identifying as a \"tomgirl\"; he has variously referred to men in general as \"barbarians\" and \"Neanderthals\", which, coming from him, are rather ironic accusations for <a href=\"/cwcki/Death_threats\" title=\"Death threats\">a</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/14_Branchland_Court\" title=\"14 Branchland Court\">number</a> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_racism\" title=\"Chris and racism\">of</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_health#Chris_and_hygiene\" title=\"Chris and health\">reasons</a>.\n</p><p>Chris has since relaxed his former misandric attitude and no longer takes issue with the company of men.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Trans_People\">Trans People</span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Himself\">Himself</span></h3>\n<dl><dd><i>Main articles: <a href=\"/cwcki/Transgender\" title=\"Transgender\">Transgender</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Gender_dysphoria\" title=\"Gender dysphoria\">Gender dysphoria</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:ChrisChan_Twt_Bio_from_4-20-21.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"319\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/b/b6/ChrisChan_Twt_Bio_from_4-20-21.jpg/300px-ChrisChan_Twt_Bio_from_4-20-21.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/b/b6/ChrisChan_Twt_Bio_from_4-20-21.jpg/450px-ChrisChan_Twt_Bio_from_4-20-21.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/b/b6/ChrisChan_Twt_Bio_from_4-20-21.jpg/600px-ChrisChan_Twt_Bio_from_4-20-21.jpg 2x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:ChrisChan_Twt_Bio_from_4-20-21.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Chris's Twitter bio as observed shortly before <a href=\"/cwcki/Jail_Saga\" title=\"Jail Saga\">spending nearly two years in jail</a>.
