You have had many Sweethearts who\nhave Tragically Died; you know the Pain and Heartbreak Wild would\nsuffer if something happened to Simonla. It is a Tragic, Real Life\nExperience that happens to people Every Day. I think adding this to\nyour story would be an Interesting Twist should you spend an entire\nchapter dedicated to Wild losing his Heartsweet and recovering with\nthe help of Sonichu and the Gang, and maybe finding new love?\n</p><p>However, if you can think of a GOOD, PERMANENT way to remove Simonla\nwithout causing the Heart Break, PLEASE do it and PLEASE show it\nactually happening in the comics; Usually when people die in Sonichu\nor Leave Forever it happens Off-Screen; my lawyers want to SEE Simonla\nleaving the story before they can Legally Accept it.\n</p><p>-Evan\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Parodies\">Parodies</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Asperchu_can.27t_be_a_parody_of_Chris.2C_because_Asperchu.27s_not_a_total_dick_fucking_asshole\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Asperchu_can't_be_a_parody_of_Chris,_because_Asperchu's_not_a_total_dick_fucking_asshole\">Asperchu can't be a parody of Chris, because Asperchu's not a total <s>dick</s> fucking asshole</span></h3>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #B48246; padding:5px; background-color:#FCC\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>From: Alec-chan <a href=\"/cwcki/Asperchu\" title=\"Asperchu\">Asperchu</a> &lt;albasperchu@live.com&gt;\n<p>Christian,\n</p><p>Thank you again for clearing up your words that I was wondering about! However, I am afraid that you Have indeed given me a blessing for the cartoon show, if with your actions but not only your words. You See, although it is clear you do not care for some of the lesser quibling aspects of ASPERCHU, you do recognize it as a fiery, flaming inspiration of Exquisite Art, which is the words what Mr. Tartica, an Executive Officer over at the Cartoon Network said - not my own words, but rather His. I do not mean to Anger you with this statement, but I felt you should see his words for Yourself, because it is important you know just How Much of a Great Weight you have given to my efforts to establish myself as an Up and Coming Artisan.\n</p><p>Now, with that out of the way, I have something of a Bone to pick with you, I must confess. In fact, I would go so far as to say that there are several levels to my concern, each of which deserves Coverage. FIRST: You say that ASPERCHU is a \"Look-Alike Sonichu Character with a Look-Alike Sonichu Medallion\". Now, I am JUST PLAINED OFFENDED at YOUR offense, Mr. Christian Weston Chandler! that you would call ASPERCHU a \"look-alike\" is appalling: FIRST of all, ASPERCHU has glasses, while SONICHU most certainly does NOT; it is a little-known fact that ASPERCHU has the astigmatism. SECONDLY, ASPERCHU, as you pointed out, wears clothes! First you say ASPERCHU is a parody of Sonichu, next you say he is a parody of you yourself with the shirt. Which is it, Mr. Chandler? ASPERCHU cannot parody both of you completely different beings and still be a parody. SECONDLY, you say that the previous letter, the picture contained within you submit here as evidence of your claim, was placed in your <a href=\"/cwcki/Rejected_Mailbag#Parodies\" title=\"Rejected Mailbag\">parody page</a>. But it is YOU YOURSELF who put that ASPERCHU image into your parody mailbag, not I. If it were up to me, you would have placed it into your ORIGINAL mailbag, as that is what it is (I do not even see that you even HAVE an original mailbag yet, what is up with that?). THIRDLY, you say that that image is full of the suggestions of <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">homogayrotica</a>. That is just plain and duly absurd! In that image, ASPERCHU and his joy-boy Sonichu are enjoying the Comfort and Camaraderie that comes when two Adult, Confident, STRAIGHT male friends are able to share their PLATONIC friendship with each other in a PLATONIC hug. NOTHING MORE. There is absolutely NOTHING of the homogay in that image. But just to prove ONCE AND FOR ALL that ASPERCHU is NOT the homogay, I have crafted and submitted a New image to depict to you: Tell me, if ASPERCHU were not STRAIGHT, would he be using AXE SHOWER GEL? No, I do not think he would.\n</p><p>I do thank you for clarifying what you mean concerning your opinions on the Aspergers and the Autism. I must say however, that as one afflicted with the Aspergers, it is my opinion that I do not have the qualification to make a determination personally. Because of this, I cannot say that you are not right or wrong that Aspergers and Autism are not linked. However, I must ask you this question: If it is in fact a True Fact that the Aspergers is not linked to the Autism, then how exactly is ASPERCHU a parody of Sonichu? Because apart from his major differences - the glasses, the clothes, the goatee, the stories, and Such - ASPERCHU has the ASPERGERS! He is even a part Aspergers-type pokemon (he is electric-type and Aspergers-type). He must therefore NOT be a parody of Sonichu, as I have been saying for the while. So please retract your statement that ASPERCHU is a parody of Sonichu, as the completely DIFFERENT mental conditionings PROVE that I came up with ASPERCHU all on my own.\n</p><p>Sincerely,\n</p><p>Alec Benson Leary\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.
