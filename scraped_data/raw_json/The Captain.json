This got to the point where Chris started to sell his belongings on <a href=\"/cwcki/EBay\" title=\"EBay\">eBay</a> in order to keep up with their requests. One of these items was the <a href=\"/cwcki/Amnyfest_Ring\" title=\"Amnyfest Ring\">Amnyfest Ring</a>, which he put on sale on 14 April for $10,000<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup>. For obvious reasons, no-one bought this.\n</p><p>On April 17, The Captain asked if he could buy the ring for $200, which Chris accepted. The Captain initially bought the ring for what seemed to be cosmetic reasons, with no ulterior motive. However, he was shortly after contacted by \"some people close to Chris,\" who told him that Chris was being manipulated, but was refusing to give them any details about it. Captain's suspicions were also raised upon seeing <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_Special_5\" title=\"Sonichu Special 5\">Sonichu Special 5</a>, where all the <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu\" title=\"Sonichu\">Sonichu</a> characters were seen saddened by Chris giving the ring away, which tipped him off that the sale was involuntary. \n</p><p>Despite the transaction being over, The Captain continued talking to Chris, enabling his delusions in order to gain his trust. Eventually, Captain sent him a photoshopped image of the ring glowing, telling Chris that it was sending him Morse code messages. He followed this up by a note in his notepad that read, \"The CPUs have been hacked. Don't trust the CPUs,\" and claimed that was the secret message. \n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #d5d5ed; border:1px dotted #BFB1A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Not even a few days later (the day after it came in the mail), I find out about Chris' odd behavior (see the Wise and Boyd post) and think to myself what could I do to help?\n<p>So it dawned on me - Chris is really big on shamanism and symbols (thanks @Marvin) so I simply told him that the ring was sending me morse code messages and that the idiots in Discord were lying to him. So I did a five minute photoshop of the ring glowing and sent it to Chris as well as a piece of notepaper where I wrote \"The CPUs have been hacked. Don't trust the CPUs\" claiming that was the morse code message.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]</a></sup>\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>After this, he had a 20-minute phone call with Chris, where he told Chris that the ring was in fact the \"Reality Stone,\" a magical object that could instantly transform <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a> into whatever he wanted it to be. Captain reasoned that while this was once again enabling, it was a necessary evil, as the existence of the \"Reality Stone\" blocked out all trolls who tried to mess with CWCville, as Chris could instantly undo the damage. Chris trusted the Captain, and gave him his <a href=\"/cwcki/Discord\" title=\"Discord\">Discord</a> and all his other accounts passwords, so he could \"scan for viruses.\"\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #d5d5ed; border:1px dotted #BFB1A3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>It was a way to quickly and easily shut the trolls out.

He quickly told <a href=\"/cwcki/Marvin\" title=\"Marvin\">Marvin</a> about the situation, who started coaching Captain on how to talk like Chris, so he could communicate to the Idea Guys while Marvin formed a plan. Chris also coached The Captain, by giving him info on himself so Captain could imitate him better. The Idea Guys became skeptical of The Captain at one point, and told him to write a message on a dry erase board to prove he was really Chris. The Captain told Chris to write on the board, which Chris did, and Captain forwarded the images to the Idea Guys. Eventually, Marvin built a script to rip all the chat logs from the Discord, and The Captain went completely silent in the Discord, leading to the Idea Guys freaking out.\n</p><p>The Captain later sent the ring back to Chris, due to his need for money and the fact that its sale was involuntary.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Chris-Chan_Extortionists\">The Chris-Chan Extortionists</span></h3>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/The_Chris-Chan_Extortionists\" title=\"The Chris-Chan Extortionists\">The Chris-Chan Extortionists</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>On 11 <a href=\"/cwcki/July_2018\" title=\"July 2018\">July 2018</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Null\" title=\"Null\">Null</a> made a thread on <a href=\"/cwcki/Kiwi_Farms\" title=\"Kiwi Farms\">Kiwi Farms</a> titled \"The Chris-Chan Extortionists,\" where he discussed the <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Saga\" title=\"Saga\">Saga</a>.

I then contacted Chris and by playing into his delusion about the CPUs, ponys and other shit convinced him that I was trustworthy. He informed me about the top-secret Discord chat and after a little bit more discussion, gave me his new username and password. They had originally been talking to Chris using his CWCSonichu Discord, but sometime in late 2017/early 2018 convinced him to make a new account and to join a new private server in an attempt to avoid detection.\n<p>After Chris gave me access to his Discord, he then gave me access to every other account he owned in an attempt to scan for \"viruses\" - this would later prove instrumental towards building up the evidence that we have. When I logged onto the Discord I was appalled - the level of absurdity that these guys had gone to in order to take advantage of Chris was beyond belief. I saw the constant requests for money, threats, blackmail, etc. and Chris' responses and was simply floored. They were forcing Chris to post videos, Twitter statuses, etc. all in order to get their kicks in addition to the constant requests for money. They had also forced Chris to record a series of videos to his Google Drive in which he beats himself, called himself names, gives a tour of his house (complete with a sleeping Barb), and \"other\" videos in order to use them as leverage against him in the future. They even forced him record a two hour video of himself watching rather grotesque pornography as a \"reaction\" type video.\n</p><p>Essentially what went on for months was a series of \"wash, rinse, repeat\" in which Joshua Wise and Stephen Boyd threaten some random Sonichu/Pony/CPU character and Chris responds with videos, money, etc. in order to save them. At this point I have Chris messaging me multiple times a day and I'm very aware that I've witnessed a very serious crime and I did what anyone else would do in a situation like this that's over their head - I went to @Marvin with everything. He started coaching me on how to talk to Chris and had me stall (i.e. roleplay as Chris) in the Discord chat. He also recommended that I ask Chris to take a break from the internet for a week while we did this and he did. He started watching and catching up with all of the TV shows he was told he was \"banned\" from watching by Wise and Boyd.\n</p><p>During this time I continued talking with Wise and Boyd just enough so that they wouldn't get spooked. If they asked me something I didn't know, I would go to Marvin and/or Chris about it and reply accordingly. At one point they wanted Chris to post photographic evidence that he was indeed himself, writing a message on a dry erase board. I had Chris take said picture for me and then forwarded it to them, etc. Eventually, @Marvin built a script to rip the chat logs from Discord, which amounted to hundreds of pages of autistic debauchery in which these speds took advantage of Chris. When the script was finished and we had the chat logs and images we simply went silent on the Discord and a couple days later Wise and Boyd got freaked out and attempted to sanitize it, banning Chris from the channel and deleting every private message they had sent him one by one.\n</p><p>At the half-way point during all of this @Null had been brought into the picture and was being updated on our progress, what was being said, etc. He stuck his own neck out there and filed the reports with the FBI, Greene County Sheriff, called Boyd's mother, etc. Chris had also taken steps at this point towards assisting in any future investigation, including getting a new phone number, forwarding Null, Marvin and I ALL suspicious incoming messages, giving full access to his accounts, etc. He also collected all of the receipts from Food Lion, which he bought Amazon/GameStop gift cards with, and sent us screenshots of his GameStop order history in which he had sent PS Vitas, the Gwen statue, etc. to both Wise and Boyd's personal addresses.\n</p><p>And then everything just sort of settled down for several weeks. At one point Chris received some texts from either Boyd or Wise attempting to roleplay the Dark Tower with him, to which Chris replied, \"I'll do it for $6,000!\" and naturally, they didn't message again. Chris encountered some really serious monetary issues as a result of this, and at one point was two months behind on his mortgage payments with foreclosure looming. He now regularly speaks and is on friendly terms @Null, @Marvin and I as a result of all of this and we've been actively monitoring his accounts so that something like this doesn't (or is less likely) to happen again, as well as coaching Chris on how to better handle/protect his social media.\n</p><p>It's a shame that law enforcement hasn't done something with this as with everything we have it really is a slam dunk. At our insistence Chris did drop off things to the Greene County sheriff and sent us a copy of the report, but they didn't seem to do anything with it.\n</p><p>So, here we are today.. this should fill in some significant gaps that people have been scratching their head about as of late, i.e. Operation Kingsnake, the weird Twitter posts, videos, etc. earlier this year, the Null pony picture, blah blah blah.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Start_of_the_Guard_Dogs\">Start of the Guard Dogs</span></h2>\n<div class=\"rellink boilerplate seealso\">See also: <a href=\"/cwcki/Guard_Dogs\" title=\"Guard Dogs\">Guard Dogs</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Kiwi_Farms_posts_(The_Captain)\" title=\"Kiwi Farms posts (The Captain)\">Kiwi Farms posts (The Captain)</a></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:152px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:J-chu,_TSSSF_card.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"207\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/7/7e/J-chu%2C_TSSSF_card.jpg/150px-J-chu%2C_TSSSF_card.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/7/7e/J-chu%2C_TSSSF_card.jpg/225px-J-chu%2C_TSSSF_card.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/thumb/7/7e/J-chu%2C_TSSSF_card.jpg/300px-J-chu%2C_TSSSF_card.jpg 2x\" width=\"150\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:J-chu,_TSSSF_card.jpg\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>A <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/TSSSF\" title=\"TSSSF\">TSSSF</a> card of The Captain.</div></div></div>\n<p>Even after the <a href=\"/cwcki/Idea_Guys\" title=\"Idea Guys\">Idea Guys</a> were taken out of power, The Captain continued to be concerned for Chris's health.
