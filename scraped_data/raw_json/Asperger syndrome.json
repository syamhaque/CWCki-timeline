First identified in 1944 by Dr Hans Asperger of Germany, it was unknown for decades in the English-speaking world, and was considered distinct from <i>classical</i> autism for years after that. It is now universally regarded by <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_psychology\" title=\"Chris and psychology\">psychologists</a> as identical with <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/High-functioning_autism\" title=\"High-functioning autism\">high-functioning autism</a>, and the term has been depreciated.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup>\n</p><p>According to Chris, however, having Asperger's is <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_anger\" title=\"Chris and anger\">NOTHING LIKE AUTISM; GET IT THROUGH YOUR DANG, DIRTY SKULLS!!!</a> His view of Asperger's syndrome is extremely warped and inconsistent: he is easily offended by the suggestion that Asperger's is even remotely similar to autism.  He varies between outright denying that it is part of the autism spectrum, to idiotically confusing it with <a href=\"/cwcki/Barbara_Chandler\" title=\"Barbara Chandler\">Alzheimer's disease</a>. He also believes Asperger's sufferers are <a href=\"/cwcki/Aspergers_(CWCipedia_article)\" title=\"Aspergers (CWCipedia article)\">\"stealing the limelight from us autistics.\"</a> Unlike his issues with <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_race\" title=\"Chris and race\">other races</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Homos\" title=\"Homos\">homosexuals</a>, Chris has never attempted to ameliorate or otherwise compromise his statements about Asperger's (with the exception of <a href=\"/cwcki/Apologies_for_offending_people\" title=\"Apologies for offending people\">one half-hearted attempt</a> which mostly ignores the issue at hand) for the sake of good PR, suggesting that it is his most strongly held prejudice.\n</p><p>Chris happens to have made \"high-functioning autism\" a cornerstone of his identity because that's the diagnosis he received as a child in the late 1980s. If he'd been born two decades later, though, it is quite likely he'd have wound up diagnosed with the Asperger's label he so fiercely detests, and he would probably be ranting about the autistics trying to steal his aspie thunder.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Chris_on_Asperger's\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris on Asperger's</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Chris_versus_Autism_Awareness_Month\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris versus Autism Awareness Month</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#References\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">References</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#External_links\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">External links</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span id=\"Chris_on_Asperger.27s\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris_on_Asperger's\">Chris on Asperger's</span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Hans_Asperger.gif\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"thumbimage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"387\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/2/28/Hans_Asperger.gif/300px-Hans_Asperger.gif\" srcset=\"/w/images/2/28/Hans_Asperger.gif 1.5x\" width=\"300\"/></a> <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a class=\"internal\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Hans_Asperger.gif\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Dr. <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Asperger\" title=\"wikipedia:Hans Asperger\">Hans Asperger</a>, the man who diagnosed the condition and raised awareness of autism. Seeing as he was a <a href=\"/cwcki/Nazis\" title=\"Nazis\">Nazi</a>, Chris wants nothing to do with him.</div></div></div>\n<p>For some time, Chris referred to Asperger's as a disorder that affects the memory: <a href=\"/cwcki/IRC_(02_January_2009)\" title=\"IRC (02 January 2009)\">on IRC</a>, in his online <a href=\"/cwcki/Quizzes#Autism_Quiz\" title=\"Quizzes\">Autism Quiz</a>, in the <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_1_Official_Videobook\" title=\"Sonichu 1 Official Videobook\"><i>Sonichu</i> #1 Official Videobook</a>, and in his <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag\" title=\"Mailbag\">Mailbag</a> on <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCipedia\" title=\"CWCipedia\">CWCipedia</a>, among other places. It appeared as if Chris was confusing Asperger's with Alzheimer's disease, an easy enough mistake for someone of his level of competence.\n</p><p>Not long after Chris began answering the Mailbag, Asperger's became a recurring topic in the column. Numerous e-mails doggedly attempted to correct his misconceptions, while in his replies Chris became much more defensive and much less consistent in his arguments about why Asperger's is so different from autism. Eventually, he decided to settle the issue with a <a href=\"/cwcki/Aspergers_(CWCipedia_article)\" title=\"Aspergers (CWCipedia article)\">spectacularly butthurt essay</a>, revealing the real reason Asperger's <a href=\"/cwcki/Family_Guy\" title=\"Family Guy\">\"grinds his gears.\"</a> It's also worth mentioning that in Mailbag 17, Chris confirms that there will never be Sonichu or Rosechu with Asperger's, but there may be human characters with the ailment.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">And those with Aspergers DARE try to take the Shine and Limelight AWAY from us Autistic people, not only with their \"Social Flaws\" and such possibly similar traits to Autism.

He simply feels that people with Asperger's are receiving some measure of the attention and sympathy that he isn't receiving. Naturally, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_anger\" title=\"Chris and anger\">tard rage</a> ensues. In <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_19\" title=\"Mailbag 19\">Mailbag 19</a>, he even admits that the first thing he thinks of when he hears the term Asperger's is \"Competing Retards\".\n</p><p>As per his adamance that high-functioning autism and Asperger's are completely unrelated, Chris also point-blank refuses to acknowledge scientific research that contradicts his statements of so-called fact; indeed, he eventually began totally ignoring any <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag\" title=\"Mailbag\">Mailbag</a> entries that included references to such papers. In a private <a href=\"/cwcki/Vivian_Gee_E-mails,_2010#15_January\" title=\"Vivian Gee E-mails, 2010\">e-mail to Vivian Gee</a> from January 2010, he delivered an interesting spin on his feelings regarding the validity of that research:\n</p>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">I STILL disagree with the \"Scientists\", regardless of how long they may have studied those psychological topics.

For one thing, any such rivalry is nothing but a figment of his overactive imagination, not shared by most people on the autistic spectrum. For another, people on all ends of the spectrum who've been exposed to Chris universally regard him as a revolting embarrassment to other people with the same condition.\n</p><p>He's also just kind of bothered by the fact that it sounds kind of like \"ass burgers\":\n</p>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">I refuse to let something that has a name that sounds like a bad cut of meat and is NOT as Special as us take our light away.\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:11px; padding:0 0 0 16px; vertical-align:bottom; width:20px\">”\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\" style=\"font-size:smaller; padding:8px 36px; text-align:right;\"><cite>Chris, in an <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jackie_e-mails\" title=\"Jackie e-mails\">e-mail to Jackie.</a></cite>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>Chris has yet to realise that the burgers he usually shoves down his throat are often made of minced rump steak, or 'ass burgers', if you will.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris_versus_Autism_Awareness_Month\">Chris versus Autism Awareness Month</span></h3>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism_Awareness_E-mails\" title=\"Autism Awareness E-mails\">Autism Awareness E-mails</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>In <a href=\"/cwcki/April_2010\" title=\"April 2010\">April 2010</a>, Chris uploaded his own version of a web ad for Autism Awareness Month to the CWCipedia. It featured another short rant in which he once again stated his belief that Asperger's has nothing to do with autism, and thus shouldn't receive any extra awareness.\n</p><p>This led a well-meaning volunteer worker to write him and try to correct his misconceptions. She didn't succeed, but their conversation does reveal Chris making some bizarrely contradictory statements, even by his standards. Among other things, he says that the notion of a total disconnect between Asperger's and autism is entirely his own invention, and nobody else led him to that conclusion...but that doesn't stop it from being an indisputable fact.\n</p>\n<table style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:50em;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"border:none; color:#B2B7F2; font-family:'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size:3em; font-weight:bold; line-height:41px; padding:0 16px 0 0; vertical-align:top; width:20px;\">“\n</td>\n<td style=\"border:none; font-size:1.2em; font-style:italic; padding:0; vertical-align:middle;\">For your information, the Fact of Aspergers being different from Autism and of it trying to steal the light is of MY Own Idea.
