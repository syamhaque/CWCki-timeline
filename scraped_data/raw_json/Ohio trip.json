He responded by asking that she come to his house, saying he wasn't comfortable traveling long distances, especially by himself.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup> Over the next ten days, Chris would change his mind and agree to visit, before backing out again, and then agreeing he would start setting aside money for an eventual trip within the next couple of months, though he might bring his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Mom\" title=\"Mom\">mom</a> along. Julie tried to dissuade him from bringing his mom, saying \"I was thinking that when you get here...<a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_sex\" title=\"Chris and sex\">you know</a>.\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup>\n</p><p>During another chat on 22 February, Chris stated that he would \"feel at unease if I made the trip without the emotional support of my family\". He wanted to have Julie talk to his parents in order to gain their support. Julie replied by saying she was beginning to suspect Chris didn't want to see her. Chris stated that his mother was paranoid for his safety and suspected Julie might be a police officer posing as an underaged girl.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup> The next day, Chris reiterated that Barb was still against him going to Ohio. Chris started looking within his church congregation for a different escort for the trip, and suggested that <a href=\"/cwcki/Rocky_Shoemaker\" title=\"Rocky Shoemaker\">Rocky</a> (who has family in Ohio and visits the state on occasion) might be up for it.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-skype12_4-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-skype12-4\">[4]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Things took a quick turn later that day when <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Max\" title=\"Max\">Max</a> informed Chris that Julie had been taken ransom by himself and <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">Clyde Cash</a>. He stated that he would give Chris five days to come to 2229 East 46th St., Cleveland, Ohio and rescue her.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-skype12_4-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-skype12-4\">[4]</a></sup> Unsure on what to do, Chris turned to <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">fans</a> in a Mumble chat for advice. He stated that he still felt insecure about going there against his parents' wishes. Members of the chat persuaded Chris to be assertive and convinced him that it wasn't a <i>To Catch a Predator</i>-style sting, as police posing as minors always explicitly tell suspects that they are underage. Chris said he was going to talk to his mother and put his foot down.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]</a></sup>\n</p><p>The next day (which happened to be his 27th <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Birthday\" title=\"Birthday\">birthday</a>), Chris went to his <a href=\"/cwcki/Aunt_Corrina\" title=\"Aunt Corrina\">Aunt Corrina</a>'s funeral. He discussed his plans with family members and claims they all encouraged him to go to Ohio.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-7\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">[7]</a></sup> He also claims that the spirits of his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Family_tree\" title=\"Family tree\">maternal ancestors</a> wished him a safe trip to Ohio.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-8\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">[8]</a></sup> That night Chris sent the following email to Clyde Cash:<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-clydeemails_9-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-clydeemails-9\">[9]</a></sup>\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>I have NOT failed you, sir, as a matter of fact, I am coming to Cleaveland [sic] tomorrow; I am preparing for my journey, my mind is set, and I have the support of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/God\" title=\"God\">God</a>, my relatives and my friends.

Instead, he filled up his gas tank and prepared for the trip.

Bob and Barb worried that Chris would get himself killed.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-emilydate_12-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-emilydate-12\">[12]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Chris got on <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_81\" title=\"wikipedia:Interstate 81\">Interstate 81</a> heading north; it can then be assumed that he took <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_522\" title=\"wikipedia:U.S. Route 522\">U.S. Route 522</a> and <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_70\" title=\"wikipedia:Interstate 70\">Interstate 70</a> to <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breezewood,_Pennsylvania\" title=\"wikipedia:Breezewood, Pennsylvania\">Breezewood, Pennsylvania</a>, where he got on the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Turnpike\" title=\"wikipedia:Pennsylvania Turnpike\">Pennsylvania Turnpike</a>, which becomes the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Turnpike\" title=\"wikipedia:Ohio Turnpike\">Ohio Turnpike</a> at the Ohio state line. At the tollbooth on the Ohio state line, Chris accidentally locked himself out of <a href=\"/cwcki/Son-Chu\" title=\"Son-Chu\">his car</a>. Somebody at the tollbooth had AAA Roadside Assistance and called them to help Chris get back into his car.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-emilydate_12-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-emilydate-12\">[12]</a></sup>\n</p><p>Chris had <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_money\" title=\"Chris and money\">taken only $50 with him</a>, $40 of which he had gotten the previous day for his birthday. He realized this might not be enough for the trip when he was faced with an $11 toll on the Pennsylvania Turnpike (according to Bob, Chris had never been on a toll road before).<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-emilydate_12-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-emilydate-12\">[12]</a></sup> Around 4:30 in the afternoon Chris stopped in <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetsboro,_Ohio\" title=\"wikipedia:Streetsboro, Ohio\">Streetsboro, Ohio</a> to buy food and gas. He purchased 6.385 gallons of gas from <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sheetz\" title=\"Sheetz\">Sheetz</a> for $11.68 and got a small hamburger with mayonnaise and no <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Pickles\" title=\"Pickles\">pickles</a>, and a lemonberry slushie from <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Restaurants#Sonic\" title=\"Restaurants\">Sonic</a> for $2.70.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-13\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">[13]</a></sup> According to Chris, the slushie was made with real fruit and had two lemon wedges in it.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-14\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">[14]</a></sup>\n</p><p>He arrived at the outskirts of Cleveland soon after, where he called his parents.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-emilydate_12-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-emilydate-12\">[12]</a></sup> Upon reaching 2229 East 46th St., Chris found a run-down old house with an elderly <a href=\"/cwcki/Niggos\" title=\"Niggos\">black</a> woman residing in it. Neither she nor anyone else he asked in the neighborhood had heard of Julie or Max Milvana.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-clydeemails_9-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-clydeemails-9\">[9]</a></sup> Chris then tried visiting an address on nearby East 40th Street (probably a church)<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-15\"><a href=\"#cite_note-15\">[note 1]</a></sup> which the woman said she received mail for; he found no sign of Julie at this address either but remarked at the \"<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jewish\" title=\"Jewish\">Jewish</a> church\" next door.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-16\"><a href=\"#cite_note-16\">[note 2]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-17\"><a href=\"#cite_note-17\">[15]</a></sup> Chris then turned around and headed back towards Ruckersville.

Matthew angrily questioned how it was possible for Chris to drive eight hundred miles for a fake girlfriend, yet he couldn't do the same for <a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey\" title=\"Kacey\">Kacey</a>, who lived much closer to Chris in Washington, D.C.\n</p><p>In <a href=\"/cwcki/CCWC%27s_Final_Warning_to_the_Second_CWC\" title=\"CCWC's Final Warning to the Second CWC\">CCWC's Final Warning to the Second CWC</a>, the trip is mentioned again.
