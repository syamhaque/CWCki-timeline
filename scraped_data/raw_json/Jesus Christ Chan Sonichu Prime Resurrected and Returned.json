  "html_content": "<div class=\"mw-body-content mw-content-ltr\" dir=\"ltr\" id=\"mw-content-text\" lang=\"en\"><div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p><b>Jesus Christ Chan Sonichu Prime Resurrected and Returned</b> is a video uploaded to Chris's YouTube channel on 16 <a href=\"/cwcki/October_2023\" title=\"October 2023\">October 2023</a>. It is notable for being Chris's first upload for more than two years, and the first of the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Second_Coming\" title=\"Second Coming\">Second Coming</a>. In the video's description, Chris links to <a href=\"/cwcki/Praetor\" title=\"Praetor\">Praetor</a>'s online shop <a href=\"/cwcki/OfficialCWCmart\" title=\"OfficialCWCmart\">OfficialCWCmart</a>, indicating he is still in business with the group. It is likely that Praetor influenced this video, seen in the green screen and editing seen in previous Praetor projects.\n</p><p>The video is about 9 minutes long and consists of Chris singing two parodies of songs from the <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Pok%C3%A9mon\" title=\"Pokémon\">Pokémon</a> 2.B.A. Master</i> album in front of a green screen; the first is a spoof of \"Double Trouble\" loaded with slurred, <a href=\"/cwcki/Random-access_humor\" title=\"Random-access humor\">almost nonsensical</a> lyrics, while the second is a parody of \"Viridian City\" that's now centered around going to <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a>. Interspersed are brief messages to his viewers in what seems to be an incredibly loose talk show/podcast format. Clips of Chris dancing are overlaid on top of the video throughout. Overall, unlike <a href=\"/cwcki/Chop_Chop_Master_Onion%27s_Rap_Showdown#Chris's_Version:_&quot;Master_Onion_A-La_Mode&quot;\" title=\"Chop Chop Master Onion's Rap Showdown\">his previous attempts</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/CWC_Music_Video_Holding_Out_For_a_Hero\" title=\"CWC Music Video Holding Out For a Hero\">at making music videos</a>, the production quality is a lot higher, which suggests that other people could have been involved in the video's creation (though in the description, Chris insists that he edited the video himself.)\n</p><p>At the end of the video, Chris presents his hands to the audience and states that he has \"the etchings of where I have been hung on that cross back in Nazareth many a millennia ago.\" No such marks of crucifixion are present. However, this shows that he believes the crucifixion of Jesus Christ took place in his birthplace of Nazareth, not Jerusalem as agreed upon by every Christian sect. This puts Chris' laziness on full display. Despite pretending to be Jesus for nearly two years and a Bible likely being one of the few items he was allowed to have in jail, he has still not bothered to read it. \n</p><p>Despite the improved production quality, the video somehow manages to land among the most baffling and incoherent content Chris has ever produced. Notably, comments were disabled when the video was first uploaded, as the video was marked \"for kids\" by either Youtube or Chris himself. This marking would be removed, and the comment section enabled, around midnight on 17 October, before comments were disabled again a few hours later.\n</p><p>It should be noted that the chorus, where Chris repeats that <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Team_Rocket\" title=\"Team Rocket\">Team Rocket</a> is stupid, is very similar to a part of the video <a href=\"/cwcki/Victory_Rockout\" title=\"Victory Rockout\">Victory Rockout</a>, in which Chris jumps up and down whilst singing about Team Rocket being stupid.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Video\">Video</span></h2>\n<table style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa;
