I've been reading and following <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(comic)\" title=\"Sonichu (comic)\">Sonichu</a> with great interest for several years. I am a cultural anthropologist and college professor. My field of study focuses on American culture, society and values, those sort of things. If you could please take the time to answer a few of my questions I and my future students would be most appreciative. My questions all concern Sonichu and <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu\" title=\"Rosechu\">Rosechu</a>, their family, and their living situation:\n</p><p>1. Are Sonichu and Rosechu living in poverty? They seem to occupy a rather small house for a family of five, and that house is provided by the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a> government. I understand Sonichu is paid for guarding the city, but you also said he has to mow lawns to make ends meet. Yet in your Christmas special, they seem to be living beyond their means, buying the latest video games for very young children who wouldn't really appreciate such things. What is the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sonichus\" title=\"Sonichus\">Sonichus</a>' approximate income? \n</p><p>2. What are Sonichu and Rosechu's educational backgrounds? You show most of the other Sonichus and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Rosechus\" title=\"Rosechus\">Rosechus</a> attending University courses (or high school, as the case may be), but Sonichu and Rosechu seem to have rushed into marriage shortly after they met each other. Most couples -- even ones in stable, long-term relationships -- would delay marriage until after college graduation. Did Sonichu and Rosechu finish (or even attend) high school? Do they have college degrees, or any college education under their belts? If the checks for saving the city stop coming in after <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Slaweel_Ryam\" title=\"Slaweel Ryam\">Slaweel Ryam</a> is defeated, how will Sonichu and Rosechu provide for their three children?\n</p><p>3. Did Rosechu plan her pregnancies, or were the three children \"accidents\"? Many women choose to delay pregnancy until their late 20s or early 30s, when one is usually finished with college and has started a professional career. It's much easier to start a family when one is more established in life. It's also unusual for people in their late teens or very early 20s to have three children, and women in such situations have very stressful and financially precarious lives. Rosechu appears to have hired <a href=\"/cwcki/Heather_Iglesias\" title=\"Heather Iglesias\">a nanny</a> to remedy this. Does Rosechu receive checks from the government to pay for such a service as well?\n</p><p>Thank you in advance for taking the time to answer my questions!\n</p><p>Sincerely,\n</p><p>Margaret Mead, Ph.D, Fordham University\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Sonichu and Rosechu do not live in poverty. Their house is two stories with an attic; the lower story is underground. I never said that he had to make ends meet; he gets paid very well. To cover their essentials and costs for their help in the city, it comes down to an average of $3,500 a month.\n<p>Education is optional for the <a href=\"/cwcki/Pok%C3%A9mon\" title=\"Pokémon\">Pok'emon</a>. After learning basic Home-Ec from <a href=\"/cwcki/Kel\" title=\"Kel\">Kel</a>, Rosechu took <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Women%27s_Rights\" title=\"Women's Rights\">2 years of Home Ec from Cwcville University</a>; Sonichu took the classes with her, and the two took hand-writing, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/English\" title=\"English\">English</a> and such courses together within a total of 4 years time. This all happened before marriage. Sonichu and Rosechu will continue to receive payments, because there are more evil aside from Slaweel that I have yet to draw in the pages. Plus, Sonichu does volunteer work to help rescue citizens from something as basic as a cat up a tree to rescuing captives from burglars and thieves to even rescuing a majority of victims in a large building fire.\n</p><p>The children were planned; the three eggs came out and they were hatched in order as I had described from oldest to youngest; Cera, Christine and Robbie. <a href=\"/cwcki/Heather_Iglesias\" title=\"Heather Iglesias\">Heather</a> gets paid from the monthly checks the Sonichu family receives. But in emergency times, she will volunteer the time and not ask for payment.\n</p><p>Your points for your inquiries are quite valid and well-thought.

I've seen porn. I see what they go through to do that stuff. And you saying that adults appreciate childish pictures of people fingerbanging their friends who happened to look like their imaginary sisters - drawn by a guy with the mindset of a 10-year-old who should be out in the job force but is merely driving this economy down by spending more disposable income - is plain bullshit. I know adults who aren't even bounded by a religion that disapprove of porn, especially when they direct the porn towards a wiki that appears to have been made in an anti-intellectual society (and gets on the point most of the time) and their 20-year-old friends who didn't even care about the artists. You, Chris, are irredeemable - you cannot be changed by any means of coercion or treatment. Your parents brought you into this mess and what do you do to pay them back? You fucking spend their disposable income on video games, kids' toys, and \"hipster\" stuff. I'm sorry to tell you the truth, Chris - you won't listen, as always, but I hope, if God willing, you suffer from something so bad, you'll regret your sloth ways and try to redeem yourself.\n</p><p>But you have already strained relations with everybody.
