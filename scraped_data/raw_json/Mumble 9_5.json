Clyde and the Miscreants again bombard Chris with accusations that he doesn't actually care about the death of his Aunt Corrina, but is more sad that a funeral is ruining his birthday. The trolls again accuse Chris of blowing money on <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Vidya\" title=\"Vidya\">vidya</a> (with Clyde leveling the accusation that Chris and his family have spent more than $20,000 on games). Chris, being Chris, offers little of substance in response.\n</p><p>Chris also aggressively defends that he's a good son to Bob when the topic comes up, claiming that \"..they spent a lot of money on me!\", which says a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_Money\" title=\"Chris and Money\">lot</a> about Chris' character. Clyde's words about Chris not being a good son to Bob also come to pass years later, as Chris chose to <a href=\"/cwcki/Christopher_Paul_Whitney_reveal\" title=\"Christopher Paul Whitney reveal\">make blackmail videos</a> instead of caring for his dying dad, and opted to update his <a href=\"/cwcki/Attraction_Sign\" title=\"Attraction Sign\">Attraction Sign</a> on <a href=\"/cwcki/Facebook\" title=\"Facebook\">Facebook</a> on the same day his father died, and to this day, has mentioned nothing about him, save for <a href=\"/cwcki/Facebook#An_Open_Note\" title=\"Facebook\">siccing his ghost on his trolls</a>.

To date, Chris has still not gotten a job, making this another blatant lie.\n</p><p>Chris eventually storms out of the chat after being told he is afraid to go outside, and that leaving his <a href=\"/cwcki/14_Branchland_Court\" title=\"14 Branchland Court\">house</a> for a change is the only way to get the Miscreants to leave him alone.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Timelines\">Timelines</span></h3>\n<p>(00:00)\n</p>\n<ul><li>The chat begins in the middle of a conversation between Clyde and Chris.
