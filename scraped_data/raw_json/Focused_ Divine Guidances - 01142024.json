In it, Chris confirms that he was indeed removed from <a href=\"/cwcki/Animate!_Raleigh\" title=\"Animate! Raleigh\">Animate! Raleigh</a> due to people's complaints.  He then rambles about being Jesus, his continued dissatisfaction over My Little Pony G5, and people blocking him on social media, before encouraging people to cleanse themselves of dark and evil energy and follow the light path.  Throughout the video, Chris speaks slowly with numerous long pauses between sentences, <a href=\"/cwcki/Creepy_stare\" title=\"Creepy stare\">looks directly into the camera</a>, and infrequently blinks for some stretches, which have been theorized that Chris is being heavily <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_drugs\" title=\"Chris and drugs\">medicated through unknown supplements and medications</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Video\">Video</span></h2>\n<table style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa; background-color: #f9f9f9; color: black; margin: .5em auto .5em auto; padding: 0.2em; font-size:89%; width:260px;-moz-border-radius:10px\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#3366CC\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size:110%; color:#ffffff;-moz-border-radius:10px\"><b>Focused, Divine Guidances - 01142024</b><br/>\n</td></tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<td colspan=\"2\"><div class=\"thumb embedvideo autoResize\" style=\"width: 328px;\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo autoResize\" style=\"\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideowrap youtube\" style=\"width: 320px\"><div class=\"embedvideo-consent\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo-consent__overlay\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo-consent__message\">Click to load content</div><!--\n--></div><!--\n--></div><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" data-src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zgXcB11uRSE\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"180\" loading=\"lazy\" modestbranding=\"1\" width=\"320\"></iframe></div><!--\n--></div><!--\n--></div>\n</td></tr>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#696969\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;-moz-border-radius:5px;color:#ffffff;\"><b>Search for video</b>\n</td>\n<td><a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Focused%2C+Divine+Guidances+-+01142024\" rel=\"nofollow\">YouTube</a>, <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://ghostarchive.org/vidsearch?q=Focused%2C+Divine+Guidances+-+01142024\" rel=\"nofollow\">archive</a>\n</td></tr>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#696969\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;-moz-border-radius:5px;color:#ffffff;\"><b>Stardate</b>\n</td>\n<td>15 <a href=\"/cwcki/January_2024\" title=\"January 2024\">January 2024</a>\n</td></tr>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#696969\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;-moz-border-radius:5px;color:#ffffff;\"><b>Subject Matter</b>\n</td>\n<td><span style=\"display:none\">Conventions</span><a href=\"/cwcki/List_of_conventions_attended_by_Chris\" title=\"Conventions\"><img alt=\"Conventions\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"20\" src=\"/w/images/b/bd/Convention_Subject_Icon.png\" width=\"20\"/></a> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/List_of_conventions_attended_by_Chris\" title=\"List of conventions attended by Chris\">Conventions</a>, <span style=\"display:none\">Trolls</span><a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\"><img alt=\"Trolls\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"20\" src=\"/w/images/b/b7/Trolls.png\" width=\"20\"/></a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">Trolls</a>\n</td></tr>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#696969\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;-moz-border-radius:5px;color:#ffffff;\"><b>Performance Style</b>\n</td>\n<td><span style=\"display:none\">Reason</span><a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_hypocrisy\" title=\"Reason\"><img alt=\"Reason\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"32\" src=\"/w/images/7/79/Reason.png\" width=\"32\"/></a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_hypocrisy\" title=\"Chris and hypocrisy\">Reason</a>\n</td></tr>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#696969\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;-moz-border-radius:5px;color:#ffffff;\"><b>Saga</b>\n</td>\n<td><span style=\"display:none\">Revelations</span><a href=\"/cwcki/Saga#Revelations_Saga_(16_October_2023_-_Present)\" title=\"Revelations\"><img alt=\"Revelations\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"32\" src=\"/w/images/1/1a/Revelationsicon.png\" width=\"32\"/></a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Saga#Revelations_Saga_(16_October_2023_-_Present)\" title=\"Saga\">Revelations</a>, <span style=\"display:none\">Flutter</span><a href=\"/cwcki/Flutter\" title=\"Flutter\"><img alt=\"Flutter\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"32\" src=\"/w/images/1/13/FlutterIcon.png\" width=\"32\"/></a> <a href=\"/cwcki/Flutter\" title=\"Flutter\">Flutter</a>\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" style=\"background-color:#3366CC; color:#ffffff; color:#ffffff;-moz-border-radius:10px; font-size:120%; padding:0.25em; text-align:center;\">OFFICIAL and HONEST CWC <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Videos\" title=\"Videos\">Videos</a>\n</td></tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%;\" valign=\"top\">\n<td><b>previous</b> <br/><a href=\"/cwcki/Animate!_Raleigh#TikTok_video\" title=\"Animate!

Jesus Christ-Chan Sonichu Prime here once again, focused and connected with... everything.  And I will start off by mentioning of course the <a href=\"/cwcki/Animate!_Raleigh\" title=\"Animate! Raleigh\">Animate! Raleigh</a> convention. <a href=\"/cwcki/Flutter\" title=\"Flutter\">Flutter</a> and I, we did attend the Friday, and then we were going to attend the Saturday, but we were intercepted.  Because, like the Romans back in the days of Jerusalem, <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">false witnesses</a> were borne against me, and they were talked about and ratted me out to the organizer of the convention, which that in its entity was quite wrong indeed. And as you all note, as I have exemplified through the event, I continued to love and kept my calm.  I did try to explain, and yet...\n</p><p>[<i>Pause</i>]\n</p><p>At the moment, the demons were too great in that event organizer.  And I feel sorry for that individual, and their accomplices that were with them at the time.  And, despite the efforts of the minority, we did still have a very good weekend.  And I was the one <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_fashion\" title=\"Chris and fashion\">wearing the striped socks</a>.  So you mention that and think about that as you will.  Outside of all that... all of those that dare do and repeat history in dark ways, by following that of the demons and devils, and even Satan himself, in the temptations of darkness, and try to thwart me?  They all shall be thwarted shortly enough.  It is the divine will, along with that of Russia being a modern-day Babylon, to fall as Babylon did, and Vladimir Putin, dying by his own sword.  And everything coming to fruition.  For I have risen before... and I many times risen in this lifetime as well.  Whether you all know it or not, with all the timeline shifts, the cosmic events and everything.  And y'all would actually know the answer had you actually opened your minds and meditated and actually connected.  But not every one of you all didn't.\n</p><p>[<i>Pause</i>]\n</p><p>Not every one of y'all did.  Which is a shame, really.  Because I, <a href=\"/cwcki/Messiah_complex\" title=\"Messiah complex\">when I was Jesus Christ</a> back in Jerusalem once upon a time, I connected with the Akashic Records as well way back then.  But continue to simplify what I could, was what was right, and yet was chronicled of me in prophecy, and then as such within the Holy Bible, and then later on...\n</p><p>[<i>Pause</i>]\n</p><p>...in the later book... Which is... it's escaping my consciousness but y'all know what I mean.\n</p><p>[<i>Pause</i>]\n</p><p>But it still goes in all the connections that all religions are good.  Except for those that have anything to do with the darkness and Satanism [<i>motorcycle audible in the background</i>] and so forth.  The correct religions are those that are good, light-powered and righteous, between Christianity... Mormons, <a href=\"/cwcki/Michael_Snyder\" title=\"Michael Snyder\">Judaism</a>... the Zen, zodiological animals, and all of that.  And all gods- and all gods and goddesses have existed.  They all worked under me... as well as Emmanuel... and worked under that which is above us, of which I am directly connected with, the Alpha and Omega Point of all Existence, that exists at the beginning and end of this timeline, and all timelines.  This timeline being the one <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_television\" title=\"Chris and television\">Prime Timeline</a> of which were all other timelines exists, so... and I am the one <a href=\"/cwcki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender\" title=\"Avatar: The Last Airbender\">Avatar</a> of all Existence.\n</p><p>[<i>Pause</i>]\n</p><p>So definitely be careful what you <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/I_Got_a_Fish\" title=\"I Got a Fish\">wish for</a>.  Because what you should be wishing for is that which is good.  For if you leave your wishes unwarranted, the <a href=\"/cwcki/Kick_the_Autistic\" title=\"Kick the Autistic\">trauma</a> can continue... even by that... which may have come unto unwarranted, in recent days.  Of which I do apologize for, but hey.  ALL OF US, artists, creators, <a href=\"/cwcki/Lainchu\" title=\"Lainchu\">chroniclers</a>, other dimensional and universe and timeline explorers that we have explored and done innately in our writings, in our drawings, in our music, in all of various media...\n</p><p>[<i>Pause</i>]\n</p><p>Welcome to our world.  And the drama from the midst fandoms, which include the minority that are the worst, of the toxic evilest darkest sinning individuals.  They are going to converge upon you anyway, whether or not I had commented on that which does not exist this timeline, <a href=\"/cwcki/My_Little_Pony_Protests\" title=\"My Little Pony Protests\">My Little Pony Generation 5</a>.  Make your mark, tell your tale.  [<i>finger quotes</i>]  \"A New Generation\" movie.  There is still time to shelve all that, Hasbro, and get rid of it.  Because as long as they're made... further developments which are bad, for this timeline shall continue.  Once G4 Friendship is Magic and Equestria Girls are finally resumed [?], and Friendship Is Magic concl- uh- continues on, to the end of its 14th televised animated season, animated as it was, before anything having to do with Pony Life... Money... really <a href=\"/cwcki/Praetor\" title=\"Praetor\">corrupted the business people</a>.  It has corrupted the arts.  And that has been exemplified in the G5 media, which was re-released... re-released prematurely.  As I have foreknown and foretold.  As everyone else have been [<i>unintelligible</i>] understood and observation of.\n</p><p>[<i>Pauses, stomps his foot.</i>]\n</p><p>Help in making sure that we are good in this timeline, in this, our Prime Universe, as the Dimension Merge does complete and the ultimate miracle manifests so.  It is right, it is good, and I will also note, there is no reason to block me on social media, because even if you do you're still going to be attacked by those that follow you, those that follow me, those that follow and troll all those that are famous and creative, because they try to discourage us, among the minority that exists within.  And what we need do is just let that slide.  We need not heed their words.  We need not let that affect us deeply.  All of you hear my call and understand, for we all coexist together in this... drama, in this... form of Hell, as it were.  And it's up to us to beat all the haters and fakers and darkest sinning individuals that try to- tempt us, that try and thwart us into other very emotional directions.  That is not right.  By just simply ignoring them... and only block THEM... and it is I that is not meant to be cursed at all, even when you're in the midst of feeling fatigued and tired and would not want to be involved in drama... you already were involved in that drama.  Directly, indirectly and so forth. [<i>claps hands</i>] Period.  Rather you have been dealt by me before, presently, or not yet at all.\n</p><p>Meditate on that as you will and shall, for it is right and good, and follow that which is light-powered, good and righteous.  But when you do that, and live of your own volition, and using common sense, and following the guidance that feels good, and right, and light-powered.  That... is very good indeed.  And blocking the one individual, which is I, is not right.  Because that is not gonna prevent any of those... be it from my fandom, or your fandom... all of you...\n</p><p>[<i>Pause</i>]\n</p><p>You know that it is they that make those comments, you want to report and block them.  And my name, JESUS CHRISTINE WESTON CHANDLER SONICHU PRIME.  Or I am- as I am also known as: Chris-Chan, Christ-Chan, Jesus Christ Chan Sonichu Prime.  I am not to be cursed, my name is not to be used in slander or defamy of any sort.  Do this and you will feel a massive [<i>unintelligible</i>] in your day, as it were.  But what you have been sent to- and realize that I am good, like all of you are, that are good.  Even the neutral-good.  And also are neutral-bad, or bad that are redeeming themselves, opening themselves up and their minds to redeem themselves and follow that which is good light-powered and righteous.  You know.  But it is those that leave their minds closed, and stick with such bad ways and bad mindsets that are so... over... a decade ago.  Well over a decade ago, decade and a half ago.  2007 called... That's. Not. Me. Anymore. Period.  So get over yourselves.  And accept me for I am good.  I am grounded.  I am much better now.  And I shall not be tempted or swayed by any other dark means whatsoever.  And everyone is tested.  Fail the test by approaching me with any forming of line where you pretend that you don't recognize me, or you see me as someone else, and you post that on the Internet, and such... places on the Internet, you shall be swift Divine retribution, in one way or another.  To not put anything online, whether it be a selfie with me in the picture, or any picture with I... and my friends, and family, and so forth... without my personal consent.\n</p><p>[<i>Pause</i>]\n</p><p>Aside from that, good to you and as you will and shall... and that which is good and light-powered and righteous... and it is rightly so.\n</p><p>[<i>Claps hands, moves his right hand toward the camera.</i>]\n</p><p>I bless all of you, who watch this video and understand.\n</p><p>[<i>Pause</i>]\n</p><p>And if you do not understand, open your mind.  Open your heart.  Open your soul.  Feel... the energy, purify yourselves if you are dark, further cleanse yourselves if you are neutral.  Keep yourself good, if you feel true good clear aura, without any Satanic, demon or demonic influences whatsoever.  For it is right and it is good.  [<i>Nods</i>]  All of you shall be blessed.
