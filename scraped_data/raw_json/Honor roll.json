college, he is wearing a stole that generally indicates graduating with honors. This only means so much without additional context, though. As of the 2013-14 school year, being listed on the Honor Roll for a given semester at Manchester High School only requires a 3.0 grade point average,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup> with no distinction made between harder classes and easier remedial course work (such as the English 12 class where Chris claims <a href=\"/cwcki/How_the_Pok%C3%A9mon_Came_into_Our_Pok%C3%A9Balls\" title=\"How the Pokémon Came into Our PokéBalls\">How the Pokémon Came into Our PokéBalls</a> got an A). The psychiatrist who conducted Chris's <a href=\"/cwcki/Autism_papers\" title=\"Autism papers\">intake survey</a> in <a href=\"/cwcki/2004\" title=\"2004\">2004</a> noted that Chris took regular classes in high school, but he may have only had Chris's word for that. Often, even without remedial course work, it's not hard to get honor roll. Assuming 3.0 was a B or B-, getting enough help from his parents with homework might have made up for a C average on tests. In the first semester of 2013–14, 789 students at Manchester made either the Honor Roll or the more prestigious Distinguished Honor Roll,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]</a></sup> about 40% of the total enrollment of about 1,800–2,000.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-7\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">[7]</a></sup> This may explain why Chris was <a href=\"/cwcki/Count_Graduon\" title=\"Count Graduon\">so upset</a> at being awarded <a href=\"/cwcki/Manchester_High_School#Graduation\" title=\"Manchester High School\"><i>only</i> a star pin for his grades</a>.\n</p><p>On the other hand, it is not completely out of the question to consider that Chris may have been able to get decent grades in school, even in harder courses. His emotional and social issues have always made judging his actual intelligence a little tricky. In \"<a href=\"/cwcki/Song_of_Christian\" title=\"Song of Christian\">Song of Christian</a>,\" he is enraged to receive an F in English, suggesting that he usually got good grades, and also exclaims: <i>\"I mean, I started off with an \"A\" and you just lowered it, lowered, lowered it!\"</i>, indicating that he initially made good grades in the class, but for one reason or another, they had slipped considerably by mid-May.\n</p><p>Chris's basic cognitive functions appear to work fine, as the 2004 psychiatric survey confirmed, and in some respects he seems to be no less intellectually capable than many ordinary people. He has a reasonable facility with <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Computers\" title=\"Computers\">computers</a> and technology, for instance. At the same time, his <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_stress\" title=\"Chris and stress\">laziness</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Na%C3%AFve\" title=\"Naïve\">naïveté</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_his_ego\" title=\"Chris and his ego\">egotism</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_anger\" title=\"Chris and anger\">temperament</a> and <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_sex\" title=\"Chris and sex\">sexual frustration</a> have led him to ever-increasing depths of self-destructively foolish behavior. The Miyamoto Saga offers an interesting example of this contrast. Chris was bright enough to eventually work out that the e-mails he received from \"Miyamoto\" came from an easily-spoofed domain; however, one would think that if he could deduce this, he should never have believed that <a href=\"/cwcki/Nintendo\" title=\"Nintendo\">Nintendo</a> was interested in his <a href=\"/cwcki/Sonichu_(character)\" title=\"Sonichu (character)\">low-quality recolor</a> in the first place.\n</p><p>One would think that all Chris would need to do to end the doubts of his alleged intelligence would be to post his grades. Sadly, according to <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_19#We_cannot_see_Chris's_report_cards\" title=\"Mailbag 19\">Mailbag 19</a>, Chris's report card papers were said to be locked away beyond his reach. This could have meant a number of things. They could have been buried under the hoard, he might have been lying about their existence, or he might have just been too lazy to get up and find them. Since the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Destruction_Of_Chris%27s_House\" title=\"Destruction Of Chris's House\">house fire</a> and the disorganization of the year-long <a href=\"/cwcki/Rental_House\" title=\"Rental House\">relocation</a> in 2014, the documents, if they exist at all, are undoubtedly even less likely to ever be disinterred.\n</p><p>Chris also claims that the grades testifying to honor roll status are a matter of <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_21#When_you're_27,_nobody_really_cares_about_your_high_school_report_cards\" title=\"Mailbag 21\">public record</a>, and that interested parties should contact the high school directly. However, <a href=\"/cwcki/Trolls\" title=\"Trolls\">those</a> who might be interested in accessing the Chesterfield County Public Schools hall of records should note that the school district website states otherwise.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-8\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">[8]</a></sup>\n</p><p><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bob\" title=\"Bob\">Bob</a> stated in a <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler%27s_call_with_The_P_Capsaicins\" title=\"Bob Chandler's call with The P Capsaicins\">call</a> with <a href=\"/cwcki/ThePCAssassins\" title=\"ThePCAssassins\">ThePCAssassins</a> that Chris did not, in fact, make the honor roll.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-9\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">[9]</a></sup> It is possible that Bob was either mistaken, lying or progressing into senility. Also casting serious aspersions on his purported honor roll status is the fact that, in <a href=\"/cwcki/A_Week_With_Christian_Chandler\" title=\"A Week With Christian Chandler\">A Week With Christian Chandler</a>, Chris nonchalantly documented that he slept through much of his class time – in twelfth grade. When Chris reiterated on <a href=\"/cwcki/July_2014_Facebook_Posts#Honor_Roll\" title=\"July 2014 Facebook Posts\">Facebook</a> in <a href=\"/cwcki/July_2014\" title=\"July 2014\">July 2014</a> that he was honor roll, a friend who claimed to be a fellow alumnus challenged, \"How's that possible when you barely passed Mrs. Dorazio's class? Remember? I was in that class with you... you don't have to lie to be cool.\" Chris's report card for Mrs. Dorazio's class had been leaked the previous month, however (see below), so the friend's comments should be taken with a grain of salt.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"June_2014_leaks\">June 2014 leaks</span></h3>\n<dl><dd><i>Main article: <a href=\"/cwcki/Manchester_High_Leaks\" title=\"Manchester High Leaks\">Manchester High Leaks</a></i> <i></i></dd></dl>\n<p>In June of 2014, information was released on the <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCki_Forums\" title=\"CWCki Forums\">CWCki Forums</a> about Chris's high school days. These documents revealed that, despite one or more teachers giving him high marks that he indisputably did not deserve (possibly out of pity or their own incompetence), Chris got a D+ (72%) in English for the spring 1999 semester, and got low scores in at least two other classes. Extrapolating backwards from his English report card, however, his grade for fall 1998 was a relatively decent 84%, probably a B. Suffice to say, this, plus the content of the actual documents, cast yet more doubt on Chris's claimed honor roll status.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Notes_and_references\">Notes and references</span></h2>\n<table style=\"background:#FFF; border:1px solid #00F; border-top:8px solid #00F; color:#000; width:100%; max-width:618px; margin:0 auto 16px;\">\n<tbody><tr style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<td style=\"padding:5px;\"><a class=\"image\" href=\"/cwcki/File:Nownownownownow.jpg\"><img alt=\"Nownownownownow.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"88\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/6/66/Nownownownownow.jpg/90px-Nownownownownow.jpg\" srcset=\"/w/images/thumb/6/66/Nownownownownow.jpg/135px-Nownownownownow.jpg 1.5x, /w/images/6/66/Nownownownownow.jpg 2x\" width=\"90\"/></a>\n</td>\n<td style=\"padding:0 5px 0 1px; width:100%;\"><div style=\"font-size:1.25em; margin:0\"><b>THAT IS MY LINK!!!</b></div>\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:0\">This article contains link(s) which have been <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Walks_In\" title=\"Bob Walks In\">cut down</a> by <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler\" title=\"Bob Chandler\">the Internet Lumberjack</a> or which have otherwise crashed into slumber due to <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_stress\" title=\"Chris and stress\">stress</a>.
