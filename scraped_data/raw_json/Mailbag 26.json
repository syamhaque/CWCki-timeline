It was answered two days later, on the 30th.\n</p><p>Amongst this batch, Chris explained why he put up <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Kill_de_Jack\" title=\"Kill de Jack\">his Christmas video</a>, denied that he had fleas, revealed that he doesn't know what \"asexual\" means, and yet showed his usual intolerance towards gays and transgenders. Chris's ability to notice who's writing him was terribly inconsistent here. He called out \"Stephen King,\" but didn't catch an equally-obvious letter from Chris Brown. Likewise, a letter from someone claiming to be <a href=\"/cwcki/Magi-Chan\" title=\"Magi-Chan\">Magi-Chan</a> was deleted forever, but a letter from <a href=\"/cwcki/Blake\" title=\"Blake\">Blake</a> was answered without any comment as to its writer. It's likely Chris only recognized the letter from Stephen King because an episode of Family Guy was specifically dedicated to King and his works. \n</p><p>Notable in this set is that Chris finally responded to <a href=\"/cwcki/Evan\" title=\"Evan\">Evan</a>, but only to implore Evan to reconsider wanting him to kill off <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Simonla\" title=\"Simonla\">Simonla</a> for the sole reason that it would take away <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Wild\" title=\"Wild\">Wild</a>'s girlfriend.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Answered\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Answered</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#How_the_Chris-Chan_stole_Christmas\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">How the Chris-Chan stole Christmas</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Mary_Lee_Walsh_trolls_IRL\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Mary Lee Walsh trolls IRL</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#In_which_Chris's_brain_starts_to_work!\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">In which Chris's brain starts to work!</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#...then,_promptly_shuts_down_again\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">...then, promptly shuts down again</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#It_isn't_theft_if_Chris_dumps_a_boyfriend_on_them\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">It isn't theft if Chris dumps a boyfriend on them</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Chris_hates_da_homos:_Part_9001\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris hates da homos: Part 9001</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Chris_uses_advantage\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris uses advantage</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#New_Year's_wishes\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">New Year's wishes</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Moar_pron_plz,_kthnx\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.9</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Moar pron plz, kthnx</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#Chris_and_asexuality\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.10</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris and asexuality</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#Why_Chris_hates_prostitutes\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.11</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Why Chris hates prostitutes</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-13\"><a href=\"#Reusing_the_same_excuses_for_everything_else!\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.12</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Reusing the same excuses for everything else!</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-14\"><a href=\"#Rejected_Mailbag\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Rejected Mailbag</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-15\"><a href=\"#Chris:_friend_of_homos_everywhere\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris: friend of homos everywhere</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-16\"><a href=\"#Gone_forever\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Gone forever</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-17\"><a href=\"#Magi-Chan:_voice_of_the_people\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Magi-Chan: voice of the people</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Answered\">Answered</span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"How_the_Chris-Chan_stole_Christmas\">How the Chris-Chan stole Christmas</span></h3>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #B48246; padding:5px; background-color:#FCC\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>From: <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliens_(film)\" title=\"wikipedia:Aliens (film)\">Trevor Wierzbowski</a> &lt;silentbughunters@yahoo.co.uk&gt;\n<p>Christian,\n</p><p>I use to be a big fans of yours, but after the video you posted on Christmas day to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jack\" title=\"Jack\">Jack</a>, I must say I am disgusted in you.
