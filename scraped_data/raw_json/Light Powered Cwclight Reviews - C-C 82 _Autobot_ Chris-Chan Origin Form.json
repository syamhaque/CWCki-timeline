style=\"background-color:#ccf;\">Text from YouTube's captions\n</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>yeah well every prime has their origin and sometimes it takes them a lot\n<p>longer to actually find themselves and mentally and emotionally get their together so be patient with them they\nare manifesting and doing\nHey what's up everybody on YouTube jesus Christ channel Sani Prime here once again and today we are starting on wave\nthree of Transformers Legacy Diet Burge starting with the origin form of\nChristian Prime or just Christian as she was known before she came prime or her\noriginal name CC82 so here we are and there she is and\nfirst and foremost always we'll take a quick look at the packaging so right up front we got a really impressive front\ncover art i mean look at that aura she's got that rainbow glow going on look\nshe's even analyzing that matrix under the microscope and it's glowing it's so\nbeautiful i mean look at this look at it look at it it's so gorgeous and\ninspiring yes anyway yes transformers Legacy Transformers Legacy I merge that\nwas when my tongue stopped working for a moment is she is a Voyager class\nclassif and uh on this side of the bot you got the uh lovely artwork of\nCC82 with uh that rung gun going all the way to the uh that's the front of the\nbots and uh let's uh the camera a little bit so you can see the top and uh yeah\njust Christian Chan or and CC2 and\nChristian Chan in Cybertronian and it's actually got a bit in quality isn't that nice and then on\nthe side of the box you got the uh lovely half of the poster art and uh h\nthere's something different about this as opposed to the uh bottom half of the uh other art of the other poster arts on\nthe other boxes so h maybe they actually got a good artist to actually do this or\nsomething i don't know there's something I just I can't quite put my finger on it\nall right so yeah we got that going on and then so yeah there's the uh top the box and uh there's the bottom with the\nwords things and barcodes and uh on the back of the box you got your obligatory process does this that and the other and\nyou got a little rung gun you mean you got more of one and just look at that action pose and scan the matrix and uh\neverything and uh that's basically it for the\npackaging and moving right along so here we have CC82 in her origin form she was a\nmicroscope are you surprised yes because she was very smart and she was very\nstudied in everything cyberronian and metaphysical and so on so of course\nshe's going to have something quite inspiring and mental and good to go so\nlet's get a closer look and uh look at the uh details so yeah you got the uh\nmicroscope and uh top going on right there and yep little bomb with the uh\nlittle tray right there for the specimen and uh the uh base you got that going on\ngot all And then the sides you got the little faux dials on there and then there's the back there's some uh sticker\ndetail on here and there that's a bit more obvious in robot mode and that's aside from the allot symbol right there\nyeah so anyway yeah and then just essentially yeah there's the top of that and then there's the bottom um it's a\nmicroscope but I it doesn't really roll but it can slide like microscopes can\nslide hooray for sliding gliding fun\nmicroscopes so moving right along for comparison well we'll just uh get a few\nprime comparisons out of the way first and foremost so here she is with Prime just a truck i mean kind of\nlike Well there you go and here she is with the Studio\nSeries Hot Rod so you can see that there i mean hardly a contest microscope\ncar and of course uh here she is with uh Chris Chan Prime her future self in her\nupdated glory i feel like the differences will be more clear in robot\nmode and here she is with in a group shot with Sonchu Edelina Silver Prowler\nArmorat Bumble and even Jetness guitar mode all right and here she is with the\ncombiner team of Autobots from Clickfield Wave Roll Out Armorats and Chapper\nand here she is with the Decepticons we have so far the first Punis lab the first SAV and Decepticone\nCollector and of course here she is with her best friend forever Mr\nrung bit off center but you know there she is with Mr\nrung and here she is with a couple of her other p other microscope and details\nso here she is with the times return perceptor see that's what's going on\nright there that's a considerable mold made if you'd like and here she is with\nstudio series perceptor and uh I'll get to the uh comparison between the those two\nperceptors as well but I feel like just between the two the times return version\nthe big winner in comparison let me shrink\neverything yeah all right so there you\ngo all right so now let's go over the accessories she comes with and she comes with quite a few so for starters she\ngets her uh little gun so as we're talking about she has her own little headmaster because she eventually became\na headmaster and separate herself from her robot body and uh she comes with uh\nnot one but two little rung partners huh\nwe'll get to for details upon why later but just to give you this\nuh but just to give you this quick comparison boy pause and boy was that\nawkward that my right arm had to go off screen in front of the camera just to reach for the other one oh and I got to\nget the big rung as well all right what three two one go all\nright so yeah for comparison so here's this uh rung with the uh pink rung that\ncame with her future self Chris Chan Prime and here's the little rung\nwith the big rung you know what let's just I'm going to just uh lay these right here so you can see the comparison\nget this out of the way been a funny day but oh well it's been a funny day but oh\nwell needs a little bit better come on yeah oh well work what you got work\nwhat you can do all right so get the camera back up where it was so yeah we\ngot you get those and um you also get some lovely little effects parts you get\nthese two little zappy effects parts right there they'll plug into the uh\nlittle rungs right there we'll have a blouch moment in a while and I am reminded of another detail but\nanyway but yeah you get those little effects parts and of course she comes with her uh headmaster right here that's\nuh definitely different from the from the future self let's get a closer look\nand uh look at the details oh yes perfect focus yes all right so you got\nsome lovely detail over the place on this little robot body here and of\ncourse the uh Yeah there's the upside down face right here and um for comparison uh here\nis that little headmaster with Soni right there that comes with\nSonu and here she is with the G1\nheadmaster all right so anyway so there's lot Oh I forgot the one most one\nof the most fun important accessories so you get you also get the core of the\nMatrix right there all nice and done in gold paint with lovely little\ntranslucent uh blue center that lovely little gem right there which eventually\nshe does get her own matrix of leadership albeit from herself count from an alternate timeline that uh well\nit ended up shortly after but anyway so we can incorporate these so you got options so of course you can uh take the\nlittle headmaster here and do this as well but what you mainly want to do is uh have the little matrix you plug it in\nright here got this little groove right here that this little bit right here is going to\ngo into you just tap that in there that'll hold that in place and there you go she's scanning the core of her matrix\nthat she had just imported and what we like what the instructions tell you to do and what I like doing is you take the\ntwo rungs and you put them on the side it's like uh she's got her own little conductors going on but yeah then this\nis just the basic part where these little parts come in so one up here and\none up here and you got your electrifying moment yeah all right but you do have an\noption for storing you do have options for storing the gun in this mode you can pop into the little port on the\nmicroscope if you really wanted to or what I like doing because I feel like it's a bit more arrogant there's a that\n5 mil pre on the back just plug it in right there and just like if you have it\ndirectly looking at you you hardly know it's there it's just that's just pretty\ncool all right but anyway so without further ado let's get down to transformation shall we let's let's\ncan't really get spin out of the microscope but all right so first\ntransformation go ahead get this out of the way so we'll transform one of the two little rungs and uh just get that\nsplit the legs and uh pull the arms out from behind there and then you rotate\nthis bit and and there you go you got your you got your little rung guy and we'll do\nthe comparisons a little bit later in the robot mode so anyway let's get closer look at the details of the little\nrung and just you got a lot of details in the face and the uh orange not the\norange some grays a little bit red so you got that going on and there's the\nback just big old backpack right there articulation articulation wise what we\ngot so nothing at the head the arms can do a full 360 and they can go in and out on that ball joint and uh you got\nuh you got waist rotation as well so legs they can go forward that far and\nback that that far but farther if you want to if you get the backpack out of the way so\n[Music] outward about that far you got a little bit of rotation with that uh ball joint\nthere attached to and nothing at the knees nothing at the feet so there you go that's this little rung this little\nrung guy so we'll do that comp robot comparison later right now let's\nuh get her into get this one into her secondary alt mode so yeah she does have\na second alt mode as opposed to microscope and this is quite simple so you're going to rotate the uh microscope\npart like this and if you want to keep that in place you got this uh part right\nhere that you can flip out and now just hold that right there now you want to take the legs you got a little tab that\ngoes in that slot right there you pull that out and you just uh rotate this around a little bit and you just rotate\nthe leg until the peg is angled so it can go into that side and just plugs in right there and\nsecond verse is just like the first unpack the uh leg from there rotate that\naround rotate that bit get plugged into the shoulder right here and uh also you\nalso definitely recommend you want to just uh pop this pop this up a little bit so you got\nthis being upward so then uh you can take her tight master flip out the arms\nforward i forgot about my articulation on tight master so yeah head can rot head is on a ball joint wiggly waggly\ncan do a full [Music] 360 silly day I've had anyway look up a\nlittle bit down some arms can move up and down and uh a little bit outward and\nlegs can go can go move forward that far back that far and you have that uh\nbackwards and forwards knee joint right there anyway so just get the little tie\nmaster in her seat position pop into that uh groove right there so she could\nbe manning the uh big cannon\nand make sure I got that yeah I think in this instance I like I feel better with\nthat not using that just this works a bit better and then don't have to wait further adjustments\nthere's another one for the uh blooper reel that ends up being published on the uh final video but anyway there you go\nthere you have CCA2 in her tank mode you know it's\ndecent little tank mode it's good and everything and uh yeah so pretty much a\nlot of the details you've seen before obviously and clearly and just that's uh the kind of\nreverse yoga pose going on right there yeah but of course uh what we like doing\nI'm going to put the little rung back in the weapon mode for this\nbecause we can pop them onto the sides\nhere and there you go there's a bit of triple force going on right there oh articulation but yeah so you can rotate\nyou can pull you can ro angle the uh you can angle the cannon as you like\nout there if you don't pull it off and it rotates so you got that going on and\nyou can slightly angle the uh tank upward if you dis if you dislodge the joint right there but yes of course and\nyou got the tank mode right here all right and here she is\nwith Prime\nwith Hot Rod\nwith Christian Prime and uh of course\nuh with her big wrong\npartner all right so here is uh here she is with uh the Quickville Autobots Sonu\nBumble Lumba Prowler Silver Omarats Atelina and Jet in his guitar\nmode and here she is in the group shot with the combiner team uh Roll Out\nChapper Farshot and Wave here she is with the uh Decepticons we have so far\npunlat the first that SAV the first and Decepticone\nCracktor and of course times return Perceptor in his\ntank mode there you go and that's not the\nending that's not transition period and of course with\nStudio Series Perceptor that\ndidn't yep so there you go all right so let's get down to\ntransformation once again shall we let's There you get an easier spin in the tank\nmode all right so let's remove the two rungs in the side\nhere and uh take the talking master out of it uh the seat position I'll go ahead\nand just uh pop it into head mode just obviously arms to the side then bump it\nover and around chin there you go that's ready to go all right so then we take the uh legs\nsplit them from the side rotate get them angled outward and then rotate them downward you take this blue piece that's\nthe extension part you rotate that in flip the foot out second verse just like\nthe first pull that down rotate make that that's forward then rotate this out\npop the leg up go ahead and take the camera you can leave this on here if you want to but I kind of feel like um I\nlike actually having it uh off but of course when I have it in robot when I\nhave this in robot mode I'll uh when I have it in robot mode I'll\nhave it stored on the back which I'll get to in a little bit so I'll just for now leave it on just put it back here\nlike this i'm leaving it like that so you can take the arms out rotate the fists out then you rotate them upwards\nget the arms rotate it down like that same thing on the other side push this down take the chest plate put that in\nplace this little belly button piece put that in place and then of course missing a head there's the\nhead getting there secured okay\nyeah yep actually yeah that's another detail so I'll go ahead and do talk about this as well see you got that 5\nmil port right there and of course that peg that'll go into the slot right there what I like doing in regards to the uh\ncannon and storage I like to put it on the back like that but we'll go into other options in a little\nbit all right yeah it can make it a bit heavy come on you stand can you stand\nbecause it's normal darn this table i'm going to take\nthe camera i'm going to take the scope off and put right here for right now make it easier all\nright and but yeah there you go there you have uh CC82 origin form Christian\nPrime Autobot in her robot mode and she does really good in the robot mode and\nyou got all the lovely little details and everything going on here so let's get closer look at the details\nnot on the belly button eyes up there whoop eyes up here so\nyes so yeah um focused as possible um\nwell anyway so here she is in her robot mode and she's got love she's got lovely little face features though it's like\nit's not so clear with the as in tell with the camera but anyway yeah she's got\nhochromeia right eye green left up blue and she's got pinks and blues on her\nhead and she got all kinds of pinks and blues all over by lots of good sticker\ndetail and couple of silver ones on her shins and just uh give you turn around\nand we'll go at the back so there's the back as well\nyep so yep there you go all right so what we got for\narticulation i'm going to tell you not sure we can see everything with the camera so yeah typical with high\nmaster and master heads and the ball joints they got your wiggly waggly wiggly waggly she can only look up a\nlittle bit she can look down a little bit head can do a full 360 arms can do a full 360 they can move in and out you\ngot bicep rotation and 90° of bend there at the elbow no wrist rotation but the\nhands can move anywhere now we're doing a transformation no waist rotation legs\ncan move forward that far back that far when you don't have the backpack on\noutward she can do the full splits and then some if you want to use that transformation joint and then some it\njust It looks really weird looks really weird but still fun and uh you got thigh rotation legs you got full range of leg\nmovement right there and you have a toe joint you can go down can't really go up\ntoo much and there you go all right so let's run through the\naccessories once again so you can definitely uh got the gun so you can\ngive her this gun and uh you can give her one of the\nrungs in one hand and if you really want to feel like you could uh store one on the arm right now and uh yeah she can\nbang bang bang bang and all that good stuff oh of course duh i feel dumb take\nthis it I should have done this in the first place you can have that she could be holding the two rungs or Yeah here\nyou go here you go holding her scoping cannon so yes she can do pew pew bag and all\nthat epic excellent good stuff all right so as I just made pretty much\nclear you have the 5mm ports on either forearm you can plug these or the other\nor this gun in and mainly well like I said I like\nstoring the microscope on the back in this hole and uh you got the little five wheel\nport right here so you can store the other gun on that as well or one of the two rungs or you do have this option as\nwell you have this slider it's slide it all the way over\nhere it's tight on my copy and you have this 5 mm port right here and you can\ntake this and store it back here like that and maybe probably a bit more\nelegant if uh this way so that's a thing\nif you want to do it if you want to do it and uh also you can take the uh\nlittle mattress core you have a slot right there it's not a secure hole but\nit'll sit in there tap that slide in but yeah you can tell it's not secure like\nthat and yet if you put the Titan master in there that sits more secure that's not\nfalling out what's up with that h Well here's a scary moment if you really want\nyou could take that core end\nwell core head that's scary like shockwave and as\nI mentioned earlier these two rugs are blouch compatible yes they are so we could take our lovely little blue shoes\nhere we can even take the little ladyb blue shoes which I do like they're so fun and good and I'm going to do it this\nway where they're on something they're on the arms like that as supposed to ho them because if the she holds them in\nher hands and she's not able to flex her elbow like that to get holding upward\nright so I feel like this works better anyway so you could do it with the uh full\nblush if you really wanted to but in this case I want the full want the\nlittle lightning bolts as well so yeah so we'll just take this off we'll go with just the uh smaller\nportions uh plug one in here and\nuh in here and uh in here and uh actually yeah let's do I'm\ngoing to be more symmetrical like this put the one of the lightning bolts here and plug the other little lightning bolt\nthere you stay on there you stay on\nthere yeah there you go there there you go this will work all right i'm going do this so you can see the face as\nwell come on stay up stay up all right but with this we can do a big old origin\nChristian Chad\n[Music] CC82 an all powerful prime origin\nblush and now for comparison here she is with her BFF Mr\nwrong as you can see right there\nwith prime yeah that's a bit of a height\ndifference right there isn't it and again she was she was young she\nhad not become a prime yet here she is with Hot Rod\nand here she is with her future self Christian\nPrime here she is in a lovely dynamic group shot with Sonu Silver Etselina\nProwler Armorat Jet and Bumba Lumba\nand here she is in that dramatic pose alongside Wave Fireshot Chappet and Roll\nOut and I'm thinking Wave right there is being very judgmental about the haters and the fakers in the audience that are\nwatching this right now so yeah here she is with the Decepticons we\nhave so far pun the first SA SAV the first and Decepticon Corrector\nand I suppose we'll do a bit of a side byside comparison putting her in the center ring and here we have CCA2's rug\nwith her future selves run partner and big rung as well as Sani in\ncomparison and now for a sidebyside comparison here she is with Titan's\nReturn Perceptor and with Studio Series\nPerceptor and uh just as I mentioned earlier it's like night and day between\nthe Titans Return and the Studio Series and the clear winner between the two is\njust Titans Return i\nmean they don't rotate on that shoulder i mean you could do that that don't work\nyou could do that just what's up with that that's not in the show that's not the comic book you do like the sidearm\nright there but that don't work but then yeah you can rotate this\nso yeah there you go and that was another detail I forgot\nto mention if you have this on the thing you can ro on the here you can rotate\nthat as well and yeah you could use that slider and yes you can get rid of the\novershoulder cannon so there's this lovely little comparison\nas well so there you\ngo so yeah this here is CCA2 Autobach Christian origin form and\nyeah she's quite the very decent figure not without her flaws of course like there's like a little bit of a like a\nbow it's going to be easy to uh knock back over and uh some connectivity issues and like wire two of the ports\nthat little matrix just uh doesn't want to stay connected in the uh big gun for\nthat bit of storage so that's a flop and a bit of a bust right there but oh well but still just an all round decently\ngood figure and just I do like this part i'd like to like the mode and uh yeah of\ncourse she is definitely the bot that uh was not only a technician a scientist but she was quite the metaphysical\nspiritualist type of individual and that continuation she got her promotion and\ngot her mates of leadership yep so anyway so there you go\nnow I picked this up from Target and you're going to find these popping up in your Walmarts as well as the big bad toy\nstore Entertainment Earth and all the other fun good places check out GameStop all that and uh so yeah this is the\nstart of wave three for treasure services except merge and uh this is this here is uh\nCCA2 Albach Christian Prime origin form and this is Jesus Christ son saying\nremember you don't stop playing because you grow up you grow up because you stop playing be geek be crowd\nand that is going to be just\nprime geek be proud you know what's coming\nup oh hello Chris so I see so what's this lovely little project you got going\non here well Optimus Prime needed a few more Autobots so the cause and actually\nmaking a few more i'm This is my first one i'm making for the team and I'm thinking about dubbing it after that of\nwhich I found out of that of which I got my name from the avatar of all existence\njust importing a bit of the old Allspark energy for the well of all sparks in the center of Primus\n[Music] itself oh my\ngoodness oh my goodness chris your spirit is so successful it's alive\nalive yes it is or rather he\nis uh hey can you hear me are you\nfunctional uh yeah I think so um uh wow\nokay uh arise Sonu welcome to\nCybertron is that where I am uh\nuh are you my mother in a way yes but I prefer you\nthink of me as your fellow Autobot autobot okay i see i am going to\nneed a whole bunch of data and understanding i shall teach you personally as will my best friend here\nmy assistant Rug right here good evening soju it is very nice to meet you uh yes\nit is very nice to meet you as well Brung okay\nwell I don't know where to start i feel a little bit hungry yes though we shall\nget you some food and nourishment free up an air John john huh huh is that\nanything like a\npineapp pineapp huh yes I think so in my meditations and connections with the uh\nplanet Earth i do believe that is a a specimen of food from there and I'm thinking I\nsee reason to believe that not only did I name this Autobot after the very first\nSonichu of all existence that I have become aware of but I think I've brought in the soul of a Sonichu from\nEarth oh I think you might be right okay\num I don't really know what you're talking about lady\n[Music] uh Sonu and what was my name again i have\ndubbed thee Sanchu oh okay well then I guess I feel a little\nbetter all right so shall we go get you some air John please lead the way i thought we\nhave a lot to learn about where I am now even the future leader of an Abad team\nwith such the circumstance could only have the appropriate name of which I had\ndiscovered and dubbed him and you know what to quote Optimus that's just\nprime and I'm good with\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\"
