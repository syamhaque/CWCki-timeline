Think about it.<br/>\n2. <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/My_Little_Ponies\" title=\"My Little Ponies\">My Little Ponies</a>. For girls.<br/>\n3. Drinking <a href=\"/cwcki/Semen\" title=\"Semen\">semen</a>. Pretty gay.<br/>\n4.

You sang <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/I_Love_the_Nightlife\" title=\"I Love the Nightlife\">I Love the Nightlife</a>, a gay/lesbian pride song.<br/>\n9.

Well, let me address your signals accordingly,\n<p>1. The website is www.adameve.com; they give you a Free Random Gift with a purchase of $17 or more; RANDOM. I have ordered ONLY Woman Love Dolls and DVDs from there. It doesn't really matter with them; when the Free Gift is of Their Choice, NOT MINE, it is a surprise.<br/>\n2. I have tucked all but a select few and my Custom Creations in a box in another room a few months ago. I have grown out of that as well; mainly Decorative items anyway.<br/>\n3. I was <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Fanta\" title=\"Fanta\">RECYCLING</a>, until I had learned otherwise from my gal-pals, so I had stopped over a year ago.<br/>\n4. I mostly have and Enjoy Images of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Vagina\" title=\"Vagina\">Vaginas</a>, Breasts and Women in my head. The images of the contrary ONLY started when I was being Mislabeled; it relatively forced the images onto me along with the stress. I REALLY TRULY DETEST THOSE STRESSED-INDUCED NIGHTMARE IMAGES.<br/>\n5. Granted, but I have watched a LOT of <a href=\"/cwcki/Anime\" title=\"Anime\">Dude Shows</a> as well in my lifetime., such as <a href=\"/cwcki/Transformers\" title=\"Transformers\">Transformers</a>, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Dragonball\" title=\"Dragonball\">Dragonball, DBZ and DBGT</a>, <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_Bebop\" title=\"wikipedia:Cowboy Bebop\">Cowboy Bebob</a> [<i>sic</i>], <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlaw_Star\" title=\"wikipedia:Outlaw Star\">Outlaw Star</a> and many others. And I am looking up more shows of the sort from the current decade, such as <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackass_(TV_series)\" title=\"wikipedia:Jackass (TV series)\">Jackass</a> and Sports Shows and Movies.<br/>\n6. That is your opinion, yet I partially agree with you on it not attracting women so well.<br/>\n7. I enjoy HER BODY and HER VOICE; She is among my Top 3 Women Celebrities who I Would Love To Fuck; 1) <a href=\"/cwcki/Britney_Spears\" title=\"Britney Spears\">Britney Spears</a> 2) <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamela_Anderson\" title=\"wikipedia:Pamela Anderson\">Pamela Anderson</a> 3) <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Jo_Johnson\" title=\"wikipedia:Amy Jo Johnson\">Amy Jo Johnson</a> (the original Pink Ranger from the Mighty Morphin' <a href=\"/cwcki/Power_Rangers\" title=\"Power Rangers\">Power Rangers</a>, and she starred in the movie <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susie_Q_(film)\" title=\"wikipedia:Susie Q (film)\">Suzy Q</a> [<i>sic</i>]).<br/>\n8. When I sang that, I was singing it for me Enjoying the Nightlife with WOMEN. Again, that is your opinion of the song, and if it is true, I Never Knew That. I thought the Gay's Anthem was <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-Teens\" title=\"wikipedia:A-Teens\">A*Teens</a>' \"<a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_Queen_(song)\" title=\"wikipedia:Dancing Queen (song)\">Dancing Queen</a>\".<br/>\n9.

He initially refused to make a video for me because he said it \"got him in trouble before\". I didn't know what he meant, so he sent me here to see videos of him talking to previous girlfriends and how the nasty trolls got him in trouble for it. Mind you, he was very careful to remind me that this website is full of lies and shouldn't be trusted, despite the fact he himself sent me here.<br/>\nBut I respected the fact he was at least being honest with me about this online shit. Or so it seemed. I watched a bunch of his videos, got more and more disturbed by them. I questioned him on some things, like how he apparently cheated on one of his ex-girlfriends with some other girl online. As was quite insulting (but not at all surprising now that I've familiarized myself with this site), he lied to me and said it never happened. Even though he himself admitted to cheating on her in a video HE MADE.<br/>\nAnd a bunch of other shit he lied about too. Like professing his love for me every five minutes, even though he COULDN'T REMEMBER MY FUCKING NAME.

He calls this website full of liars, but as far as I can tell he's a worthless piece of shit and this site is pretty frank about it.
