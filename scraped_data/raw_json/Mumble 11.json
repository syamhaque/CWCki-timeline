Chris demands he be muted and it is done.</li>\n<li>BlueSpike stole Chris's Yahoo! account. He gave it to him to prove his love for <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Julie\" title=\"Julie\">Julie</a>, but he was Julie all along.</li>\n<li>GeckoMantis is surprised Chris thought BlueSpike was a girl.</li>\n<li>Chris is typing loudly in the background, trying to get his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/PSN\" title=\"PSN\">PSN</a> back from BlueSpike.</li>\n<li>Chris can't upload pages because BlueSpike took his website down.</li>\n<li>A troll points out that as Chris's polar opposite, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Reldnahc\" title=\"Reldnahc\">Reldnahc</a> should be dead. Chris says forget about that, they have opposite characteristics. \"I'm straight, he's a homo\".</li>\n<li>BlueSpike is unmuted.</li>\n<li>Chris will help a female fan write a hentai story. He will possibly watch porn for inspiration as he needs to know anatomy \"between breast sizes and pussies.\"</li>\n<li>Another fan says that Chris should be more wary of Internet girls. Chris says when he's better he'll start going out in public.</li>\n<li>BlueSpike says that girls might actually talk to Chris now that he doesn't have his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Medallion\" title=\"Medallion\">medallion</a>. Chris replies that he can make <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Medallions_of_Fail#Mark_3\" title=\"Medallions of Fail\">another one</a> and has the memories linked to the medallion in his <a href=\"/cwcki/Amnyfest_Ring\" title=\"Amnyfest Ring\">Amnyfest Ring</a>.</li>\n<li>Chris admits <a href=\"/cwcki/Julie_Reveals_Herself\" title=\"Julie Reveals Herself\">cutting the medallion up and shoving it up his ass</a>. He says it hurt.</li>\n<li>BlueSpike is IP banned.</li>\n<li>They verbally abuse BlueSpike.</li>\n<li>Chris says that <a href=\"/cwcki/BILLY_MAYS\" title=\"BILLY MAYS\">BILLY MAYS</a> is not Mayor of <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">CWCville</a>.</li>\n<li>Chris confirms that the medallion has nothing to do with being mayor. BlueSpike questions why they should believe him without his medallion.</li>\n<li>Chris says that the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ring\" title=\"Ring\">ring</a> has been linked with the medallion the whole time.</li>\n<li>The fans say that only the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris-Chan_Sonichu\" title=\"Chris-Chan Sonichu\">powers</a> are transferred. Chris says everything is.</li>\n<li>When challenged that he's not out of the time vortex yet, Chris says he's drawing himself out. <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_reality\" title=\"Chris and reality\">He is adamant that this event in the comic is canon to real life</a>.</li>\n<li>Chris gets on the phone to a fan offering condolences.</li>\n<li>When the redundancy of the medallion is pointed out, Chris says it was like a security blanket.</li>\n<li>The first medallion didn't have a ring holder, but the second did. He transferred his memories from the first to the second, now they have been transferred from the second to the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ring\" title=\"Ring\">ring</a>.</li>\n<li>Chris offers no comment on <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Medallions_of_Fail#The_Rosechu_Medallion\" title=\"Medallions of Fail\">his</a> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Medallions_of_Fail#The_Jiggliami_Medallion\" title=\"Medallions of Fail\">other medallions</a>, e.g. <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Medallions_of_Fail#The_Black_Sonichu_Medallion\" title=\"Medallions of Fail\">Blachu</a>.</li>\n<li>Chris gets on the phone with someone who seems to be asking for his parents. He proceeds to talk and lie to this person as if they're a person with some authority over him. Only parts are audible.</li>\n<li>After several minutes, Chris tells the fans he has to go and leaves.</li>\n<li>The fans are left thoroughly confused and annoyed.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Transcript\">Transcript</span></h2>\n<p>NOTE: I'm only adding in names that are either large names or are directly attributed to in the chat itself.\n</p><p>[<i>Several people talking at once; someone says \"I can hear you\" and as the voices die down someone asks \"How are you, Chris?\"</i>]<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Well, I got a cold.
