The letter was received on Helena's behalf by Twitter orbiter @EelsandtheEgman to save Chris the trouble of sending mail internationally to Argentina.\n</p><p>This is the first letter in which Chris discusses his experience at the facility where he was held between February and May 2022. Although the name of the facility was censored by Helena, mentions of the unit in which he stayed and one of the employees who interacted with him make it clear that he was indeed held at <a href=\"/cwcki/Western_State_Hospital\" title=\"Western State Hospital\">Western State Hospital</a>, as some had speculated. Chris also makes his most explicit denial of <a href=\"/cwcki/Affair_with_Mother\" title=\"Affair with Mother\">incest</a> to date, insisting that he never had sex with <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Barbara\" title=\"Barbara\">Barbara</a> and that his claims of having done so from his <a href=\"/cwcki/Incest_Call\" title=\"Incest Call\">call with Bella</a> were just \"Big Talk\".\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Helena.27s_Letter\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Helena's_Letter\">Helena's Letter</span></h2>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #F2E6FF; border:1px dotted #B1A3BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Hello Christine,\n<p>I am Helena G F, the one that wrote before or at least tried to. I also write and draw\nabout Pickchu. You got taken away when I tried to send you letters. I didn't have a way to get\nthe letters back. I am worried for you. I basically write to you because nobody is providing news\nabout you. I saw your latest photo. It broke my heart. The first picture you look so confident and\nnow it looks like something happened. I can't help but cry for what happened. I catch myself\naudibly sobbing when I see an old video from before the incident. I want to BELIEVE you were\njust saying stuff to impress bella. I want to believe that you did not do THAT.\nIn other news Null got the first batch of Chrischan silver coins sent to England stolen by\nsomeone. ALL of the first batch. Also Dillin, the one that leaked your DMs? His career crumbled\nand now is being made fun of people and had to delete videos, rebrand and then finally leave\nthe internet. There are rumors that after a month (today is Mother's day in USA) he is going to\ncome back. Either way he and Taylor split and she spoke so much dirt about him. I was in Rogue\nThe Internet Man's Discord channel. Both GiBi and Dillin's servers got deleted. I lost contact\nwith the people that used to draw Sonichu stuff.\nWhat have I been doing these months? Doing commissions mostly, found a writer for\nSonichu issues for like a month and then he stopped paying me to draw them. I can't finish any\ncomics that are not commissions. I think I experienced this before when I stopped drawing\nSOnichu stuff Back then I stopped drawing all together for 5 months. Went back to draw when\nallowed me to draw Sonichu content again. Lately my Sonichu content is getting violent and\ngory and I am worried there is resentment and hate in my art. I KNOW vent art is a healthy thing\nbut the level of violence is BIG.\nWhat I asked in the less secured return addresses letters was for your help. For your\nscripts to bring to life the 100 comics in the other dimension. I can draw from 4 Sonichu styled\npages to 12 if I work hard enough. I can do this. Please trust me to make them a reality. I will not\nprofit from them. It means no selling them or charging people for seeing them (would get\nleaked anyways). My idea? To create an audience on Comic Fury (Tapastic and Webtoons kicked\nmy Sonichu content out) of the official continuation of Sonichu. I know I asked you before but I\nhave the feeling that NOW is the moment. You can open another paypal by then and gain some\nmonetization. I just want to see Sonichu comics and be able to do Commissions in that style\nwhen asked but mainly I want to see the comics here.\nEither way this letter is probably going to get leaked so don't tell me anything you want\nto be private. Save that for the DMs. I don't usually pray but I hope what is fair happens. Good\nluck, Chris.\nHelena.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><span id=\"Chris.27s_Response\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Chris's_Response\">Chris's Response</span></h2>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>\n<p>(1)                                       06012022<br/>\nHey, Helena<br/>\nI had attempted to write to you less than a month ago (enclosed is the photocopy of the original returned letter).

Thank you.\n</p><p>Second, I offer confirmations to you: the violent drawings you've made are and have been precurssors foretelling the violent and spontaneous combustion death to come, and have come, upon the Toxic individuals of 1218 Earth; you may as well draw death peices of Sockness and Vladimir Putin as well on that note.\n</p><p>Also, now is the time I can tell what happened (I've written in more detail in a recent Goddess Log page that I shall personally share online After my safe return to the Sonichu Temple, as Foreknown.).\n</p><p>I have had foreknown about the Betrayl plans from <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bella\" title=\"Bella\">Bella</a>, <a href=\"/cwcki/Null\" title=\"Null\">Null</a>, as well as <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sockness\" title=\"Sockness\">Sockness</a> long before even <a href=\"/cwcki/June_2021\" title=\"June 2021\">June, 2021</a>.

I confirm unto you in direct honesty that it Was Purely Big Talk from I; No sex was had between Barbara and I. All that happened was Simple Soul-Bonding, cuddling, hugs, and cheek and forehead kisses; nothing more. In the Soul-Bonding and talking, I had made great effort to restrengthen her mentality and emotions through talking and getting her to recall her past in story telling. Also, I Divinely Did heal and cleanse her of her sins and regrets, Very much similar to what happened between Barabbas and I before Pilate back in my past Book of Life off and on that Crucifix.\n</p><p>I was to be Betrayed and Jailed, anyway; my testimony not credible to the Judge and (Modern Day vs. Jerusalem Year 40 A.D.) Lawyers and \"Legal System\" (Neurotypical Script-Followers like unwoke Sheep or NPCs), any Testimony from Barbara rendered Moot and unaccounted due to her age, <a href=\"/cwcki/Incest_Call\" title=\"Incest Call\">Bella's LEak Video</a> rendered Moot due to her own Confession of Faking the Details herself, a Massive Number of False Witnesses and Testimony from the \"Comments Sections\" and all, and no eyewitnesses to the Facts.
