I assure and promise to you, Catherine: I did not have a crush on <a href=\"/cwcki/Tiffany_Gowen\" title=\"Tiffany Gowen\">Tiffany</a> at all during High School. The only time that would be considered contrary was at the Seinor Prom. No one had asked me to dance, and I went there with my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Barb\" title=\"Barb\">mom</a>. Tiffany asked me to dance with her; it was good. But with the learning of the set up arrangement last year, and upon recollection and reflection, that was probably a set up arrangement as well.\n</p><p>My High School crush was <a href=\"/cwcki/Kellie_Andes\" title=\"Kellie Andes\">Kellie Andes</a>. But then I had heard a rumor near graduation about her going outwith some other dude. And I lost touch.\n</p><p>I was moreover not over the Friendships of ALL of my High School Gal Pals: Tiffany [x], Kellie [x], <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sarah_Bevel\" title=\"Sarah Bevel\">Sarah</a> [x], <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Molly_Quarles\" title=\"Molly Quarles\">Molly</a> [x] (who is still a friend, and on my Facebook Friends List), and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Miranda_Joyce_Mitchell\" title=\"Miranda Joyce Mitchell\">Miranda</a> [x] (who I still have never found anywhere online, so she is undecided). Aside from Kellie, I did not have the deeper feelings for any of my gal pals, but I still was close with them, I cared about them as my friends, and I definitely felt comfortable around them. Seriously, I was totally <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Naive\" title=\"Naive\">Naive</a> on the subject of <a href=\"/cwcki/Dating\" title=\"Dating\">Dating</a> throughout High School, even though I had a sexual education class. Which led me to my later idea of encouraging <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Dating_Education\" title=\"Dating Education\">Dating Education</a> Classes alongside Sexual Education in High School. Anyway, Kelly blocked me on Facebook a few years ago, and l have gotten over her well over a decade ago. And\n</p><p>last August to October, while I was totally on getting the Class of 2000 Reunion going on the 15th year, since the ten year reunion did not work out. I also built the original Lego High School building, before the fire last January, which melted the top portion and about the back walls of the building. I still am glad I rebuilt it with renewed dedication to Manchester High.\n</p><p>When I was contacting as many classmates as I could last year, I talked with Sarah Bevel, and eventually, She was the one in Mid-October who totally devastated my High School Memories by being the first to tell me that their friendships with me were a set up that occurred between my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bob\" title=\"Bob\">father</a> and the principle. I became More VERY Upset and Sad!\n</p><p>sigh\n</p><p>And with the bullying from Sarah and Tiffany since then, I really wanted to know Why the hell they hate me for other than no reason. I was mostly over all of that before you found me on <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/OKCupid\" title=\"OKCupid\">OKCupid</a>. And then, just recently when I was messaged the link to Tiffany's Facebook.\n</p><p>Yeah. So anyway, while I am feeling more crestfallen about that, I am more into the relationship between you and me, Catherine. You continue to care about and love\n</p><p>me; as I still do for you too.

I am still thinking ahead for the <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_sex\" title=\"Chris and sex\">sex time</a>, when we get there. No hurry. I'm feeling a bit nervous about it. I have mentioned before I had an idea for keeping my <a href=\"/cwcki/Duck\" title=\"Duck\">penis</a> and testicles hidden when we would be tribbing; I made a sort of early prototype of a strap-on (I would wear my belt to keep it on) that pushes my parts into my body and hold them there in place. My initial design didn't quite work out during testing; it kept flipping around, the testicles kept dropping out. I was under a misunderstanding of the direction the penis popped out from. It apparently was more vertical than horizontal. I need to examine myself further on that. I later recalled the <a href=\"/cwcki/Sex_toys\" title=\"Sex toys\">strap-ons</a> offered for the optional dildo, so I checked on adameve.com. I see a few possible products that might keep my parts pushed in, but I would have to order one later one and figure that for myself.\n</p><p>It's not immediately important; as a soulful lesbian, for my own identity and ability, I want to be able to perform a tribadism the best I would be able to (and keeping the protrusive parts out of the way too).\n</p><p>If this topic bothers or offends you, please let me know, and I will not bring it up again. Thank You, Love, for listening. &lt;3\n</p><p>Stay Safe and Well with Peace,\n</p><p>Christian W.

Years ago, I had a small vibrating dildo, and one time, I put it up my behind with it turned on. Seriously, it did nothing for me. Now fast forward to tonight: I had the idea of using the new one that came with the strap on to try to get the washcloth up there to clean the <a href=\"/cwcki/DIRTY,_CRAPPED_BRIEFS\" title=\"DIRTY, CRAPPED BRIEFS\">crap</a> out; that idea failed. Then I got an impulse to shove it up there in the tub with the water; it went in easier, but it was either hitting my bladder or prostate; it was without a doubt more painful than anything pleasurable to me. My impulse conned me into shoving it up there four times in different ways; all the while still more painful. It did not get any stains on it. I felt off-balance after getting out of the tub and drying myself. It was about 3/4 inch longer than my erect part. I put the thing in the dresser drawer with my deflated woman <a href=\"/cwcki/Kimmi\" title=\"Kimmi\">sex doll</a>; I had not used it in months. The non-living things doesn't cut it for me as they had years ago (the women sex dolls). That's another lesson learned for myself.\n</p><p>Thank you for listening, my Loving Heartthrob. &lt;3\n</p><p>Stay Safe and Well with Peace,\n</p><p>Christian W.

Have some empathy and put yourself in my shoes in your imagination. I have described how I have been feeling lately after you said \"I don't want to be in a relationship with you\". Take what you have learned about me from our conversations and time together face to face: of who I am, and my emotionally. You're me: from my eyes and heart, pretend you are doing and have done about near everything I had done for you. Before meeting you, I was paranoid and depressed from loneliness and the damn Internet trolls. Imagine from about when I sent you the message on <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/OKCupid\" title=\"OKCupid\">OKCupid</a>, and then your response shortly after, and so forth. Everything building up within me with you, the first date meeting at Applebee's, the more recent bowling date, the try of getting together at the Pride Festival yet your car problem happened. I wanted to come to your rescue and worrying about you. That time I was in VA, you were in New York with Shaina, and then suddenly, Colin enters and takes you on the cruise outing, and me not knowing him better at the time for the while. Ecetera.\n</p><p>Take your time with empathizing there: it's like reading a book and imagining Everything from the lead character's perspective.\n</p><p>Anyhow, I am still feeling the heartache and depression, and Unless you want to come over here and offer me condolences and compassion, or restarting the open relationship, it could take me a LONG time, or less if I should die early from said depression, to make any significant emotional recovery there.\n</p><p>Think, Imagine, and Emphasize on all that from my perspective.\n</p><p>Sent from my iPhone\n</p><p>Stay Safe,\nChrisitan [sic] W.
