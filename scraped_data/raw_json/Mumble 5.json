A little bit more.<br/>\n<font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie</b>:</font> Yes, it was rather nice.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash:</b></font> Something productive.

Depends.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> I mean... y-<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> I have to he- wait for them to call me back. Them to call me back.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> I mean, it could take months. I mean it's taking me months til anything starts and till then, you gotta find yourself a way of financial security. Besides, aren't you gonna have to make a trip anyway? You've got to have to save up money somehow.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> Myeah. I'm gonna save up money for a month.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> How are you gonna save money? I mean <a href=\"/cwcki/Monthly_tugboat\" title=\"Monthly tugboat\">$800 a month</a>... really?<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> Yeah... it'll be a while sure, but I will have it saved up.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> But don't you got bills to pay? After bills, how much do you have left?<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> I don't need to tell you my financial situation.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash:</b></font> I think Julie would like to know. Right?<br/>\n<font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie:</b></font> Clyde, stop it.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah Clyde, leave us alone.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> I'm not doing anything harmful, I'm just asking how you're going to save money up for a future family. I mean if you cannot even do that... then, there's... there's no way your family will be a success. She will divorce you quicker than... I dunno. I dunno.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> I'm working on [<i>Julie chimes in, inaudible, along the lines of never divorcing Chris.</i>] controlling my <a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_money\" title=\"Chris and money\">compulsive spending</a>.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> It's not just controlling your spending. You can do that easily. The thing is you need more than $800 a month. Way more to support a family.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> Maybe so, but at least I'll have some money tucked away before I start that family up.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> And how much do you have tucked away right now?<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> (Smug) I have about 100 bucks tucked away right now.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash:</b></font> <i>[laughs]</i> Chris... $100 might last you a week.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> Shows what you know.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> Ok. In an average week how much do you think you'll spend on food for let's say, two adults and uh, well you're not going to have a child that fast, so just, let's go with two adults.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> Hmm. I'm sorry could you repeat the question?<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash:</b></font> How much do you think it would cost to feed two adults, let's say you and Julie, for a week?<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> I'd say probably about... right about somewhere between twenty to fifty.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> Alright, let's just say thirty to average that out. You got seventy bucks left that week. Now, let's see: you got bills to pay. Hmm... And that's obviously got to be like... what kind of bills you got? TV, you got Internet, I mean, Julie, what other amenities do you need?<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> She doesn't have to answer you.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> I'm- My God. It's simple. You got TV, you got your car payments, car insurance, you got your Internet, you got utilities, it's all gonna add up. $100 is not going to last a month.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> I tucked a hundred aside and uh, a hundred a month and I'll have enough money saved up. Over that time.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> The thing is what happens when you run out?<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> Then I'll save up some more.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> No, that takes time. Ahh... I mean, oh my God. How much money do you think it costs to raise a family for a year?<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> I'll bet that might seem to run into the thousands.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> And if you save $100 a month... you'd barely get $1,000.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> Well if I have to, I can and will get a job.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> And again, I looked over your <a href=\"/cwcki/CADD\" title=\"CADD\">files</a>. Why do you think you got an F on that?<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> I did not get an F on that.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> Ohh, oh, what'd you get then?<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> I got... an A+. It took me weeks to months. A whole lot of thought. It's that big grand <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville_Shopping_Center\" title=\"CWCville Shopping Center\">shopping mall</a> with the mayor's office on the other floor.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> But you got an F in the comics, I thought that's what you got.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> Well, you misunderstood.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> Well, how did I misunderstand? I mean, it says, \"I have Grade F destruction,\" that definitely implies Grade F.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> It was on previous projects before that one. One or two.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> But then why'd you have to villainize him? I mean everyone gets failing grades, you don't have to have some...<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> Because he talked down to me, he made me feel inferior.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> My God. I mean, you didn't even utilize the 3D aspect of <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoCAD\" title=\"wikipedia:AutoCAD\"><i>AutoCAD</i></a>, did you?<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> 3D aspect of?<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> You know, you got your Y plane, your X plane and your Z plane. You have a X and Y plane. You never used a Z plane.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> I do use the Z plane.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> I didn't see that in that project.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> <i>[condescending]</i> Well, did you have a CADD program in your computer?<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> Yes! I have the official one from <i>AutoCAD</i>.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> I see.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> Lemme tell you, did you even bother to look for a job utilizing that degree?<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> I have. And it's a bit... on a shortage right now.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> Did you even go in for an interview?<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> I have gone in for interviews, yes.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> With what companies?<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> <i>[long pause]</i> Look, there's so much <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress\" title=\"Stress\">stress</a> right now, I've got a headache. It's hard for me to think of specific names at the moment.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> So you're lying to me, is that what you're saying?<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> I am not- I am not lying to you.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash:</b></font> Julie, listen to that. He can't even name one company he's tried to work for. Tell me, do you think a man could financially support you like that?<br/>\n<font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie</b>:</font> Uh, yes [<i>Chris says \"leave it-\"</i>]. It's possible. He can do it.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> [<i>Clyde, inaudible</i>] Yes, I can.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> This is American dollars we're talking about, the conversion rate is so much different.<br/>\n<font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie</b>:</font> I don't care, you can do anything.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> Yeah.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> Ok, well you're a little delusional. In <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/America\" title=\"America\">America</a> we've got a bad economic spin right now. A really bad one.<br/>\n<font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie</b>:</font> I understand that.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> Me too.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash:</b></font> No you don't, Chris. You don't listen to the bad news. You said it yourself. You don't listen to the bad news.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> <i>[overlaps]</i> I do too. I had to listen to it from my <a href=\"/cwcki/Bob_Chandler\" title=\"Bob Chandler\">father</a> every day, when I'm trapped with him in the car, or when I'm downstairs with him.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> Ok, wait, why are you going with your father in the car? For what?<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> Sometimes I go out-go out when him when he goes on trips, he goes downtown for- to run an errand. And sometimes I'll even go out with him for his morning cup of coffee. And than I get a <a href=\"/cwcki/Coffee_Place\" title=\"Coffee Place\">cup of coffee</a> as well.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> Okay. Tell me. Tell me why we've got an economic crisis.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> <i>[long pause]</i>One reason? The high gas prices being raised by <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_people\" title=\"wikipedia:Arabian people\">the A-Rabs</a>. They gettin' greedy. And the low amount of available jobs being made. A lot of people are getting fired, and a whole bunch of other stuff I can't think of at the moment, because I'll admit sometimes my memory fails me.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> What the hell kind of answer was that?<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> It's an HONEST one.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> Is it the truth? Have you even looked it up? Do you understand what a bank does?<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> Bank. Keeps your- it does- they- you store your money in the bank. Eventually it increases with interest, and you can spend some out of it and you can put some more in it.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> How to banks make- how do banks raise the money to give people interest? How do they do that?<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> Okay, I'll admit you got me there. I don't know.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> That is the reason why we have a terrible economic meltdown right now. Because banks are giving out loans that people cannot pay off. And now it's all come tumbling down. A bunch of corruption, a bunch of terrible loans, and a president who didn't know what to do. You're telling me you're financially prepared to take on a <a href=\"/cwcki/Lovely_Weather\" title=\"Lovely Weather\">future wife</a>?<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> I didn't- I... I did not say that I-<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash:</b></font> I'm doing this for the good of Julie. Do you understand what I'm asking you? This isn't hatred against you or anything. I'm trying to make you a better person.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font>  Yeah, listen. I may or may not be financially prepared at the moment, but I know that I am emotionally prepared.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash:</b></font> Look, I wanna tell you the story of my government teacher. He had it all. He was completely prepared to marry his sweetheart. But you know what he didn't have? Money. He was trapped with student loans and college and he could barely pay off everything in his apartment. He's eighty and he hasn't- and he's never heard from her since. Now, I don't want you to grow up to be a lonely old man, but... you don't have the money. Julie's gonna leave you. Julie is going to leave you. And I know this.<br/>\n<font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie</b>:</font> No I'm not.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I have faith in Julie. She has faith in me.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> As I said, faith means nothing. As I said last time, if you end up homeless, it's over. She's going to leave you.<br/>\n<font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie</b>:</font> No I won't. I would never do that.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash:</b></font> Julie.<br/>\n<font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie</b>:</font> What?<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> You know, you seem to be trapped in a fantasy world of romance where you think things will work out in the end. Let me tell you something. It doesn't. It doesn't work out in the end.<br/>\n<font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie</b>:</font> Yes, it's true. It will.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> It doesn't.<br/>\n<font color=\"#CC00FF\"><b>Julie</b>:</font> Isn't that right Chris?<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> <i>[overlaps]</i> I'm just giving you stories, my own stories, my own personal tales of loss. And things do not work out like you see in the movies. You have to agree with me on this. The divorce rate in America is 50%. Fifty God-damn percent.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> Maybe so, but the other 50% are still happ- are still happily married.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> You don't know if they're happy. They could be in it for the tax. Tax breaks, and what not. They might not- they could be separated. My parents were for quite a long time, and than they got divorced, and then they died. It's a sad tale. You gotta understand.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> Look. Yeah. I'm hear- I-I- I'm understanding where you're coming from. But you do not need to reflect your own bad times among other people.<br/>\n<i>[Voices overlap]</i><br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> What about your parents Chris? What about your parents?<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> Oh, let me ask- let me tell you something. I talked to my mother. They never got drunk before they had me. They planned me. They met in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/1979\" title=\"1979\">1979</a>, they married in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/1980\" title=\"1980\">1980</a>, I was born in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/1982\" title=\"1982\">1982</a>.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> I trust the word of <a href=\"/cwcki/Cole_Smithey\" title=\"Cole Smithey\">your brother</a> more than the word of your parents. Because <a href=\"/cwcki/Barbara_Chandler\" title=\"Barbara Chandler\">your mother</a>'s been lying to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Cole\" title=\"Cole\">Cole</a> for quite a long time. Did he ever find out who his real father was?<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> Yes. He did.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> Really. I should ask him, I should ask him.<br/>\n<i>[Voices overlap, Chris says \"And he'll tell you that-\", Clyde inaudible]</i><br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> I'm sorry, go ahead.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> No, you go. You go.<br/>\n<font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris</b>:</font> Anyway, you'll find an answer the same thing from him that his fa- that his blood father was a drunk.<br/>\n<font color=\"#4DBD33\"><b>Clyde Cash</b>:</font> And, uhh, but what about your mother? Didn't she divorce?
