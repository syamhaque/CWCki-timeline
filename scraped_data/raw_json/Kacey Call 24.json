A wide range of topics such as Barb being sick, job hunting at Target, cleaning his room, Kacey allowing her gay friends to touch her boobs, Chris's sexuality were discussed.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Summary\">Summary</span></h2>\n<ul><li><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris\" title=\"Chris\">Chris</a> says that his <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Mom\" title=\"Mom\">mom</a> had food poisoning, so they went to a doctor and found out that it wasn't food poisoning. So they went back to the restaurant to complain anyways.</li>\n<li>Chris is amazed that families and friends of cancer patients will shave their heads to support the person with cancer.</li>\n<li>Kacey asks about Chris's <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Room\" title=\"Room\">room</a> getting cleaned. Chris is \"still working on it!\", but <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Kim\" title=\"Kim\">Kim</a> suggested that Chris take his <a href=\"/cwcki/Lego\" title=\"Lego\">Lego</a> city apart. Kacey asks for pictures. Chris will think about it.</li>\n<li>Chris is still trying to get a job at <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Target\" title=\"Target\">Target</a>, but has applied to two other stores.</li>\n<li>Chris was talking to a girl named Regina, the girl whose father bought Chris's two <i><a href=\"/cwcki/Guitar_Hero\" title=\"Guitar Hero\">Guitar Hero</a></i> <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Guitar\" title=\"Guitar\">guitars</a>. Chris went to meet her, and she didn't show up.</li>\n<li>Chris talks about the <a href=\"/cwcki/Emily\" title=\"Emily\">Emily</a> date, and claims that the <i>man in the pickle suit'</i>s name is Harold.</li>\n<li>Chris talks about the <a href=\"/cwcki/PVCC\" title=\"PVCC\">PVCC</a> trolling him, and Kacey says that such an organization doesn't exist and he just thinks too much of himself. Chris says they do it for the L-U-L-Z (spells it out).</li>\n<li>Chris gets stressed out when Kacey says that he's not important enough to spend that much effort on.</li>\n<li>Chris claims that he gets lots of emails from men asking him on dates. Kacey says that's a compliment, and he doesn't come off as straight. This makes Chris yell in a high pitched voice: \"OH JESUS CHRIST! I'M STRAIGHT! WHAT THE HELL!\"</li>\n<li><b>Kacey says it's common sense to not reply to trolls. Chris says \"Let me tell you about common sense,\" and says that he had sex with a FEMALE BLOW UP DOLL, not a male blow up doll, so it's obvious that he's straight!</b></li>\n<li>Kacey says that Chris should just be bisexual. Chris yells \"I HATE LOOKING AT PENISES!\"</li>\n<li>Kacey: \"I have <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Gay\" title=\"Gay\">gay</a> friends, and they're always grabbing my boobs! It's okay because they're gay!\"</li>\n<li>Kacey tells Chris to stop sighing because it makes him sound like a baby. Also to stop saying \"whatever.\" He sighs several times while Kacey talks.</li>\n<li>Chris asks what Kacey wants to talk about, and Kacey says she doesn't care unless Chris can tutor her in her Statistics class. Chris says that he's really good at it and that he can help her with it.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Video\">Video</span></h2>\n<center>\n<table style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa; background-color: #f9f9f9; color: black; margin: .5em auto .5em auto; padding: 0.2em; font-size:89%; width:260px;-moz-border-radius:10px\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFFF00\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-size:110%; color:#008080;-moz-border-radius:10px\"><b>Kacey Call 24</b><br/>\n</td></tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<td colspan=\"2\"><div class=\"thumb embedvideo autoResize\" style=\"width: 328px;\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo autoResize\" style=\"\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideowrap youtube\" style=\"width: 320px\"><div class=\"embedvideo-consent\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo-consent__overlay\"><!--\n--><div class=\"embedvideo-consent__message\">Click to load content</div><!--\n--></div><!--\n--></div><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" data-src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/e_sD9CXBaX4\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"180\" loading=\"lazy\" modestbranding=\"1\" width=\"320\"></iframe></div><!--\n--></div><!--\n--></div>\n</td></tr>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#696969\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;-moz-border-radius:5px;color:#ffffff;\"><b>Stardate</b>\n</td>\n<td>31 August 2009\n</td></tr>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#696969\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;-moz-border-radius:5px;color:#ffffff;\"><b>Featuring</b>\n</td>\n<td><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris\" title=\"Chris\">Chris</a>; <a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey\" title=\"Kacey\">Kacey</a>\n</td></tr>\n<tr valign=\"top\">\n<td align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#696969\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;-moz-border-radius:5px;color:#ffffff;\"><b>Saga</b>\n</td>\n<td><span style=\"display:none\">Liquid</span><a href=\"/cwcki/Liquid_Chris\" title=\"Liquid\"><img alt=\"Liquid\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"32\" src=\"/w/images/8/85/Liquid_saga.png\" width=\"32\"/></a> Liquid Saga\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" style=\"background-color:#FFFF00; color:#008080; color:#008080;-moz-border-radius:10px; font-size:120%; padding:0.25em; text-align:center;\">Audio Recordings\n</td></tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%;\" valign=\"top\">\n<td><b>previous</b> <br/><a href=\"/cwcki/Kacey_Call_23\" title=\"Kacey Call 23\">Kacey Call 23</a>\n</td>\n<td><b>next</b> <br/><a href=\"/cwcki/Father_Call\" title=\"Father Call\">Father Call</a>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n</center>\n<p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hello?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b> </font>Hey Chris, it's Kacey.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b> </font>Hi Kacey, how are you?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b> </font>I'm good, just a little tired.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I got to agree.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> So how are you?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I'm fair myself.

But, um... how did they know that she had food poisoning?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I mean, that my, that was <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Bob\" title=\"Bob\">my father</a> and mine's theory at first, but then you know, we took her to Martha Jefferson, then, and then the doctors classified... classified the ailment as colitis.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oh, well that's definitely not food poisoning.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, I mean well-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You guys shouldn't have gone back there to talk to them then, 'cause it's obviously not them...\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hm. Yeah, well, I mean, still. Uh, you know, my mom, after today... she was having gut pains, and... yeah, she was like, \"Yeah, take the uh, there's the uh, majority of the food I left behind, I had but I had not eaten, so you know, you just take it back to them, and uh, tell 'em what happened.\" She was like, you know, um, my father and I, we just like, you know, we couldn't do much to respond, you know....Mom was... all up, all up on top of the world here kind of, you know? Uh...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> How long ago did it happen? I mean, did either of you eat it and get sick from it too?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uh, no, my father and I did not eat it.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Besides, if she has colitis she shouldn't be eating food like that. You said it was Chinese, right? I mean, that food's loaded with MSG and salt and fat, that's like the worst thing she could be doing right now.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, well I mean, I mean, none of us knew about the colitis yet. So...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> But still, it's definitely not food poisoning, it's her body telling her what she's eating is wrong. Like did she get put on a diet?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, she can't eat much, uh, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Recycling\" title=\"Recycling\">salty</a> or sugary foods, or drinks, now.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> No, definitely not. Is she sticking to it?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, she's, yeah, she just got started on it.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> So then what type of things is she eating?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uh, you know, just basically, um... I'd say, mostly, um... fruits and vegetables...Um, I'm not sure what else at the time-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, fruits and vegetables are high in sugar.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hm. Well-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Maybe you should join her in her diet to support her, it could be good for you.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hm, alright well, I'm not sure, I'm not really sure of, uh, of her diet. But, uh, you know, I can, I can like, you know... um... I can have her tell me more about it. But right now-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You should, I mean it's good. You know cancer patients, their whole family shaves their heads, I mean you should totally do it, so that, number one, it'll help you get healthier; number two, it'll help your mom that you're there for her.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Wait wait wait wait wait... Cancer, families of cancer patients actually shave their heads?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Yeah, it's a show of soli-, you know, togetherness? When the cancer patient goes into chemo and loses their hair, a lot of family members will do that, you know, to show that they're all together in this.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Oh.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> It's pretty inspirational.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Huh.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I mean, and all you would have to do is diet.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. Yeah...alright. Yeah, well. Yeah, I'll talk to my mom about uh, this diet she's on and uh... I'll see if I can get on that as well. But anyway-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You totally should.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b> </font>Yeah. I, yeah. But right now she's, right now she's sleeping. But still you know, I'll talk to her next time she's awake. About that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Definitely, I think that would be good for you.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>sigh</i>]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> How is <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Chris%27s_room\" title=\"Chris's room\">your room</a> coming along?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. I'm still working on it, uh...I, uh...Kim and I agreed that, uh...yeah, Kim convinced me that, you know, I'm planning on uh, taking my city, my <a href=\"/cwcki/Lego\" title=\"Lego\">Lego</a> <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCville\" title=\"CWCville\">city</a> apart, piece by piece, and putting the pieces into, into buckets.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Oh, that's a good idea.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, so I'm gonna start on that, I'm gonna start on that soon enough. But, you know-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You should take some more pictures and send them to me along with progress, you should probably do it like every other day. I mean, 'cause you were supposed to have this done, I mean how much longer do you think it's gonna take?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>Pause</i>] Yeah, it'll take me a while longer, plus you know, recent, plus you know, last weekend I had to worry about my mom being in the, being in the hospital.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Right.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> So...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> But you should still push yourself to do it, it'll probably make your mom feel better too.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah well, yeah, I, yeah, I'm going to work on that this week. On that-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Awesome, don't forget to send me pictures, give me something to get my mind of everything too.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, OK. Alright. Hm... Yeah, I'm sorry to hear about you possibly losing your job and failing in class, what happened?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Um, well we have a new manager, and he's just a jerk, and he wants his own people in there, and class, well, I've just been having issues with it, and being able to get to the class, so it's something I can recover, you know, I've just had a lot going on. Especially with work and everything, 'cause sometimes I've had to pick up during the class, and it's just one big mess, but I'm working to fix it and I might have a new job soon.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> OK. well, I hope uh... I hope that, you know, at your next job, you'll be successful. Or like, you know, um... you know, that you'll have it. Hm. Yeah, 'cause I would hate to see you without a job at this point. [<i>Pause</i>] Oh, by the way I still have, by the way, apparently, uh... it's like, you know, I have, um... yeah, I have not heard back from <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Target\" title=\"Target\">Target</a>, and I called them like, you know, I think it was, yeah, the last... the weekend before this recent weekend. And, I have not heard back. So, it's like, I think it's pretty obvious at this point I did not get a job there, but I'm submitting applications for, uh, places like uh, Barnes &amp; Noble and Sears, even a new CVS that's being built in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Ruckersville\" title=\"Ruckersville\">Ruckersville</a>. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Hm. Have you heard back from anywhere?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> No, not yet. But I, but I, like you know, I'm planning on, I'm planning on checking in with them to see if they got my applications. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Definitely.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> 'Cause I had to go online to do the applications. For these places. As well. [Pause] Hm. Yeah. Yeah... but upon, yeah, let me go, let me go off topic here a bit, uh... Yeah, about uh, <a href=\"/cwcki/Regina\" title=\"Regina\">Regina</a>, the girl I was just telling you about, that uh...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Right.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> ...whose father I sold two guitars to on <a href=\"/cwcki/EBay\" title=\"EBay\">eBay</a>. Yeah, I mean like, we were, it was like you know, we were getting along...great, you know. I've been mostly telling her about the pos-, about my positive characteristics. Not one, not once mentioning the, uh, trolls or names like <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Gregg_Mays\" title=\"Gregg Mays\">Gregg Mays</a> and whatever. And then, uh... and then... you know like, we had the pick-up time scheduled, you know, uh... but, today at two o'clock at the, uh, <a href=\"/cwcki/McDonald%27s\" title=\"McDonald's\">McDonald's</a> on Barracks Road... but then she doesn't show up, but then I come home and I find the e-mail and it's like, \"Oh I get the, oh, I got the, oh, I was intercepted by Gregg Mays and he had two, and he had two guitars, with no paint, with all paint and stickers removed.\" And so, he charged her half price for it. And it was like you know, she thinks as if she still bought it from me, or she's giving off that impression, but... Uhh, but yeah, I'm thinking basically I got troll-, I got trolled again. And like you know-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well it sounds like she got trolled too.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, or like you, yeah or like you know, like she's one of the, she's one them, just like, uh...the past time at <a href=\"/cwcki/Charlottesville_Fashion_Square\" title=\"Charlottesville Fashion Square\">the mall</a>, I think her name was <a href=\"/cwcki/Emily\" title=\"Emily\">Emily</a>. And then we were, and then, uh, being intercepted by Harold, that <a href=\"/cwcki/Man_in_the_Pickle_Suit\" title=\"Man in the Pickle Suit\">guy in the pickle suit</a>. Uh... and I think, uh, I think, you know, <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Kim\" title=\"Kim\">Kim</a> could tell you more about that, you know, there are audio files, you know, that girl had a wire on her. And the, uh, audio-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> How do you know she had a wire on?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [annoyed sigh] Because, the, I found the audio file later, on the, uh... <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Miscreants\" title=\"Miscreants\">Miscreants</a> webpage that was originally created by <a href=\"/cwcki/Clyde_Cash\" title=\"Clyde Cash\">Clyde Cash</a>-slash-<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Gregg_Mays\" title=\"Gregg Mays\">Gregg Mays</a>.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Hmm.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. Uh, but anyway, then Kim, then I talked to Kim about it and she convinces me like, you know, Regina could be just, uh, an innocent victim and it's just a whole bunch of misunderstandings and whatnot. So...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> It probably is, Chris, I mean it's not like the whole world's against you. You really don't think that, do you?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hm. No...I don't think think <i>the whole world</i> is against me, just some, it's just some of the people, it's just the whole buncha people out of a whole, out of a big vast majority.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You really think there's a group devoted to trolling you?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah, Kim can tell you about that, there's forums and everything.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Why? I mean, why would a group of people devote themselves to you? I mean, have you ever done anything wrong?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [getting more stressed and whiny] I had originally done nothing wrong! As far as I, as far as I know, I-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> But then, why would they be devoted to trolling you?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I don't know why! I don't know why they started...[Sigh] I don't even know why that, why the <a href=\"/cwcki/Encyclopedia_Dramatica\" title=\"Encyclopedia Dramatica\">Encyclopedia Dramatica</a> page got started in the first place. I mean, I mean, other than the fact that they were doing it for the... L-U-L-Z]].\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> The what? \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> L-U-L-Z. You know, they call it \"LULZ\". Or like, you know-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> So... they're doing it for laughs? I doubt there is a group dedicated to trolling you just because it's fun.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>Sigh</i>]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I mean, are you telling the truth?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah I-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I mean are you sure you didn't do anything to any of them? I think we've talked about this before.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I am telling, I am telling you the truth. I am telling you the truth, Kacey. I swear to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/God\" title=\"God\">God</a>. And Kim can back you up on that, she can tell you about these forums. And whatnot. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> That weird though, that's really weird, I mean are you really that important?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [offended sigh] Hm. Well, I'm internet famous. Uh, for one thing, but, I don't think I would be THAT important, I mean, the way these trolls keep carrying on they make it like I'm as, I'm as important or more important than <a href=\"/cwcki/Britney_Spears\" title=\"Britney Spears\">Britney Spears</a>! [Pause] Jeez...[Sigh] What a mess that, what a mess the whole trolling thing is. [Sigh] But, I just take it one step at a time, you know, and I'm block-, and I'm continuing to uh, block any naysayers, that send me negative e-mails. On my, on my, on my AOL address. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Hm. That's good.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I mean, what do you consider a negative e-mail?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Well like you know, people... I- for one thing, here's a... I'm giving you, like, maybe one or two examples of the top of my head upon recollection... Um, one thing is like, you know, the inclination of people... mislabeling me as a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Homosexual\" title=\"Homosexual\">homosexual</a>, or... dudes asking me out on a homosexual date, or making me, or asking me to do anything homosexual when I'm not, and it's pretty hard for me to-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You should take that as a compliment! I mean, maybe you're giving off the wrong impression to them.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [stunned] What, come on, I mean-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I mean, you might be attracting these gay people.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [disgusted sigh] But anyway, I'm STRAIGHT. But, you know-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, maybe people don't think that, maybe you're not coming off as that. You ever think about that?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Ugh, come on you know me, I'm- You know I'm straight. And- [stammering incoherently]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> But THEY don't.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b> </font>[getting angrier] Ugh, I've been telling them, I've been telling them NUMEROUS TIMES now in the <a href=\"/cwcki/YouTube\" title=\"YouTube\">YouTube</a> videos that I'm straight! \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Maybe they think you're just being shy.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Ahh, THEY'RE STUPID! I, I mean, I even, I even reflected so much about my, uh, about my, uh, how I feel about the homosexuals, I just don't... care that much about them, I just don't wanna get too close to them...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, Chris, remember that usually when you protest too much, [Chris sighs] then it usually is true.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Oh, JESUS CHRIST!\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> They just think you're in the closet. I mean, you...\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I'M STRAIGHT!!! I'm straight!\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Chris, but you make so many videos about NOT being straight, I mean, it actually HURTS you. Like, if you just let it go...\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Wait, wait, time out, time out, wait. Making videos about me NOT being straight, what the HELL?\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> No, about BEING STRAIGHT, it hurts you because they're like, \"Oh, he's just covering it up.\"\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Oh, Jesus...[Sigh]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I mean you should just ignore it.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [Chris sighs and tries to change the subject] Ah, whatever, but anyway like I, like I said, I add the, I add those names, I add those people, those are... The subject of those people who send me such e-mails, I add to my block list. That's uh, one thing. Another thing is like you know... like you know, or like you know, they just tell me like you know, \"Fuck you,\" or \"You're a failure,\" or any negative comments like that, I add them to the block list as well. Or even more recently like you know, oh shh-, you know, yeah, \"We're continuing the talks about your <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Copyright\" title=\"Copyright\">copyright</a> being stolen,\" that's just a false rumor and it's not been stolen. I recovered that e-mail. So like you know, I add them to the block list as well. I don't even have to open the e-mail, it's ob-, it say-, they just say it in the subject line. [<i>Pause</i>] Yeah. Anyway, yeah those, those are some of the examples of uh, people, uh, who I add to the block list.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Chris, why does being called gay make you so angry anyway? I mean if it's not true it just shouldn't hurt you at all.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Because it's a mislabeling! I hate being mislabeled!\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> But you should just ignore it, or else they're gonna think that you're mad because you're hiding something.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Ugh, Jesus...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I mean Chris, this is just common sense.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah... You know, let me, let me tell you something else, you know, uh, \"common sense\"... I, you know, yeah, there is a, there is <a href=\"/cwcki/For_Julie%27s_Eyes_Only\" title=\"For Julie's Eyes Only\">a video of me</a>... uh... having sex with a blow-up woman, with a blow-up doll, that's like a wom-, a blow-up female doll, alright? I mean that, I mean, I, the blow-up doll is a woman, and if I was a homosexual, I'd be blowing up, I'd be blowing up a... dude doll.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I don't think it matters because dolls don't really have genders. That could be interpreted either way.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> But I-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I've heard people could be bisexual. It doesn't matter.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [stress noises] Yeah but I mean, it's obvious that the doll is, is a woman, the doll looks like a woman. With the boobs, and the long hair, and the-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> It's just a piece of plastic, Chris. It doesn't matter.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. I uh, I know it was a piece of plastic, and it wouldn't, and it wouldn't know, but still-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b> </font>So it doesn't make you straight, and it doesn't make you gay.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [double stress sigh] Well yeah, well...[stress breathing] Ahh, a buncha things. Yeah. Yeah, but anyway, still, like you know, I'm just going, I'm just going, I just been going overboard in this conversation... And, yeah, but most of the time I would, most of the time nowadays I do just ignore that. \n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well you should, but I mean it just seems like this really gets to you, because you don't get this mad at anything else, not even when they claim to have your copyrights or anything else, like you just always get so angry over the gay thing, it's just really weird. You know?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [<i>Sigh</i>] Oh, jeez...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I mean it wouldn't be bad. You could be bisexual and it wouldn't be bad, I mean-\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> No, no, I am not bisexual, I'm STRAIGHT. I have- I HATE looking at <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Pickles\" title=\"Pickles\">penises</a>! I love looking at <a href=\"/cwcki/China\" title=\"China\">vaginas</a>!\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, I mean that doesn't make you straight or gay, if you just LOOK...I mean, gay guys actually love to look at girls' chests, did you know that? \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [quiet, frustrated sigh]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I mean, they're fascinated by them, even if they don't find them sexy.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I find wom-, I find women a lot more sexier... than any dude, I don't even... I mean, I, yeah, we talked about this before, we... we talked about this before.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I just think it's amusing that you get so angry. I mean, I have gay friends, and they're always like, grabbing my boobs or something, and it's OK because they're gay and everything, but it's like, gay guys love boobs, it's hilarious.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [sighs disgustedly, waits a few seconds, then sighs again] Whatev-, whatever. I- Yeah, uh, whatever. Let's not, let's not talk about that anymore, um... Uh...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You should stop <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Stress_sigh\" title=\"Stress sigh\">sighing</a>, Chris, that doesn't sound like a normal adult, that's like... little upset toddler behavior.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [tries not to sigh]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I mean, don't say \"whatever\" to me either, it's kind of rude.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> [annoyed sigh]\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> You could be polite and be like, \"I disagree.\"\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b> </font>Yeah-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Or, \"Let's change the subject.\"\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. Alright, well yeah. Let's change the subject. Hmm...\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Alright, but you gotta promise me you're not gonna do the sighing and the \"whatever\"s anymore.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> OK yeah well I mean, I been working on the... reducing of the \"whatever\"s. I mean, 'cause... Kim, uh, corrected me on that as well. [waits for response] She's been correcting me on-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well it's not that hard, so...come on. Heh.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Uh, wait... I, uh sorry, what was that last statement? I did not not understand that last statement.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I said it's not that hard. I mean-\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Oh, yeah, not hard.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b> </font>It's all about a level of respect, I mean if you respected both of us you wouldn't do it.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Yeah. I mean, yeah, well I mean, I did try to... stop-, to not say whatev-, that word. But, I mean-\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> I mean, you didn't start saying \"whatever\" until recently, like you've always done the sighing, but you didn't start saying that until recently. \n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Right... Yeah. Hm. Well... I mean I've done it, I mean I've done it numerous times before, uh... around my fam-, around my family. And, and it's like, they corrected me on that before. I guess it has been a long time since I said that word, and then... and then I, it just started coming back, it just started coming out again. That's, that's one thing that I'm, that I think there, about that. [Silence, Chris realizes she isn't going to say anything] Hm. Alright well, anyway, um... Um, let's see... What else is, what else can I, what else is on my mind I can talk about? Um...I'm not sure, lemme think, sure... No. If you've got anything else on your mind, Kacey, uh, I'm open to talk about that.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Not unless you can tutor me in statistics.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Unless I can tutor you in statistics....Actually, I did take statistics, uh...at, uh, one or two of those classes...uh, when I started at <a href=\"/cwcki/Piedmont_Virginia_Community_College\" title=\"Piedmont Virginia Community College\">Piedmont</a>, as part of the, as part of when I was starting out, in the, uh, degree, I was, I, first, I started to work on...but then I, but then I switched over to <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Computer_Aided_Drafting_and_Design\" title=\"Computer Aided Drafting and Design\">Computer Aided Drafting and Design</a>. But yeah I did do, I did do statistics, so...like, so like, you know...if you...show me like an example of, uh, what you're learning in statistics, I could prob-, I could probably remember...what to do there.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK, maybe I'll scan it or something for you, okay?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Alright. Yeah, and I'll see what I can, I'll see what I can remember.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> OK.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Hm. Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, I have school in the morning so I should probably go, OK?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Alright. But anyway, it's nice to talk to you again. And it's nice to, and it's nice to, you know, if you can't call me, you know, to get an email from you, so I know what's going on. And, you know, it's nice, it's nice to know that, to have you confide in me, and me offering my feedback, but hey, you know, yeah. You know...just, you know, at least you're making your recovery and you will strike back victoriously.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> [<i>Laughs politely</i>] Yeah.\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> I'm rooting for ya, and I'm here for ya.\n</p><p><font color=\"#FF0066\"><b>Kacey:</b></font> Well, I appreciate that, and I'll try and talk to you tomorrow. OK?\n</p><p><font color=\"#0033FF\"><b>Chris:</b></font> Alright, if you can't talk to me, send me an email.
