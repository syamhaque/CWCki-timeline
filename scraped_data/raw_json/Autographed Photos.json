He apparently learned from the multiple failed listings of the <a href=\"/cwcki/Original_Sonichu_and_Rosechu_Drawing\" title=\"Original Sonichu and Rosechu Drawing\">Original Sonichu and Rosechu Drawing</a>, since he did not allow bidding on the listing. Instead, he set a comparably reasonable Buy It Now price of $20 for each photo, with immediate payment required, making it less susceptible to trolling. In the Q&amp;A for the listing, Chris indicated that he would wear the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Medallion_of_fail\" title=\"Medallion of fail\">Sonichu medallion</a> on request, but that his \"The Classic\" shirt had been lost in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Destruction_Of_Chris%27s_House\" title=\"Destruction Of Chris's House\">the fire</a>. By the time sales were temporarily suspended in <a href=\"/cwcki/November_2014\" title=\"November 2014\">November 2014</a>, 104 photos had been sold, several to <a href=\"/cwcki/CWCki_Forums\" title=\"CWCki Forums\">CWCki Forums</a> members.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup> In <a href=\"/cwcki/June_2015\" title=\"June 2015\">June 2015</a> he inaugurated a new eBay account with a listing of autographed photos, managing to sell four.\n</p><p>He resumed selling autographs in 2018, which proved to be a popular item that year.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#2014_sales\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">2014 sales</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#Description\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Description</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#Facebook_updates\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Facebook updates</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Questions_and_answers\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Questions and answers</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Gallery_of_Chris_Portrait_Selections\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Gallery of Chris Portrait Selections</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#Gallery_of_Received_Portraits\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Gallery of Received Portraits</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#2018_sales\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">2018 sales</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Gallery\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Gallery</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#Damaged_frames\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">2.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Damaged frames</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#See_also\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">See also</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#Sources\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Sources</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-12\"><a href=\"#External_Links\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">External Links</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"2014_sales\">2014 sales</span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Description\">Description</span></h3>\n<p>Original description:\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background:#E6F2FF; border:1px dotted #A3B1BF; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>\n<p>Straight from the creator and artist, Christian Weston Chandler (myself), you may now have a more current headshot photograph of the artist, complete with his personal autograph and optional message.
