The confrontation between Chris and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Lars\" title=\"Lars\">Lars</a> heats up, and Chris uploads a video to combat him. Chris mentions that he used to hate minorities, but has gotten over it. Jackie demands more content. She points out that Chris acts more like a Satanist or a shaman than a Christian. Chris writes a romantic poem for her.\n</p>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #B48246; padding:5px; background-color:#FCC\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>September 23, 2010 - 8:39pm\n<p>Hey Chris.\n</p><p>So it's all well and good that you agree with me about the addiction issue, but my point was that the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Money\" title=\"Money\">money</a> you spent is still hundreds of dollars that you could have spent on other things, like <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otakon\" title=\"wikipedia:Otakon\">Otakon</a>. My point was never that you found games on sale, it's that games are the only thing you want to spend money on in the first place. You mentioned <a href=\"/cwcki/Son-Chu\" title=\"Son-Chu\">your car</a> is having trouble, are you going to have the money to fix it?\n</p><p>Anyway, I had a really shitty day. More shit about <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Lars\" title=\"Lars\">Lars</a> as well as some housing problems I've just found out I have to deal with. I don't really feel like talking tonight. But thank you for writing so much for me tonight, you've given me a lot to read. We'll reschedule our next chat soon, sweetie.

Also, I am still undrawn on the pilot comic for the <a href=\"/cwcki/TrollBusters\" title=\"TrollBusters\">TrollBusters</a>. I'm still thinking of the story plot, and I am open for your input as well. So far, I have Cal and Dee^2 hanging out in their headquarters in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Cwcville\" title=\"Cwcville\">Cwcville</a>, talking about common Troll Icons and \"Anon\" Associations of theirs. Other discussion topics of advisement is open for suggestion. They get an e-mail from a victim; Dee^2 traces its origins, googles the victim's name, finds the various forums and such. She and Cal traces the origin points of the inputed text on the Forums and such through IP Addresses. Finds the point of the Head Troll of the group, hops into their Truck (depending on the Location of the Troll, in <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/US\" title=\"US\">US</a> or out, having to take the Private Plane or not; I'm still deciding on the starting location). After they reach the destination, from their truck, they scan all of the computers in the house of the troll wirelessly; they find the bookmarks leading to the same Forums, history of entered text onto said forums, and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/IRC\" title=\"IRC\">IRC</a> Chat history matching up. They save all of the evidence onto their HDD, then remotely shuts off the internet for this dude alone. Meanwhile, the perp is inside making another post, and gets interrupted of Loss of Connection, then Cal and Dee^2 force their way in with backup from <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Jerkops\" title=\"Jerkops\">the Police</a> and the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation\" title=\"wikipedia:Federal Bureau of Investigation\">F.B.I.</a> and catch the Troll Red-Handed and take him into custody.\n</p><p>I would appreciate your input on the pilot story; any ideas.\n</p><p>I'll TTYL.<br/>\nStay Safe and Sweet.<br/>\nLots of Love,<br/>\nXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXO &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3<br/>\nChristian.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"background: #CEF2CE; border:1px dotted #A3BFA3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px\">\n<caption align=\"top\" style=\"caption-side: top; text-align: left\"><b><span style=\"color:black\"></span></b><span style=\"color:black\"></span>\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>September 27, 2010 - 9:00pm\n<hr/>Original Message-----<br/>\n<p>From: Lars Mcnulty<br/>\nTo: chrischansonichu<br/>\nSent: Sat, Sep 27, 2010 8:27 pm<br/>\nSubject: I aint steppin\n</p><p>Shiiiiiit, dog!

And last night, I crashed early at 8:00 PM. My <a href=\"/cwcki/Biological_clock\" title=\"Biological clock\">internal clock</a> has been askew again lately mostly. Basically on Monday, I fell asleep at 8 AM after an all-nighter and awoke at about 5 PM. I made <a href=\"/cwcki/New_Address\" title=\"New Address\">the direct-to-Lars video</a> and uploaded it right before I read your e-mail letting me know that Lars WAS black and I replied to that. Then I logged off, and did all of the other things I did that night all the way up to 8:00 PM last night.\n</p><p>And obviously I didn't get your request for the <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL_Instant_Messenger\" title=\"wikipedia:AOL Instant Messenger\">AIM</a> for Monday Night until later. And yesterday I was busy going out and hanging with my parents and stuff. And having crashed early, I forgot to check my e-mail yesterday. I guess a point I'm trying to make is I would feel better and more ready to talk over AIM if I had at least a 12 or 24 hour notice beforehand, so I could plan on that. Because the e-mail you sent Monday night was an immediate impulse, and I had already checked my e-mail and logged out. Yeah, that got messed up. :(\n</p><p>If you are available Tonight, I'll log in at about 8:45 PM to see if you are logged-in, or read your reply e-mail at least. And, at least a 12 hour or greater notice for when you'll be available for AIM; let's keep that in mind for future reference. Again, I am soo sorry for missing the opportunity.\n</p><p>At this time, we'll see how long my internal clock will stay on a daytime schedule. From my point of view, it appears to me that when my internal clock has been staying on the daytime schedule, one all-nighter is all it takes for it to go askew all over again.\n</p><p>I will talk to you later, Sweetheart. Please keep your ideas and thoughts in mind for me. :)\n</p><p>Stay Safe and Sweet with Lots of Love,<br/>\nXOXOXOXOXOXO &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3<br/>\nChristian.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #B48246; padding:5px; background-color:#FCC\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>September 29, 2010 - 1:19pm\n<p>Hey Chris!\n</p><p>Why did you stay up til 8am? You shouldn't stay up to play video games like that all night, it's not good for your health. You really ought to make the choice to set a regular bedtime for yourself and stick to it. For example, I usually go to bed at midnight every night (or sometimes earlier), even if I'm not particularly tired, because I don't want to screw myself up for the next day. You can't just stay up for as long as possible until you \"crash\", that's what small children do. Your choices are why your sleep schedule is messed up, it's not because you can't control your own body. And plus, then your random sleeping habits inconvenience others, like myself. You need to make the choice to discipline yourself and stick to a regular schedule. It's what the rest of us have to do.\n</p><p>Anyway, I'll be on about 8:45pm tonight, so I look forward to <a href=\"/cwcki/Jackie_Chat_3\" title=\"Jackie Chat 3\">chatting with you then</a>. We can talk more about your trollbusters plot ideas and other stuff.

Did you stay up playing video games all night again? I told you, it's your responsibility to set a bed time for yourself. Remember, if you get the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Job\" title=\"Job\">job</a> at <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/McDonalds\" title=\"McDonalds\">McDonalds</a>, you're going to be working for hours every day, and you won't have a choice in the matter - not like now, where you just get tired because you choose not to go to bed at a reasonable time. And also remember Chris, the terms of our agreement were that you would make one video every day for the month of October. A video like this one is only a couple minutes long, and all you did was stand up and talk into the camera a bit and then upload it, so I don't get why you have to \"muster\" the strength to do it even though you're tired. It doesn't bode well for our contest if such a trivial effort is so difficult for you. I suggest you stop staying up to play games all night and choose to go to bed like adults do, because it's kind of annoying that you cause your own sleep problems and then seem to want special commendation for doing something that takes no effort in the first place. Remember, our contest is all or nothing. You have to do all the videos if you want me.\n</p><p>*SIGH*\n</p><p>Anyway, thanks for the video. You probably should have just said \"hey <a href=\"/cwcki/Michael_Snyder\" title=\"Michael Snyder\">Mike</a>, I realize the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Game_Place\" title=\"Game Place\">Game Place</a> is your business and you are in charge, and I don't have a right to disrespect you and do things you don't like no matter how much I disagree with you\". But instead you went on about how you should have the right to scream at children whenever you feel stressed, which probably won't endear you to Mike very well. But enough about that, let's talk about the next video!!\n</p><p>Here's what I'm thinking for tomorrow: Hamburglar video. I really liked in your resume where you detailed your life long relationship with McDonalds. I want you to do a tribute video to McDonalds. I want you to get some dollar menu burgers, <a href=\"/cwcki/100_2265\" title=\"100 2265\">dress up as the hamburglar</a> (maybe go shirtless with stripes across your chest and arms? You could paint, or just put duct tape across your chest… :) sexy!) and dance/recite poetry to your burgers. Then, I want you to sit down and eat them, after thanking McDonalds for your wonderful gift of food. But before you begin eating, can you turn to the camera and say \"Heyyyy folks!… FAT MAN HERE\" then wink because we both know you're not actually fat. It's satire! But I know what you're thinking, you don't actually want any trolls to get the idea that you applied at McDonalds. You don't want any going to harrass <i>[sic]</i> you there. So don't say anything about that - just talk about how you love McDonalds. Ooh! And write a poem about a burger and read it to the burger! You did soo well with the poem you wrote me, I think you could make something great about a burger.\n</p><p>Guys eating burgers turn me on. :D :D :D :D :D\n</p><p>Jackie\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #B48246; padding:5px; background-color:#FCC\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>October 2, 2010 - 9:33pm\n<p>Hey Sweetie!\n</p><p>I really enjoyed <a href=\"/cwcki/Jackie_Chat_5\" title=\"Jackie Chat 5\">our chat</a> tonight.

But I am happy we are opening up to each other, and I really do want our relationship to be strong too, Sweetheart. :)\n</p><p>I can answer your current questions now.\n</p><p>-At that time in her office, Sonichu and I were coming up with an immediate plan of counter-attack to the things she was saying; I do not remember what she said.<br/>\n-I do still sometimes talk with my electric-hedgehog pok'emon while I'm on my way to falling asleep and the tv is off; we talk about current things, like things I could do or say in meeting new people, or just things I'm feeling currently to get their response to, for examples.<br/>\n-I can't remember verbatim, but memorably, getting relationship advice from Sonichu And <a href=\"/cwcki/Rosechu\" title=\"Rosechu\">Rosechu</a> are most memorable.<br/>\n-Sonichu had a speech of his own to stop our mutual villain from attacking us with the things she was saying and her past actions against me and the early days of my <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Sweetheart_Search\" title=\"Sweetheart Search\">Sweetheart Search</a>.<br/>\n-The Curse-Ye-Ha-Me-Ha attack is essentially an invisible energy attack, launched similar to <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Son_Goku_(Dragon_Ball)\" title=\"wikipedia:Son Goku (Dragon Ball)\">Goku</a>'s attack; it is an attack that curses <a href=\"/cwcki/Excel_Saga\" title=\"Excel Saga\">Bad Luck and Extreme Misfortune</a> onto the individual the attack is aimed at. Among the misfortunes in mind for the attack, if the individual has a girlfriend of HIS own, she breaks up with him. This was fabricated in my lonely days then, where I was also jealous of \"All of the other <a href=\"/cwcki/JERKS\" title=\"JERKS\">Men Taking ALL of the Women</a>, Leaving me with None to choose from.\"\n</p><p>I will think about how best to make myself up as the <a href=\"/cwcki/100_2265\" title=\"100 2265\">Hamburglar</a> in a little while; I'll probably use a printed photo of a hamburger from McDonalds, and upon my recollection, he mostly said, \"Robble, Robble\", so I'll mostly say that in the dedication to the hamburger there.\n</p><p>Also, I'm afraid I have another disturbing development in the nude photograph department; I've just received a couple more e-mails from a couple of trolls, one of which pretended to be an ex-lesbian girlfriend of yours; she had a bunch of your nude photos attached to it. While I am going to ignore them both, I felt you should know about it. I'll be forwarding the two e-mails to you shortly for your reference.\n</p><p>Hey, don't fret too much over the matter; you and I, we have done what we could against that damn Lars for him leaking the photographs and confirming to him that he is through, and you have me; no bullshit. You know better now not to share such photos with anyone over the internet, even as a gag.\n</p><p>And regardless of anything said, portrayed or whatever, I will still Love You truly, Jacklyn. :-* :)\n</p><p>We'll see about Monday night when it comes around.\n</p><p>Stay Safe and Sweet with Lots of Love,<br/>\nXOXOXOXOXOXOXO &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3<br/>\nChristian.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #B48246; padding:5px; background-color:#FCC\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>October 3, 2010 - 2:03pm\n<p>Hey Chris!\n</p><p>Thanks for answering my questions. That clears up quite a bit. We can talk more about that stuff in our next chat, too. Thanks for explaining the curse ye ha me ha thing - I had no idea you were a Wiccan! Wow, this is a whole new side of you that I had no idea about. I've known Wiccans before at school and what not, but I never really knew them that well or talked to them about their beliefs. What sort of divinity do you follow, do you believe in a Godess or Earth-Mother figure? I know that's the primary deity in a lot of pagan faiths, isn't it? And what other sorts of magic or sorcery do you practice? The curse ye ha me ha sounds like a sort of black magic, akin to Satanism. I don't know much about Satanism either, but I know that the best definition is that Satanism is basically a religion that emphasizes hedonism, free will, priority towards earthly/carnal pleasures, and abandonment of restrictive rules in general. I never really thought about it before, but when I consider that you are very devoted to eating whatever you want, not working out, playing games all the time and generally not following any of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/God\" title=\"God\">God</a>'s rules, it actually makes sense that you are a Satanist. How come you didn't tell me? Were you worried I would take it badly? I don't, I think it's really cool that you're a Satanist! What other kinds of pagan magic do you practice? Is all of it black magic, or do you practice any white magic or naturalistic sorcery as well? This is really cool, Chris! It's a side of your beliefs I had no idea about!\n</p><p>On a darker note... Thank you for trying to console me about Lars and those damn nude photos. Thank you so much for being the bigger man and rising above, and not judging me for those photos being out there. But I still feel so bad about all this. I feel terrible that those photos are floating around out there, for anyone to see. And now you've got random trolls sending them to you and making shit up about me, as well. I hate Lars so much. I hate him with every fiber of my being for doing this to me. Your videos to him so far have been great but clearly Lars needs a heavier hand. We're going to have to think of a way to get him out of our hair once and for all. Are you with me sweetie? :)\n</p><p>Anyway, I am looking forward to the Hamburglar video! Also, I had another idea for one of your next videos. Do you know <a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles\" title=\"wikipedia:The Beatles\">the Beatles</a>? It'd be really fun to see you sing to one of their songs, like <a href=\"/cwcki/100_2269\" title=\"100 2269\">a Day in the Life</a> - that's my favorite Beatles song. Or maybe \"<a class=\"extiw\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/With_a_Little_Help_from_My_Friends\" title=\"wikipedia:With a Little Help from My Friends\">With a Little Help from my Friends</a>\", that's my second-favorite Beatles song. That'd be awesome! Maybe you could even write some lyrics of your own and sing them to the song! What do you think about the Beatles? Do you like them?\n</p><p>&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3\n</p><p>Jackie\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p><br/>\n</p>\n<table style=\"width: 90%; max-width: 600px; height: 70px; margin: 1em auto 1em auto; border: 0.15em outset #ff00ff; background: #ffdddd; vertical-align: centered; color:#000000;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"width: 33%; max-width: 200px; text-align: center; color:#000000;\">⇐ <a href=\"/cwcki/Jackie_E-mails_15\" title=\"Jackie E-mails 15\">Jackie E-mails 15</a><span style=\"color: #000000\"></span>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33%; max-width: 200px; text-align: center; color:#000000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000\"><strong><a href=\"/cwcki/Jackie_E-mails\" title=\"Jackie E-mails\">Jackie E-mails</a></strong></span>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33%; max-width: 200px; text-align: center; color:#000000;\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Jackie_E-mails_17\" title=\"Jackie E-mails 17\">Jackie E-mails 17</a><span style=\"color: #000000\"></span> ⇒\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p><br/>\n</p>\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"navbox\" style=\";\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"padding:2px;\">\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"nowraplinks collapsible mw-collapsed mw-collapsible\" style=\"width:100%;background:transparent;color:inherit;;\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<th class=\"navbox-title\" colspan=\"2\" style=\";\"><div style=\"float:left; width:6em;text-align:left;\"> <span class=\"noprint plainlinksneverexpand\" style=\"white-space:nowrap; font-weight:normal; font-size:xx-small; ;;border:none;;\"><a href=\"/cwcki/Template:Emails\" title=\"Template:Emails\"><span style=\";;border:none;;\" title=\"View this template\">v</span></a> <span style=\"font-size:80%;\">•</span> <a href=\"/cwcki/Template_talk:Emails\" title=\"Template talk:Emails\"><span style=\"color:#002bb8;;;border:none;;\" title=\"Discussion about this template\">d</span></a> <span style=\"font-size:80%;\">•</span> <a class=\"external text\" href=\"//sonichu.com/w/index.php?title=Template:Emails&amp;action=edit\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color:#002bb8;;;border:none;;\" title=\"You can edit this template.
