Due to the closure of the CWCipedia from 8 to 14 February, the response to these emails was delayed even more than usual. Questions like Evan's statement about going to court were outdated as Chris had already killed off Simonla on 13 February.\n</p><p>Thankfully, Chris retired the \"neutral response\" seen in <a href=\"/cwcki/Mailbag_52\" title=\"Mailbag 52\">Mailbag 52</a>. He seemed especially meek in this batch of responses, giving small, inoffensive answers to enraged fans pointing out his incredible penchant for <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Lies\" title=\"Lies\">lies</a> and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Hypocrisy\" title=\"Hypocrisy\">hypocrisy</a>. Highlights from this mailbag included the first public indicator that Chris <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Direct2sex\" title=\"Direct2sex\">values sex over love</a>, and Chris saying he's an optimist, as though that somehow overrides mathematical proof.\n</p>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"mw-toc-heading\" class=\"toc\" id=\"toc\" role=\"navigation\"><input class=\"toctogglecheckbox\" id=\"toctogglecheckbox\" role=\"button\" style=\"display:none\" type=\"checkbox\"/><div class=\"toctitle\" dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><h2 id=\"mw-toc-heading\">Contents</h2><span class=\"toctogglespan\"><label class=\"toctogglelabel\" for=\"toctogglecheckbox\"></label></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-1 tocsection-1\"><a href=\"#Answered\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Answered</span></a>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-2\"><a href=\"#So_much_for_true_love\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.1</span> <span class=\"toctext\">So much for true love</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-3\"><a href=\"#The_sorrow_of_Chris's_loss\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.2</span> <span class=\"toctext\">The sorrow of Chris's loss</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-4\"><a href=\"#Black_brothers\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.3</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Black brothers</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-5\"><a href=\"#Chris,_your_comics_are_bad\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.4</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris, your comics are bad</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-6\"><a href=\"#On_sexual_abuse\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.5</span> <span class=\"toctext\">On sexual abuse</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-7\"><a href=\"#Well,_that_makes_everything_better!\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.6</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Well, that makes everything better!</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-8\"><a href=\"#Chris_admits_to_being_a_no-good-thief\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.7</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Chris admits to being a no-good-thief</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-9\"><a href=\"#We_will_never_excuse_you,_Chris\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.8</span> <span class=\"toctext\">We will never excuse you, Chris</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-10\"><a href=\"#Optimism_vs_mathematics\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.9</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Optimism vs mathematics</span></a></li>\n<li class=\"toclevel-2 tocsection-11\"><a href=\"#Old_message_is_old\"><span class=\"tocnumber\">1.10</span> <span class=\"toctext\">Old message is old</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Answered\">Answered</span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"So_much_for_true_love\">So much for true love</span></h3>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #B48246; padding:5px; background-color:#FCC\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>From: Andreas Veinbergs &lt;ziaxool_89@hotmail.com&gt;\n<p>Hi Chris!\n</p><p>If you had to choose between:\n<br/>a) Have sex with a girl and never meet her again\n<br/>or\n<br/>b) Meet a sweetheart but never have sex\nwhich would you pick?\n</p><p>Thanks!\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_sex\" title=\"Chris and sex\">All thing considered, and if She was Clean, I would go with \"A\"</a>.\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3><span id=\"The_sorrow_of_Chris.27s_loss\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_sorrow_of_Chris's_loss\">The sorrow of Chris's loss</span></h3>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #B48246; padding:5px; background-color:#FCC\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>From: Chris Doyle &lt;c32characters@yahoo.co.uk&gt;\n<p>Dear sir,\n</p><p>I have to say you've disappointed me greatly.

But recently...\n</p><p>See, we had a big club down here in Florida, we had at least twenty members. We all loved Sonichu and talked about it, one of our members would bring his laptop and give us the update. But recently... we've been questioning your series. I mean, the art is just getting to be an eyesore to look at because sometimes we can't tell what's going on. The walls of text and the generic coloring is bad too.\n</p><p>And now we don't get the story, what's happened to all the other characters you've created? Also recently we discovered you took <a href=\"/cwcki/Simonla_Rosechu\" title=\"Simonla Rosechu\">a character</a> from someone named <a href=\"/cwcki/Evan\" title=\"Evan\">Evan</a> and changed him into a girl and called it yours. Did he give you permission to use his character and give it a sex change? Reading the fan mail you say he's overreacting, I think he has a right to, seeing how you stole something.\n</p><p>But anyways, we've just been so disgusting with how the comics and you yourself have been doing. A <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/cwcki/Electric_hedgehog_pokemon\" title=\"Electric hedgehog pokemon\">electric hedgehog pokemon</a> has gotten boring and tiring, it's just not original anymore now that we look at it. So, I, being the president of the fan club decided to take down the club. Everyone agreed and it's not more. We're trying to find a different comic to read, perhaps <a href=\"/cwcki/Moon-Pals\" title=\"Moon-Pals\">Moon-Pals</a>. <a href=\"/cwcki/Asperchu\" title=\"Asperchu\">Asperchu</a> has plenty of fans of ready I heard, I think the website has over 60,000 views. I looked at Moon-Pals and loved that they have a regular used set of characters.\n</p><p>Maybe, just maybe, if you restart this 'Sonichu' into something more original and fun, and safe for kids (we had elementary students in the club) then we'll consider bringing the club back together.\n</p>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table class=\"{{{2}}}\" style=\"border:1px dotted #4682B4; padding:5px; background-color:#F0F8FF\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><a href=\"/cwcki/Chris_and_writing\" title=\"Chris and writing\">Improvements to the series will be made, I can assure you</a>.
