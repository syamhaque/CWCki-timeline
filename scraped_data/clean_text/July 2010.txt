================================================================================

On 2 July 2010, for the umpteenth time, Chris uploads his Flipnotes.
On 9 July 2010, Chris is spotted at Fridays After Five (again).
On 26 July 2010, JenkinsJinkies applies to join the Trollin Train.
On 31 July 2010, Chris tells Jackie he's been advertising himself as a male prostitute.
July was the seventh month of 2010. Overall, it was pretty quiet; most of the life signs from Chris came in the form of observations from field trolls, as Chris would spend most of his time online by messing around in his new time sink, ModNation Racers.
The month began with Chris in the middle of a skirmish of sorts with the moderators of Flipnote Hatena. Chris was angry over the fact that no one was praising him, so he deleted the comments on all his flipnotes and disabled commenting. He then uploaded a Flipnote entitled My apologies, in which he spent more time blaming the trolls than actually apologizing. Eventually, the moderators grew wary of his sub-par animations and his refusal to adhere to their codes of conduct, and decided to ban Chris from uploading. This became quite arguably the quickest he's managed to get banned on the Internet.
On 17 July, after some further Love Quest misadventures in public, Chris returned to Twitter in order to beg people for free ModNation Racers mods. He also said that he's still working on Sonichu pages, but if we take into consideration what he was doing at the time, that was very unlikely.

Chris uploads My apologies to Flipnote Hatena. It's deleted by mods moments later, as they are apparently now watching Chris like a hawk.

Chris replies to Jackie that the flipnote was simply a "gesture of goodwill."
Chris, proving his intelligence once again, reuploads Don'tGetTrolled!, the Tagged Flipnote, part two of his random humor series and, of course, RomanticLabyrinth, only to have them all taken down again. He later re-enabled comments. He was also banned for life from posting anything from his DSi, comments included, for his rule-breaking Flipnotes.
