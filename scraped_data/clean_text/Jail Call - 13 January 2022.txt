Okay...
Hello everybody on the in- innernet, this is Jesus Christ Chan Sonichu, your lord and savior and messiah and god and everything I have spoken in truth to you before recently.
At present my body is still within the jail, but during this time I am looking to further etspand my genuine, decent, connections, so at this point I'm looking for active... genuine, kind, followers from within the state of Virginia, preferably- bly- preferably, from within the Charlottesville and/or Ruckersville area, or as close to the Sonichu Temple's location as possible.
During this present time you can reach out to me by sending a letter via US postal mail to the Central Virginia Regional Jail, and also if you want to send any donations I highly would give th- them to Barbara via check, valid cashier's check to Barbara at the Temple, the address is obvious and known, but you can also send, preferably and this is the quickest method without using the website, you can go to your local post office, and have them send a postal money order to this address at Central Virginia Regional Jail, and make sure the money order is made out to me by the name of Christine Weston Chandler.
Again, I am just very, very blessed and thankful for each and every one of you genuine and kind people amongst my foll-, amongst my followers. Keep faith because we are getting the collective shift done, and we're gettin' the majority of good and neutrals to C-197 Earth, and we're leaving behind the toxics. We are all in this together, we're gonna survive and everything, and I'm gettin' my body out of this jail very shortly from now.
But on that, I'm also asking for active... protestors to just essentially let the local authorities and whatnot here know they want me out of jail and back home safely. I am very much innocent on all charges.
Anyway I do thank you all again kindly and humbly for your kindness and appreciation of me and everything, and also please show kindness to Barbara as well. Thank you all and have a great, safe, blessed day. Go forth with peace and clarity.
A'ight.
