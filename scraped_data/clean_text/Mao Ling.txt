Troll disclosure: This persona was created, appropriated, or otherwise used by trolls to manipulate Chris. He was played by the same troll as Clyde Cash and Vivian Gee.Though this identity is contrived, the CWCki may treat it as if it were a real identity because it was to Chris. (It's also funnier that way.)

Asperchu
Mao 'Bamboo' Ling (also known as DariaCamacho) is a good friend of Alec Benson Leary, and the webmaster of the Asperpedia, a knock-off of Chris's CWCipedia.
Mao bought the CWCipedia ad space from Jack Thaddeus for $2000, who previously used it to advertise gay porn on the site. Mao started off by using the ad space to advertise the Asperpedia, and later ads mocking Chris.
The last straw came when Mao, following in the footsteps of Jack, starting placing gay porn on the CWCipedia. Chris, after seeing this, made a video cursing Mao, and saying that if he didn't remove the ads that he would prematurely rot. After a phone call with Alec, Chris gave Mao an insincere forgiveness blessing, along with many other insincere apologies.
Chris's anger towards Mao would surface once more in Sonichu 10, where him and the other members of the Asperpedia Four are on trial for the murder of Simonla. After they are convicted guilty and sentenced to death, Chris uses his psychic powers to break Mao dead, cracking his bones until his heart explodes.
On 17 March 2010, Chris said the n word on video. Jack Thaddeus, angered by the video, dropped all funding for the CWCipedia, and Mao became an admin. Naturally, he and the Asperpedia Four started vandalizing the site, before eventually he made it so everybody could edit the CWCipedia. On the 22th, the other admins reverted the site back to a pre-Mao state.
During May 2010, a user named 'DariaCamacho' was given access to the CWCipedia and starting making actually good edits to it, but Chris got angry at her regardless. She was later revealed to be Mao in disguise.
A few weeks later, Mao hacked the site again, and released editing perms to the public, who would cause havoc once again. After a while, he gave ownership of the site to Alec Benson Leary and Vivian Gee, who used it to upload 'Sonichu Season 2' a fancomic. Shortly after, the site died.
Mao was the one to leak all of the Alec Benson Leary calls.
