================================================================================

"11052009 Kacey, I Love You, and I Need You" is a 6 November 2009 video in which Solid Chris apologizes for behavior towards his sweetheart Kacey's father with an emotional speech. It seems that the discussion they had together previously over the phone didn't go very well. Solid also proclaims an undying, eternal love for Kacey, even though she's apparently only been his girlfriend for a little over a week.
Solid uses REO Speedwagon's 1984 power ballad "Can't Fight This Feeling" as background music. The music drowns out his declarations of love for large portions of the video. Also, his medallion is missing, thus, his feelings are not TRUE and HONEST. Despite his whining, there are no actual tears, as Kacey later observes.
He occasionally refers to himself in the plural "us", or "we". One would think he might be talking about himself and Kacey, but the points he mentions are really only applicable to himself. This is possibly a renewed manifestation of his split personalities.

[Dramatic glasses removal, background music starts playing]
Kacey, I'm sorry about the way I acted... on your father last night. Yeah, could of—yeah, I realize that I could have been more respectful, and said [salutes], "Yes, sir"... and just stick with that. And I realize now that, some of the things he talked to me about, told—talked down to me about, were like, yeah, definitely things I should be working on. And I promise, I will get an office job. And I will make efforts to move out of my house, even though I'll probably end up with this house, inheriting it.
But, anyway, [closes eyes] Kacey, I—I love you so much I care about you. You just ma-ma-make me feel so sad—make me feel so that... Phone call where... [Sighs, then squints, as though starting to tear up.] you—you went and said some of the things your father said. Those shocks to the heart... made me cry. [voice breaks] I'm not afraid to cry in front of you. If I have tears I w—I... we—we have... shed them, and we shed them in front of you. It's... it's very hard.... You just made me feel so sad that I cried. Made that phone call there.
Kacey I need you. I need you. I love you. You're the best thing in my—you're the best thing in my life. The best person that's ever come into my life. You know that more than I do. You cared about our health and well-being. And I cared about you that much, as well, but, you put more in—you gave me advice that I... heed—that I have thought—that I have heeded. And I am... taking the steps to wake up and get myself more stronger and healthier for you. But it's like, you know, if you—but then it's like, if you end up going back to the other Chris and—[sigh] I don't know, it just feels like I would have done all that work for nothing. I need you Kacey. I care about you so much. I just can't fight the feeling. [Sudden volume increase, sounds almost angry] I love you! I love you! I need you.
Please don't leave me. Please don't be mad at me. I made mistakes. But I'm... but a man admits when he is wrong. And I was wrong in the way I acted last night. I'm sorry I hurt—I was very very sorry I hurt your feelings.
I'd be very—I would feel terribly sad if you went back to—back to the other Chris. Please, don't leave me. [Raises voice] I love you! I love you! Kacey, I love you! Please don't—please come back. Don't leave me.
And you need—and you need me—and you need me, as well, because, I am an honest and very loyal person. And, unlike that—unlike that other Chris, I don't go all that crazy. I stay sane most of the time, and, even when I try to act crazy [Something resembling either a chuckle or a sob]... that lame—those are pretty much lame attempts.
Anyway... anyway I, uh—you know me; I am very—I am strong, and I am strong-willed. I would do whatever I could, in my power, for you. Everything. It's my—my—everything I can, within my power. And I... and I will hold onto my promises, just all the other things came up, and—but—but I don't need excuses. It's not about excuses. I'm gonna uphold my promises, Kacey. And I don't want you to leave me, please. I love you. And I need you. I'll talk to you later, probably. I pray. [Video abruptly ends]
