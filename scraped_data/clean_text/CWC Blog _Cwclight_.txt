On here, I will personally add more of the facts and details about the events and myself. Certain other websites and forums do not have the direct source and knowledge as I do. I will also feature answers to various frequently asked questions, past, present and future. Even Wikipedia will hardly have anything in comparison.

Starting in September 2024, Chris would write and publish CWC Blog posts to his website Cwclight.
