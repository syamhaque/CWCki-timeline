================================================================================

"You Think You're a Man" is the seventh track from SPARKLE like you mean it: ROBEE'S BALLAD by Robee Sonee and the Tomgirls. It is a cover of "You Think You're a Man" by Divine.
If this song dates back to the Jackie saga, it could be a taunt aimed at Lars.

Lyrics
Pink Flamanyoin, Divine in da house!
Man [unintelligible]
Turn around,
Take one final look at what you left behind,
Then walk away
From the greatest lover you have ever known,
Just walk away,
You're telling me that you can make it on your own,
For yourself, all alone, without my help,
Mister, you have made a big mist-mistake,
You think you're a man, but you're only a boy,
You think you're a man, but you're only a toy,
You think you're a man, but you just couldn't see
You aren't a man enough to satisfy her.
Shut the door,
Take a look around, tell me whatcha find.
Shut the door,
Take a giant step for you and all mankind,
Then don't come back;
I always gave you so much more than you deserved.
Then don't come back,
'Cause no one makes a fool of me
You've got nerve to walk away, forgot the words I'm gonna say
Mister, you've just made a big mistake.
You think you're a man, but you're only a boy,
You think you're a man, you are only a toy,
You think you're a man, but you just couldn't see,
You weren' man enough to satisfy her.
Youthink you're a man, but you're only a boy,
You think you're a man, you are only a toy,
You think you're a man, but you just couldn't see,
You weren't man-nanough to satisfy her.
Think you're a man, but you're only a boy,
You think you're a man, you are only a toy,
You think you're a man, just-you just couldn't see
You weren't man enough to satisfy her.
Think you're a man, but you are onlya boy,
You think you're a man, but you are only a toy,
You think you're a man, but you just couldn't see,
You weren't man-nanough to satisfy her.
