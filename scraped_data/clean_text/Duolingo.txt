Duolingo is a website and phone application for learning languages. It also offers courses on music, math, and chess. Chris joined the platform in October 2023.
Surprisingly, Chris remained a dedicated user of Duolingo for months on end. On 4 December 2023, Chris posted on Twitter that he had acquired the rank of Galactic Legend.[1] On 29 January 2024, he hit a 100-day learning streak.[2] Chris broke his streak on around 18 April 2024 after days of inactivity, bringing his record streak to over 150. He became inactive in July 2024 until mid October, when he resumed practicing Finnish daily again, exceeding his streak record of 175 days in April 2025. On 7 May 2025, he hit a 200-day learning streak.
Even more surprisingly, Chris has used the platform primarily to study Finnish, which is regarded as a very difficult language for native English speakers to learn and which is spoken by fewer than 6 million people. Chris has avoided making public comments on his interest in the language, however he was spotted in Finland throughout 2024 and 2025 and on one occasion was observed attempting to speak it. One popular theory is that his mysterious gal pal Flutter, who was first seen in public with Chris around the time he joined Duolingo, and accompanied him to Finland, is Finnish or speaks the language.
