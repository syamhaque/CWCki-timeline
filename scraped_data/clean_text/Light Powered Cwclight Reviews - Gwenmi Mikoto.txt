There is no room left for you on this
very timeline Gwen
meakoto you get out so that our timeline
may be restored to the prime as it was
before
P
Every last one of you toxic worst
darkest sitting
individuals
out Hey everybody what's up jesus Christ
science prime here once again and today
we are going to be reviewing the next
figure the legacy of Diver Burge
9 Decepticon
Glebbeotto and here we are and well here
she is and first and foremost as always
we're going to take a look at the
packaging so right up here we have
Makoto in her truck mode a lovely a fine
little pickup Truck looks so dirty and
grimy and covered in filth Anyway yeah
Anyway she is a deluxe class Classic
delet classic class The little hole All
right Decepticon webbby threads for buzz
On this side of the box you got some uh
some artwork of uh Miss Makoto right
here And she just looks like she's out
for something Out for revenge Look at
that face and even her name and
cybertronian
writing On the other side of the box you
got the top half of the lovely poster
artwork And I feel like as when you
could when you look at the previous
figure video and yeah I feel like they
definitely got a new piece of art here
for this And this you put these two
halves here They look great This is very
nice I like this Anyway uh there's the
top of the box Lacy night birds There's
the B bird stage barcodes And on the
back of the box you got your obligatory
product She does this that and the other
And uh little ly bio if you want to read
that if in your own time or if you want
to just take your time This will be
posted on that lovely little page on the
quick light blog So there you go And
that's basically it for the packaging
And moving right along here we have uh
Miss Makoto in her truck mode And I'll
give you all the uh brief story in case
you have not heard So during the events
of Idea Guy and Johnson Wilds in between
late 2017 and early 2018 where we
heavily diverted away from the prime
timeline at which we haven't always been
We were the prime we at least I and a
whole lot of y'all watching this were of
that prime timeline as well
And these people came in they shifted us
fastly away from that timeline And we
have been slowly and steadily with as
many of the obvious signs that have been
appearing over the years the recent
years since then that have confirmed
that we have been shifting and
everything is coming back to place
correcting itself and so forth It should
be very obvious to you It shall be very
clear and obvious to anybody that is
highly intuitive and psychic
powered essentially saying ask an
authentic
psychic All right So anyway so here she
is at her truck mode It's just uh little
brown pickup truck Just looks dirty We
got some mud on top So let's get a
closeup here Look at the uh details
There's a Decepticon symbol right there
on top a trans color windshield with uh
details on the inside and uh just even
more details on the inside if you uh
take a look in
there and so
on Anyway yeah So then you got uh the
yellow headlights and pinks and little
bit of silver some whites and uh goes
along the side of the truck Uh just a
lot of muddy brown more grays It just
looks so dank and grim grungy And
there's your tail lights that red and
yellow And yep So there is the
top There is the bottom She does roll as
only thing Hooray for rolling rolling
around dirty brother trucking
things And now for
comparison So here she is with the CC82
in her tank mode
complete with their little Titan master
manina
tank And yeah just to uh get the other
obvious comparison as place So here she
is with uh Christian Prime right there
As if that uh punch through time did not
damage Makoto
enough
Anyway and we'll throw this in as well
So here she is with Sonu right there
with
Prime And of course now we get on to the
uh the show so far with her actual
teammate So here she is
with Megatron right
there Uh
with
crasher
with put a slab of the first Hey Parsley
what are you doing here i'm just getting
in my review video now You lousy hunk of
scrap I'm going to burn your ass so bad
when we get back into the office I'm so
scared
with SIV the
first
with Septic Clone
Tractor And now for the uh kind of an
obvious mold mate comparison Here she is
with Time's Return
Cup So there you
go And moving right along let's run to
her accessories So she comes with a few
of course Uh we'll start off with her
Titan Master So here she is And just uh
Yep there you go Little tiny GBY Makoto
that just uh drives her pickup truck
self because she was a human that
identified a robot but then she did
upgrade it and as she became a
cyberronian unwittingly unwillingly And
we can look at the uh details So here we
have a lovely little molded face right
there the body and arms and
just Oh we'll just leave that in But at
least we got a good shot of the face
this time And uh obviously uh to go
around the back and there we have the uh
upside down face right there Low and
articulation What we got so we got the
ball on the joint You got got your
wiggly waggly Uh look up a little bit Uh
look down a little bit It can do a full
360 And arms can uh move up about that
far And of course they go down They can
go out side to side And uh legs as usual
can move forward that far and back that
far And then you got the back and forth
knee joint right there
And uh for comparison here she is with
uh Christian Cham Prime
Headmaster And here she is with a G1
headbuster And she does get some she
does have some weapery So yep So she
first comes with this little silver
rifle gun right here And that little
detail on it Lots of silver paint some
reason why white they used white plastic
on this Yep She gets this little gun And
she does come with her own little blade
right here which also looks like it
might double as a rifle if you think
about it But yeah there you go Uh it's a
sword She can wield it That'll work And
she also comes with her own bashing pink
shield right there And yeah she can uh
like you know defend herself and just
big big bash has like a one air jump
weapon she has and it comes with this
little uh has this little handle on here
which uh she can you can rotate that up
and then it could double as in battle if
you want to You're totally dependent on
which
so it's uh so we can incorporate the
tide master into the vehicle mode as uh
usually it's just a simple it's in the
driver's seat So we open this up There's
the uh little groove in there for the
back of the feet to go into So yeah just
uh there like that And best you can you
might want to undo the uh connections at
the point the transmission connection
just to get in there But it can be done
It can be
done And this is not working right now
This is not connecting Why is that
because the camera's on because the
camera is
on Um Oh you know what i think we got it
That'll do There you go She's driving
her pickup truck itself All right So we
got five mil ports here on the either
side and ports up here So weapon storage
Easy enough Uh could pop one right there
and uh pop this You could put it up here
or you can just uh put on the side to be
like that Little creaky but at least you
know it's not going to fall out And uh
maybe not the best delicate for the
shield but at least you can store it up
there Make it look like uh she's
carrying this bit of luggage in her
truck
pocket Is she not a tank all right Well
anyway so without further ado let's get
uh down the transformation shall we
let's Let's I'm going to make her feel
dizzy Dizzy I got to spin and spin and
I'm gonna make her
go there Yes Okay Anyway let's get down
to transformation So we'll move the uh
weaponry and uh take a little headmaster
out Yes there's emotional baggage But
anyway so first step is uh we take the
back of the uh truck here We pull that
out That's going to split apart right
there a little while And uh on either
side you get pull the legs out There's
uh slots right there These tabs are
going to glue into Just pull that down
That'll go right there And then yep same
thing on the other side We can go ahead
and uh flip the feed out right there
They're on either
side Takes might take a little
fingernail to do that with And uh we can
go ahead and angle this So we're going
to take this and uh rotate this up This
is the uh top of the uh body This goes
right down there We can go ahead take
care of this as well So that stays there
And you just want to rotate that up And
then we close the uh windshield over all
that We can lower these a little bit And
uh and we got to rotate at the waist as
well So we just fold these These are a
couple of hinges You got a slot right
there that this tab is going to go
into And then you take these There's a
slot right there tap right there And uh
you just uh put that down here And then
you pull this down You got the little
groove right there Can you see that
little groove right behind the wheel
that this little tab is going to slip
right into so you just pop that in there
And there you go Satisfying click And
second verse Just like the first Put the
leg together like that And put the put
the thigh down the shining guard and
this in there And now we'll uh work on
the upper body a little bit Just uh take
the arms There's a slot tab connection
right there that keeps them in place
Just put it right there Now uh it's like
a gay looking What the is going on
there cuz her hands are up like that And
uh you just take hold of them off right
there There's like a little post right
there that goes the slot to keep that in
place And you then you just fold the
hand
down The same thing on the other side
This is a bit tight on my copy And then
that that and yep And of course uh she's
missing her head and which that's going
to be
remedied You know just a simple
headmaster
transformation right there And you plug
that
in And there you go So there you have
Gwen
Makoto in her robot
mode And well that's it This is her This
is freaking We Makoto as she is you
know Yeah But let's get in closer Look
at the details I'm going to rotate the
camera up a little bit because that's
Look at there Look in the eyes So anyway
so there's her mug and she's got that
bug that just is no good right there She
looks so angry all the time And yep
Decepticon symbol right there on the
chest and the details we see on the
truck mode and
other did some details going on there
those
carvings And then just going down the
legs she got some pink stripes on her on
her thighs right there I mean yeah Wait
our shins I mean our shin guards and
that was her choice There's taillights
and uh going up the uh back Yeah there's
some there's some loose joints in this
figure Anyway so uh articulation wise
what we got i'm going to tell you So the
head is on a ball joint So you got your
wiggly waggly wiggly leg She can look up
only a slight bit She can look down that
little bit Uh it can rotate a full 360
Arms can rotate a full 360 They can move
in and out A little bit of rotation
there Oh bicep rotation Here you go And
you have a double joint You have a
double jointed elbow for full range of
movement Uh no rotation at the wrist but
uh that hand can move outward like that
if you need it to Waist
rotation And legs can move forward that
far and
back that far Yep and uh
outward that far She cannot even do a
full split And you got the thigh
rotation up
there 90 degrees of bend at the foot And
uh the toe chain can move down if you
need to And that's pretty much it for uh
for her for
articulation So now let's uh run through
her uh weaponry and assortments So of
course she can wield her weapons She can
uh hold her hold her sword like that and
she can hold her gun in the other
hand It's a tight fit but yeah there you
go She can pew pew slash pew pew slash
and all that good stuff right there And
um yep there Take that out And yes you
can even put the shield in her hand like
so So they go shield shield Bad bash or
Yep Um there you go Hack hack
hex
Yeah Or yet cuz she got this little
poster right here Let's see what that
looks like You can even have holding her
blade like as if it was a gun It looks
like a gun I mean this is not bush
compatible but I just would mainly just
count this as a sword So yeah So you got
that going on All right So you got some
you have some weapon storage You just uh
main you mainly just have the uh these
two these two five mil ports on her back
You can uh take her sword and put that
back here You can take her gun and try
kind of put it back there kind of but
just they goofed up on that It's not
exactly the most elegant thing Oh you
know what may as well I may as well do
this
give her a mock
Megatron type of look since she's
leading her this leading her share of
Decepticons on Earth at this point
Mostly Decepticones but yeah you can
store these weapons on her back And uh
yeah you can even store the shield back
here Again not the most uh elegant way
to store it but there you go Storage if
you want it H Anyway so at least this
one gun she's holding that is blouch
compatible So yes it is We can take a
blouch and just uh pop it right on in
there And we can have a big
old timeline diverting chaos bringing
makotoing and it fails epically
And now for Come Paradise Here is
Makakota with the
CC82 Definitely shorter but hey she
still had some growing to do
with
prime
with another
prime She's
outclassed and uh
with Sonu right there And now of course
her associates Here she is
with
Megatron
with
Crasher with Decepticone
Corrector
with PL the
first
with SIV the
first And lastly but not leastly here
she is compared
with Times Return Cup An old man versus
a grouchy lady So there you
go All right So yeah this is the Gweni
Makoto I mean I'm just going to switch
to being nonbiased and just as a figure
itself you know this a decent figure
Take it for what you will at least uh
you know a few loose joints here and
there but other than that you know it's
not bad And the fact that we have like a
dirty looking truck al mode kind of
gives the uh figure some appeal It's
just obviously it's uh clear that she's
been through quite one bit of ordeal or
another but still you know she has had
she still wants to take out her revenge
on me and uh but all the other
Christians Christ out the multiverse but
then again you know what we've been
through our share of emotional or times
and well and all that and we have grown
immensely And by that of course I mean
emotionally and mentally but that's uh
just uh going a bit into personal
details But yeah this essentially um not
bad figure It's here and there you know
yada yada yada All right so anyway there
you go So now I picked up this figure
from Target You got these are pop these
figures are pop up in your Walmarts is
your Targets your big bad toy store
everything Earth and everywhere the toy
stores are sold even our toy stores even
on Amazon.com
But yeah just essentially uh yeah if you
uh the links to the some of these
websites claim BBTS will be in the
description down below So yeah um as for
my socials I forgot to mention this last
time There's a bit of a slight trend I
mean I'll still post on a rare on
occasion time on my blue sky I'm not
posting anymore on Twitter except for
the purely occasional uh Etsy detail or
there's like a fact that I want to
retweet that just I feel like it heavily
resonates and whatnot But anyway uh
between that and the blogs on my quick
light the links to all that will be in
the description down below And I think
that pretty much it So uh that is
Transformers Legacy Night Merge Gwi
Makoto and this is Jesus Christ Chance
Prime saying remember you don't stop
playing because you grow you grow up
because you stop playing be geek be
proud bro I had to go through a few
junkyards but I finally found a nose
code that fit me I'm able to go back and
join the battle You know what i just
don't get our superior sometimes They're
just so tough at Even the boss
lady she's just so critical and
judgmental Doesn't give us even
Decepticons a break I know the boss lady
and first our superiors they rarely ever
give us a hard time Well at least the
party was good But let's at least the
character that actually survived
actually was able to host it Yeah even
I'm just a background lonely deceptive
clone but even I can count and
appreciate the good things in life Uh
hey you guys see that coming to the
window some distance i don't know what
it is but I think it's coming this way
What what are you talking about oh the h
I see it I think it is coming this way I
got to get out of
here Oh It's the boss lady Uh
boss ma'am Uh are you all right
[Music]
yeah I say she's all right All right All
right You think I'm okay you pair of
deceptic goons I just got wet miles away
by Christian
bright She makes me so
furious There's so around here Hey Hey
What day is
today well ma'am today is actually June
20th You've been gone for a little while
Crasher took your place Ma'am she'll be
giving orders to us Ma'am And we've been
actually very reluctant and very
hesitant about her Ma'am crush her Damn
it She lights worse than Starscream
sometimes Or she just works worse than
Starcream I'm going to have to fight the
crap out of that stomping
bot What's it up with you now
and you landed on me so hard
boss Man that really hurt my
back Damn it I just had that nose code
replaced Damn it Uh now I'm going to
have to go find another one Ah damn
right You're going to have to find
another one that fast Ma'am Yes ma'am
Come boss Ma'am sir Ma'am Uh yes
Meanwhile I'm going to have to go give
Crasher a talking to and report her to
Megatron that psycho in the process
She's not going to have a good day about
it
all And neither was
I Well yeah I suppose uh getting beat up
by Prime and flying that's definitely a
lot worse than me losing my nose cone
again Shut up you dip wit
