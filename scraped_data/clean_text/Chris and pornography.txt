This article is still yet to be completed due to stress. We get a lot of stressful torture in our lives that makes us crash into slumber. Given that inspiration is a big variable, and we may have been lacking of it, this article will be completed as soon as possible, at our own pace... HONEST! This article is missing the following:
• Chris as a pornography artist, including info on the porn drawings he put on ED and the Luv Shack
A small selection of Chris's pornography collection
Pornography is sexual media content. Like with many other things, Chris has developed a fixation over porn, to the extent that he views it as educational.[1] He has made many different pieces of porn and viewed plenty as well.

Discovery
The pool scene in question
By the age of 15, Chris had discovered softcore pornography, which he watched on HBO and Cinemax. He would lay belly-down on a bed on top of a clean washcloth while watching it, eventually leading to his discovery of masturbation[2]. Based on a PSN chat with PandaHalo and an IRC chat, Chris would access pornography after he figured out how to bypass the parental controls on his parents' TV:
“
actually figured it out for myself, in my room one night after having unlocked the parental lock; I found the pool scene in "I Like to Play Games 2" [sic], and I just figured it out for myself.
”
Chris would go on to clarify in BlueSpike PSN Chat 3 that the scene that taught him how to masturbate featured a man and a woman having sex in a swimming pool. No such scene exists in I Like to Play Games Too, however a scene fitting Chris' description appears in the first I Like to Play Games.[3]
It is possible that this scene was the inspiration for Chris's Romantic Labyrinth wet dream, which he would later recreate in Flipnote Hatena.
Viewing
DVDs
One of Chris's Adam & Eve receipts for a porn DVD, along with Kimmi the sex doll
Chris has been collecting pornographic DVDs since at least 2006, when he began purchasing a bunch through Adam & Eve. However, he paid full price for very few of these DVDs — most of them were either free gifts or sold at a steep discount. One of the only discs he looks to have specifically shopped for was a collection of vintage American smut cartoons priced at $14.95.
By December 2013, Chris had amassed a collection of at least 56 pornographic DVDs. He attempted to sell them on Craigslist and asked one of LoveYouLongTime's personas if she would buy them, listing as a lot for $1,000.[4][5] He listed the titles as:
Hentai:
Love Lessons 1 and 2, Love Doll 1 and 2, Anime Fiction 1 and 2, Sailor and the Seven Balls 1 and 2, Desperate Carnal Housewives 1. Vintage XXX Cartoons (featuring little Annie and the Phallum), Pure Love2, Fruits Cup

“
I am Not ashamed to tell you I enjoyed a number of the screen caps on welivetogether.com, and when I feel like totally grossed out with even an image of a penis, and recalling and focusing on a vagina image in my mind usually works, but when it doesn't, I turned on W.L.T. and focus on those images.
”
Chris, September 2017[6]
Chris's favorite lesbian porn website is welivetogether.com, mentioning it in conversations from May 2015[7] and September 2017.[6] Chris wrote that the site "really thrills me", although added that he is not a member and just likes to browse the free samples.[7] He also used it as a coping mechanism for when he saw imagery of a penis - Chris's usual technique for this emergency was to imagine vaginas. For times when this was not enough, he turned to browsing welivetogether.com for an added boost.[6]
During the Idea Guys saga, Chris was coerced to "record a two hour video of himself watching rather grotesque pornography as a "reaction" type video." The video has not been released to the public.[8]
On 30 July 2019, MKRNightVee posted some Transformers R34 porn artwork in a Discord server. Chris commented, "I was curious about the twitchy servos in that for a while, but it ended up being hit-or-miss with me."[9]
Creating
Art
Chris has created numerous pieces of pornographic artwork, though initially it was for the purpose of imitating all of the porn he found on Encyclopedia Dramatica to protest against his page's existence.
The first set of porn he made came about in 2007 amidst his fight against Encyclopedia Dramatica. Repulsed by the copious pickles on the site, he set out on a mission to add 'positivity' by replacing the dick-filled artwork with hand-drawn porn pictures aligning with his own tastes. Armed with his magic markers, he gave the world an eyeful of Sonichu and Rosechu fucking, Blake and Bubbles Rosechu also fucking, Angelica Rosechu fingering herself, Mary Lee Walsh commanding one of her jerkop slaves to pleasure her, and the infamous ShecameforCWC.JPG (in which he fingers Megan Schroeder). Unsurprisingly, the latter came back to bite him in the ass.[10]
Chris doubled down on drawing porn for Sonichu 8, which opens with a graphic sex scene between Sonichu and Rosechu, and includes badly traced nudes of Rosechu. If that's not hideous enough, he adds a dose of face-rape.
In 2009, Chris created Sonichu and Rosechu's Luv Shack as a notorious outlet to show off all the porn art he had drawn so far. He even included ShecameforCWC, despite this picture being the final nail in the coffin for his friendship with Megan.

Selling porn

Chris has successfully sold some of the porn artwork he made. On 23 April 2018, Chris listed for sale on eBay the contents of the Crumple-Lope - several pornographic drawings (which included his neatly cut-up shecameforCWC.JPG). Though the listing was struck from eBay for a TOS violation, Lukas Simpkins made a private offer to purchase the lot for Chris's initial asking price of $1,000, which Chris accepted.[11]
Cyber Sex and Sexting
See also: Nudes
Chris has created porn of himself for the enjoyment some of his gal-pals, though the ones that he has done this with were trolls posing as potential sweethearts. Some of these included Chris dressing in his mother's underwear, or showing off his naked body. Other instances of him showing his goods can also get particularly odd, such as with the infamous Flying Elephants video he sent to Vanessa Hudgens, where he does various skits while completely naked, or the Cakefarts video he sent to Jackie, where he does as the title would entail.
Along with voice chats and Facetime videos, Chris also appeared to have performed some form of cyber sex with Fiona according to her. In a chat between her and Bella, Fiona had claimed that she had at one point shown herself topless to Chris, which aroused him.[12]
Effects of pornography on Chris's beliefs
Chris's consumption of pornography has engendered many false beliefs about sex in him, which he sticks to religiously. His sex chat logs are a prime example of this – Chris's fantasies are merely recreations of what he's seen in pornos, rather than plausible sexual experiences. For example, he believed that Kacey would welcome a brutal BDSM tit-fucking followed by load after load of navy to the face.[13]
Other examples of Chris's crude misconceptions about sex abound. He mimics female porn stars' sex positions, spreads an imaginary vagina a yard across, and believes that electric shocks to the vagina are pleasurable.
