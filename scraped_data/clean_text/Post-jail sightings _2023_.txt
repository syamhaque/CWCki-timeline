A map of all Chris sightings in May 2023. (Note: this map has the wrong Walmart labeled. The Walmart where Chris was spotted is further south, just off of US Route 360.)
On 27 March 2023, Chris was released from jail, with the only explanation being "released by court order". Beginning on 1 May 2023, sightings of Chris were reported in various places around Chesterfield County, Virginia. From June onwards, Chris has been spotted in a number of locations around the state of Virginia, including Williamsburg, Lynchburg, Bedford and Ruckersville.
Most of the sightings are initially posted to the r/ChrisChanSonichu subreddit or to Twitter. Most sightings to date have involved Chris either shopping or playing trading card games at game stores. As of August, it has been confirmed that Chris once again has his own car. On several occasions, Chris was seen accompanied by Flutter, which has led to speculation that she might be his newest sweetheart.

May
Walmart
On 1 May 2023, Chris was spotted shopping at a Walmart in Midlothian, Virginia, a western suburb of Richmond in Chesterfield County.
On the same day, a Reddit user called DarylMcGoofyGuy posted a thread with a photo of Chris, claiming that a friend had sent the picture.[1] On Twitter, more photos were posted by an account named Speedymctweet, again claiming a friend had sent them.[2] In the photos, Chris's hair has returned to its natural brown color, and he also appears thinner, congruent with his last mugshot. He also has a temporary Sonichu medallion.
Photo uploaded by both DarylMcGoofyGuy and Speedymctweet, of Chris putting something in or taking something out of his cart.
2nd photo uploaded by Speedymctweet, of Chris shopping.
3rd photo uploaded by Speedymctweet, of Chris looking at what could be a shopping list.
4th photo uploaded by Speedymctweet, of Chris in the Entertainment section.
Another Reddit user, Alternative_Roof1940, subsequently posted photos of Chris from the security cameras at the Walmart.[3]

OFFICIAL and HONEST CWC Videos
previous Incest Arrest
next The Otaku King's CWC sighting
He also claimed:[4]
Chris approached the electronic department asking for a flash drive and also ended up buying a switch (yes......again). The second photo is from the electronics when he was asking
There was a large black van chris got into about 8 stores down driven by a large black woman. I didn't take any photos of the vehicle for the sake of the woman driving
No, there was no group. Chris was alone the entire time up until chris got into the car with 1 single person parked 8 stores away
The address of the Walmart was not revealed by any of the observers, but the exterior view shown in Alternative_Roof1940's video indicates that it is located at 14501 Hancock Village Street. This location happens to be 10 miles (16 km) by road from the main campus of Gateway Homes, lending support to the hypothesis that Chris is residing there. One of the rules of Gateway Homes states “No registered sex offenders or individuals who have committed a sexual offense will be considered,”[5] although Chris is not a registered offender and has not been formally convicted of incest, making it unclear if his charge poses an issue for admission. Without confirmation, we cannot say for sure where Chris is residing. Coincidentally, the Walmart is only 4 miles (6 km) from Manchester High School, which Chris attended from 1996 to 2000.
Battlegrounds
Nothing has changed.
On 2 May 2023, Chris was spotted playing cards at the game store Battlegrounds, also in Midlothian, around 11 miles north of Walmart he was shopping on May 1st and a half hour drive from his speculated Gateway Homes. The photo was posted by Euclid_Class_Object to Reddit on the same day presumably. [6]
Euclid Class Object sourced the photo from a member of the "Zodiac Duelist" Yu-Gi-Oh Facebook group.
On the 5th, Battlegrounds set their Facebook store page to private, most likely due to ween activity.
Chris was wearing the same temporary medallion he was wearing in the Walmart photos.
Chesterfield Towne Center
CWCfoot
On 3 May 2023, for the third time in a row, Chris was spotted outside a Donatos Pizza at Chesterfield Towne Center in Chesterfield County, about 16 miles (25 km) north of the speculated Gateway Homes and over 2 miles (4 km) east of Battlegrounds. The photo was posted to Reddit by Pure_Lingonberry_677, who also claims his friend took the photo [7]
This was the first sighting where Chris was aware that he was being photographed. Chris appeared to be put off and even nervous, something uncharacteristic of him before the Jail Saga, though Chris could just be caught off-guard.
Also, the Sonichu medallion itself somehow turned its face towards the camera; whether this was due to Chris moving fast enough for the medallion to bounce naturally off of Chris, or that the medallion itself is possessed by the same forces set to bring about the Dimensional Merge is uncertain.
Earthbound Trading Company
Chris, fitting in.
On 3 May 2023 a reddit user called sagehazes who works as a cashier mentioned in a comment on the Chesterfield Towne Center sighting thread that they had rung Chris up at the store where they work:
came into my store and signed the receipt "sonichu"
At the time sagehazes did not elaborate or provide evidence.
On 27 May 2023 sagehazes rang Chris up again, and on 29 May they rang him up a third time. That same day, sagehazes posted a picture of Chris in line at the register and a picture of his signature on a receipt. While the pictures on Reddit are from the 27 May sighting, sagehazes claims that they also took pictures during the 29 May sighting. It remains to be seen if those will be uploaded as well.[8]
In the thread, sagehazes did not name the store but described it as "a hippie/new age type store."[9] One Reddit user identified the store as Earthbound Trading Company, a clothing and new-age chain which has a location in Chesterfield Towne Center. Photographs of the mall store on Google Maps show that the store's ceiling matches the ceiling visible in sagehazes' photo.
According to sagehazes, Chris had been to the shop at least twice, once near the end of April and again on 27 May. Sagehazes described his purchases as "usually jewelry and crystals" and described Chris as looking relatively normal (by his standards) but emitting an unhealthy odor:[9]
it was definitely funky with a hint of shit
pure shit I had to breathe through my mouth very shallowly
Sagehazes also claimed that Chris was talking to himself while in the store.[9]
The woman standing in line behind Chris would also make a statement on twitter regarding her experience.[10][11]
Hi so um apparently I was in the background of a Chris chan picture??? Some YouTuber named SmokeyMcC posted it and I was at the mall with some of my friends and we saw him there!! I had no idea it was him and apparently people on reddit are talking about it....
He was taking AGES in line though he was trying to find loose change all in his bag. I couldn't really smell him so ig I wasn't close enough or all the essential oils in that store were clogging my nose. Also I have a constant resting bitch face so I might have seemed mad but I really wasn't I was just with my friends at the time so I wasn't paying attention like at all
One notable change from early May is that Chris's hair has been dyed a bright teal color. Also conspicuous is the absence of the Sonichu medallion, presumably to avoid recognition by weens. On closer inspection, however, the back of a necklace can be seen on his neck, as well as what looks to be a bump in the shape of the medallion under his clothes, so it is likely he has simply hidden it under his shirt.
The signature reads "J. Christ Chan Sonichu," showing that Chris's Jesus delusions remain strong after being released from jail.
This is what Chris actually believes.
Modern Table Top Gaming
You are what you eat.
On 30 May 2023, a now-deleted Reddit user Literally-poop spotted Chris playing Magic: The Gathering in an unspecified location and posted a photo of him to r/ChrisChanSonichu the same day.[12] The Sonichu Medallion is once again presumably hidden under Chris's shirt.
User SaleneDreams identified the store as Modern Table Top Gaming in Chester, a community in eastern Chesterfield County.[13] Photos of Modern Table Top Gaming on Google Maps confirm that the chairs and table in the store match those in the photo and that the framed picture behind Chris had been blacked out because it prominently displayed the store's name. The store is 15 miles (24 km) east of Gateway Homes.
June
Williamsburg Premium Outlets
Chris with two women.
On 7 June 2023, Chris was spotted buying Ben and Jerry's at Williamsburg Premium Outlets in Williamsburg, Virginia with two women, one of whom was in a wheelchair.
On the same day, user CardboardJoJo claimed on r/ChrisChanSonichu that Chris had complimented their dog, initially without any photos and refusing to state where this had happened.[14]
CardboardJoJo wrote:
Won’t say where, but similar to where they’ve been sighted in May. Was walking my dog and a person in leggings and a jeans skirt said “That is just the cutest dog!” and I immediately recognized their voice. I was shook and just told them “thank you!” but I feel so blessed.
A few hours later, CardboardJoJo posted a photo of Chris and the women and disclosed the location.[15]
This was in Williamsburg at the Premium Outlets for those interested in documenting that level of specifics. Didn’t want to post this info at the time in case someone would attempt to go there and make contact. They were on the way to get Ben and Jerry’s ice cream.
This is the first post-jail sighting of Chris outside of Chesterfield County. The Ben and Jerry's location is about 66 miles (102 km) east of Gateway Homes by road, a drive of more than an hour without traffic.
July
Walmart (July)
On 3 July 2023, the person seen behind Chris in the photo of the previous Earthbound Trading Company sighting posted on the Official CWCki Server that a friend had seen Chris at Walmart in Chesterfield County and had taken a photo of Chris looking at a display of G-Fuel drinks. Chris is seen with newly dyed dark blue hair and the photographer noted he (Chris) had his medallion on.[16]
Later that day, the photographer posted to r/ChrisChanSonichu, adding that the Walmart was at Hancock Village St[17] and also posted a similar photo.[18]
In the high-resolution photo, it can be seen that Chris has a drawing of the Neo Spiritual Christianity cross clipped to his backpack, seemingly a memento from his jail days as it is done entirely in black and blue pen.

Dragon Fire Games
On 20 July 2023, a 4chan user posted a thread on /b/, uploading a photo of Chris taken from behind. The user commented:
I play Magic The Gathering in central VA. Chris Chan showed up for the first time here. Should I get her number?
When asked "How bad does he stink?" the user answered:
Nothing noticeable. For reference, this was at Dragon Fire Games in Lynchburg, Virginia."[19]
A photo taken from another angle, showing Chris's face, was briefly posted in a thread on r/ChrisChanSonichu. The photo was apparently sourced from an unknown Discord server, but the Reddit thread was quickly deleted by the poster,[20] although the photo itself was saved.
This is the second known sighting of Chris outside of Chesterfield County, and the farthest from the Chesterfield Gateway Homes campus that he has traveled since his apparent transfer - Lynchburg is approximately 108 miles west of the facility by road, a drive of nearly two hours without traffic.
August
Walmart (August)
On 4 August 2023, Twitter user The Otaku King posted a video of Chris at what appears to be a Walmart in Lynchburg, writing:
Found chris chan (60% sure?) . Cool dude. Talked to him about sonic and shit. Don't seem that bad."[21]

Walmart Part II
On 24 August 2023, Chris was spotted at Walmart for the fourth time by DoctorWinchester87, who was initially reluctant to post the photo they took of Chris,[25] though later posted it a few hours later.[26]
Chris lookin' for grub.
Just wanted to clarify for those who didn't see the original post I made - this occurred in Walmart in Lynchburg, VA this afternoon. I was just walking along and saw him coming down the aisle. I got this picture (which is slightly zoomed in from the original) and a preliminary picture which was really far away and blurry.
I did not interact with Chris/Christine other than just walking past and making brief eye contact. I did hear him talking to himself briefly.
On the road
On 25 August 2023, Kiwi Farms user Right Butt Cheek posted a photo of Chris's car from Lynchburg in reply to a post by user Stupidface about the information currently tied to the "SONCIHU" plate. The user also claimed that their friend sent it to them.[27]
Son-Chu in the flesh.
The plate information this was in reply to was the following:
VIN: KL1TD56646B569111
2006 Chevrolet Aveo
Last sold on May 19 2023 for $3,500.
September
14 Branchland Court
Oh. Oh, no.
On 4 September 2023, Reddit user nemo1316 posted a photo of the same car from the Son-Chu sighting parked at 14 Branchland Court, indicating that Chris was visiting.[28] Barb was sighted at the house on the 25th of August, though it is unknown if she was there at the time of Chris's arrival. The house was reportedly empty on the 8th.
Well, nuts.
Food Lion
On the same day as the 14 Branchland sighting, Twitter user bndjnky sighted Chris at the Food Lion Ruckersville location talking with Flutter at a Coinstar machine.[29]

Sheetz(September)/On the road Part II
On 9 September 2023, Discord user DooDoo fard2874 posted on the Official CWCki Server that he had found Chris on the road from Lynchburg and followed him all the way to a Sheetz convenience store in Charlottesville. He apparently ran after Chris, though Chris (thankfully) pulled out of the parking lot and drove off before he could reach him, driving away from Charlottesville with the same woman from the Food Lion sighting, Flutter. He provided four photos and a video with no audio, along with the following account:[30]
I saw him, we followed him. at an intersection I ran up to him and yelled their name. We followed him to a Sheetz and he pulled into the parking lot. I ran after him and he pulled out of the lot and I yelled "CHRIS CHAN WE LOVE YOU" then he went out on the highway and we lost him.
DooDoo fard2874 also reportedly took a photo of Chris, though it appears to have been lost.

DooDoo fard2874 is most definitely a ween, and not a keen one either. DooDoo fard2874 was banned from the server shortly after he posted about his sighting chase, and fellow CWCki server members found that his Facebook account was linked to his Discord account. DooDoo fard2874 promptly deleted his Discord account and privated his Facebook.
Walmart (September)
On the 16th, Chris was again spotted with Flutter, who was first seen with Chris at Food Lion, at a Walmart in Bedford, VA a town not far away from Lynchburg. A poster on r/ChrisChanSonichu posted that a friend had photographed Chris and taken a video.[31]
Groovy, baby!
Chris's cart contains two yoga mats and LED strips. It also has food such as tomatoes, peanuts, peanut butter, and whipped topping. He is wearing a My Little Pony shirt and seems to have the medallion on underneath his shirt.

Undisclosed parking lot
On the 19th, Chris was sighted with Son-Chu in a currently undisclosed parking lot near Bedford by Reddit user battychaosgoblin and boyfriend.[32] Chris briefly remarked on an Eric Cartman plush they had with them.[33] battychaosgoblin described Chris as being "very quick and fleeting" and "skiddish,"[34][35] and described the interaction as the following:
He even spoke to us, a half witted Eric Cartman joke regarding our little Cartman plush we fought to get out of a claw machine.
Couldn’t even snap a picture before he scampered off into the wilderness so we scoped out his car for photo evidence 💀
Front view of Son-Chu.
The joke was apparently a poor impersonation of the Respect My Authority! scene from South Park.[36]
When asked if Chris was with "his new gf" (referring to the woman from the Food Lion and Sheetz sightings, Flutter), battychaosgoblin provided the following response:[37]
No, however I think he went into this undisclosed video game store with her and another individual as stated by someone we know who works there
CVS
On the 17th, CVS employee and Reddit user justcuriousox claimed to have seen Chris at the CVS in Lynchburg and alleged the following (in reference to Chris and the woman companion (now known to be Flutter) who was first seen with him at Food Lion):[38]
she was all over that woman. Just kept touching her and had her hand on the back almost the whole time.
When asked for photo proof, justcuriousox posted a thread on the 20th, uploading two photos of Chris and the woman together, clarifying in a comment that the photos were of "Chris hugging the mystery girl close. Then him kissing mystery girl."
Oh...
man...
Justcuriousox claimed other details, such as that "she seemed uncomfortable and kept her head down mostly,"[39] that Chris "seemed like he was kind of leading the shopping trip. He also was very close to her at all times. Co-Worker asked if they needed help Chris made sure to step so that he was between my Co-Worker and the girl,"[40] and that the woman paid.[41]
At least we have some potential confirmation he isn't fucking his mother.
October
River Ridge Mall
On 1 October 2023, Chris was sighted by Reddit user merrymarigold at River Ridge Mall[42] in Lynchburg, accompanied by Flutter. This sighting, shared 6 days later, provided us with our first clear photo of Flutter's face.[43]
When asked how old the woman looks in real life, merrymarigold replied:[44]
My guess is probably in her 20's or maybe early 30s. I think her round face, hairstyle, and even the clothes make her seem younger.
Game Junkies
On 3 October 2023, Chris was sighted at the Game Junkies store in Roanoke. According to chemicalreligion, the redditor who posted the sighting, he purchased a Guitar Hero III controller.[45] Chemicalreligion also claimed to have engaged in conversation with Chris, that Chris did not have body odor,[46] and that Flutter was waiting in the car.[47]
Walmart (October)
On 24 October 2023 Chris was spotted by u/Swizguard[48]in a Walmart in Lynchburg[49]. Chris's cart contains a large box of Philly Steak and Cheese Hot Pockets, four frozen Salisbury Steak meals from Banquet, four frozen Sweet and Sour Chicken meals from Banquet, a bag of frozen ravioli, what appears to be a bag of frozen french fries, and what appears to be a box of Eggo waffles. Chris himself is carrying what seems to be a sandwich wrap. He is also seen alone for the first time in a while.
November
14 Branchland Court (November)
On 7 November 2023 Chris was allegedly spotted by u/Taxistheft98 at 14 Branchland Court, moving boxes into his car. u/Taxistheft98 also saw Barbara at the door, and may have heard Clover. The redditor also claimed to have had a chat with Chris, who talked about residing in Lynchburg, VA and having taken Barbara shopping earlier that day.[50]
I met Christine today. I was working around 15 minutes away from Branchland, so I stopped by to reminisce. Lo and behold, the new Soncihu car was there. I shit my pants in disbelief when Christine stepped out of the house with boxes to bring to the car. I got out, introduced myself, and made assurances that I would not take pictures. We had a 10 minute or so kind of awkward, but pleasant conversation. It was confirmed that Lynchburg is the new place of residence, but no other specifics were offered. Barb is still around and doing ok. It turns out that Christine was just grabbing some belongings, and took Barb shopping earlier in the day. I did see Barb at the door, and heard the bark/howl of an old beagle that I’ve heard so many times before. There were no mentions of sonichu/rosechu, but we did briefly talk about the new Sonic Lego sets. Manifesting was brought up, and I was blessed, and we shook hands before I left. Overall Christine seemed a little nervous, but maybe happy to have a normal/friendly conversation. I took no pictures as I knew if I did, the conversation would be over, so you just have my word here. I am still in disbelief over it all.
Oh, and the medallion was being worn!
In a later livestream, Chris responded to a superchat who talked about having met him; Chris reciprocated that it had been nice to meet too.[51] u/Taxistheft98 claimed to be the one behind the superchat.[52]
Walmart (November)
On 24 November 2023 Chris was spotted by u/Taxistheft98 at a Walmart in Lynchburg, VA. In a photo, taken through the Redditor's windshield, Chris is seen putting his shopping bags away into his car.[53]
December
Boonsboro Shopping Center
On 3 December 2023 Chris's Chevrolet Aveo was spotted at the shopping center in Lynchburg, VA.[54]
Greene County Sheriff's Office
On 5 December 2023 Chris was spotted and photographed while at the Greene County Sheriff's Office by /u/Overall_Air_5547, who said, "as far as my understanding, he was trying to reclaim items of his that the sheriffs office has in their possession."[55]
UPS Store
On 16 December 2023 Chris was spotted at a UPS Store. u/Illustrious_Orb, a UPS Store employee,[56] used the store's security system to take still images of Chris and uploaded those to Reddit.[57]
Richmond International Airport
On 20 December 2023 at approximately 7:30 pm local time, user Agreeable_Caramel455 recorded a short video of Chris and presumably Flutter heading towards the baggage claim area at Richmond International Airport. The video was shared the next day on r/ChrisChanSonichuSFW.[58]
The Reddit user later wrote, in response to a question about the woman in the video:[59]
yes I was on her flight, I noticed her almost immediately but she wore a mask the whole time, It was subconscious so I didn't think much of it other than "huh she looks familiar," but while she was leaving the airport chris was waiting for her he embraced her and said her name out loud, I was on the phone and couldn't make out what he said.
Agreeable_Caramel455 later realized that his phone, which records calls, had picked up Chris shouting Flutter's name. He posted the recording to Vocaroo.[60][61] The name which Chris shouts in the recording has been interpreted variously as "Allen", "Alice", "Allie", "Alex" and other ways:
http://sonichu.com/cwcki/File:Chris_allegedly_shouting_Flutter%27s_name_20_December_2023.mp3
On 5 January 2024, Agreeable_Caramel455 provided some additional details about the flight in messages to Kiwi Farms user Zeus Blue Thunder, along with a screenshot of his digital boarding pass for proof:[62]
The girl seemed very shy, she was also in the wrong seat and had to be asked to move
Almost like she wasn't used to flying or something
I was late to the gate so I never saw her until boarding, she wore a mask the whole time, and never spoke
Her seat that she originally took was 32 d (or f?) But they moved her to 33 d or f, it was an aisle seat, im not exactly sure what was going on there tbh
Agreeable_Caramel455 also stated that their flight departed from Charlotte Douglas International Airport, a major airline hub serving many locations throughout the United States and abroad. Flutter's original point of departure is unknown.

A video clip was recorded and originally uploaded to Streamable.[63]

[Chris is having a conversation with Flutter; the conversation is unintelligible until 0:33.]
Chris: ...so good.
Agreeable_Caramel455: Hey, excuse me. I'm sorry to be rude, I know that you probably get noticed all the time. I'm not...
Chris: Yeah, no pictures, please.
Agreeable Caramel: No pictures? I'm just saying I really love Sonichu, man.
Chris: Yes. Thank you very much.
Agreeable Caramel: It's nice to meet you, Christine.
Sheetz
On 20 December 2023 Chris was spotted and photographed at a Sheetz in Henrico County, Virginia by Reddit user mattt1123.
A woman, later confirmed Flutter, appears to be in the car with him. Most likely, this picture was taken after Chris picked her up from the Richmond International Airport. [64]
Isabella's Italian Trattoria Restaurant
On 21 December 2023 Chris and Flutter were spotted and photographed by r/ChrisChanSonichu user JacksonStarship while eating dinner at Isabella's Italian Trattoria Restaurant in Lynchburg, VA.[65] JacksonStarship claimed that Flutter paid for the dinner and that Chris "ate spaghetti like a toddler."[66] The two also apparently shared cake and dessert, with Chris allegedly hand-feeding Flutter.[67] Chris was notably wearing a near replica of The Classic.
JacksonStarship also claimed that Flutter was not noticeably mentally handicapped, did not appear to be underage, did not speak with an accent,[68] and was keeping Chris in check. He alleged that Chris was being a nuisance to staff and Flutter prevented him from doing so further, and that she also pulled him away from talking to random people,[69][70] describing a latter incident as Chris supposedly saying, “a family night, that’s nice,” to a passing family and Flutter pulling Chris through the door.[71]
Finally, JacksonStarship followed Chris and Flutter[72] to the parking lot, asking Chris to take a photo with him, which Chris politely declined. JacksonStarship then claimed to be a huge fan and asked to shake his hand, which Chris obliged. JacksonStarship asked again if he could take Chris's photo, to which both Chris and Flutter started to get angry. According to JacksonStarship, Chris started yelling and made "a bit of a scene" while Flutter grumbled and pulled him away and the two of them walked away together.[73]
