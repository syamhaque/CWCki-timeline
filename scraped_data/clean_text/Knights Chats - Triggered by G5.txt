Anaxis's summary
The WCT shares Chris's then-recent YouTube video to the second layer, in which Chris angrily demands the cancellation of MLP G5 and resuming of G4, claiming that not doing so will throw the current "timeline" into chaos. The Fool and Silvia remark on the state of the wall seen behind Chris in the video, noting that Chris must have punched it. The WCT shares DMs of him reaching out to Chris and expressing concern for Chris's wellbeing, with Chris responding that he won't hurt himself and reiterating that G5 is supposed to be canceled. WCT expresses sympathy towards Chris's position and then asks about the wall, and Chris states that he had been punching it to practice breaking down the "Iron Curtain" separating dimensions.
At this point, Chris posts a large textwall in the first layer explaining his actions and motivations, which were apparently driven by anger towards seeing G5 toys in a store, and had snapped his fingers to make them "[phase] out of existence." Chris expresses to everyone the apparent seriousness of the situation, and both WCT and the Fool agree with him. Chris then explains what happened to the wall and states again that he does not intend to hurt himself.
The Knights react to Chris's messages in the second layer, with the Fool commenting on Chris's consumerist mindset and myself expressing concern over the "punching holes in the wall" debacle. WCT shares another DM with Chris where the latter requests that the former make an anti-G5 video on his YouTube channel. A discussion sparks about Chris's delusions and coping methods, and then Chris's past criminal history when it comes to his behavior in stores.

Chris 08:33 PM
Hey, @everyone. With all of you, I wish to go ahead and clear the air in regards to the video I have uploaded earlier today.
The preface: I did not get today's set of commissions to draw from Josh, so I chose to make a day off out of it, and go to the book store and read and highlight my copy of "Warhol/Chris Chan" some more.
After leaving the book store, I went to Kroger for groceries (ham, turkey, a block of cheese, also needed some more orange Crush, Pepsi, and a case of water.
Kroger wasn't keen on the orange soda, and their stock of bottled water was low, so I ended up going to Wal-Mart for the soda and water.
After getting the soda and water, I took a lap around the store as I like to do. Then, looking in the toy aisle where the My Little Pony toys were normally, I saw the sign that I was not looking forward to find. A handful of figures of the magic-less unicorn from G5. Needless to say, I was triggered, but I had known what I was to do in this event.
I literally snapped my fingers, and these particular figures literally phased out of existence from the store. With that in mind, I opted to check Target as well. I found four figures of the orange G5 pony, and I repeated the process with that bunch of figures.
I knew after I had got home, it was the time to take the more direct, and compassion-filled approach, so I recorded myself with the lights above the lavatory mirror, and said directly, straightforward, and to the point what I said in the video.
I tell you all, as I have stated time and again, and even a while ago with @Neko:
This has absolutely nothing to do with the trivial details of the show, or the visuals of the leaks. The impact of G5 being aired prematurely will literally do a heavy Metaphysical amount of damage to our very Timeline, here.

Should’ve been 14.
Chris 08:46 PM
Because by continuing with this trend, unless Hasbro Cancels G5 and resume G4 for five more animated seasons, the forced decrease in magic in Equestria, in counter with our increase in magic in 1218 as it and C-197 come back together, it will cause great tidal waves of catastrophe and chaos for not only Equestria, but for everyone of the 1218 half as well.
Worst things can and will happen if this is left unchecked.

Exactly; the appropriate emoji response, indeed.

lol
Chris 08:47 PM
But, as I have reflected in the video earlier, and consistently right at this moment, I am very serious.
The WCT 08:48 PM
I’m glad you’re pointing it out though Chris. The situation looks dire and by not giving G4 a proper ending with no planned smooth transition to G5, it will be a disaster for everybody.
They’re clearly just rushing things without any consideration.
Chris 08:48 PM
Worse than trivial and fashion choices.
Yes, but I am looking ahead at the grander picture of the consequences from among mine, Magi-Chan’s, and everyone’s visions and knowledge of ALL foreseen possibilities for this timeline of ours.
Also, as I have told @Neko, and given him permission to share publicly on the Kiwi,
The holes on the bathroom wall were made by my hands, but it was for past event reasons that involved me physically practicing in breaking the iron curtain veil.

And I have no intentions of hurting or killing myself at all.
The Fool 08:51 PM
Thank you for your hard work chris, we believe in you and we know you'll get the power to stop this mess Hasbro's wrought
The WCT 08:52 PM
[Replying to "And I have no intentions of hurting or killing myself at all."]
Again, I’m glad you cleared that up.
Chris 08:53 PM
Not just Hasbro, but there are manipulative demons behind the decisions as well.
I only pray and can affirm that the executives there will Listen and Sense the Danger if they do not heed my warning.
Anyway,
I’m taking a break at the moment after the earlier events.
I’m also still waiting to talk with @an0nym0us about another topic that only she can help by listening very well.
I’ll check y’all later.
Magi-Chan, Cryzel, Sylvana and I are also binging Beastars Season 2 on Netflix.
Episode 16 is definitely sexy furry bait; they have a strip joint featured in it.
