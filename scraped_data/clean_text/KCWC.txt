An example of "SHORT TALK".
KCWC is a fictional radio station created by Chris and hosted by multiple plagiarized characters.

Real life
As with CWCville, Chris isn't quite sure where reality ends and fantasy begins. Taping your own "radio broadcasts" in your room is a perfectly amusing and educational form of play for your average 7-year-old, but Chris was doing it when he was 16; kids interested in radio broadcasting at that age should probably be producing podcasts or soldering up pirate transmitters by that stage. The KCWC Top 10 Dedication Special was actually "broadcast" on YouTube, but people generally expect somewhat higher production values from 28-year-olds.
In comic
Tragically, the radio station eventually appeared in the Sonichu comics as well. In one sense, this proved to be a blessing for Chris and the audience, because radio stations don't actually have to play anything in the comics. Despite the ad claiming that KCWC plays "EVERYTHING", the station in the comic has only been shown to play "More Than a Feeling" and "Livin' la Vida Loca". It's also highly unlikely that Chris listens to heavy metal (outside of Guitar Hero and Brutal Legend).
Chris also, in an unusual display of musical knowledge, mentions the use of household items as musical instruments: jugs (1920's jug bands) and washboards (jazz, zydeco, skiffle, jug bands). Chris probably heard about this from his ancient parents, who would be familiar with very old genres. (Bob was born eight years before Elvis!)
KCWC further functions as a propaganda outlet for the CWCville Mayoral Office, as evidenced in Sonichu #8, where the staff can be seen to slavishly praise their dictator and his draconian rule.
Staff
KCWC is run by DJ Jamsta, a sexually androgynous hedgehog whose main job seems to be spouting clichéd catchphrases and badly hitting on the female guests in a vain attempt to STAY STRAIGHT. His sidekick is Lolisa, a worthless Rosechu.
FCC violation
If KCWC broadcast in real life, it would be in violation of FCC rules. Since Chris's fictional world is, for all intents and purposes, in Virginia, the station's call sign would have to begin with a W, making the radio station WCWC. American stations east of the Mississippi River have callsigns beginning with a W, while those west of the river begin with a K. There are exceptions that have been granted, such as KDKA in Pennsylvania and WFAA in Dallas, which were founded before the K/W rule was in place.
Furthermore, KCWC is currently in use in Wyoming, and WCWC was historically in use in Kentucky (although it stopped broadcasting in 2023), but it is likely that Chris did not know (or care) about duplication, and just used K after another fictional radio station like KBBL from The Simpsons.
However, now that CWCville has been absorbed into the alternate dimension of C-197, these issues have been rendered moot, as the FCC has no jurisdiction within the borders of damaged manchild coping mechanisms.
