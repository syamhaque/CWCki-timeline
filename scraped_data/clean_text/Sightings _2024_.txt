January
Ultimate Comics (North Carolina)
On 4 January 2024, Chris and Flutter were spotted and photographed at Ultimate Comics in Cary, North Carolina by r/ChrisChanSonichu user RandyMagnum68, who claimed that the pair were picking up tickets for Animate! Raleigh, a convention in Raleigh NC.[1]
The following day, they were seen together at the event.
Animate! Raleigh
Main article: Animate! Raleigh
Raleigh Convention Center
On 6 January 2024, Chris and Flutter were spotted outside of the Animate! Raleigh convention, purportedly being denied entry.
An image was provided by r/ChrisChanSonichu user DeadStargazer, who stated that security was awaiting Chris and Flutter's arrival.
The user says no incident prompted this removal, simply that Chris was reported to the convention ops on 5 January.[2]
Gas station
On 13 January 2024, Reddit user u/lynnwood_davis allegedly spotted Chris at a gas station, presumably Sheetz, in Henrico County.[3]
I was finishing an order around 3:45pm when I noticed someone ordering had on really ugly green leggings and a jean skirt. I smiled to myself and thought "that lady looks like Chris Chan, got the ugly leggings+skirt combo on too", just for me to look at her face and realize it IS Chris Chan, with her fading blue hair and she/her pin on. I couldn't take a picture because she DEFINITELY noticed how much I was staring and I couldn't stop smiling. I texted my buddy on the register and apparently she ended up going through his line. he told me later that day that when he realized she was in his line, his eyes bugged out of his head and she awkwardly just said "doot doot doo..." under her breath. he confirmed his suspicions when she took out her Sonichu wallet. she awkwardly shuffled around the coffee area waiting for her order and mumbled anxiously looking for napkins, and left soon after.
This sighting, due to the lack of photos and credibility, has been disputed for a long time; however, since it's located near the airport Chris picked up Flutter from a month earlier and Flutter was nowhere to be seen, it's safe to say that's when she left the scene once again, as confirmed by later sightings and overall activity of Chris.
Target
On 23 January 2024, Chris was spotted at Target in Lynchburg, VA by u/DatabaseSuccessful99 on Reddit.[4]

February
Notary with Barb
On an unknown date in February 2024, Chris and his mother Barbara were spotted by Reddit user Illustrious_Orb.[7] The Reddit user would wait until 19 September 2025 to post a picture from the store's cameras, due to them being an employee of the store at the time:
I no longer work here so Ican post this, so Feb 2024 they both came into my store for a notary
Illustrious_Orb left replies to a few questions with more information:
What did they notarize?
It was some legal affidavit. We told them no because it was a weird conditional document. I wasn't the one who interacted with them, so I don't know all of the details of it
Now I'm doubly curious. What's an example of a conditional document and why are they not allowed to be notarized?
Even as a notary there's a lot of documents that either require the presence of an attorney or it's a document that we as a notary say no to. If I remember right their document was both something that required a third party and one that my coworker didn't feel comfortable doing
Walmart
On 21 February 2024, Chris was spotted at Walmart in Lynchburg, VA by u/Unhappy-Rub-6371 on Reddit.[8]
Liberty University
On 24 February 2024 Chris was spotted at Liberty University in Lynchburg, VA by @munchaboy24 on Twitter[9]
Chris was spotted again the same day by @AryehSYE on Twitter.[10]
March
River Ridge Mall (March)
On 3 March 2024 Chris was spotted at River Ridge Mall in Lynchburg, VA by u/white_crayon69 on Reddit.[11]
Sheetz (March)
On 11 March 2024 Chris was spotted and photographed at a Sheetz in Lynchburg, VA by @hystericvision on Twitter. Chris's Car was also photographed with a new bumper sticker that reads "VIRGINIA IS FOR LOVERS".[12]
River Ridge Mall (March, second sighting)
At 2 pm on 18 March 2024, Chris was spotted at River Ridge Mall.[13]
(Censored face of person sitting in bar behind them) Two guys had a camera and were recording a conversation with Chris, who (at one point) raised a hand and started singing a high note, garnering looks from the people around the food court.
The poster later claimed the individual interviewing Chris was TheGamerFromMars, this was later confirmed by TheGamerFromMars in a podcast.[14]
TJ Maxx
On 23 March 2024, Chris was spotted with Flutter at TJ Maxx in Lynchburg, VA by u/Possible-Major-6101 on Reddit.[15] This was the first time Flutter was seen since Animate! Raleigh, disproving rumors about her staying away from Chris due to the aftermath of the event.
Target Parking Lot
On 25 March 2024, Chris was spotted alone in a parking lot near Target in Lynchburg, VA by u/DatabaseSuccessful99 on Reddit.[16]
April
Mall of Tripla, Helsinki, Finland
On an unclear date in April 2024, Chris and Flutter were photographed at the Mall of Tripla in Helsinki, Finland, shortly after they had shopped at the mall's Normal. The photo was not shared until 26 November 2024, when Reddit user Zenzei_ posted it.[17] Zenzei_ wrote the following on Reddit:
Tommosen ehin napata sillon, Flutter ikävä kyllä just Chrisin takana nii ei päässy kuvaan mukaan xD[18]
Sadly, Flutter is behind Chris in this pic but i was in the normal when they were there and i almost walked into Chris and when he turned around i felt like ive just seen an extinct animal😭 i had eye contact with Chris chan.[19]
Arabia Shopping Centre, Helsinki, Finland
On 4 April 2024,[20] Chris and Flutter were seen in Helsinki, Finland at the Arabia Shopping Centre. A brief video clip was recorded but was not shared until 1 October 2024 when it was posted on Kiwi Farms; the person filming had been uncertain at the time whether it was Chris, though they noted the height similarity and that English was being spoken.[21]

A cropped screencap of the clip. The best evidence so far suggesting that Chris and Flutter may have a romantic relationship.
On 30 April 2024, Chris and Flutter were unwittingly recorded at Linnanmäki by a random user on YouTube. Reddit user Master106yay noticed Chris and Flutter in the YouTuber's vlog over a year after it was originally published,[22] thanks to Chris accidentally revealing a picture of himself at the same amusement park about a month prior.[23] In the brief clip, Chris and Flutter are seen holding hands while walking together.

May
Dallas Fort Worth
On 24 May 2024 Chris was spotted at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, Texas by Reddit user Accomplished_Fix1716. Accomplished_Fix1716 said that Chris's flight was canceled. Accomplished_Fix1716 also said that Chris was calling someone, as well as texting.[24]
Of note, Dallas Fort Worth offers direct service to Helsinki Airport in Finland. Assuming Chris flew in directly from Helsinki, he would have been in the air for close to 11 hours, which would help to explain his mood in the video.

Big Island House
On 29 May 2024, Kiwi Farms user TwistedFreak posted two pictures of Chris's car, alongside one photo of Chris himself in front of the Big Island House.[25] TwistedFreak later realized it was not, in fact, Chris's car in the side-view mirror photo taken at H&H Mart. [26]
Good afternoon Kiwis.
I present to you Day 2 of #Crishing - a Twisted Freak Production.
I come bearing answers to two long debated questions:
1.Does Chris read Kiwi Farms?
2.Does bullying work?
After less than a week of being publicly shamed on KF for his antisocial parking behavior, Christopher has changed his ways. See pic:
That was from this morning. On my second trip of the day #Crishing on [House address], I spotted a wild Christopher outside of his paper mill goon mansion:
So much for that airport fit, back to dressing like a 5 year old girl apparently.
After snapping that pic, I flipped a U-Turn and went to H&H Mart. After laying down a doozer in the bathroom, I saw Christopher getting gas at the gas station. I didn't notice him until I was already in my car. Rather than startle him with a camera in his face, I managed to snap a picture of him leaving:
June
River Ridge Mall (June)
On 29 June 2024, Chris was sighted at River Ridge Mall in Lynchburg with Flutter by Reddit user ProduceFuzzy1353. According to the Redditor, Chris and Flutter had Chick-Fil-A and went to see a movie,[27] later confirmed to be Inside Out 2.[28]
July
Walmart (July)
On 5 July 2024, Chris and Flutter were spotted at a Walmart in Lynchburg, VA by a friend of Reddit user white_crayon69.[29]
Another user, by the nick of Silly_Tourist123, later published a 2-second video clip of them at the customer service line, writing: "I saw them too while I was checking out my bags. I managed to tail his car as he was leaving for a short ways."[30][31] Silly Tourist also posted to Kiwi Farms, where a photo of the car sighting was posted.[32]

Walmart Part II (July)
On 12 July 2024, Chris and Flutter were spotted at a Lynchburg, VA Walmart by Reddit user ClownPrinceofGrape,[33] who remarked:[34]
I do want to say i overheard them talking when they were checking out next to me and she was talking in a fake anime girl voice and he was telling her how to bag food properly and it was beyond weird
A Kiwi Farms user asked for details, and ClownPrinceofGrape replied that Chris was doing most of the talking about the food they needed and the order to bag it, and that Flutter was replying with simple answers such as "that sounds great!" or "ok!" in a waifu voice.[35]
On the road
On 16 July 2024 Chris and Flutter were spotted driving by Reddit user StalinF.[36] StalinF mistook Flutter in the backseat for a child due to her appearance. StalinF left a comment saying:
I don’t know much about the Chris chan lore so idk if this is interesting but I saw him on the way towards Charlottesville VA with whoever the kid is in his backseat

Valley View Mall
On 19 August 2024, Chris and Flutter were spotted at Valley View Mall in Roanoke, VA. Flutter was initially mistaken for a child by the photographer, who also wrote: [38]
Seen at Valley View Mall. She had what looked like a little kid, but I did some research and it seems like someone named Flutter? I haven’t been tapped into the lore recently but that’s my best guess. She wouldn’t get a picture with my friend and I but she fist bumped us and said we’re blessed.
Two days later on 21 August 2024, Reddit user LancieBoi365 posted another photo from this sighting, which marked the first time Flutter's face had been photographed since October 2023. [39]
