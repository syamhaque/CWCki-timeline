================================================================================

Delusion disclosure: This article or section takes place during Chris's phase of role-playing as Sonichu. He may refer to his Christine Chandler personality and physical body in the third person by using terms such as "mama".

February was the second month of 2021. Chris stopped roleplaying as Sonichu after nearly an entire year.
Chris's sex drive ramped up. He had a sexual dream, chatted about being lonely and wanting a relationship, allegedly desired a hooker, and discussed masturbation.
Chris wanted to use a taser on his Gate Crystal and Celestial Key quartz crystals in an attempt to open an inter-dimensional portal and bring about the Merge; this resulted in fighting between the Watchmen white knight group and Praetor (who was to enable Chris by meeting up and letting him use one of their tasers). The Watchmen crafted and spread rumors on the taser matter, to which Chris claimed the taser was his own idea, leading to tensions between the Watchmen and Chris.
KwaiiSandbag, an enabler pretending to be a psychic, contacted Chris and the two chatted in several calls.
