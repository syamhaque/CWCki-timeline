================================================================================

Right after giving Mao a curse-ye-ha-me-ha, Chris "apologizes" to Evan and Alec, two of Mao's compatriots from Asperpedia. He seems to hope that this concession will help convince them to remove some of their ads on the CWCipedia, which, in addition to exposing Chris's lies and hypocrisy, have become fearfully pornographic.
However, Chris studiously avoids mentioning the character that is the real bone of contention with Evan: not Asperchu or Simonchu, but Simonla Rosechu, his shameless imitation of Simonchu. He also fails to apologize to Alec for calling him "naïve", and also makes a snide remark towards him by referring to his "quote-unquote fanmail", implying he believes he receives "true" mail from fans and that Alec doesn't. This understandably didn't please Alec, and he brought this up in a phone call the following day; Chris had virtually no rebuttal to any of this, and pretended to be his mother to get out of the call.

Ahh, Captain's Log, February 1st, 2010. I would like to take this moment to apologize to Mr. Alec Benson Leary for the curses, and the death threats, and mislabelings I have placed upon him. Such as, uh, not reading his own fan- his own quote-unquote "fanmail" and all that. So I apologize for stealing- for misunderstanding his Asperchu as being a parody and labeling it as such. As much as it is his original character.
Asperchu is Alec Benson's Leary charac- Alec Benson's... [squints in a retarded concentration] Try saying that three times fast with plurals. Heh. Asperchu is Alec Benson Leary's all-creation. Not mine. And I retra- and I retract all the past statements I have made, uh, against that, and of his book being anything parodic or copycatishly to anything in my uh, anything in my book.
Um... Anyway, uh, along with that I also would like to apologize to Evan for offending him and by clai- and by taking false claim of his Simonchu character. And uh, I'm happy to give that back to him, and I retract all ownership of the Simonchu character. [Pauses in a retarded contemplation, leaning forward and opening his mouth again before continuing] And I leave you all with that! So, yeah. My apologize, my apolo- my respective apologies to all of y'all on the Asperpedia, uh, I hope we can get along and maybe be less offensive advertise-wise. Okay. [sigh] Be safe and have a good day!
