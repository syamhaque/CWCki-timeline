This article is still yet to be completed due to stress. We get a lot of stressful torture in our lives that makes us crash into slumber. Given that inspiration is a big variable, and we may have been lacking of it, this article will be completed as soon as possible, at our own pace... HONEST!
Delusion disclosure: This article or section takes place during Chris's phase of role-playing as Sonichu. He may refer to his Christine Chandler personality and physical body in the third person by using terms such as "mama".
The following is a conversation that several Watchmen had with Chris over Google Hangout on 20 July 2020.

Bismuth: you uh was it wasn't that funny to see i remember uh you showed up in the mat at the internet uh discord server and there was a lot of uh exceptional behavior going on that day to the point where i i don't know if you know who Darkseid Phil is but Darkseid Phil is this individual who does let's plays and he was yeah and uh that on that day he he got kicked off of twitch so everybody in that server was freaking out over that and then half the internet went down because of cloud player so once so by the time you showed up in the in in the mat at the internet server people quite literally couldn't believe that that was that that was Sonichu because yeah and also in the past uh there's also a lot of people also a lot of people you know you obviously know this but there's people who've been pretended to be Sonichu on discord and and on other platforms so they p probably thought it was a fake and since they did and since they don't know you and how you know your your particular style of writing like any any true chritorian would have been able to look at that and tell like oh yeah that's that's
Chris: ...yeah especially with all the things that I've seen and experienced
Bismuth: yeah i i like the way i like the way you bantered back and forth uh forward because you were expecting or you know so uh you know i i don't i'm
not sure what you were expecting i don't want to assume anything but the way you said like go ahead and show me your pick you're the the troll
you know like you you took care of it like like a boss you were ready to take to take them on and i like it because but if you notice nobody nobody said anything because you know they know even though even though mine is not in there some of the the people who matter in that server know that i'm bismuth that's why that's why i said hi that's why i tagged you and tagged you and said hi i know you've been playing uh dnd recently because you used the term you know chaotic uh you know chaotic good and that confused that that confused some people and i and i was trying to tell them like it's a it's a you know it's a dungeon in the dragon's term you know come on
Chris: yeah
Bismuth: yeah like read a book you know (giggling)
Chris: but yeah i wanted to make sure i was i wanted to make sure they knew that it was me and that meant not mom and not mama Chris chan so yeah i just essentially put my foot
forward i'd be like hey i like my dick's mostly pink!
Bismuth: yeah that
was but yeah that was funny as fuck that that made me laugh so hard um and you you like just just just as like uh just as Josh you know said to you you brought so much you you bring and you brought so much fucking joy to this world and you continue to do so that's why one of the reasons why you know we you need to remain safe
Spade: yeah you're amazing Sonichu
Bismuth: yeah we want nothing but the best for you
Chris: (mumbling)
Chris: i must be in the same dimension as Rosie that's the most valuable thing i think she's right next to me so it's like we're literally so near yet so far
Spade: yeah
Bismuth: ...That's that's that's really sweet i wish i wish more wish more people didn't try to use didn't uh i wouldn't try to weaponize a Roseachu against you because they know you know that that i i love that little couplet that you wrote you know as long as the birds tweet you shall be my heart sweet
Chris: (laughing)
Spade: it was adorable yeah so corny but cute
Bismuth: no it's not even corny it's cute i like i like it fight me it looks cute still is
Chris: that's a big cuteness oh boy and i like and then i definitely like what the trick was this trick quite tricky at her book you know hey i can see i can hey are you a ship cause i can see us doing meows to me out
Bismuth: that is pretty funny
Chris: it's just you know the stupid cheesy corny flirt lines or something Rosie and i did have back in the day (mumbling)
Bismuth: oh so oh sorry it's just a uh it's an interview with this uh fella named uh Darkside Phil the person that i was mentioning they're doing a little interview with him he's trying to explain why he was kicked off of Twitch
Speaker 3: who's twitch who's interviewing him?
Bismuth: oh uh he's interviewing he's interviewing himself because he's too afraid to because Darkseid Phil is a genuinely like nasty person so he won't go on he won't speak to
anybody unless they pay him
Chris: so he's just like interviewing himself is he like playing two different characters himself and somebody entirely different
Bismuth: he's just uh he'll state he'll state uh one thing he'll say like so my detractor said this and then he'll respond to himself
Chris: okay
Bismuth: yeah it's called it's called it's called a hug box and that's one of the reasons that's one of the many reasons why you know you're awesome because you don't you know you're willing to go outside uh yeah you're willing to go outside that box
Chris: yep
Bismuth: not a lot of people are they just want to stay in places where oh you know their their narrow minded views are reinforced
Chris: yeah and then also some also
Bismuth: exploring!
Chris: yeah if they are talking to somebody else they want to make sure they are being clearly understood that they are understanding the other people that's uh that's kind of like the reasons why mama doesn't typically have her ears doesn't like you know phone conversation as much especially when you got the person in the other room that's (unintelligible)
conversation with kai and more than half the time uh look at this (unintelligible) all right so it's like he definitely confirms the magic (unintelligible)
Bismuth: yeah it's it's okay it's okay does he does he really speaks yeah does he does he speak that quick? or does he just simply bombard you with information
Chris: yeah he he literally kind of like did the combination of fast and low talking uh he took a baby test he had drank like a bunch like some energy drinks and some sodas before
Bismuth: so yeah soda's not nice soda's does not good for you you know you gotta you know you gotta mix things up
Chris: and he also definitely definitely drinks some water at times as well so there's that yeah
Spade: so it's kind of like a fast mumble?
Chris: yeah that's what it sounds like yes
Bismuth: hmm that's why i try to articulate my words
Chris: yeah you know i get the same level you know according to memory when mama tried talking with Jake over the phone the uh vocals the way that he speaks that's about the same amount that's about nearly this similar difficulty i get from high school it's not exact but similar
Bismuth: yeah that's well that's not a good sign you know you you're into it yeah yeah use your intuition you know it to be true you know
Chris: but of course uh yeah kai is definitely different from Jake he's like the total opposite
Bismuth: well yeah well what i mean by what i mean by that is can you know people who are confused sometimes tend to tend to be the same it's not that he's possibly even malicious but it's just that he could just be another confused person you know because we because we we still don't know uh like uh does did he know did he know about did he know about mama before all of this? did he know about mama from from the documentaries? or what
Chris: no he never knew yeah he never knew about mama Chris chan until the day she went to that first dungeons and dragons session and met him there
Bismuth: i i don't understand how that's possible i i don't understand how that's possible though your mom is so famous yeah my mama's infamous especially remember
uh mama left that sign uh out in front of that that how uh out in front of there and even the store owners knew it was news from mama yeah so it's so weird
Chris: and kai is not one of those it goes goes on often with the social medias
Bismuth: oh well he so he had no power so he so he and the rest of the group did not really have much prior knowledge about mama (unintelligible) and everything so it just decides they have they chaos the internet on that point so that was definitely a good thing that we said that channel the others sat down and foreseen in that particular dnd group
Speaker 4: um if i may ask Sonichu is this the person you drew a picture for for their Sonichu oc?
Chris: yeah darkri Sonichu
Speaker 4: yeah that's right because i remember i remember you telling me that that's very interesting i was just curious if that was
the same person
Chris: yeah that's yeah that's him
Speaker 4: okay
Bismuth: uh yeah no that was a good question to ask yeah that's actually something that you
Spade: try to talk to us and like hang out we're not
Bismuth: yeah exactly just come yeah yeah just come hang it just come hang out with us you know we all
Chris: difficulties as well
Bismuth: i mean we i mean every each of us each of us here do come on like let's we're we're all we're all we're all friends
here we we all do i don't know there's nothing yeah there's nothing for him you know there's nothing for him to be scared of
just
Spade: and It feels like he's avoiding us and that makes me feel suspicious and i feel like it would just make everything yeah...
it makes me nervous
Bismuth: yeah well uh that val really doesn't like it either because uh for obvious reasons
Chris: yeah well val's psychic and you know he can always ask for protection let literally go find kai and visit him personally
Bismuth: well kai won't speak to val no on on any on any level that's why that's what's worrying he keeps blocking himself off
yes yes on every on every level on every on every level in every place and multiple times ... i know i yeah i i understand it's
frustrating and it's not and it's partially not your problem but the thing is kai has inserted himself into your life
and into you know into mama's life and sonni and Sonichu's so just be careful
Speaker 4: it's something that you know that would pique interest you know it's a very specific interest
Bismuth: yeah yeah and and also the whole dungeons and dragons thing and not knowing it just you know doesn't something
Spade: how do you live in Ruckgersville and not know who Chris chan is that's just kind of
Bismuth: yeah
Chris: (unintelligible) Virginia
Spade: oh
Speaker 4: okay that makes a bit more sense
Spade: yeah okay
Chris: (unintelligible) 64 to take y'all to keep that strictly confidential
Everyone else responds: yeah
Bismuth: well you know you you know anything that you anything that you or mama tell us is confidential stays confidential
Chris: yes thanks
Bismuth:any time
Speaker 4: the other thing that um piqued my interest was the fact that kai you know i'm still new i'm i'm not i don't know too much
um ... huh?
Speaker 3: uh i'm not really too familiar but go on it's all right
Speaker 4: um oh shoot my train
Chris: (unintelligible)
All: (laughter)
Spade: sorry
Speaker 4: i was just like wait
Speaker 3: um by the way how you how's your night going Sonichu
Chris: well going fair going as well as it can be to just go to this dress up earlier today as was telling everybody else and uh
and very much taking a break by binging stuff bending cartoons on hbo max
Spade:: i hope yeah i hope you're enjoying it because there's a lot of good cons on hbo max right now
Chris:: they got hannah barbara classics on there
Speaker 5: do they have any 90s cartoons on there by any chance?
Chris:: 90s cartoons?
Speaker 5: yeah
Speaker 4: like rocco's modern life cat dog
Chris:: yeah they don't have nickelodeon on there
Speaker 5: no i'm talking no cartoon network i'm talking about old school cartoon network do they have it because hbo is owned by warner
Chris:: yeah uh the only thing i found on there that's from past day cartoon network so far was og powerpuff girls
Speaker 5: oh awesome
Speaker 3: i don't like the new version of the powerpuff girls
Speaker 5: no that no that person sucks ass
Spade:: like why did they take the boobies away like what's so offensive about boobs people have them they feed their children with them
Speaker 5: miss Bella
Chris:: were children they weren't supposed to have
Spade:: oh no not the powerpuff girls like all the other female characters in the show they like removed all well
Speaker 4: like like the mayor's assistants and all that and the teacher and stuff they just like it just seemed really unnecessary to
change their designs in that way
Speaker 4: um i haven't watched the reboot i just saw like the one episode where they were all twerking and i was like i i can't i'm sorry
Speaker 5: i don't blame you yeah that show is a piece of shit anyway it's like that new uh uh my little pony cartoon that just showed up
Chris:: and even and i even yeah i mean i'm continuing to watch that you know at least once one time per episode
and just you know continue to monitor it they have pure new voice and discord now
Speaker 4: yes my favorite my favorite peter knew my my big mac sorry geeking out
Chris:: and the premiere episode get this mount volcan nope oh yeah okay that came out yesterday
Speaker 4: i did i did i need to catch up on that
Chris:: yes and uh also even dr wolf commented like you know you got these you got these short episodes are like about five minutes or so
i'm trying to fit a life lesson in in in them but it's like there's definitely not enough time to validate such such lesson as
as well as in the episode g and the episode g4 did
Speaker 4: here's like here's my like personal view on it i feel like it's pinkie pie's view of her friends that's what i feel like
Chris:: yeah it's a quote dr wolf when i heard him it's all go go go go go
Speaker 4: yeah it's to me pony life seems like just the pinkie pie and
Chris:: just not think about it to even get the most bit of enjoyment out of it and even even with this brain it just essentially stays
off and i was going and i went into the into the uh pilot of the series you know which is neutral expectations even though i
even know everybody have foreseen how bad it was going to be and then you saw the uh the tweet at post sales like just drowning
i just couldn't help but crowd the majority of this show
Speaker 4: oh yeah well for me it was like you know it's just like the only thing i could ever credit is they literally took the my
little pony and made them my little ponies that's pretty much all they did but
Chris:: and by the way captain yeah we might heard it about this but kathy west sucks not watching spike in go pony but top of the sink
Speaker 4: yeah and i heard i was like hmm that's really interesting but you know i mean it would be nice to have the original spike
Chris:: yeah basically i mean the main six are original voice actresses but yeah discord saying nope
Speaker 4: that discord meme where it's like he takes out his eyes and he he rolls them like dice and throws them away that's how i feel
Chris:: that one yeah i mean our original discord in c197s equestria definitely is like rolling his eyes all over the place but having
just seen you know cz 69 discord video nope nope nope
Speaker 4: um but what my back to on my train i caught my train
Chris:: yay!
Speaker 4: i meant to say that the thing that concerned me about kai or at least put a little made my hair stand up
was that they did on vice the channel vice released the documentary of you of your mama so and i know a lot of people watch
tv vice at least the channel so i was a bit surprised
Bismuth:: wow i forgot i forgot about that spunk yeah that's a good yeah good on you i forgot about the vice piece because
so many people have done that
Chris:: uh huh yeah are you talking about like cable television
Bismuth:: yeah devices yeah vices everywhere uh vices made very very mainstream
Spade:: yeah
Bismuth:: so yeah there's no way that you could you know could not run across it
Spade:: yeah i watched it i love their documentaries they're awesome
Chris::(unintelligible) where kai was living previously for like well over a year uh he has not he has not had too much access to cable
television so he has highly unlikely seen this vice channel at all
Bismuth:: is that one of the reasons why he had to borrow money for groceries
Chris:: no no no that's not the case it's not that he needs a no he did not it was not borrowing money at all it's just that he was
low on money for himself and he needed more food so i opted so i opted to help him out there
Speaker 4: that's very kind of you yeah you know
Bismuth:: yeah you you or mama yeah
Chris:: all right so now back to this
Bismuth:: wait was it was it your your idea or was it mama's idea
Chris:: uh part yeah partly my idea but yeah originated from mama she put into my put into my mind and then i ended up thinking of it
and yada yada it happened
Speaker 4:okay
Chris:: okay that's this vice channel there's they've been airing the documentaries of chris chan over there on that cable shadow
Speaker 4: yes i saw it myself because um actually i was flipping through channels because you know um my brain is kind of a ... cloud i
Chris:: don't know we all have cloudy brains
Speaker 4: yeah well you know how my brains work it's like an archive of libraries you pull a book and then sometimes you lose
the book and you misplace the book it's it's it's very different um but i was flipping through channels and i saw a commercial for vice um
and it caught my eye because i saw it said chris chan and i was like hold on that's very odd so that's why i tagged
you in that twitter tweet saying well your mom i tagged your mom in that twitter tweet saying would you would you watch
this because i was i didn't know if you were aware but yeah i i know a lot of people watch vice especially for documentaries or just you
know that's what they mainly do if i'm correct i don't watch too much of it but i know that mostly cops and reality shows are on there
Chris:: hmm i'm trying i'm looking i'm just googling uh you know vice channel and chris chan and i'm not seeing much results for
cable channel although there is apparently there's a vice tv app
Speaker 4: yes they have an app too but it's a channel on dish network because my parents haven't but it's too expensive
for me i can't afford cable or the cable dish packs stuff of that nature
Speaker 5: who even watches cable tv anymore i just fucking pirate
Chris:: um yeah we still have we still have cable we may and we definitely mainly end up using it for our wi-fi but we also have it on for
pretty much the music channels yeah pretty much been doing we've been pretty much doing the majority off television show watching via
the via the internet
Speaker 4: yeah that's fair i mean nowadays hulu netflix those kind of channels are taking over cable because it's more accessible and
cheaper you know but yeah i didn't know vice had an app i just saw it um on the television and then on the twitter
on twitter um it talked about airing on a sunday i remember ...
Chris:: let's see
Speaker 4:i can send you that in the um discord server the quick quick court if you guys want that
Bismuth:: yeah
Speaker 4: yeah i'll send that
Chris:: oh i just did a google advice tv channel there's a wikipedia article on it apparently it says here that it's an american basic
cable channel based on digital the digital media company and print magazine same name owned by a joint venture majority owned by
a&e networks known as viceland until december 2nd you know learn something new every moment
Speaker 4: well i i i don't watch a lot of it i mainly say on cartoon network and stuff of that nature
Chris:: yeah so so did mama yeah
Spade::cartoons are awesome cartoon cartoons
Speaker 5:oh yeah!
Spade:: so Sonichu have you seen the new um teenage mutant ninja turtles series rise of the teenage mutant ninja turtles
Chris:: yeah
Spade:: yeah i'm really into it
Speaker 4:it's it's actually pretty good i was i was i'm not a huge fan TMNT but i gave that a chance and i was like you know what
that's not bad yeah
Spade:: it's pretty entertaining
Speaker 5: i grew up watching the 2003 uh show that was on that was a good one that was on for kids tv
Spade:: brings me back to the old saturday mornings on the fox box watching kirby sonic and turtles
Speaker 4: orgetics yeah that too
Chris:: yeah mama watched the classic ninja turtles back in the 90s and she also did and she also checked out the crossover movie and
she's also watched some of the cg on nickelodeon
Spade:: oh yeah i love that one too i love them all i just like turtles
Speaker 4: i like turtles i love that yeah
Spade:: ironically i like turtles i am that meme i suppose they're just such cute little critters!
Speaker 4: um my friend actually saved a huge soft shell turtle on the road the other day he sent me a picture of it and i was like whoa
Spade:: poor baby i hope i'm really glad he saved it oh yeah he's doing the middle of the road though silly think i know it was
mind you it's a flat those flat soft shell turtles like they normally stay in the water i'm they anger pancakes yes they they zoom
they zoom but yeah like i think it was because it was raining that day and um i live in the south so a lot of creeks and stuff rise and
fall in this area because of the humidity so yeah it might have got out of the creek or something
Spade:: yeah it's possible that it didn't have enough water or food to sustain it so he's looking for a new puddle to curl up in
Speaker 4: yeah but it's like it was huge it's like about it's like um it's a very thick turtle
Spade::i like soft shells they're funny looking
Speaker 4: my favorite ones are the little yellow belly sliders oh yes ... (unintelligible)
Spade:: there's the ornate box turtle which has like a little yellow belly and yellow spots on it yeah that's probably not what you're
talking about though if it's slider anyways turtles
Speaker 4:
it's the ones with the red on their side of their face
Spade:: oh yeah yeah i know what you're talking about that's a red-eared slider yeah i thought they were yellow bellythat might have
been my mistake nah they have yellow bellies they just they're called the red eared slider common for pets because they're so cute
Speaker 4: but people just don't know how to take care of them and it makes me upset it's
Speaker 2:really sad
Chris:: they really have red ears?
Spade:: um yeah they have red markings that go across their ear sort of moon shaped ones it's
Chris:: they're very very tiny and they're super super fast they are turtles are super super fast
Speaker 4: yeah well some of them some of them some of them watch out wisely rabbit
Spade:: indeed
Speaker 4: definitely
Chris:: let me see some maybe cecil tortoise was one of those red red moon turtles
Speaker 4:probably
Spade:: it would make sense
Chris:: yeah and that name is actually memory cause mama and murray and likes the looney tunes show
Speaker 4:
oh
Chris:: you know she remembers you know that that turtle is his name is cecil and yeah by a cecil turtle and he was working in an office out
of his chair he has his co-worker julie she'll help him take it off that back (unintelligible)
