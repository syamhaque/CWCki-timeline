================================================================================

This was my fault (also known as 01022010 - This was My Fault.MOV) is a video posted by Chris on 2 January 2010 where he apologizes to the Sysop of CWCipedia and the Coca-Cola company for his crass attitude and is ready to take full responsibility for his abuse of the Coca-Cola trademark. Of course, accepting "full responsibility" for Chris means to also partially blame Jack Thaddeus.
Again, Chris thinks YouTube is a mystical, magical place where the person, company or entity you address is likely to watch your video simply because they were mentioned.
The second video is because Chris's camera is "fickle," probably because he abuses it like he did his PSEye.

(Sigh) ... Captain's Log, Stardate: January 2, 2010. (Removes glasses)
(Sigh) Okay, well currently, the CWCipedia is down on account of a mistake I made... mmm... with the Coca-Cola ads. I thought... uh... free advertisements was OK, but it turns out I was wrong. But anyway, I put the majority of the ads on there, because number one the... uh... mislabelings, and I am sick and tired of those; (clenches fist, speaks angrily) I'm straight, goddamn it! And plus, number- and plus of Jack Thaddeus, I put the more offensive ads that were on there before the less offensive ads that we have—uh—he has left up there now. But anyway, uh, quickly addressing the Coca-Cola Company, I hope it isn't--I pray it is not too late and that they get this-- (video glitches) and that they get this—I apologize for misusing the—uh—label, and if you will grant me the chance, I will be happy to remove those—I will be happy to remove all traces of those—uh—images... from the website... post-haste.
And, uh, also, to the SysOp, I apologize for this sort—I apologize for putting up this trouble-- I feel terrible about this... so, yeah, don't sell yet, Coca-Cola company, do not-- (video abruptly ends)

Ah, go figure, the fickle battery cable on my—uh—camera... Anyway, the Coca-Cola Company: If—uh—I apologize, and—uh—you don't have to address the CWCipedia webmaster, take your complaints to me. I'm the one responsible for ma—er, for making that happen. It was my mistake and I take full responsibility of it. Anyway, with that, I hope we get the CWCipedia back up as soon as possible, so I can undo the mistake—ah—of the placement of the Coke ads, and I deeply apologize. Uh, to most everybody, (peace sign) have a pleasant day.
