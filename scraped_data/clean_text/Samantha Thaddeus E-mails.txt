Troll disclosure: This persona was created, appropriated, or otherwise used by trolls to manipulate Chris. She was played by a user named Alex Hendroil / oxycleanfanatic2264.Though this identity is contrived, the CWCki may treat it as if it were a real identity because it was to Chris. (It's also funnier that way.)
Samantha Thaddeus social engineered her way into Chris's Club Nintendo and PSN accounts, and later gave them up to her father Jack.
In July 2009, Chris bitched to Samantha when his PSN accounts were accessed by trolls.

Hey, You. 10-11 July 2009
I KNOW you have taken my Yahoo account, and maybe my PSN account. GIVE THEM BACK TO ME NOW!!!
Why should I?
btw who are you voting for mayor of cwcville?
okay i give up,
yahoo account:
pass: HailHitler22
psn:
pass: HailHitler23
That's not funny. And for your information, my City's politics are of a King/Queen thing; NO VOTING, and Billy Mayes was NEVER MAYOR; I was lying out my ass in a piece of past blackmail.
Your passwords have failed. I have a Detective working on my case against the likes of you, and I know you live in California; do not think I will not send him and his squadron your way. And I have True Friends by my side. SO GIVE IT UP FOR REAL; NO LIES.
IT'S BILLY MAYS
GET IT RIGHT
also, the police don't give a FUCK about you and your psn besides, you have a problem. you spend way too much money lol
Well, Mr. Mayes could not care less anyway; you are a Naive, Retarded Bastard. And you know WHAT, I've OFTEN confused Bill with That guy who plays Al on "Home Improvement". *Singing* "Home Improvement. Home Improvement. Starring Tim Allen. Billy Mayes. And all the other people."
Enjoyed your Earthquakes?
..dude earthquakes kill people what the fuck is wrong with you
jesus christ you are a psychopath
Think what you will; you WILL still be punished greatly, unless you give me back my Accounts.

okay 12 July 2009
What do you want from me? What will it take for you to give back to me control of my Japan, Hong Kong, Spain, France and German PSN accounts? Anything within God-Given Reason. What do you want?
If I do this ONE THING for you to get my accounts back, you HAD BEST give them back to me Honest and For True. I have God and Jesus on my side.
the same god and jesus that told you that ivy was your true and honest wife to be?
i mean, why the hell do you want your psn accounts back?
Because without the ability to access the accounts online, I am unable to copy some of the downloaded content from my PS3 to my PSP, such as the XISai PSOne demo, the UmJammer Lammy game, and Creatures 3, as well as other things. Or even being able to play those items on my PSP if I can't access the accounts to activate the PSP with. Plus, I have 400 Yen in the Japan account.
I have a HISTORY with the accounts too big to measure. Please have a heart and give the accounts back to me by listing the e-mail addresses and matching passwords you've changed the accounts to.
it's just video games
besides, 400 yen is only 4.32 american, you could earn more than that in an hour at work
Look, just give me back the accounts, Pretty Please.
do you think being nice will work? are you retarded?
Look. I'm tired from the stress; you are tired of playing; let's just end this cherade. Give me back my PSN Accounts.
you told me to hang myself
I THINK I WILL LOL
THEN YOU'LL NEVER GET THEM BACK LOLOL
but seriously you're not getting them back
I never said that; you are putting words into my mouth.
please watch the video you made again
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfbFnB9jWcs&feature=channel_page
look at the 1:05 mark
carefully.
I respectfully withdraw that remark, and I apologize for having outbursted with it.
**Withdraw the remark from the video.
whatever, i don't care
you're still not getting the accounts back
The last straw, 12 July 2009
Chris began to go insane and spammed Samantha with over 100 e-mails.
Subject: And
Body: God will reign down with a Vengance upon you until you give me back my Japan, Spain, Hong Kong, France and Germany Playstation Network Accounts.
He did this 108 times.
At one point he sent the same message with a new subject of "I can do this ON and ON and ON and ON and..." implying he has all the free time in the world to do this since he doesn't have a PS3 to play.
Chris, who do you think gave me the account information?
God is punishing you for ignoring important biblical commandments from the book of Leviticus.
11:10 And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of all the living creatures that are in the waters, they are an abomination unto you,
11:11 and they shall be an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, and their carcasses ye shall have in abomination.
19:19 Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with two kinds of seed: neither shall there come upon thee a garment of two kinds of stuff mingled together.
19:27 Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard.
19:28 Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am Jehovah.
I did not "hack" into your accounts, Chris. God and Jesus gave me a dream. And in this dream, they told me your passwords. They said that you were wicked and guilty of the mortal sin of greed. I did not know this before, but two thousand dollars? God and Jesus are right. You deserve to lose this.
Especially considering the fervor with which you seek to reclaim it. Chris, greed is a sin. A grievous sin. And your greed is worse than any I have ever seen. Aunt Corrina is embarrassed of your behavior.
You did not receive anything from them in a dream; you got the info from someone like Jack Thadeus. NOW, You give me back my PSN accounts, and I'll call off the detective from finding and arresting you. I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE; HE KNOWS WHERE YOU LIVE. >:(
Then Chris began a new line of messages, consisting of "Give me back my Japan, Spain, Hong Kong, France and Germany Playstation Network Accounts. >:(".
He did this 74 times before giving up; however, intermittently throughout the messages, 17 different messages had the same body, but carried a different subject, which spelled out this:
And Thou Shalt Not Steal
And Thou Shalt Not Covet
And Thou Shalt NOT Withold Stolen Information from its Original Owner
And Thou Shalt NOT aid thine own Hell's Devils
And Thou Shalt NOT continue Belaboring Stress upon that who you have Stolen From
And Thou Wilst Return what thou hast stolen Immediately and Posthaste
And Thou shalt respect and honor thy neighbor as thou's self; Respect CHRIST!
And Thou Wilst Forgive he who Apologizes for trespassing with emotions of rage
And Thou who hast sined against thine neighbor can ONLY be forgiven upon that which thou hast stolen from the son who has Jesus in his Heart Truly
And Thou will not be forgiven if thee hast not forgiven thine self by returning that which thou hast stolen from unforgiving trespasses with bad emotions against thine neighbor with Christ truly in his heart
And Thou wilst not be forgiven if thou continues to sell his soul to the devil in wrongest deals; thou will only be forgiven truly if thou returns the Accounts thou has stolen from the son of God who truly has Christ in his name and in his heart
One last taunt
Samantha allowed Chris to hack her e-mail to which Chris used in order to lead into Jack Thaddeus E-mails. Chris tried to use this as leverage against her in one e-mail.
YOU actually BELIEVED that Mockumentry? My friend and I made that with the Acting, just to kick you TROLLS IN THE GROIN! |:J
Also, how does it feel to be Trolled?
Not so good, huh?
Well then you may want to QUIT THE GAME.
AND TELL YOUR ASSOCIATES THE SAME AS WELL. :D
I'm just gettin' started Bee-Otchie Samantha. |:J
Also, you only have a WORD-OF-MOUTH-LIE; when Invenstions Begin; NOTHING will come up. ALL establishment/business owners will be ALL like, "Who?" "I've never interviewed that guy." "I've never even HEARD of him." And so on, and so on, and so FUCKIN' ON.
|:J
I'll be happy to return your OxyClean to you, in return for FULL SAFE RETURN of ALL of my Out-Of-US Playstation Network Accounts; ALL FIVE (5) of them. Japan's Reld_Nait; Hong Kong's PinkieSwear; Spain's PesoQuarter; Germany's Sonichu1, and France's Sonichu3.
And ONLY after successful log-in of ALL 5 accounts on my half, will I ship your OxyClean your way, "PLUS a Second OxyClean, FREE".
Check It!
Peace,
Christian C.
