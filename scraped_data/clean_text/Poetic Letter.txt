The poetic letter.
Chris proudly displays the Poetic Letter he wrote for the UVA Remembers Pulse event he went to earlier that day, where he read the letter aloud during the open mic portion of the vigil.[1] The letter itself is a message to past versions of Chris as he recounts his life and love quest, promising that he will find his destined sweetheart.
In the video, he forgets to turn his mic on and comments for six minutes, but uploaded the result anyway, echoing a move from 2009's Brutal Legend and 2016's I`m sorry for the lack of mic audio in the Destiny Stream. Chris deleted the video after a fan pointed out the audio issue.[2]

Transcript of Poetic Letter
[in cursive dotted with hearts] Dearest Christopher & Christian Weston Chandler,
I feel for y'all my friends family & allies in this lifetime of ours. Lost and confused; is this point in our lives where we are meant to be; where DO we belong in our local communities; with, minds gone blank like a fully erased paper? We are left with the remnants of what we had thought of, before impulsively lost in time. I, too, was there during the times y'all were bullied, broken, and beat up bad. The times we've sought for new friendships to later, maybe, find truest love from one within. And, yet our efforts were mistaken for something sordid. The love, or lack thereof, from those who raised and taught you as y'all grew up. Left with time for ourselves, we've searched within our own personal depths, Soon enough, we not only have found ourselves, but we three, Child, Teen, & Adult, combined, worked out our ideas, taking our time; we continued onward in our life from how we were born, towards who we are meant to be this whole lifetime. I will continue onward, the stronger soul; woman that We ARE, for being boy was a lingering downfall. Someday, I will find our destined Sweetheart & Truest Love, while feeling the Love within; from Child, from Teen, from Me.
[the following lines of text appear to be on top of white-out or likely a digital edit which removed the original words beneath it]
I Love You both; Y'all Love Me; We Love Ourselves.
Truestly Ours Forever,
[signed in cursive and dotted with hearts] Miss Christine Weston Chandler.
