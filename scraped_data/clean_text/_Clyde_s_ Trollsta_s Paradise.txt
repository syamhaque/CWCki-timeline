Lyrics
[sung over Coolio's "Gangsta's Paradise"]
As I walk through the valley of wallow and dark shame
I take a look at my life and I realize there's nothing here
Cuz I've been blastin' and laughin' so long, that
Even my mama thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never left my computer, dog gone it
Me be treated like a punk, I take it out on that guy
I have too much stress and free time, I can't enjoy it
I am a stressed homeboy imprisoned in lulz
A cheap laugh on that guy's lone expense
As they croak I see myself worse off than that fool
I'm the kinda 'G' no one gives a cryin' dime to care
On my knees in the night (sped up)
Saying prayers in the LCD light
We keep spending most of our lives
Living in a trollsta's paradise
We been spending most of our lives
Living in a trollsta's paradise
We keep spending most of our lives
Living in a trollsta's paradise
We keep spending most of our lives
Living in a trollsta's paradise
Look at the situation, they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
So I gotta lay it down as Clyde No-cash
Too much Internet surfin' got me tauntin' dreams
I'm an stupid 'lil fool with fake sex on my mind
Got my mouse in my hand and a soda-stained keyboard
I'm locked in ninja ding dang ganger
I keep my homies not here, so I'm a lonely dope, G
...eath ai-ain't nothing but a heartbeat away
I'm livin' life, yo, do or die, what can I say?
I'm thirteen now, but will I live to see any-moe?
The way things are going I don't know
...me why are why are so blind to see that the ones we hurt are you and me
The... things... we... see... (catches up) ...hurt are you and me?
We... we...
W-w-we b-been spending most of our lives
Living in a gang-trollsta's paradise
We keep spending most of our lives
Living in a trollsta's paradise
We keep spending most of our lives
Living in a trollsta's paradise
We keep spending most of our lives
Living in a trollsta's paradise
Power and no money, money and no power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's typing, but half of them ain't carin'
... It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's hangin'
They gotta learn lame words, learnin' to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess I front, that's why I know my life is not well spent, G
We been spending most of our lives
Living in the trollsta's paradise
We been spending most of our lives
Living in a trollsta's paradise
We keep spending most of our lives
Living in a trollsta's paradise
We keep spending most of our lives
Living in a trollsta's paradise
Tell me why are we, so blind to see, that the ones we hurt
Are you and me? (pause) Tell me why! We are we!
So blind to see! The ones we hurt! Are you and me! (pause)
(catches up) ...we hurt are you and me?
