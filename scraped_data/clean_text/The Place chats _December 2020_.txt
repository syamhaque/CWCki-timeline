Rough Financial Moment
3 December 2020
Chris (as Sonichu)
Just went through a rough financial moment with Barb right now. Chris’ SSI came in for the month, but with the automatics that happened, and the overdraft fees, it fell $400 into the red, leaving us this time with $800. Had to give Barb less than usual this time around. I will check what I can cancel this month to spare the bank this month. But, as Magi-Chan will tell you, if he hasn’t already, this month is the month this body and us finally fully and safely traverse into C-197.
So, it’s a moot point, but I’ll see what I can shave off to spare the bank today.
And Patreon was less than $30 this time around.
Naught
Smart move
MKRNightVee
I agree
Chris (as Sonichu)
That’s done, anyway. I’ve checked both the PayPal (first and foremost) and then the BoA transactions lists for the subscriptions that would have made the dents later this month in comparison based on the date.
Did what I could do for now.
I can’t state too much, but I am having massive amounts of visions and other dimensional and psychic links; it’s trying, and it can cause a bit of dizziness, but this body is really tough and does pull through.

Symbolism of Custom Lego Figs
12 December 2020
[at 1:59 AM]
Chris (as Sonichu)
Hey, @everyone, I have a thought to share with you all.
Kyle
Alright, shoot.
Lainchu (Anaxis)
What's up?
Chris (as Sonichu)
Some of you all may remember this little bit of Lego arrangement with our figures from months ago that I, Sonichu, have assembled.
MKRNightVee
Hello~
Chris (as Sonichu)
Kyle
Seems a bit more precarious than pride of place in terms of positioning.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Also to mention, for a few weeks now, Rosey Rosechu, herself, has been sharing this body with me.
She projected herself, fatefully, and joined me here.
Her body is being kept safe with one of our Rotom on temp possession, and the body with the Rotom are safe in Rosey’s S-Chu Ball.
That information is strictly classified from the public eye.
Anyway
Note the game controllers in mine, Rosey’s and Chris’s hands.
It is symbolic, obviously.
Kyle
Isn't Rotom more restricted to machines, as loose a definition as that can be?
Chris (as Sonichu)
I had thought for months that this was due to simply both Rosey and I escorting this body to C-197 and returning it to Chris.
In recent days, Chris has been relearning and taking control for herself and our paths and destinies in the near future with the Dimension Merge and all else.
Hence the controller in her hand as well.
Kyle
Or, just a prop? I mean, it merits a bit more explanation.
Chris (as Sonichu)
But Now, with Sonic World, and look who is now in the game, complete with her own voice and dialogue, direct from her soulful...
And she is able to possess her game’s avatar and take in the experience of it all for herself from that perspective and exercise.
So, that being said, I realize that it has become ever more literal of me and Rosey video game controlling Christine.
Kyle
Subtext aside.
Chris (as Sonichu)
And that the arrangement was not only symbolic, but also even more premonitional.
Chris (as Sonichu)
[quotes Kyle's "Isn't Rotom more restricted to machines, as loose a definition as that can be?" remark]
Yes, typically, but they can possess living beings as well, but mainly those with electric endurance and resistance.
Chris (as Sonichu)
[quotes Kyle's "Or, just a prop? I mean, it merits a bit more explanation." remark]
Definitely not a prop.
Kyle
The mechanics, are vastly different.
Different process having someone else do a mod vs a more involved project, stands out more I feel.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Do all of you appreciate the greater values of all of this and what it all means and signifies?
Kyle
Assuming a constituent plasma, would seem to be a strain on credibility, at least when you put metal in a microwave, you can make simple things work.
Granted, never do that.
Chris (as Sonichu)
[quotes Kyle's "Granted, never do that." remark]
Obviously.
“Do not use foil in microwave oven”, said Meatwad as Shake turns on the microwave with Meatwad in it.
Kyle
There's the old lightbulb trick, neat effect.
Chris (as Sonichu)
But, yeah, this realization is further signifying the coming of the Merge at the Apex event and timing.
@MKR, @Lainchu; you both get this, right?
MKRNightVee
Yes
Kyle
Thank god that xenon ark light didn't work on that old show.
Chris (as Sonichu)
I know @ภคยﻮђՇ gets this, too.
Lainchu (Anaxis)
Following you so far
MKRNightVee
Feels right
Kyle
More or less. I just like being sure.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Details are becoming even more obvious now, but not all of the details are conscious to this brain yet.
Y’all’s thoughts in response to my realization?
Kyle
Sounds similar to some stuff that the timeline on still hasn't seen through, so it might not affect the timespan.
Consequently, might make it longer.
Lainchu (Anaxis)
It seems exciting, assuming everything works out as planned
But I can understand Nova's healthy skepticism
The last thing we want is disappointment after a big lead up
Not saying that's what will happen, just that it's good to be prepared sometimes
Chris (as Sonichu)
No shit.
But, it will happen, everything continues to progress very well in our scheme of events as foreseen.
Deja Vu moments have become more frequent lately.
MKRNightVee
I think letting things flow naturally and unveiling themselves in this way is the best way to proceed. Trying to force it will only give headaches.
Kyle
But if its basically a 100 step project at this point, could very well take years even if things did start.
MKRNightVee
Things will become clear when they need to be known
Chris (as Sonichu)
Bismuth knows this, but the big date, keeping it out of public knowledge, is in less than nine days from now.
Further a treatment to that date is that is also when exactly three years ago on that day, Chris wrote the defining, massive level changing pair of pages.
And three year marks are nothing to sneeze at; beyond just a significant event or day.
Cited from “Awakening of a CPU”
Kyle
Hypothetically, but it helps to have a failsafe or some way of looking back on it in that event.
Chris (as Sonichu)
We have many failsafes in place.
The deities and the psychics have all seen and foreseen to that.
Kyle
And a methodology for evaluating a fail state without addition?
Harold Camping doubled down on his rapture planning, and it really didn't work for him.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Magi-Chan, Chris and the others, and even I at times, have looked into all other infinite possibilities, timelines, dimensions, universes and so on.
You know the fate of what happened with N-641 that I talked about recently; that was a massive event that we have learned from to take those into effect, so we know the merge does not go beyond the two dimensions of 1218 and C-197.
Seeing into the results from all of the self-counterparts’ actions and choices definitely helped us out a lot in figuring out the best circumstances to set up along the way to keep this flow in constant progress and motion to get the desired and necessary outcome as it will be. (edited)
I mean, the actual event where that Hater-created dimension merged with both 1218, C-197 and all other dimensions, and then became undone by the power of many deities and our Chris Chan, that is not a thing to be easily dismissed.
Kyle
It sounds very similar to some of the past things that didn't pan out on the most convenient time, so what would be a constructive reevaluation of our methodology?
Chris (as Sonichu)
I can’t say; that question, once again, can be best answered by our Magi-Chan Sonichu.
Kyle
There's ample reason to question some of the sourcing from about that time, Idea Guys didn't care, and we can't discount the role duress plays in how we interpret things.
Well, putting lightly...
Chris (as Sonichu)
Yeah, which is why we made sure Christine knew of the Aether in her class ring to undo the majority of that bunch of nightmarish months from under IdeaGuy’s and Johnson Wiles’ shit influence.
Kyle
But citing old material with little parenthetical.
Chris (as Sonichu)
At least Simonla didn’t get melted by a Nazi, and I didn’t go bonkers with a gun in this adjusted timeline.
Regardless, Chris wrote it.
And we’re focusing on the content of these two pages out of it.
Because they were written and happened on December 21, 2017.
Kyle
If your model doesn't account for a percentage error, it means exponentially more difficult efforts to try and prove anything, in the practical problem domain, there are always going to be some errors, stubbornness doesn't prove much and makes the model impossible to alter.
Chris (as Sonichu)
I get it.
It’s like Phillip Fry trying to convince everyone of the invading brains and how he was the hero that time.
But everyone but Fry and Matt Groening forgot that happened. (edited)
Kyle
So if it doesn't pan out in the expected 9 day timespan, how exactly can we reevaluate our position to account for frequent errors.
Chris (as Sonichu)
It will happen naturally and instinctively.
I’m feeling tired right now; gonna be hitting the hay shortly, anyway.
Goodnight

Empty Dimension Lore
Earlier in the month, during a prior chat in which Chris talked about dimensional beliefs, Kyle had inquired if there are "empty dimensions" and pondered over it, and Chris took his comments as meaning that Kyle wanted to create such a dimension.[1]
14 December 2020
Chris (as Sonichu)
Hey, @Nova, I have further input for your empty dimension plan.
It all came into better conscious knowledge last night during, what you may call, a massive cosmic link or a massive info dump.
Anyway, given that we have about a week left before the big day, and the planning and recruitment process on your end, and taking all possibilities and varables, foreseen and viewed/reviewed in all timelines, universes and dimensions, the sanctury in that dimension, at best at this time would only be able to hold about 75% of the remaining populations between the two dimensions.
And even if you were to up your work and go Rick Sanchez level in the time we have left, you’d be at best resulting with gathering up to or around 80% of the remaining populations.
With that stated, that does ease up the work load for Chris, I, Magi-Chan and the rest of us deity and overpowered types who are capable of managing the remainder, counting ourselves, in the greater details of the Dimension Merge.
This allows us to keep the dimension-sanctuary we have planned all along, but with improved efficiency and better capability to handle the lower count numbers.
Meanwhile, we all take on the task of merging the two dimensions of 1218 and C-197 together as it was fated, destined and planned to be.
In any case, your plan will work out for the better benefit of everyone in general, and we are most grateful for your input and creative thinking in that.
You are intelligent and awesome.

Sleep Schedule
17 December 2020
Chris (as Sonichu)
@everyone, ¡Buenas Días! 😊⚡️
For the first time in a long time, this body actually hit the hay around 9:00 pm last night; fell asleep in less than a half-hour or so (waiting on the Fitbit sync-up).
Did have a wake-up call about 1:00 am and didn’t fall back asleep for an hour.
And this body, regardless of sleep schedule, has a set wake-up time up to an hour before 8:30 am, because when Chris bought the Fitbit, she set an alarm in it to go off and buzz everyday at 8:30 am.
The body always knew it was gonna go off, so that’s why.
No different today; woke up about 7:30 am; over a half-hour ago.
This body feels very well-rested.
Now maybe we can keep this type of day schedule consistent with this body.
But on the other hand, this change in the circadian rhythm was inevitable with the timing of the events and the Dimension Merge.
Especially since this type of schedule will end up becoming mandatory for this body and us in it.
And it is four days until our next big day from now.
We’re all very much pleased to say the least.
I need to meditate and analyze the dreams from last night.
I’ll check back later.

Crystals

MKRNightVee
I found some of the crystals my great aunt had given me today, I thought I'd share since I know everyone likes crystals.
[posts an image]
Chris (as Sonichu)
Most of them look similar to each other.
I think one of them is a simple quartz.

Christmas and Merge Talk
25 December 2020
Chris wishes the server a Merry Christmas, then begins role-playing about the Dimensional Merge preparations. Chris bemoans that the Merge has not completed yet, writing that it is "like a punch in the gut" that his physical body is not in CWCville.
Kyle tries to evade Chris's role-play prompts, and Chris insists he try harder to link with the cosmos, telling him that Tails is trying to communicate with him.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Merry Christmas. 🎄
Kyle
Likewise.
Naught
Merry Christmas
Chris (as Sonichu)
Here’s the Nakashuma Mark IV transistor radio.
Thank Alan Sherman for the idea.
Kyle
I forget how to build a radio, used to be a popular engineering project for younger people.
AM sucks for fidelity, why most AM radio isn't music.
Does have interesting signal propagation though..
Chris (as Sonichu)
Val.
I just typed it up by accident on the phone, but I’m curious what Val is up to with Slink in the UK right now.
What events transpired there with the holiday magic along with the merge.
Back on topic, have you tried to recreate that frequency on a radio or something yet, Kyle?
Kyle
I don't know how much we still look at sound channels, they gave up on the atmospheric sound channel or if an equivalent works in space.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Every day I wake up and I’m not in the same dimension as Rosey, Chris, and everyone else with this body, or in Cwcville, it feels like a punch in the gut.
Kyle
Just having a frequency, the frequency could apply to anything.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Well, it applies to breaking a dimension divide between 1218 and C-197.
That much I consciously know.
Still waking up for the day.
I’m surrounded lovingly with Rosey, Chris, Mewtwo, an Alakazam or two, and everyone else in and outside this house.
Kyle
Its a bit like describing how binary works as "9", debatably that can be interpreted correctly, but specificity is better, even if we're slightly wrong.
Chris (as Sonichu)
And Vanessa, our Gardevoir has just entered.
Have you meditated towards figuring out the specifics for yourself?
Kyle
I think the actual fields involved would also be requisite information too.
Val
Merry christmas <3
Chris (as Sonichu)
Hey, Val and Slink.
What’s going on with y’all?
Val
Had to work all this morning, now just settling down with the family to open presents
Kyle
Spacetime phenomena, generally the application on any scale, given it hasn't been observed, astronomical phenomenon likely wouldn't even qualify as having high enough energy.
Chris (as Sonichu)
[quotes Val's "Had to work all this morning, now just settling down with the family to open presents" remark]
At least you have Val there with you to celebrate.
Val
Always
Kyle
I think that kind of thing might be the justification for white holes, which would probably indicate something about the requirements.
And of course everything tends to stop working then, there's no reason to assume infinitesimal points exist, so it couldn't be described in physical space, could be possible that more than one point exists, where that kind of pinch effect would break down.
At least it would probably be symmetric, I don't know what the assumption of exterior regions are.
And also suffices to say, its an incomplete data set regardless.
Chris (as Sonichu)
The frequency is not garbage or bunk; our dimensions will be merged, and I am getting this body to Cwcville and alongside Rosey and everyone else between both of our dimensions.
We will not be denied.
Kyle
Can't exactly get any information from one number, even if there was a context.
Reminds me of that ENT episode Shuttlepod one, I think.
Trip asks Reed to somehow navigate in space to one arbitrary point with no means of locating either current or later location and just yells at him because he should have a good memory because his family was in the navy.
Chris (as Sonichu)
The fact that you’ve eluded the meditation question tells me you have not attempted to link with the Cosmos for yourself to get the details you seek.
Also, Tails is here as well with Sonic, Knuckles and Amy; Tails says he has been talking with you, or at least trying to.
Have you been seeing his visage on your comm devices?
Or at least hear his voice with a side of static.
hedgehog
Merry Christmas.
How's your day so far?
Chris (as Sonichu)
Pretty good
Heavy vibrations today; longest amount of time (while awake) this body has felt continued vibrations.
hedgehog
Good to know you're doing well. Been getting lots of snow in your neck of the woods?
Kyle
I think I'd notice something like that.
The WCT
[quotes hedgehog's "Merry Christmas." remark]
You too man!
Chris (as Sonichu)
Not much snow in Virginia.
The WCT
[quotes Chris's "Not much snow in Virginia." remark]
I’m sure it’s freezing though.
Kyle
I don't know if I screwed up the angular velocity, but obviously a physical frequency is exponentially more, well, obviously not.
I think the record for a pulsar is .24C
Lainchu (Anaxis)
Merry Christmas everyone!
Kyle
As Clarkson says, we all love the Baby Jesus.
@ภคยﻮђՇ [links to a YouTube video of "ＲＩＣＨＥＶＡＮＳ [ レッドレターメディア ]" ]
Val
[quotes Kyle's "As Clarkson says, we all love the Baby Jesus." remark]
If you dont love the baby jesus then you cant do Christmas tbh
Kyle
I hope to someday be as curmudgeonly as Dr. Clarkson.
Chris (as Sonichu)
[quotes Kyle's "As Clarkson says, we all love the Baby Jesus." remark]
We’re friends with Jesus; he’s one of our deity allies.
So, even though we haven’t been able to think much about the holiday, we’re still observant.
[quotes The WCT's "I’m sure it’s freezing though." remark]
It’s about 28 degrees here at the moment.

Trollsona OCs
26 December 2020
Chris professes his theories on chroniclers of dimensions and individuals. He gives Clyde Cash and other Miscreants-era trolls as examples, then invites server members to share the information on Kiwi Farms.
Chris also tries to convince Kyle that he has dimensional counterparts trying to contact him.
Chris (as Sonichu)
The point that Chris Core was making with all of that last night was that regardless of rather or not a Chronicler/Creator does any work with the dimension(s) they have discovered, that dimension has already existed long before they thought of or discovered it innately.
And the quality of how it’s chronicled is not as important as the events that get chronicled that would happen to the individual(s) there already or later on.
And all of you have your respective chronicler(s) as well in one dimension or another, if not in C-197.
Fun fact: You remember Clyde Cash? That OC that was misused to troll Chris?
Naught
Yes
The WCT
Absolutely .
Kyle
Well that also implies much less of skills, of course quality matters.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Yeah, Clyde in C-197 actually has chronicled Each and Every individual in 1218 who played as him. And now with recent drawing, he's no longer human, but a really damaged red Sonichu.
"Julay"/BlueSpike chronicled the dude who played as them.
Blanca Weiss and Jiggliami chronicled their hooligans.
List goes on. The trolls who trolled Chris using an OC, the respective OC was chronicling and using them. Put that fact on Kiwi and see how many peoples reevaluate their respective trollsonas/OCs.
Naught
🤔
Like a retroactive account of their deeds,
interesting.
Chris (as Sonichu)
It’s more than interesting, Bis.
Naught
I like the term trollsona
Kyle
Relevance as well, seems like a lot of emphasis is more, personal scale and possibly reaching.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Came up with it based on terms like “Fursona” and “Ponysona”.
No shit.
Kyle
Well, more that it seems to be a blindspot.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Kyle, Kylechu and your scientist-sona; they’re working with you as well.
Kyle
I did prioritize known factors for staff roles, yes.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Which is another reason why we’ve been telling you to get into Cosmos-linking and astral projecting.
Your self-counterparts have done that for themselves, and they can help you get the remaining details you want to answer your questions.
Kyle
I think the explanation would be wanting in the end, it isn't ad hoc reasoning.
Chris (as Sonichu)
That’s part of that reasoning, but not the entirety of the grand plan.
Especially considering the greater common foes that will be attacking both Earths between both 1218 and C-197 later on.
Kyle
So, more reason to know more.

The Real Sonichu Fancomic
26 December 2020
Chris logs into his Kiwi Farms account to read a thread on The Real Sonichu
Naught recommends a fancomic, The Real Sonichu, to Chris. Naught and Chris discuss Count Graduon's role in the story. Chris tries to persuade Naught and Kyle to talk to imaginary friends.
Naught
You mentioned people on the farms and there's one person named blank, they continued their fanfic of yours.
The art is good.
I like them because unlike Cedric and others they don't use the art to try and antagonize you
Kyle
Minus my own personality on things like amateur nuclear research, which has almost zero practical use.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Fanfic of me or Chris, and is it good and kind-hearted, or malicious and gory?
Naught
It's a little edgy, not needlessly
I like it since I'm a fan of count graduon
Kyle
Should have drawn the villain I had for the dating sim, or even done any work at all on it.
Naught
[posts a page from The Real Sonichu]
Chris (as Sonichu)
@ภคยﻮђՇ, Chris says you could do very well with talking with Graduon; fortunately, he is working with us as well.
Feel free to project and talk with him; he’s in his castle built in Maryland.
Naught
Fitting place for him
Chris (as Sonichu)
Is that an excerpt from the fanfic you mentioned?
Kyle
Always wanted to design a fortress.
Naught
Yes,
Chris (as Sonichu)
It’s caught our interest.
Can you send us a link, please, Bismuth?
Naught
Blank posts them here
[posts a Kiwi Farms link to a thread on The Real Sonichu]
Chris (as Sonichu)
Although, Graduon is still human, and not a Sonichu, much less one with a checkered pattern.
Naught
Something happened in the story to make him that way, I forget what, it's been going on for a while.
Kyle
The idea of alternative perceptions means some level of skepticism is permissible.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Hence the alternate dimension placement.
He’s got the pages on imagur; links to which are on page one of the thread.
[posts a Kiwi Farms link to a thread on The Real Sonichu]
Kyle
Or just the idea that the verification of a single location is also subject to mistakes and some factors are less certain, there are things which can be verifiably false or made up. So quality helps.
Portal had those kind of things with the PETI program, although it was mostly just goofy.
Probably the only significant one is the one where Half Life never happens.
Although mostly demonstrating that even Cave was only kind of an idiot on a smaller scale.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Checked the earlier book; some of these pages have been seen by Chris and this pair of eyes before, so not totally new, except for the two pages blank uploaded recently.
By the way, Robertchu and Graduon are separate individuals, but I see where the dude was coming from wherein that alternate dimension, instead of finding a very matching body amongst his army of !revived individuals who became his Jerkops and Janekops less than a decade ago, that dimension’s Graduon possessed their Robertchu, instead.
Naught
Yeah, I liked that twist
Chris (as Sonichu)
Actually, I recall hearing from Mister C. that he was having nightmares of him and Graduon being one in the same shortly before Chris and I body-swapped last March.
But unlike in that dimension, our Chris, here, has smartened and toughened up, and is set to do right for, by and with everyone during this time, during the merge, and post-merge.
She’s been working diligently and tough; even writing and drawing new “Sonichu” books, and even rewriting/redrawing in expanding on the previous ones.
Now, though, think about this:
Regardless of her being in my body, she has also chronicled a few books about 1218, me, all of you and everyone else here, side-books from the “Sonichu” set, but still very much canon.
She’s tested her abilities and confirmed their happenings here from the Sonic statue in the forest being restored, to the recent gingerbread monolith and rainbow, and so on.
She’s shaping up this dimension for the better over the past month and a half now.
And she’s been doing all of that within her subspace, FTL, and taking her time within each and every literal millisecond.
Kyle
Would be interesting to read.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Read?
You’re living it right now as we speak.
Kyle
Well, that too, alternate perspectives and accuracy I guess.
Chris (as Sonichu)
She’s also used her soulful goddess and psychic abilities to foresee and see everything in the present and past, and she’s consulted with Magi-Chan and Mewtwo, so everything works out without any repercussions, or with minimal damage and no more.
Kyle
In what way?
Chris (as Sonichu)
Positive and good way as possible.
But, I’ll make this easier on you, Kyle: talk with Kyle and Kylechu in C-197; they’ve asked and got their respective answers.
They can help you out too.
Kyle
For some reason I forgot the other one.
Is it both or one and the same?
[...]
Chris (as Sonichu)
[quotes Kyle's "Is it both or one and the same?" remark]
Reconnect with them, and then you tell me.
Kyle
Whether do to actual lack of clarity, or just some kind of actual personal concern I'd have with that, I'd have reservations on accuracy.
@Sonichu982 And even what I'd look for, superficial or otherwise.
Chris (as Sonichu)
For now, all I can tell you, Kyle, is to be open for the wisdoms and details from the Cosmos and your self-counterparts, as well as the ally deities and psychics.
I am feeling overwhelmed at the time with my heavy share of present duties and tasks.
I am getting this body, safely alive and well to Cwcville.

Scary Barbara and Cirrusfire Rant
See also: Sonic World#Confronting Cirrusfire over DMs
27 December 2020
Chris (as Sonichu)
Barbara scares me.
How deep asleep can you be in order to not hear your own two dogs Barking and Howling, in the same room, when I can hear both of them from downstairs?
Because Barbara, while she is confirmed still alive, was That deep asleep.
And she could hear me speak loud and clear. (edited)
The WCT
Is her hearing not as good as yours?
because that is something that elder people struggle with.
Chris (as Sonichu)
She can hear me loud and clear, so I’d say her hearing is good.
And the way her face looked while asleep, it scared me.
The WCT
maybe she's not too bothered by it or something.
I too get annoyed when my dog barks loudly.
Chris (as Sonichu)
This body is screaming tonight, breaking the Iron Curtain, so I and it can finally get to Cwcville, safe, alive and well.
Another thing that pissed me off earlier tonight:
Cirrusfire did a major ass thing.
The WCT
smh.
Chris (as Sonichu)
And you know his response when I addressed him about it?
Just because you have me credit in the notes doesn't mean you can republish my work. Secondly yes it's your character that I mainly made for a comic dub that was long since cancelled 2 years ago, and it's why I did my own voice acting.. it's authentic to my own project, I have you permission to make your own voice mod which is fine and dandy and you can release the voice mod separate and for those that wish to use it can download it, also. I'm not famous, if I was cool but it'd be on my own accord, and not for a sonichu mod .. but once again having your own voice mod is chill, but when I made it originally it took hours to animate and work on, models, textures. I put all that time and effort in.
I can’t even think too clear to respond to that, due to the pressing issues with the dimension merge, and Barbara just now.
I’m feeling stressed.
The WCT
I'm terribly sorry to hear that.
Some people can be just selfish.
Chris (as Sonichu)
And totally ungrateful
I am sick and tired of the ungrateful, selfish idiots of this dimension. I can only thank Chris Chan and the other deities that they do not make up the majority of the population.
But they are real bull-shitters on everyone.

Chris (as Sonichu)
The moon is full tonight.
It shines through the bedroom window.
Lainchu (Anaxis)
Pretty!
Looks like the sun in the night sky.
The WCT
Almost like the Star of Bethlehem. ⭐
MKRNightVee
I like it, for some reason I'm reminded of a scene from a video game I played as a child. "I spy spooky mansion" it was a fun game.
[Hours later]
Kyle
I mean, did they agree to the use of their work in the first place?
@MKR That's a good one.
[Hours later]
Chris (as Sonichu)
Cirrus did give an okay when I talked with him much earlier.
Also, If any of you all are sensing anything coming from our direction, here, towards yours, please let me know.
Trying again to break through the Iron Curtain to walk with this body into C-197 and get to Cwcville.
On a positive result; the power went out in the house for about ten seconds or so twice this afternoon during all of that, and there was no rain or incriment weather around at all today in 1218.
At least Weather Channel app verified that.

MKR Continues Complaining About Moderator Removal
19 December 2020[2]
MKRNightVee 10:42 PM
@Lainchu how much do I have to buttfuck you to get mod? Lel
Lainchu (Anaxis) 10:44 PM
?
MKRNightVee 10:45 PM
You know mokousmug[3]
Lainchu (Anaxis) 10:46 PM
Sorry, but I can't give mod if you're not going to actually moderate the server
Besides, I thought you hated the cwcki server?
MKRNightVee 10:47 PM
No one actually fucking moderates the server.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 10:48 PM
Look, like I've said before, if you want to keep an eye on users there, that's fine as long as you follow the rules
You don't need a mod role for that
MKRNightVee 10:48 PM
I just don't see why I can't be a mod if you're going to give it out to anyone who gives you tardbucks?
Lainchu (Anaxis) 10:48 PM
I can tell you that the mods aren't conspiring against us
MKRNightVee 10:49 PM
Hmm
Lainchu (Anaxis) 10:49 PM
[Replying to "I just don't see why I can't be a mod if you're going to give it out to anyone who gives you tardbucks?"]
We don't
MKRNightVee 10:49 PM
You do tho
Lainchu (Anaxis) 10:49 PM
I don't know what to tell you
I'm telling the truth lol
MKRNightVee 10:50 PM
Just makes me wonder what else you might be lying about?
Lainchu (Anaxis) 10:50 PM
I haven't lied about anything
I get that you didn't like the fact that you were removed from the modstaff without warning, and I'm sorry about that, but it took you something like 3 months to notice because you were inactive there
It wasn't malicious, we just had a change in how we ran things, and since you didn't seem to care (until recently) we didn't say anything
MKRNightVee 10:55 PM
Hmm 🤔
Lainchu (Anaxis) 10:57 PM
You can be suspicious all you want, I've told you the truth several times over at this point, and clearly nothing I say will make you believe me
MKRNightVee 10:58 PM
Then why not restore it? (edited)
Get rid of one of the payfags?
Lainchu (Anaxis) 11:00 PM
1. I can't give you mod if you're not going to actually moderate, as I've said already
2. Nobody has paid to become a mod
And again, why do you even want it? Clearly you don't like the server.
MKRNightVee 11:00 PM
You say that but I don't believe I've ever said I hated it.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 11:01 PM
[Quoting "The cwcki discord on the other hand is a cesspool of retardation. Lol"]
MKRNightVee 11:01 PM
Yes, but I didn't say I hated it
I like that part about it
Why would I be here helping Chris chan if I wasn't a fan of retards?
Lainchu (Anaxis) 11:03 PM
Fair enough
But if you believe that we let people pay their way in (which we don't), how is me granting you mod powers "just 'cause" any better?
MKRNightVee 11:05 PM
Because they were given to me by your predecessor and you took them away without so much as asking me first.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 11:05 PM
That same predecessor was the one who took it away, not me
MKRNightVee 11:06 PM
Really?
Lainchu (Anaxis) 11:06 PM
I was part of the discussion about removing mod roles from non-mods, but the decision was his, not mine
I wasn't the owner at the time
MKRNightVee 11:06 PM
I doubt they would not have contacted me?
Lainchu (Anaxis) 11:06 PM
I'm just upholding the policy
MKRNightVee 11:07 PM
It's a discord server not a business ya dope.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 11:07 PM
Doesn't matter, I agree with it
I can only apologize about what happened, but the policy hasn't changed
MKRNightVee 11:08 PM
Hmm do you have evidence to back up it was in fact his decision to do so?
I don't believe he would have without telling us.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 11:08 PM
Who, [REDACTED]?
Yeah, he did
We did it to several people who we believed were inactive
MKRNightVee 11:09 PM
Inactive> threat
Lainchu (Anaxis) 11:10 PM
Can I ask again: why do you want it?
MKRNightVee 11:10 PM
Why do you think I want it?
Lainchu (Anaxis) 11:10 PM
I don't know, but I don't think it's for moderation
You didn't seem that interested in doing that last time
That's why you were removed in the first place
MKRNightVee 11:11 PM
I think you're deflecting again
Lainchu (Anaxis) 11:12 PM
You're the one who isn't answering the question lol
Just tell me why you want it
MKRNightVee 11:12 PM
Because you took it away
As far as inactivity is concerned, I have to leave my discord on offline mode
Otherwise the weens ping it more
Lainchu (Anaxis) 11:13 PM
[Replying to "Because you took it away"]
I'm sorry, but that reason isn't good enough
I know you're upset that it was taken, but I can't give it back just because you want it
MKRNightVee 11:14 PM
You can actually
That's how discord works

@Lainchu
It's for you
Lainchu (Anaxis) 11:26 PM
The answer is no
I'm not gonna change my mind
MKRNightVee 11:26 PM
Neat
Lainchu (Anaxis) 11:26 PM
It's not personal
Just the way we run things
MKRNightVee 11:26 PM
Seems pretty personal?
Lainchu (Anaxis) 11:26 PM
You aren't getting any less information than I am
MKRNightVee 11:27 PM
I doubt that.
But this wasn't about information, it was about you taking away a thing I had without telling me. That's pretty rude bro
Lainchu (Anaxis) 11:28 PM
Again, it wasn't me
And again, I apologized
MKRNightVee 11:28 PM
Not a good one
Lainchu (Anaxis) 11:29 PM
And let's face it, if I had told you, would you have just accepted it and not be asking for it back anyway?
MKRNightVee 11:29 PM
Yes

What happened with WCT anyway? Was he really kicked for the info leaking and politisperging, or was that just what was told to him and chris?

Yeah, namedrops too much
Lainchu (Anaxis) 04:36 PM
Namedrops?

Saying he hangs out with cwc in a server

Chris's "Avatar State" and Bella, New Age Discussion, Nova and MKR Distrust Praetor
28 December 2020[2]
Lainchu (Anaxis) 09:46 PM
So now Chris is ripping from Avatar?
Good source to rip off, I guess
Who's Bella?
Kyle 09:48 PM
Youtuber?
Lainchu (Anaxis) 09:50 PM
Bella is a Praetor, huh? One of them made that animation?
I wonder if she's the blonde one
Kyle 09:51 PM
Praetor is talking about the lore and trying to influence it, this is pretty disturbing.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 10:15 PM
One of the few times I can give a relatively direct answer to Chris's question, since I'm familiar with the referenced show for once lol
Kyle 10:16 PM
I've never bothered with anime, I do well enough pulling off wikis.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 10:27 PM
Technically not anime, it's western made
