Isabella "Bella" Loretta Janke, (born circa 2000s)[note 10] also known as Kelly Osborn and dozens of other pseudonyms, is a foot fungus-ridden[18] ween and self-described "lonely 4chan dweller",[12] known for recording conversations initiated by Chris in which he bragged about his incest with his mother.
In the fall of 2020, Bella was hired by the Praetor group to create the Chris Chan Sonichu Intro animation for Chris. Chris began contact with her afterwards.
While Bella was friendly towards Chris in conversations,[19] behind his back she A-Logged him on Kiwi Farms[8] (saying that she tried to tell the trolls to get him to cut his cock off and that she thought Chris "should’ve been killed in some freak gender reassignment surgery accident by now") and her private Chess Club Discord server[20] (in which Allen and Bella had made what Allen later claimed to be edgy and sarcastic jokes about a plan to get Chris to kill himself).[1] Bella's comments led to much speculation and rumors, though no proof has been found that Bella had been serious with her A-logging remarks.
In July 2021, Chris began telling selected trusted individuals - Bella, The WCT, Null, Don Lashomb, Spunky, and his physician[21][22] - that he had begun having sexual relations with an older woman. At the time, Chris was using euphemisms such as "lady friend" to mislead them and disguise the true nature of his actions.
On the night of 27 July 2021 EST,[23] Chris trusted Bella to such a degree that he decided to brag that his sexual partner was his own mother to her during a video call conversation with her. Bella covertly and partially recorded the conversation[24] and shared it with the Chess Club Discord server and Fiona. Chris also sent Incest Texts describing the incest further. Bella planned on how to release the information publicly, wanting to gather evidence and get more information from Chris from another angle to preserve her anonymity.[25] However, Fiona shared audio from the call with the Chris Chan Conservation Collective Discord server,[26] and around the early morning of 30 July, the first of multiple leaks of audio from the call was leaked to YouTube and Reddit by Chris Chan Conservation Collective server member EllDudeRocks, followed by the texts being leaked to Reddit by Fiona. Longer (though non-essential) cuts of the call were released by Bella and her Chess Club friend over the next few days. Ultimately Chris would be arrested and charged with incest after concerned viewers called police for a welfare check after the initial 30 July leaks.
In Bella's attempts to preserve her own anonymity, she tried to claim that her friends were either behind the leak[27] or were the person behind her voice in the recording,[28] a move which led to much backlash. She also inexplicably crafted poorly-photoshopped fabricated BDSM texts and manipulated others to post them onto Kiwi Farms, another move which further damaged her credibility.
In the wake of the Incest Call's leak, Bella was doxed by the Kiwi Farms.[29] Out of a combination of her A-Log comments and self-proclaimed plots towards Chris, her edgy behavior, drama over the revelation of Chris having sex with his mother, and general confusion as logs of Bella's chats were leaked, speculation and gossip on Bella's involvement with Chris (led by Kiwi Farms user Spooky Bones) ran rampant, resulting in misinformation being repeated as fact.
After being sent to jail over the incest leaks, Chris began viewing Bella as an enemy, alongside Null and Jacob Sockness, even going as far to falsely claim in many jail letters that he "foresaw" several of her claimed plots and that Bella had faked many of the details that were revealed in the Incest Call. Chris also exploited misinformation created by gossipers, repeating those as part of his narrative.

Bella's dubious comments
NOTE:
Despite any grotesque statements she had made, there is no concrete proof that Bella had genuinely wanted Chris to commit suicide.
For more info, click here.
Bella is both a habitual liar and an edgelord - a type of person who makes exaggerated, offensive comments for shock value. Throughout her time interacting with Chris, Bella often made such commentary behind his back when talking with friends about him. As such, her comments are extraordinarily unreliable. After Bella was doxed by members of gossip forum Kiwi Farms, her comments were in turn further distorted by gossipers such as Spooky Bones.
Some examples of Bella's comments, and signs that she had not been serious when making them, are below.
In an anonymous 4chan thread dated 12 November 2020, a user matching characteristics of Bella wrote about Chris, "What do? How do I profit from this?" and also wrote that, "he’ll think what I say is legit, I made him watch madoka magica and convinced him it’s real, I told him to play Touhou and convinced him it was real so he believed it". In response to heavy criticism from other people in-thread, the user backtracked and claimed to have been sarcastic about the profit comment.[30] Additionally, Chris is only known to have mentioned Madoka in terms of the SNT Vs Sonichu fanfic, a project not related to Bella, and in a November 2023 livestream, Chris mentioned he had not heard of Touhou.[31]
During a 19 July 2021 conversation in the Chess Club, Bella coached her friend Allen on how to talk to Chris. Allen asked why Chris trusts Bella, to which she answered,
"bc im extrmeley nice to him," then said it's how she "hacked" into his bank account and "stole his money", and "got free trips and got him to join a cult and mlp porn on [Kiwi Farms] and fly [to Florida]". In this conversation, Allen joked about a suicide plot. He wrote, "I thought the plan was to get him to kill himself", to which Bella responded, "yeah but by getting others to tell him theyre jesus and they hate them and then saying "oh no those ppl are os mean :(" and then he pays me".[20] After the Chess Club server logs were leaked, Allen later claimed in an interview on 8 August 2021 that he and Bella had been making sarcastic, edgy jokes and that there was no plan to kill Chris.[1]
Early Relations to Chris

I’m in contact with CWC
What do?
How do I profit from this?
”
Bella in a 4chan thread.[32]
Bella claims that she first saw Chris at BronyCon circa 2016 when she happened to be visiting Baltimore to watch a Rubik's Cube contest. Chris did not attend Bronycon in 2016, so it is more likely she saw him there in 2019, indicated by the date of her comment.[33] She claims that she did not know who Chris was at the time and did not talk to him.[34]
Bella tweeting to Chris (her account name at the time was lilaj60771210)
During 2020, Bella made some attempts to contact Chris. On 30 July 2020, she used her lilaj60771210 Twitter account[16] to tag Chris's Twitter with messages that she had redrawn one of his art pieces and asked his opinion on it.[5]
According to Bella, she finally achieved contact with Chris via Praetor around September-November 2020.[8][35] On 12 November 2020, an anonymous user, implied to be Bella (given the account matches known characteristics of Bella such as writing style, age, and interest in chess), then went onto 4chan in a thread on the /tv/ board, posting about how she could potentially "profit" off of Chris's infamy and possibly troll him effectively.[36] The user leaked screenshots of Chris playing chess. In addition, the user claimed to be both a "troll" and "friend" to Chris,
and that "we genuinely talk about stuff everyday and i like to play chess with him desu".
Other users in the thread, however, had given the user heavy criticism, giving her warnings about how her being in contact with Chris was a bad idea, to which Bella had responded to with a series of tantrums, foreshadowing just how fit she really was for trolling Chris. In said tantrums, Bella gloats about how she considers Chris her "chess partner" while also complaining about how Chris wanted her to join his "cult". The user ignored warnings by other users that it would be a dox risk to continue interacting with Chris.
During their interactions, Chris held a positive view of Bella, describing her as "cool to talk with,"[17] meshing with Bella's claim that she is "extremely nice to him."[20] Bella gifted Chris with mints in the shape of Pickle Rick, markers, and a few letters.[37] However, the former Watchmen member Kyle considered Bella a "sycophant".[17] Bella claimed that many of the ineteractions she had with Chris were "pleasant",[37] though Chris also envisioned her as being a male Sonichu in Dimension C-197.
Collaborations with Praetor
NOTE:
Bella was never a member of Praetor, only being hired to create an animation for them. She also wasn't involved in any other projects of theirs.
For more info, click here.
“
I did, I was paid too by Chris himself and a group of faggy trolls who “recruited me”(essentially just gave me all of chris‘s information and bank info) and had Chris write me a graphic explanation of the “anime intro” word for word. Gayest fucking shit I have ever read in my life. My IG is 10thanonymous, idk it doesn’t show up in his video, I’m surprised he even reached out to me considering the blatant criticism and the depictions I made of him being a fat, overweight, retard.
”
Bella on her relations with Praetor.
“
The current “trolls” are just as big of retards as he is and they literally do nothing but stroke his fucking tranny cock that for some reason they won’t budge when I try to tell them to get him to cut it off instead of paying him. as much as I think the guy should’ve been killed in some freak gender reassignment surgery accident by now, I got my check to animate this shit and now I’ll dip, cya!
”
Bella as Kiwi Farms user 10anon.[8]
In a Kiwi Farms post, Bella implies that Praetor reached out to her via her Instagram,[8] giving Bella all of Chris's personal information and his bank information. They also had Chris write her a request for his vision of an anime intro, something which Bella hesitantly did, calling it the "gayest fucking shit [she had] ever read in [her] life".
Chris seems to confirm Bella's claims in a 4 June 2022 letter, stating that he had met Bella via his interactions with Praetor, though he also believes that them hiring her was not a good decision.[38]
Chris Chan Sonichu Intro animation
Main article: Chris Chan Sonichu Intro animation
Chris states in another letter that Bella had not contributed much to the group, has not participated with them while making sales, and that her only true collaboration with them was the previously mentioned anime intro involving Chris Chan Sonichu.[39] Bella later confirmed this in a chat between the Knights, saying that she was just an associate of theirs, but they still contacted her from time to time.[40]
On an unknown date, Chris requested an animation from Bella, which she created. Chris Chan Sonichu Intro animation was subsequently posted to Chris on his YouTube channel on 13 November 2020. In the video's description, Chris credited an Instagram account - i_have_30k_hours_on_nekopara - the profile of which read:[41]
Fart collector
I animate stuff
45 yrs old & THRIVING in muh basement
Fat male + balding & still sexu
Divorced with 2 kids 😎
I commission art (/d porn only)
Bella apparently changed the username to 10thanonymous at some point afterwards; Chris talked about Bella and the planned trip to Null on 14 July 2021, and gave him her 10thanonymous Instagram. Null was suspicious about the profile's claim of 10thanonymous being a 45 year old man, and Chris answered that Bella was joking with it, described her as "very intelligent and kind," and sent Null her real-world photograph as proof her profile age was a joke.[4]
Crystalgate
On 28 December 2020, Bella talked about the Avatar State, a power-up from the fictional Nickelodeon cartoon Avatar: The Last Airbender. Chris promptly incorporated it into his fantasy world.[17] Chris talked about this new state that Bella introduced to him to a group of Watchmen while also showing them the animation she made, which inadvertently caused them to believe that Praetor was manipulating Chris to say the things he said at Goochland Library when Chris mistakenly refers to her as "one of our Praetor friends", especially when they noted Chris Chan Sonichu being drawn with a bulge, something which made Kyle categorize the animation as "gratuitous" and "porny", though this was an obvious nod to Chris being transgender.[17] Bella was also mistakenly believed to be the Praetor Cabell O'Malley, who Chris described as being "the artist" of the group.
Impersonations
During the period that Bella was in contact with Chris, she had also impersonated other people in talks with him, including his high school gal-pals. Bella's intent behind the impersonations and the full extent at which she did them is unknown.
Curiosity Stream Employee
Bella impersonated a Curiosity Stream employee on 13 October 2020 in order to get Chris to Richmond, Virginia, sending him an e-mail claiming interest in discussing with him about autism on a podcast due to his Sonichu comics.[42] It's unknown if Chris replied to the e-mail.
On 13 October 2020, Bella used her AshleyHammerCuriosity@protonmail.com e-mail account to send a message to Chris in which she impersonated Ashley Hamer of Curiosity and claimed that "Lilaj Montey" would want to interview Chris.[15] Chris is not known to have replied to the messages.
Gal Pals
One of two leaked e-mails where Bella interacts with Chris under the "Kelly Andes" pseudonym
From 1 February until mid-June of 2021, Bella impersonated high school gal-pal Kellie Andes (while misspelling her name as "Kelly Andes") in several emails.[14] During May 2021, Chris asked "Kelly" if she had an Amazon account and would be willing to buy a gift card for him, so that he could gift a female associate of his $200 for her birthday (Chris claimed his own account wasn't going through, and promised he would repay "Kelly" the money). "Kelly" agreed. As only a few of these e-mails have been leaked, and all of the leaked e-mails have occurred far between, it is uncertain how far Bella may have gone with her impersonation of "Kelly".
Chris's crush on Bella
Chris has demonstrated attraction towards Bella, although she did not reciprocate.
On 17 February 2021, Chris listed Bella as one option he had been considering for a potential relationship.[43] Chris showed signs of interest in her later on his planned trip to Everfree Northwest; he wanted to book a room with Bella at the hotel at which they planned to stay.[44] She claimed in a chat between herself and Fiona that Chris consistently made sexual remarks towards her.[45] After Chris grew to hate Bella when her recordings of him bragging of sex with his mother landed him in jail, he falsely claimed in a Jail Letter that he never had strong sexual feelings towards Bella, only stating that they were "Just Friends".[46] In a conversation with Watchmen members, Chris stated that Bella was "intelligent".[47] Bella had also mentioned in a 25 April 2021 chat with the Chess Club member Allen that Chris has been constantly texting her, and telling her how much he "needs her", to which Allen suggests blocking him, as Bella had no interest in being his friend.[48]
Interactions with Larry Vaughn
The troll Larry Vaughn also claimed to have been in contact with Bella early on when she first contacted Chris via Praetor. Despite her minimal role with the group, Bella has also posed as a full-on member theirs while also giving fabricated information about the group to Larry.[49]
According to Larry, Bella told him that Chris had been attempting to contact gal-pals from high school in an attempt to reconnect with them, and that she was telling them to change their information every couple of years so Chris couldn't contact them. Larry claimed that Bella played a role in helping him manipulate Chris.[50] A Twitter account of Bella's under her "Kelly Osborn" pseudonym had also followed Larry's Twitter account.[51] Bella was also briefly mentioned in Anaxis' second Lainchu Chronicling, The Vaughn Interlude, in which Chris mentions that Bella "trolled" him for intel, making this the first public mention of Bella.
Gloating
Despite claiming that she was done with Chris, Bella had shown instances of her bragging about having contact with him in the following months, having learnt nothing from her 4chan thread. In a 19 July 2021 Discord post, talking to one of her associates about how, as a result of being nice to Chris, she was able to troll him for almost a year.[3] The full extent at which Bella had been trolling Chris by this point, however, is not known, though Bella had often boasted and bragged about being the only troll that has never been discovered. Former member of Bella's Chess Club server had also claimed that she constantly bragged about knowing him personally.[52]
Everfree Northwest
See also: Everfree Northwest#Planned attendees
Chris talking to Null about Everfree Northwest.
Everfree Northwest is a My Little Pony-themed convention; Chris had planned to attend during August 2021. On 12 July 2021, after Kyle informed The WCT about Jacob Sockness's intentions to go to Everfree Northwest to meet Chris, the WCT warns Chris about this in turn. The Fool then suggested that Chris should have bodyguards at the convention, which The WCT agrees to. Chris then sought to put together a "posse" for "sharing and protection" during the convention.[53] Chris asked The WCT if he knew of anyone who could help, and WCT indicated that he did not. Chris also mentioned having asked Null and Praetor's Caden if they could help with the posse arrangements.[53] The following day, Chris texted Bella and assigned her to act as a bodyguard:
“
I wanted to check in with you on an additional detail about the convention, as in while us being together as travel buddies and friends remains genuine, there is a caveat as well. You'll also play as a bodyguard and watch person, similar to Link's Navi, unless you feel able to do physical work in defense as well. The reason being Sockness is making attempt to get to the convention as wells."
”
Chris's text to Bella[21]
According to Bella, she received a message from Chris requesting that she be his bodyguard.[37] Bella had agreed to the bodyguard role.[35][54] Chris also made plans with Bella for them to carpool to Washington, D.C. together for their flight to Seattle, WA to attend the convention there.[55] According to Bella, Chris also wanted her to act as photographer, paying her $500 to purchase a camera and follow him around the convention to take photos.[56]
Around this time, Chris was also secretly in contact with Fiona, a young woman who had developed a crush on him. She and Bella would have accompanied Chris during the Everfree Northwest convention. On 14 July 2021, Chris had told Null about Bella and her plans to meet him at the convention, to which Null tells him that Bella's Instagram account claimed she was a 45-year-old man.[4] Chris sent Null a photograph of her. On 19 July 2021, Chris invited Bella[57][35] and Fiona[58] into Knights of CWC, a Discord server created by The WCT as a splinter of the Watchmen, where they discussed Everfree Northwest and how best to protect Chris from Jacob Sockness.[59]
From there a love triangle formed. Chris liked Bella, Bella liked Fiona, and Fiona liked Chris. The Love Triangle made hotel arrangements complicated, as Chris wanted to have a room with Bella but not Fiona.[60] Bella, having claimed to have become "besties" with Fiona, had sworn to protect her from Chris, believing that Fiona's crush on him was a danger to her. She also admitted to being sexually attracted to Fiona,[61] and had expressed desires to date her during the event. Bella claimed in the Chess club that she planned to "steal" her from Chris to "protect" her,[62] and that Chris invited Bella to be his dance partner and then invited Fiona at Bella's suggestion, though Bella intended to just dance with Fiona.[63]
On 19 July 2021, Chris introduced Bella to the group Knights of CWC. As she had not initally demonstrated malicious intentions to him, The WCT said, "as long as your intentions are good, you'll be fine."[35] The WCT had also had Bella's assistance to help him attempt to dox Naught following Naught doxing him for declining the use of his Kiwi Farms account. According to The Fool, a longtime but now-banned Kiwi Farms user and minor member of both The Place and The Knights, Naught and WCT took conflicting approaches towards stopping Chris from interacting with Bella and the rest of Praetor when she was present in the server:
Neither naught or WCT were friends with bella, bella was in her own little white knight group controlling chris. WCT tried to be friendly with her so he could keep a short leash on her, bella was very defensive about it. WCT said naught actively tried to push bella away which might be why bella was defensive about WCT trying to interact with her, but that's just from what WCT said, I didn't witness anything the Watchmen ever did myself.
both naught and WCT knew bella was a ween but they couldn't get chris to not interact with her, or the praetor crew in general for that matter. naught tried to outright demonize them while WCT tried to pretend to be friendly with them to facilitate open communication so they could know exactly what praetor was planning next. Neither plan worked, but, it's Chris, what can you do.[64]
Chris was later arrested and detained before he could actually attend the convention and has since been banned indefinitely.[65]
Incest Call
See also: Bella and Fiona chats
NOTE:
Despite what you may have been led to believe, Bella did not convince Chris to start his affair with his mother, although she didn't strongly discourage him from continuing having sex with his mother when she found out about it.[66]

Josh moon hates me abd I'm ok with just being a legend
”
Bella optimistically gloating about the incest leaks.[67]
During July 2021, Chris began claiming to several people, including Bella, that he was having sex with an unspecified older woman. In his claims, Chris dropped vague hints, but also lied about, the identity of the older woman. In late July 2021, Chris decided to tell Bella that the older woman was his own mother during a video call conversation which Chris had initiated. While Chris was telling Bella about it, she found an excuse to begin covertly recording the conversation using her iPad.
A compilation of the recording was shared by Bella to her friends in the Chess Club and to Fiona. Fiona, in turn, shared a censored version of the file to the Chris Chan Conservation Collective; server member EllDudeRocks uploaded the clip to YouTube.
The aftermath of the leak resulted in much drama as Bella tried to avoid being doxed. In her attempts, she falsely claimed others to be responsible for her role in the call and its subsequent leak.
Hints at an affair
On 13 July 2021, Chris had bragged to Bella that he was in a relationship with a new sweetheart who is "older than him", considering her as one of the few people he can trust to not share it to anyone else.[21]
On about 27 July, Chris again pressed further and dropped more hints about the nature of his relationship:
“
I realize I am remaining and sounding distant on the questioning, and it will become more clear and obvious when I tell you, in-person, who she is. I actually wish I could tell you over text or voice call, but the government and anyone with the tech can easily hack into those methods.
”
Chris.[68]
Chris stated he would "feel better and safer confiding with [Bella] in person." Chris also recommended using Signal, a texting and voice/video chatting app which features security measures such as end-to-end encryption (having used the app to communicate with Null).[68]
Later, Bella chatted with Fiona about Chris's evasiveness. Bella said that, due to Chris implying illegal activity over his relationship from his "hack" comment, she had a feeling he and his sexual partner were related. Fiona asked if it was Barbara and Bella replied "I genuinely think it might be"[69]
The Incest Call
“
At first I did not believe it, even after Christine said “Bella, I want you to look me in the eye when I say this… I am having sexual relations with Barbara”
”
A supposed recounting from Bella about how the Incest Call started.[37]
At around 9:30 PM EST on 27 July 2021, a video call took place. During it, Chris revealed that his new sweetheart was actually his mother, going into graphic detail about his incestuous relationship with her. According to Bella, the beginning of the conversation was not recorded, and she
began recording when Chris showed her the vibrators and "organic lube foam" he was using on his mom.[70]
Bella acted nonchalant throughout, and even supportive at times. Afterwards she stated to her Chess Club friends that she never said the incest was wrong and that Chris thought it was justified, and that she said she understood so he would talk more.[25] Bella stated this several times when she was questioned in an interview regarding the call leaks.[71]
Bella made a subtle attempt to divert Chris's attention away from Barbara by bringing up Fiona:
“
[Barbara]'s wise in her ways and um, you know, she has experience and she loves you, and you two have a great relationship. But wouldn't you want somebody who's younger? Right? To keep up more with your energy? Yeah.
”
Bella, promoting Fiona.[66]
Bella talked up Fiona, describing her as "a wonderful girl" who "really, really, really adores you" and painted a picture of a relationship with her:
“
[Fiona]'ll be more open to stuff like, you know, having spa days, getting pizza, going out together, you know, and, she's um, she's probably newer in the bedroom, but she's willing to do it. She's willing to have fun with you.
”
Bella.[66]
However Chris resisted, saying he had foretold the future and that Fiona would find someone else while at college.
Call Leaks
After the call ended, Bella then edited together multiple clips from her recording and shared the video call with the Chess Club and Fiona. All expressed disgust with Chris for his incest.
“
Dude
WHAT THE FUCK
”
A reaction from Bella after the call.[72]
Fiona, though in shock, stated that "when I have sex with him, I hope it sways him away from his mother" and encouraged Bella to "please tell him to quit her for me".[72]
Apparently around the time of the call, Chris allegedly sent text messages to Bella describing his incestuous actions in additional detail.
Bella intended to leak the incest news, but wanted to gather evidence from a different angle to remain anonymous.[25] However, she had sent the incest Call and texts to Fiona, who leaked those on the night of 29 July on a Discord Server,[73] both without Bella's permission. Bella scolded Fiona for both of these actions, evidently irritated.[74]
Aftermath
Main article: Post-incest leak drama
Null questioned Chris, who told him that he had told only Bella, consequently, Bella was named by Null as a troll with knowledge of the material.[24]
Bella tried in vain to avoid being doxed, namely by spreading disinformation and attempting to frame other people.
After the Incest Call Bella had covertly recorded and the Incest Texts Chris sent were leaked on 30 July 2021 (EST), the same day, Chris told Null that he had told only Bella and that he "trust her not to have directly or personally leaked or divulged this story to ANYONE else."[75]
Also on 30 July, Chris began to be suspicious that Bella had leaked the files and accused her of leaking. Bella and Fiona held a chat about the matter - Fiona said "I'm telling him the trolls leaked it" and Bella set up a group chat "to confirm it was the troll i set up".[76] According to Chris, Bella "came forward with her side of the story, and determined the culprit who leaked the details."[77]
On 31 July, Null pointed out the absurdity of Chris continuing to talk to Bella in spite of her recording resulting in a criminal charge pending for him and asked how Chris rationalized it, to which Chris replied that he was "spiritually guided and sound of mind."[78] However, Chris also texted The WCT and asked for his thoughts, and WCT concurred with Null that Chris shouldn't trust Bella. Chris then agreed that Bella's story was not credible.[77]
Several rumors about Bella were created and spread by the Mean Girls, a group led by Spooky Bones, based in part on conjecture and in part on Bella's edgy joke about planning to suicide Chris. Rumors include that Bella had been serious about a suicide plot or that she had been planning to record Chris and Fiona having sex at Everfree Northwest as part of a plot to blackmail Chris into suicide by claiming Fiona to be a minor. No proof has been found to support the rumors.[note 11] Despite this, Chris had repreated many of these rumors when fans brought them to his attention while he was in jail.
Backlash from Chris
“
Cause... yeah. But yeah. In that Bella was the real sex criminal in that. She really wanted [pounds desk] to try to get me into something, she's a real criminal. Fuckin' BIIITCH! Callin' her out. Call her out: Isabella Jenkin [sic], she's the real sex criminal, period. She did a whole mess of adulteration and manipulation and things in her own words and acts and insinuations and everything.

Chris projecting onto Bella for his own incest crime.[79]
Chris blaming Bella and Null for the Hippo on his head
Due to Bella's role in recording his statements when he had bragged about incest with his mother, which ultimately landed him in Central Virginia Regional Jail, Chris developed hatred for Bella. Compounding the matter, fans who wrote jail letters to Chris sent him misinformation from rumors which had been prevalent about Bella at the time.[38][46] Chris then promoted and spread the misinformation, while mixing in his own lies.
Chris's lies are noted below:
8 November 2021: Chris wrote in a jail letter that the incest leak had been a "Divine Test" for Bella which she was expected to fail at. He also claimed that he foreknew of Bella's want to "tempt" him to suicide.[80] The latter was based on a chat excerpt with Bella and her friend Allen, which Allen later claimed to have simply been an edgy joke.
30 November 2021: Chris wrote that karma will "bite Bella's ass around Judgement Day", and claimed to have "foreknown" of a "Nasty Plot" Bella would have instigated between himself and Fiona.[81] The latter is in reference to misinformation spread by gossipers that Bella had a plan to film Chris and Fiona having sex at Everfree Northwest and then blackmail Chris by telling him Fiona is a minor (in reality, Chris had asked Bella to be his photographer at Everfree, and she would have taken photos of him and Fiona during the convention - with no mention of recording sex; and the minor comment was based on a lie Bella had told to the Regarding Chris chat group in a brief attempt to protect Fiona, thinking it would dissuade any attempts to go after her. Chris himself was aware from Fiona that she was an adult).[82]
1 June 2022: Chris falsely claimed that he has foreseen Bella's plans long before June 2021, and that Bella had confessed to faking many of the details said in the call, such as that any sex between him and Barb had occurred at all, and that the call as a whole should therefore be rendered "moot".[83] Chris's claims may be loosely based on the fabricated BDSM texts Bella falsified, however Chris had verified the legitimacy of the call itself to Null.[84]
4 July 2022: Chris again spread misinformation that Bella was trying to get him to out himself as a "pedophile" by dating Fiona.[85]
13 July 2022: Chris wrote that Bella was being possessed by evil spirits, and that he was trying to save her from them.[86]
17 October 2023: Chris recorded a video, Setting the Record straight - there never was any sex involving me in 2021, in which he lied about his role in the Incest Call with Bella. He claimed that he was trying to "troll" Bella by deliberately faking his incestuous relationship with his mother. Chris also exploited many of the rumors gossipers created about Bella, as he accused her of being part of a conspiracy to abuse and manipulate him and repeated misinformation that Bella had intended to blackmail him with a sex tape between him and Fiona at Everfree.
17 May 2025: Chris talked to the ween Waltah White in an interview. In it, he claimed that Bella was fabricating evidence of his affair with his mother to send to the police. He also tried to claim that Bella was manipulating him into roleplaying as him saying those things.[87]

Notes
↑ For example, she has been known to claim to boil hamsters alive and created a video where she imitated slamming one across the floor while in a sock.
↑ Bella posted a Google Document onto the Chris subreddit, where she tried to deny information that has been gathered about her and her associations with other orbiters, contradicting what has already been verified or shifting blame on people she talked to. (Such as her involvement with Praetor, bragging to Fiona, and claiming that the WCT "threw her under the bus"). In that document, she'd also claim to stop talking to Chris from March 2021 to the late June of that year. However, in one of her Chess Club servers, she'd also tell Allen in a July 2021 post that she trolled Chris for "almost a year". Bella also once claimed in a chat with friends in one of the later Chess Club Discord Server that her name was not "Isabella Loretta Janke".
↑ For example, Bella claimed to one of her associates that she had defecated on the floor of her dormroom, only to then be called out by the same associate that she had used a stock image from reddit when asked to give proof of this, to which Bella responded to with "Yeah no shit retard".
↑ Compare Bella's messages in Chess Club versus Chess Group 15.
↑ After the incest call got leaked, Bella framed many of her associates as being the voice in the call, most infamously Fiona, whom she blamed for most of the events that have occurred prior.
↑ Used this name when trying to keep her anonimity, and assigned it to Fiona afterwards.
↑ After the post-incest leak drama began, Bella changed her an0nymous Discord username to NP2348
↑ Used in an attempt to imitate the gal-pal Kellie Andes
↑ Thought by some to be part-Latina on the basis of her appearance and some comments she has made, but this is contested.
↑ Bella attended college as of 2021
↑ Several other rumors about Bella can be found here
