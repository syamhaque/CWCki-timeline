Chris's recent failings have helped CWCki gather more information for this article. Be a winner by adding this information in.
This new information can be found from the following sources:

ThePCassassins were a group of weens who had a YouTube account which previously had hosted many videos of them calling and speaking to Bob. By March 2025, the channel had been inactive for many years, and most of the videos are privated, with only three remaining.
Screencap of the YouTube channel as of 2025. They also had an account on the CWCki which was indefinitely blocked for consistent vandalism.[1]
On 22 October 2025, it was noticed that the channel had been terminated. The exact date of termination is unknown.

During its peak
During the Classic Era, the channel hosted dozens of videos, some of which were up to an hour in length. The majority of these videos were recordings made by people calling Chris's house and speaking with Robert Chandler, Chris's father. Evidence of these videos can be found by using the WayBack Machine and from information gleamed from comments left on the videos.
Comment by ThePCAssassin's referencing a possible lost video once uploaded (Dear god please someone find this video if it exists).
The videos covered a wide range of topics, usually being long and rambling recordings of Bob reveling in the opportunity to talk to someone interested in his life. One individual associated with PCAssassins (Craig) states he was an engineering student, and reportedly had phone calls up to 2 hours long with Bob discussing university, engineering and general topics. The account also hosted several prank calls.
Call Bobby Chandler
Bob's got Cancer
Bob's got Cancer is a 2-minute video of two trolls named Craig and Amfermee calling Bob. The video was recorded and originally uploaded around the 24th of March 2011. It's unclear why the video shows an upload date of 2013, it may have been privated or otherwise edited in some way to alter the original upload date. Comment's on the video appear to indicate that when it was originally posted, the information that Bob had cancer was not yet known. It is also worth pointing out that the comments indicate Bob was still alive when they were posted, including multiple comments between ThePCAssassin's and Thorgnzorg which is unusual as the upload date listed (2013) is 2 years after Bob had died. The video is viewable on the WayBack Machine.[2]
In the video the two trolls contact Bob and strike up conversation with him, one of them has called before and remarks that he is an engineering student, much like Bob was, this is the same person as in Bob Call 6 and Bob Call 4. Bob's revelation that he has cancer is not significantly acknowledged, and Bob complains that trolls or jerkops have shipped him "400 pounds worth of magazines." Bob quickly ends the call, as he understandably can't be bothered humoring two trolls after receiving a cancer diagnosis.
Catch A Wild Snorlax Plus Update on Bob
Bob Chandler's call with The P Capsaicins / Bob Call 4
This is one of the videos deleted from the actual PCAssassins YouTube account, and exists now only as an archive on the YouTube account of "Albert Clukley". Originally posted in May 2011 under the title "Bob Call 4" it now exists as an archive with an incorrectly spelled title. (Amusingly, capsaicin is the scientific term for the extract used in pepper spray. ) It's a 15-minute recording of another conversation between Craig and Bob Chandler.
This chat occurred on 30 April 2011, and while it has been privated, it is still accessible on the Wayback Machine.[3] Bob amicably chats about his past jobs, and certain aspects about Chris and how he grew up, like how Chris taught himself how to read by watching television with closed-captioning turned on, and his skills in video games. One notable part about this call is that Bob claims Chris never made it on the honor roll.[4]
Get in touch with Bobby C
Bob Call 6
Bob Call 6 (technically "ThePCassassins - Bob Call 6 - What'll happen to Chris???????") is a 20-minute video of a conversation between Craig and Bob. In it, Bob discusses a lot of topics, notably claiming that Chris learned to read and write through reading the closed captioning on his television set.
He also claims that Chris is being discriminated against by employers for being autistic, and calls Megan Schroeder a "little low life in the gutter bitch." The full call is viewable on the WayBack Machine.[5]
Individuals associated
There are 3 individuals directly associated with ThePCAssassins.
Craig
Craig is the most notable member of ThePCAssassins, he leads the conversation in Bob's got Cancer and is the one who called Bob in Bob Call 6 as well as
Bob Call 4. He is enthusiastic when speaking to Bob and is apparently an engineering student, in Bob Call 6 he states he was "following in Bob's footsteps" (with regards to his engineering degree).
Craig is most likely the person who is managing ThePCAssassins YouTube account, as a majority of the comments are written in a first-person perspective from Craig's point of view.
Craig called bob on at least 3 other confirmed occasions, at one point he reports having a "2 hour" conversation with Bob about engineering studies. This video is currently lost. Portions of Bob Call 6 may be part of this extended call, as Rufus mentions in the introduction that the recording was much longer than the final cut.
Amfermee Sanchez
Amfermee is the second caller in Bob's got Cancer, and is not present in Bob Call 6 or any further calls.
Rufus
Rufus is a narrator who dubbed the intro to Bob Call 6. Interestingly, Rufus is not present during the actual phone call between Bob and Craig. Rufus is also not present during the recording of Bob's got Cancer. His only role in the series (until more videos are unearthed) is to introduce Bob Call 6, and explain the contents of the video, as well as some of the content that they had to cut out.
Rufus actually called Bob himself on at least one occasion where he posed as a police officer and claimed that Chris was soliciting sex outside the Game and Hobby Place. However this video has been lost.
