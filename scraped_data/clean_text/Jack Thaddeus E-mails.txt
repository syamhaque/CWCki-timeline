Subject: Silence Fool
Dismiss your Foolery, and State your Business.
I want a duel. What do you say to a showdown?
Subject: Be more specific; details.
Subject: In fact,
Why don't you come down to my house yourself in person, unless you are the cowardly weakling?
Subject: Duel!
You're the one who wants the PSN pass back, Why should I come to YOU when I have all the chips on the table?
Isn't The Hero Suppose To Come And Face The Villain To Rescue The Princess?
These are my terms, I am a Virgin myself and I could guarantee that I will lose my virginity within the week. If you have sex within the week, you are the victor of the gentlemen's duel. You must take a picture of yourself with the naked "lucky" woman to be nude.
Although Jack claims to be a virgin here, he later claimed to be married with a daughter. Chris didn't seem to notice this discrepancy.
If I have sex within this week, and take a picture of me and her, you will give me back my accounts; I've noticed you've stepped it up a notch and stole my secondary USA account; I want that account back as well.
Pictures can be photoshoped I want a video of you losing your virginity to the "lucky" lady. If you do this I will give you the accounts back plus a 50 dollar bonus for each account.
Subject: Final Condition.
You remember that picture you drew of Megan with your thumb up while fingering her? Of course you do!
When you have sex I want you to reinact that scene with you holding your thumb up while fingering.
Fair enough; where would you like me to upload the video?
Redtube.com
And it has to be a REAL WOMAN not a DOLL or an ANIMAL..
are the terms clear?
Fair enough. But still, where should I upload the video after filming?
While you upload it to redtube please upload the video to mediafire.com
Thank you for agreeing to a gentlemen's duel.
Subject: Yes.
The terms are clear, and the challenge is accepted.
