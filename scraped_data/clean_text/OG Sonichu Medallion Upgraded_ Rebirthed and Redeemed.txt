Chris's brand new medallion, the Mark IV.
OG Sonichu Medallion Upgraded, Rebirthed and Redeemed is a video uploaded to Chris's YouTube channel on 18 September 2025. In it, Chris takes apart his Mark III medallion with his bare hands, cracking the moldy crusty clay into bits. He takes the destroyed pieces of the medallion and infuses it into his brand new one, which he bakes into the clay as seen at the end of the video. According to Chris, this is the "rebirth" of his medallion, since he mixed the old pieces inside it.

Description
As all of you can see and appreciate: I, Jesus Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu, Prime of every single Chris Chan and Christ Chan throughout the Multiverse, have broken up my original, Model-Magic crafted Sonichu Medallion, put the cruciald and some of the other, pieces into clay, and remade my Medallion, renewed, rebirth and redeemed. It was hard on me to break it up, but it was my pleasure to renew and redeem it with my newer energy and stronger powers and abilities.

0:00-0:23: [The TV is playing Invader Zim in the background. The medallion is sitting on its face on Chris's desk, Chris picks it up and flips it around then places it back on the table facing upwards before the video cuts. His fingernails are painted purple.]
LITERALLY SHATTERED
0:23-1:38: [Chris picks up the medallion again and snaps off its right ear, making a cracking sound and revealing a wire. He then cracks the left ear and pulls it off of its wire. He then uses his hands to snap the medallion from the middle, painfully cracking its face in half and revealing the brown insides. Chris then snaps more off of the right side of its face from the remaining ear. Chris then uses a tool to dissemble the quartz out of the megastone on the backside of the medallion, causing it to fly off. He picks it up and shows off the clear sphere to the camera. He continues snapping the face in half, peeling some of the left side off.]
Wow. [murmuring] Yep, definitely need [sigh] to change up the face. Just... wow. [Chris continues to break open the brown insides of the destroyed face while murmuring quietly.] But yeah, this thing just- [Chris pulls out the ring that's used for the string with ease.] woah. Yep, that's- well, as you suggested, I'm doing it- [video cuts]
[Chris starts to take out accessories that were in the medallion.] We have uncovered the shrinky-dink. [annoyed sigh] It's okay, the pieces will be reserved in the updated one. It's another-nother piece of metal. [video cuts]
[Chris is now using a knife to carve out an accessory, he then peels it out and struggles to have the camera focus on it for a moment before the video cuts.]
[Chris uses a knife to carve out another accessory, he then picks it out and the video cuts.]
[Chris puts the destroyed pieces into a pile, then pushes a tray with a mold over towards it.] [murmuring] piece in there... [He picks up the destroyed pieces and puts bits into the mold with the wire outline.] [murmuring] this eye... um, I think- yeah, let's do that... Here it is. [knocks into the camera] Let's see [???]... let's go with that. I'm just going to need to dig this... out as well... Yep. Okay... [murmuring] put a piece in there, okay- [video cuts]
[Chris dabs up the dusty remains and remaining bits with clay, getting it mixed inside as he molds more of the clay together. The video cuts.]
[Chris pushes and spreads the mixed clay into the mold. He murmurs something really quietly. He then picks up an unmixed piece of clay and presses it into the mold to create another layer. The video cuts.]
[Chris is standing in front of an oven. In the reflection of the oven, he appears to be wearing slippers that resemble the red shoes worn by Sonic the Hedgehog. He opens the oven and takes out the tin foil containing the baked medallion, placing it onto the counter. He picks up the unpainted medallion and shows it off, then the video cuts.]
[Chris is standing in his green screen room, the camera pointed towards himself, as he's now wearing the painted medallion (implying this is many hours or even days later). He shows it off by pointing at it, then flipping it around, then tapping it twice, then nodding.] This is the one! That's the OG mixed in. Rebirthed. [video cuts]
[Chris is still in the same place.] All pieces fallen in and fully redeemed.

The commenter had Adolf Hitler as their profile picture.[1] It is possible Chris just didn't notice this (given how it could be hard to tell from afar).
