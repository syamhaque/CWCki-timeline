The "New Associates"
Chris (as Sonichu) 12:58 PM
Hello, @everyone.
SonichuSmile[1]
And a good morning to some of you all this fine day.
This is a big day, indeed.
Anaxis (Lainchu) 12:59 PM
Good afternoon
Or morning, I suppose
[REDACTED 1] 12:59 PM
Big day, eh?
What is the reason for this day, specifically being a big day?
Chris (as Sonichu) 12:59 PM
Gonna have lunch with our new associates to talk about the molding to mass produce the medallions, and possibly the figures, with optional Amiibo functions, in a little while.
And tonight is going to be genuinely, massively interdimensional.
It is after noon, here on the East Coast.
Anaxis (Lainchu) 01:00 PM
Ah, remind me, which associates are these?
Chris (as Sonichu) 01:00 PM
And presently, Central time as well.
Ah, right, I only told @ภคยﻮђՇ.
The other day, a trio of fans came by for a visit, with a present:
Kyle 01:01 PM
Who's handling fulfillment?
Chris (as Sonichu) 01:01 PM
Anaxis (Lainchu) 01:02 PM
Oh, very shiny!
Chris (as Sonichu) 01:02 PM
Lovingly crafted by the young lady of the group, with paint that had a mixture of 24K gold in it.
Kyle 01:02 PM
Could experiment with detailing, like the muzzle?
[1 SonichuLOL[2] reaction, likely from Chris.]
Ya, those gold paints are common, you rarely need much gold in anything these days.
Chris (as Sonichu) 01:03 PM
And the tall boys had the business proposition: the artist has a mold press, and they are capable of mass-producing the good ol’ medallion.
Kyle 01:04 PM
What's the split like?
Chris (as Sonichu) 01:04 PM
I tell you all this in strict confidence, so do not go public with these details, please, Lainchu and @everyone.
Those details will be discussed today as well.
Anaxis (Lainchu) 01:04 PM
Of course
[REDACTED 2] 01:04 PM
I promise not to
Chris (as Sonichu) 01:05 PM
They have their business based in Goochland.
And I could tell by soul-reading them that their intentions were legit, honest and true.
Also, matches the past vision we had of the very moment.
Kyle 01:06 PM
What kind of press is it like, I mean, someone with a decent understanding of woodworking can make something that would work, I've got more experience with glass blowing than casting.
Chris (as Sonichu) 01:07 PM
I will ask about that as well today.
[REDACTED 2] 01:07 PM
By vision, are you referring to a dream vision?
Kyle 01:08 PM
Because just making a wood mold, filling, popping it out and patching should be something that can be done entirely manually.
Chris (as Sonichu) 01:08 PM
Yes, as well as psychic visions and foresight.
Mama had foreseen it, as well as Magi-Chan.
Kyle 01:08 PM
Actually, you can make clay molds in the oven, just with a master, that works for the materials used.
Chris (as Sonichu) 01:09 PM
Mama had wished for the right artist to come along to make the medallions on her behalf, and this vision came to her in an instant as well.
I’ll fill y’all in on the further details in strict confidence later.
But, more importantly, is tonight.
Kyle 01:10 PM
Considered ever trying alternate materials? Can get a superior product at a much lower materials cost.
Chris (as Sonichu) 01:10 PM
@everyone, be on your guard for the big event that is to come.
The thought had run through Mama’s mind some time ago, as an alternative to model magic and traditional clay, but she had to work with what was best for her present skill set.
Not to mention she wasn’t confident using an oven in lieu of a kiln.
Kyle 01:13 PM
Might require a bit of detailing, but you can wet cast clay in a clay mold.
Hydrophobics, that would do it.
And there are several clays that can cure in just a basic oven.
Chris (as Sonichu) 01:13 PM
That has been taught over the years in her various art classes in her school years.
MKR 01:14 PM
Sculpy is a good option
Chris (as Sonichu) 01:14 PM
I’ll check y’all later.
MKR 01:14 PM
Oki
Anaxis (Lainchu) 01:14 PM
See you later
MKR 01:14 PM
Bye bye
Kyle 01:14 PM
Instamold is fun, saw someone replace a tooth with it, because bad ideas.
@Sonichu982 Just going to say, try making one 100% perfect master, you can do clay ones at home, or just as a basis in general.
Kyle 01:27 PM
Usual, make sure there's low water content, something small shouldn't take too long to cure and you can get a batch done in an hour or so.
