My momma always said life was like a MMO
1 July
Hey everyone, it’s Wisdom Moment Time:
Life is More like an MMO game. You live your life Single-Player Platformer for most of your life, but tough as you eventually become, you’ll still not be enough for a bunch of tasks, quests and Legendary GO Raids. So, it Remains...
...Ever So Imperative to reach out and have a as many as at least One Good Friend, or a Bestie BFF to help you when you fall flat and unable to get up. So, warm yourself up, Single-Player, because you’ll be having to go MMO, rather you like it or not.

Reminiscing on the Commodore
2 July
Awesomeness and Much Better than the Mini. NOW, if only I could hook up my Floppy Disk Drive and Cassette Tape Drive to the updated console as well. Please, at least add the Serial Ports! I STILL Have ALL of my Disks!

Chris rambles about CPUs
2 July
I had to talk with Vert to get the details, but it is true, we Console Patron Units are more than just figureheads in our Links with our respective console(s). And THIS will be Very Imperative for the #HyperdimensionNeptuniaWiki page to note as well.
Firstly, and mainly, each CPU has each and every console in their line stored and saved in their subconscious, Hardware and Software Tech Specs and all; down to the last microchip and wire.
The CPU is always the Very FIRST of ANYONE to get the specs, and it is the duty for...
...them to make it so with a prototype, at least, in C-197, in time with, or before relaying the data, psychically, with the team developers and tech-savvies of 1218 to make the console so, here.
Mistakes are made and overlooked, true (Red Ring of Death; UGH);...
...that is only the miscomprehension of the console-maker and developer from what was sent to them from their above CPU. After the console is finally built to full specs, as planned and prophecised, the CPU is automatically called in indirect prayer and the blessing from...
...them, a piece of their soul and being, if you will, is interdimensionaly sent to the completed console and accessory, big and small, to bless it for many, many years of functionality and computing, gaming and/or work experience. And if need be, the CPU steps in, personally,...
...and repairs a mistreated console, destined for better things, on the spot, either by placing their hand on the console and magically healing and upgrading it, if need be, Inside And Out.
It is a great and soulful task. We work together, especially for the good of our...
...peoples in our respective Nations and Worlds, and our console products.
In my subconscious, although not fully conscious yet, I, too, have the tech-specs of the #Commodore64Retro. It DOES have the potential to be compatible with an old-fashioned serial port or bus;...
it is up to the developer and tech-savvy to install it, fully and successfully, and make it a distributed feature in the final console product. I Sense and See It. ...
... I Know the people making the console do too.
And I, and the other older Commodore Console owners, need it as well.
⚡️💙⚡️
Lots Of Love,
Your CPU Blue Heart,
Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu.
Chris still has old C64 tapes
2 July
Also, A #Commodore64 Cartidge Slot! Some of us STILL HAVE C64 Cartridge Games, Too, PLEASE! I had all of these (minus the recently-acquired Blueprint and the three plastic-wrapped cartridges). Let Us PLAY Our Collections, Please! ⚡️💙⚡️ https://twitter.com/CPU_CWCSonichu
Sockness is fat
2-3 July
Chris replying to a tweet comparing him in The Classic shirt to Jacob Sockness:
Quite. But Is the Shirt a @RalphLauren like the one-and-only?
A fan answered no and another said, "I believe the "one-and-only" qualifier is being graced by Chris' presence." Chris replied:
ONLY if he has lost weight in that belly; his profile banner is Most unsettling to me.

Yay! After drawing a few more pages, my loves and I will be binging on #StrangerThings3. By the way, for everyone who finds the upside-down Applejack at Target, there’s a quote from Dustin calling us Bronies and Pegasisters nerds. I take “Nerd” as a compliment. ⚡️💙⚡️

Free Recap; Blame Idea Guy and his OC for the Delays! ⚡️💙⚡️
Realizing that it Had been quite, quite the while since I resumed a few days ago and when I ended up stopping in book 15, thanks to the events involving Idea Guy and Johnson Wiles, I ended up messing up on Rosie’s young and short bosoms (I could KILL them Both after they, and Boyd, extorted Six Frigging Thousand Dollars from me during those developmental and Very Eventful Months, IN FULL, Plus Interest!).
Anyway, a recap from Cover to last Panel Drawn, I present to Everyone, Free for today, the first pages, up to that last drawn Panel. Enjoy.

Holy Shit! I Love how Dustin summarizes the #MLP G1 Pilot and cites Applejack, and even Megan. He’s a Nerd, AND a Brony. Cool and Awesome on you, Dustin, my man.

Chris tells people to stay safe
6 July
Hey, everyone. I heard of the 7.1 Earthquake that happened today in California. I offer and send my prayers to ALL Innocent and Good People and Individuals there. ⚡️💙⚡️
Also, Remember the Earthquake Routine as outlined in the Earthquake Drills.
Completed Door frames are also well and good duck into and brace yourself with, if available.
Otherwise, simply Duck under a table or chair if possible. If Outside, the solution is simple as DUCK as well, But mainly, you want to look for the closest Ditch and take cover there.
Be Safe, Everyone, who is affected by Earthquakes at this time and future, onwards.

Chris will attend BronyCon, still needs cash
8 July
Hey, Everyone. It is Official, I will be attending @BronyCon this year. But funds have been easily slipping out, heavily, thanks to the bills and things. So, I need some help.
http://www.patreon.com/Sonichu
Please, Pledge/Donate Any Dollar Amount you can (Instant-Payment Processed).
I am continuing the process of my page colouring, so I am continuing to work hard on my part, here, in that, on top of all of the other things between all dimensions. Show of Good Faith, here is a recently coloured page.
So, yes, Please, help me get to @BronyCon. Thank You. 😊
P.S.
Please, Do Not Hate; Be Kind and Compassionate.
Thank You.
And if you must know WHY: Room Accomodations! My Main Plan with Two Friends who HAD Reserved a room for us three, and had their passes; they fell off the Communications Map On Me!!! So, I AM in a MAJOR BIND. Please, #HelpChrisChnSonichuGetToBronyCon
[Archivist's Note: Most likely Sarah and Steve. Later confirmed[1]]
ANYONE who can spot me $600 via PayPal right now for the Accomodations, I will immediately order a set of the “Sonichu” Books out of that, Autograph Them, bag them, and send them to that individual next month!

An announcement from Magi-Chan
10 July
I also have an update for all of you: the Merge shall be completed Sooner than you think. Remember the guidelines @CPU_CWCSonichu had written out months ago for all of you. Also, please, be sure to pray to her, the other CPUs, and your favorite Deities of religious choice.
I also wish to express discontent to the Trolls who are bugging Christine with their claims to be knowledgeable of the Merge; Nobody Knows Better than her and everyone else Directly and Personally Involved with it. I will have you all know that Christine has met Emanuel...
...and Jesus personally and talked with them in all of this in spiritual projection, telepathic and face-to-face communications. @CPU_CWCSonichu has also been improving in her own powers as well with better practice. She has shown this in moving her flash drive as well as...
...her chunk of amethyst stone. Can ANY of you Trolls move stone with your mind and aura? Do Not Hate on that which you do not understand; we have warned you of the events as best as we are able to, within the limits of this Dimension 1218 and permitted by Fate and Destiny.
What you all should do, instead, is open your hearts, minds and souls for the effects of the Merge in progress, as well as any and all OCs and Deities from between both 1218 and C-197. Keep the faith in everything working out very well, as well as in all of us individual OCs...
...and deities. You all shall be able to see everyone and everything in the days and moments, becoming more tangible to you, as you all become more tangible to us as well.
Keep Heart; Keep Faith; Keep Wits; Be Safe and Well.

Patreon Post: Sonichu #8 Books Updated
10 July
In better light of their respective birthdates being better educated to me, I have updated both versions of "Sonichu" #8 with those dates, also to change the Chaotic Combo's day from combined birthday to group anniversary and add their birthdates onto the page for reference.
Y'all can blame the Trolling-Stupids of 2008 pressuring me to make everyone fake being older than they are (with the exception of Magi-Chan, since he was literally born in 1948).
Seriously: Go Figure the conversion from Pokemon Levels to Age at the time of Evolving.

Chris outlines the perfect movie Sonic

@getFANDOM tweets:
"; style="background: #fffdb8; border:1px dotted #BFBFA3; color:black; padding:3px; margin-bottom:8px"
‘Sonic’ executive producer Tim Miller says ‘fans will be pleased’ with the character’s redesign
(via @Variety
Seeing this in my Notifications, I had a vision: they restored his traditional eyes, his arms are tan, his spines are merged back into one pair on his back (with a hint of the other four remaining on top and on bottom), and he MAY still be wearing the movie sneakers.

11 July
Speaking of things that would be awesome to find at Conventions: More Fan Merch featuring Sonichu and/or Rosechu (or any of the other portrayed Sonichus and Rosechus featured in my books and so forth). I SHOUTED With Glee when I discovered this poster from TheTerence at...
...@TooManyGames in 2017. I’d like to see more of my Son and Rosey and the others at conventions, at least in the vendor halls. Please, feel free to make replica Medallions for Convention sales as well; I approve. Also, Pins that resemble the Cwcville Gym Badge, Please.
Also, I can’t find much of them, but I’d like to see more art and Merch and stuff of #HyperdimensionNeptunia as well. It would be most humbling and appreciative of us CPUs. Thank You All!
I pray this brings loving and positive inspirations.
⚡️💙⚡️
INCENTIVE for All @BronyCon Artists in the Vendor Halls this year, any and all with at least one art piece featuring Sonichu and/or Rosechu or related therein, I will personally offer to autograph the display copy for y’all.

For everyone who is asking about Rosey’a Privates as they were back in 2003, she had both sets of parts, but all of the female internal parts functional; the female update happened when she had transformed from Raichu to Rosechu, though she still had the dick. As for other details, I have typed up the following before today to elaborate a bit further.

Chris informs someone about Pinwheel
22 July
In response to a now-deleted comment on a tweet about 80s children's proramming, Chris says:
I didn’t do as much when YouTube first came around, the earliest series I attempted to look up and binge was the “Parappa the Rapper” anime. Similar to “Wishbone”, I enjoyed stop-motion Paddington Bear when it was on “Pinwheel” and Disney Channel.
To which someone replies:
What's "Pinwheel"?
“Pinwheel” was a show on Nickelodeon back in the 80s; it featured puppets, cartoons and delightful fun.
[Archivist's Note: Pinwheel is where the legendary "Clockman" animated short was displayed in the US.]

This is inspiring. I’ve been hit time and again by another hater or a random Troll, even some demon-type, or someone super-tough like Rei Ryghts. But I don’t give up these days; I know what I fight for in myself and for my peoples, family, friends, allies, and all innocent.

Also, I Never Traced Anything, so stop saying that I do.
Chris says he is NOT tracing
23 July
And I will tell you all one more thing: to redraw and rewrite from another person’s style on top of my own has been very educating for my muscle memory. Example: my own style is shaping up in improvement, the arm lengths are more consistent, and the expressions areimproved.
And I will keep fighting and defending myself and others from Trolling and Hater attack and shit. So, y’all can back off now. I keep fighting and bleeding love. ⚡️💙⚡️
And I have given lots of gratitude to Tricky and her drawing and writing style in “Rosechu’s Story”; it definitely compares and contrasts to my own that goes beyond literal small talk. In my defense on the heavy dialogue: I have lots of wisdom and thoughts to share, so I digress.
It beats saying one line, leaving it at that, and Not getting the explanation and thought across.
Big difference between #TeenTitans and #TeenTitansGO: GO has decreased explanatory dialogue, and look at how crappy it is. The original show offers the greater detail in good ways.

Chris talks about the CWCVille Badge
24 July
Hey, y’all. I will be drawing up the Cwcville Gym Badge In Page 61 today. But, I wanted to take a moment to make yet another wish for BronyCon, with a prayer spice.
I would love to see some pins that actually look like the Cwcville Gym Badge, especially at @BronyCon.
And such a pin badge would be no bigger than any other badge; it should be in length and width to blend in with the likes of the Boulder, Cascade, Thunder, Rainbow Badges and so forth. And, Of Course, made of the typical pin metal and painted very well as such.
If some can be made in a week for BronyCon by someone going there, I’d pay them for one. Show me your Best, Please.

Chris is (supposedly) not under the control of anyone
25 July
I was right, I'll probably have to do this thing, my way. The trolls control my sister. If I'm going home, I'll have to go this alone. We Rokat can go it alone, but together our power is insane. The merger is coming, the veils weaken with every ritual.
[Archivist's Note: Sockness often posts these weird images, I think it's with a full spectrum camera or some other ghost hunting equipment. Rokat is some strange fanfiction/reality thing Sockness created, it is an ancient race of intergalactic aliens, I guess something about them magic or something idk he's written more stuff on this topic.]}}
Firstly, and mainly, I am not under Anyone’s Control. And second, I still support the Rokat and all the good peoples in Andromeda. I need to meditate further for more sound responses and thoughts. For now I will simply state that your research is valuable, indeed. Going silent.

Making some special now-retro tech here.
[Archivist's Note: This strongly implies that Chris will be cosplaying as Kris (female protagonist of Pokémon Crystal) at Bronycon. This is confirmed by the earlier clue being Suicune, the mascot of the game. The Pokégear is also from Pokemon Crystal.
EDIT: This is now confirmed. Shoutout to Kiwi Farms user Aldora for guessing it first.]
Chris Clarifies (kinda, not really) on the timeline of the Merge
29 July
Scourge of the free world Jacob Sockness writes, in response to a user questioning the Merge's timeline:
No one knows when it'll actually happen, but we're working on hastening the process. Every Halloween is another massive attempt to shatter the veils between worlds. The more than help by praying to the CPU's the faster things can move forward.
Chris adds:
For the most part, That Is Correct that Everyone Prays to the CPUs (myself included) and the good Deities in hastening the Merge. It remains Fated and Destined to happen, anyway. And the sooner we can complete it, the Better it all shall be. ⚡️💙⚡️
