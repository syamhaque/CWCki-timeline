“
I am passionate about helping people tap into their True Selves and discover the gift of their intuition.
Our intuition is our greatest asset in life.
It lets us know when we are in alignment with what is best for us, and when we need to move in a different direction.
It always has our best interest in mind.
It is my honor to provide guidance and tools to deepen your connection to the most authentic part of you.
”

Even Molly the Medium has been spot on from her end as well.

Molly the Medium (born October 1993)[3] is a YouTube psychic and spiritual medium.
It was first noticed on 22 February 2021 that Chris had followed Molly's account on Patreon.
By 23 March, he had become a subscriber.[4]
Chris's following of Molly led to him taking a sudden intense interest in tarot card reading, and he began regularly posting about it on social media throughout June and July 2021.

Chris's interactions with Molly
On 21 March 2021, Chris liked two posts titled "The 3 Claires" and "Message From My Guides To You" on Molly's Patreon.[5]
On 29 March 2021, Chris messaged Naught about getting a tarot reading from Molly a few weeks prior, stating that she was "genuine and would be of big help to our cause, and in confirming the details to my body's consciousness."
Following this reading, Chris wrote out his Affirmations List and Lovers Attributes List.[6]
On 30 April 2021, Chris posted to the Golden Church of Sonichu Discord server stating that he and Magi-Chan would be attending an event hosted by Molly.[7] Exactly what transpired at this event is not known.
On 1 August 2021, the morning of the day Chris was arrested for incest, he sent an image of Molly's weekly tarot reading to The WCT.[1]
In his thirteenth letter from jail, Chris briefly mentioned Molly, suggesting her as one of several people who could be relied upon to confirm the veracity of his delusional ramblings.
