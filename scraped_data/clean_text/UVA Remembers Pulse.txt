UVA Remembers Pulse was an event held by University of Virginia students in June 2017 to pay tribute to the victims of the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting.
Despite not being a student himself, Chris attended, bringing with him Sonichu paraphernalia: the Medallion, a SLGBTQ Sonichu drawing, the cover page for Sonichu 12, a framed photoshop drawing of Chris and his parents mingling with Sonichu characters, and a short written piece which he read during the open mic.

News interview
He was interviewed by the local NBC station, which quoted him in an article and on video.[1] Incidentally, this is the same station that interviewed him about the Sonic the Hedgehog Watch & Win Sweepstakes.
"Do not hate. Hate is not so good and to be paranoid is a bust. Feel love that comes from us and try to feel love that you can offer at least from within yourselves, for yourselves", Christine Chandler, who attended, said.

Chris, on the other hand, decided to write a piece on his transgender identity.[3]
Chris read this aloud to the crowd.
I feel for y’all, my friends, family & allies in this lifetime of ours. Lost and confused is this point of our lives where we are meant to be; where DO we belong in our local communities; with minds gone blank like a fully erased paper? We are left with the remants of what we had thought of, before impulsively lost in time. I, too, was there during the times y’all were bullied, broken, and beat up bad. The times we’ve sought for new friendships to later, maybe, find truest love from one within. And, yet our efforts were mistaken for something sordid. The love, or lack thereof, from those who raised and taught you as y’all grew up. Left with time for ourselves, we’ve searched within our own personal depths. Soon enough, we not only have found ourselves, but we three, Child, Teen, & Adult, combined, worked out our ideas, taking our time; we continues onward in our life from how we were born, towards who we are meant to be this whole lifetime. I will continue onward, the stronger soul; woman that We ARE, for being boy was a lingering downfall. Someday, I will find our destined Sweetheart & Truest Love, while feeling the Love from within; from Child, from Teen, from Me.
The stuff he brought with him.
