================================================================================

Ian owns at least one how-to-draw book, but aggressively ignores its instructions.
My Half of A Whole New World for Kacey is a video uploaded on 31 October 2009 where, in a vain assumption that Kacey's video was directed at him and not at the real Chris, Ian Brandon Anderson attempts to sing the male part of the song "A Whole New World", from Disney's Aladdin. Like his other attempts at singing, the original vocal track is heard underneath his off-key warbling. Ian also leaves in Jasmine's parts in the song, which, given his previous try at singing female parts, has no excuse.
The poorly-framed image of the animu girl is from How to Draw Manga, Volume 28: Couples. It's unknown at this time what Ian stole from this particular book. A point of interest is the framing of the cover of the book, in which Ian has gone to great lengths to cut the male character from the view of his camera. Also of note is that the book contains instructions for all kinds of couples.
The original version of the song was also played in the background on Greetings to Kacey's folks video uploaded shortly afterward on the same day.
The TRUE and HONEST Christian Weston Chandler soon uploaded his own performance of this song, as well.

Original video from Kacey
“
Baby I thought of you as soon as I heard this song again! I want us to sing a duet, can you?? I left out some of the male speaking parts, this song really needs a duet. Sorry I went flat and too high in some places!
I adore you so much. Sing this for me and with me and solidify who I'm with! I know you can do it, my one and only!
Always yours,
Kacey

I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me princess, now when did you last
Let your heart decide
[The script Ian is holding and reading from becomes visible]
I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride
A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming
[ Kacey Jasmine is heard in background due to the fact he did not choose the instrumental track]
[Jasmine] A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world
With you
[Ian joins back in] Now I'm in a whole new world with you
[Jasmine part again]
Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, free-wheeling
Through an endless diamond sky
A whole new world
[Ian] Don't you dare close your eyes
[Jasmine] A hundred thousand things to see
[Ian] Hold your breath it gets better
[Jasmine] I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be
[Ian] A whole new world
Repeat verse 2
[Together] I'll chase them everywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this
Whole new world with you
[Ian] A whole new world
[Jasmine] A whole new world
[Ian] That's where we'll be
[Jasmine] That's where we'll be
[Ian] A thrilling chase
[Jasmine] A wondrous place
[Together] For you and me
[Ian's shadow is seen giving a thumbs up.]

How to Draw Manga: Couples
According to Amazon.com reviews, this volume contains instructions for drawing same-sex couples, as well as erotica. That's right. Although this book was probably bought long ago in a futile attempt to impress fellow weeaboo and gal pal Megan Schroeder, internet-famous homophobe IBAChandler owns a book full of naked anime men having sex with each other.
