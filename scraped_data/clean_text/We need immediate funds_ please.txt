We need immediate funds, please is Barb's seventh appearance during the Financhu Crisis. In this video, Barb is wearing two expensive necklaces, including the $400 gold necklace, while staring into space, using all of her strength and energy to form a sentence for the camera. Two weeks earlier , Chris made a video claiming she needed meal replacement shakes, and Barb claimed they needed money for food. The fact that she asked for food twice within such a small time period suggests that the Chandler's financial situation is worsening.
