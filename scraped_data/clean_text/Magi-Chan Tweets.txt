Two separate tweets were posted, location stamped as being from New Zealand.
Everybody, my new family of kitties is Very Sick. They all have conjunctivitis and need Immediate Medical Attention; I CANNOT pay for this on my own! I am scared they will NOT SURVIVE until the merger! Please open your hearts and help these poor babies and their mother! #1218C197
I have Most Horrible news. I was downstairs playing Hyperdimension Neptunia VIIR and heard my mother screaming with commotion from the dogs.
Snoopy got a kitten.
By the time I get him away this was the result. I will bury him tomorrow when I am not tired and level headed.

The tweets were quickly deleted, probably once the poster realized that their location had been included in the Tweets. The cat corpse image was traced as originating from an article on special effects in horror movies.[1]
Location stamped as being from New Zealand.
A Kiwi Farms user claimed it was also location-stamped as New Zealand.[2]
