The Rev. Rochelle "Rocky" Shoemaker is a retired, uncertified pastoral counselor (actual title - "Assistant Pastor for Care Ministries"; born 15 June 1948[2][3]) from the Wesley Memorial United Methodist Church, who has advised Chris on several matters since 2008.
According to Chris, Rocky was in her 40s during 2010, and has a son that works for Rockstar Games.[4]
History
On 11 September 2008, after nudes of his were leaked to the internet by a troll who deceived him, Chris sent to his Reverend Elizabeth Foss an email in which he told her about his foolish acts and asked her to forgive him. Five days later, Elizabeth replied and referred Chris to the church's new pastoral counselor, Rocky Shoemaker,[5] beginning her role in Chris's life.
In the BlueSpike Skype Logs 6, Chris mentioned that he asked Rocky to help him find volunteer work that would pay him, and also wouldn't cause him to lose his Social Security.
Rocky recommended to Chris the children's book How to Talk to Girls after he asked for help on the Love Quest.[6]
In March 2009, Rocky started interacting with Chris more. She encouraged him to leave the internet and stop making videos, leading to the video YouTube Finale.[7]
Joshua Martinez, a.k.a. Vanessa Hudgens, tried to swindle some money out of Chris by trading him a PSP. After that, Rocky made Bob and Barb contact the cops. The agreement was that the cops would only be involved in the Joshua matters, as they were dealing with the trolls on their own terms. However, Rocky blindsided Bob and Barb and brought up Ivy and other trolls with the cops. She even had them try to find Ivy and even managed to get a background check on her and came up with nothing.[7]
In a July 2009 IRC Chat, Chris, believing that he had entered the chat incognito (although the trolls had in fact instantly seen through his false identity), suggested that the trolls force him to rape Rocky. Rocky herself is aware that Chris said this. The fact that she did not kick him out of the church on the spot speaks volumes about her patience.
According to Chris, it was Rocky and her husband who bailed the Chandlers out of jail following the events of 28 October 2011.[8] Rocky also helped put the Chandlers in touch with their defense attorney, Mr. Rob Bell, a fellow Methodist.
In December 2011, a troll posing as court-appointed psychiatrist "Dr. Perron" called Rocky asking for information on Chris. While she initially was skeptical, repeatedly saying that she wanted authorization from the court, she eventually became convinced and gave new information about Chris.[9] This included the supposed infestation problem in 14 Branchland Court that played a part in Bob's death.
According to Marvin, Rocky was the cameraperson in CWC Lego Manchester High School Oct 18 2013.
Rocky Shoemaker with Chris in 2018, during a meeting the Guard Dogs had arranged.
In May 2018, in the aftermath of the Idea Guys saga, the Guard Dogs advised Chris to talk to Rocky about the situation, hoping she would escort Chris to the local police to report
alleged extortion by the Idea Guys. Null emailed her a copy of the report he had written to send to the FBI, and The Captain spoke with her over the phone to discuss further. The Captain mentioned that Rocky was concerned about the matter. On 9 May, the day of the meeting, Chris decided to delay it by stopping at the post office first. Rocky recommended Chris go to Region Ten, an organization helping people with mental health issues, thinking that staff there would help him file the complaint. The person Chris used to talk to was on maternity leave at the time, and Chris didn't want to speak with anyone else.[10]
Rocky retired from the church in summer 2018.[11]
On 5 August 2018, Chris watched Rekieta Law's video on the Idea Guys. The video included a recap of a thread written by Null, The Chris-Chan Extortionists, which had included a vulgar tirade against Rocky and Anna McLerran. Chris tweeted in defense of the two, stating that the accusations against Rocky and Anna were false, that both did not refuse to help report the Idea Guys to law enforcement, and that they had both been unable to do much with the police. Chris also took offense at Null's vulgarity, writing that "to tell them to “F” themselves is Simply Just Wrong." Chris asked for an apology to the two. Throughout his tweets, Chris avoided referencing Null by name, instead referring to him as the post-writer.[12] In response to Chris's defense of Anna, both Null and The Captain pressured Chris into backing down by threatening to pull their support. Chris deleted the portions of the tweets about Rocky and Anna.[13]
According to part 5 of The Chris Chan Conspiracy, Rocky visited Chris while he was held in Central Virginia Regional Jail on his August 2021 incest charge. On 14 March 2025, when asked if he has talked to her, Chris replied "No, I haven't talked with Rocky a long time. I'm certain she's doing okay."[14] The two statements do not necessarily contradict each other: by March 2025, Chris had been out of Central Virginia Regional Jail for 3 years.
