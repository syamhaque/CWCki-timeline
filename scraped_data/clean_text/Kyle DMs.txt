This page lists DMs between Chris and the Watchmen member Kyle.
Third Eye
Unknown date. Naught released as part of his 2020 Discord leaks.
Chris tells Kyle how to boost the power of the third eye.
I'll bring this up, since I just watched the following WatchMojo Top 10: Augmented Reality tools can help in seeing what only the Third Eye can see in 1218. Just putting that out there.
Wait a minute!
Akira predicted a cancelled 2020 Tokyo Olymics due to a sort of pandemic, and there being Psychic types around!
This body is Psychic, and we're finding more and more Psychic types in 1218.
I feel like AR can help you out if your Third Eye is not fully usable yet, or at least for anyone else with that problem.

Kyle discussed the below excerpt in The Place. He claimed that he had asked about providing in a relationship, then was given an answer about wanting a mommy. Kyle then quoted the below excerpt, noting that Chris changed the subject.[1]
Kyle
So the question posed is, what can other people offer in a relationship that you're unable to?
Chris
Similar, but more like someone whose aura, mind and body are not only enlightened, but with an OP rainbow aura can match my own, with greatest psychic abilities to be able to read and understand me and my abilities and extensive history.
That is amongst the highest levels of mastery who can help me better understand my powers and abilities.
