Hey, everyone. This is an offical call out:
I am aware that a lot of you like what I did in the endings of the recent Review Videos for the #TransformersLegacyUnitedMerged figures. And a lot of you also want something more Sonichu and Rosechu related. So, I only have the Amiibo figures; not posable.
What I will need for something similar is fully articulated figures. ALL joints. Don't use the copy/paste Sonic figure. Look at the photo in the above joint: no elbow joint. Not compared to Small Foot.
And I don't just want the most popular Sonichu Prime, Rosey Rosechu Prime,...
...Magi-Chan Sonichu Prime, and me in Human, Sonichu and Goddess Blue Heart (Human and Sonichu forms) figures, I need ALL of them. What you see here: Bubbles, Blake, Wild, Simonla, Zapina, Punchy, Angelica and their children (including Donnie, son of Blake and Bubbles). And others that still have...
...yet to be introduced to all of you. And begrudgingly, figures of Liquidchu (Liquid Chris Sonichu) and Reldnahc Notsew Naitsirhc (human and Sonichu).
Now, I can only pay so much, But I am saving my money; SAVING. But the artist(s) and modder(s) shall be consistently credited in the media...
...the figures are utilized. So, mainly, you'd get at least the exposure. As it has been made clear, I am a fan of modders.
I like custom figures. Look at what others have done of the #Transformers figures to recreate the #Gobots (Seriously, #Hasbro; give us Leader-1, Turbo, Scooter, Cy-Kill,...
...Coptur and the rest. Quit loafing around. They're already inhabiting Cybertron after relocating from Gobotron. "Time to go" on that, and f*** legal bulls***). Anyway, I have been impressed.
So, with the figures I'll need, please kindly introduce yourselves and let me know what y'all do,...
...and show me the results. I can be contacted directly at the Cwclight Gmail.
I thank you all for your consideration and kindness.
⚡️💙⚡️
