CWC did WTC!
Twin Falling Towers is a video uploaded by Chris on 1 November 2009. An unusually tasteless video, Chris attempts to threaten Clyde Cash by sticking an embarrassing picture of him and Jack Thaddeus in place of the Twin Towers and making childish explosion noises.
Years later, the Man in the Pickle Suit mentioned that this video had been one of many scripted by trolls:
Most non-rant videos, like cakefarts.
The rant videos were more freeform, though they often had a framework or were in response to a specific request. ie "talk about topics X, Y and Z, and be sure to mention that you think he's weak! call him weak, like some sort of big disaster, like a bridge collapsing. ooh, or compare him to 9/11! that'll embarrass him!"
Following outrage to the video – both feigned anger from the trolls who suggested it in the first place, and genuine disgust from horrified onlookers – Chris uploaded an apology video for his inelegant joke. Unfortunately, the alternate joke that Chris proposed just dug him deeper.

He's as wild as a serial raper!
[Close-up on an image of the World Trade Center before its destruction. Fragments of the photo of "Clyde", that Chris has been using this whole time, are visible through the silhouette of the towers. Laid over the image is a pointing cursor; we are looking at a picture displayed on a computer screen.]
Well now, Mr. Clyde...your same and rutches--your fame and four-chunn shall fall just like these Twin Towers! They go crumbling down, with an airplane!
[Chris moves the cursor towards the "towers."] Nyerrrrrrr! Pffff! [Chris wiggles the cursor around the "towers" to give the impression that they have exploded. He then does a horrible imitation of Strong Bad.] You are weeeeeeeak! I'm the strong wunnnnnn! You are going down, Mr. Clyde Cash! Gnrrrrrr!
Liquid Chris responds
Our Hero spotted the video not long after it was posted and offered a brief response reflecting the feelings of many observers, before writing another comment as a threat to Chris.
HOW could You MOCK the ALMOST THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE who DIED in the Nine-Eleven Plane Attacks!? I WILL SHOW THIS TO KACEY, AND SHE WILL KICK YOUR ASS AND I WILL HELP.
Please Die,
CWC
And Another Thing, KACEY is from a MILITARY FAMILY. Now you are Doomed.
