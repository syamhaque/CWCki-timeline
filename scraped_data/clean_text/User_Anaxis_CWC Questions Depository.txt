PROTIP:
After the incest situation, our liaisons who had been asking Chris questions have officially cut him off entirely. This is unfortunately the end of CWC Questions. However, this page and the invite link to the server shall remain up for archival purposes.
I created the CWC Questions Discord server (can be joined here) in order to create a relatively direct Q&A pipeline to Chris. However, I realize that not every person interested in asking Chris a question has a Discord account, or wants to engage with the community so directly. So this page serves as a place for any editors interested in asking Chris a question to do so, without the need to join the server.

Rules
The section below (Ask Chris a Question) is freely editable by anyone. Feel free to add your question there. However, keep in mind some rules I have before you do this:
1) Do not expect that your question will be answered by Chris. There is no guarantee that he will see it, nor a guarantee that it will be approved by the mods or by the Watchmen.
2) Do not expect regular answers to the Mailbag. Chris does not have a defined schedule for this.
3) Your question will be manually deleted by me if you do any of the following:
a) Blatantly insult Chris.
b) Promote your OC, or show your fan art to Chris.
c) Ask something incredibly personal or inappropriate, i.e. something you wouldn't ask a random person on the street.
d) Continually repeat the same question because it wasn't initially answered.
e) Write something that isn't a question.
f) Ask more than one question per message. Exceptions include "if so, why?" kind of follow-ups.
g) Repeat a question commonly asked by other users. Make sure to read other recent posts before asking.
4) Even if your question is approved by the mods, that is not a guarantee that the Watchmen will ask it. They have their own system for vetting.
5) Add a line after the previous question before writing yours in, so each one can be identified as made by different users.
6) Do not delete others' questions.
7) Do not spam, especially if you are asking the same thing because it wasn't answered beforehand.
8) You can sign your editor's handle if you wish, but this will not be included when the information is delivered to Chris, or back to the CWCki.
I would like to hold CWCki Editors to a higher standard than regular users on Discord, so I'm hoping that everyone will follow these rules. If this page is abused/vandalized I will shut it down, but I would very much prefer not to. Thank you for participating.

Guidelines
When asking your question, please consider using the one of the five W's and one H. Those are:
Who, What, Where, When, Why, and How.
Doing so will lead to much more interesting and informative answers. For instance, rather than asking "Do you like ice cream?", instead ask, "What flavors of ice cream do you like?"
Remember, Chris lacks the ability to understand meaning behind literal phrases, so if you ask him a question that is phrased like a yes-or-no but implies further elaboration, he will not think to elaborate on his answer.
Ask Chris a Question
Write your question to Chris below.
Colossal Chan
A lot of people have theorized that Chris's Colossal Chan form is based on the Super Saiyan 4 transformation from Dragon Ball GT. Is this true, or was something else the inspiration for Colossal Chan? Superspongebobbros (talk) 20:51, 25 September 2020 (UTC)
Approved. Anaxis (talk) 06:11, 30 October 2020 (UTC)
Lottery
How much do you still “invest” on the lottery every week? --Little Owl (talk) 15:42, 1 October 2020 (UTC)
Approved. Anaxis (talk) 06:11, 30 October 2020 (UTC)
Election 2020
Provisional results from the Virginia Department of Elections indicate two write-in votes from Ruckersville: in response to your intention to vote for Lisa Simpson, can you kindly confirm if actually you did vote for Lisa, and if so, what gave you the courage to do so? I would also like to ask if you encouraged Barbara to do the same? --Little Owl (talk) 10:47, 6 November 2020 (UTC)
Note: "Who was the other write-in voter?" may not be a good idea, because Chris may claim that it was Sonichu: that is an invalid answer because imaginary people cannot vote in elections — this is not "Sideshow Bob Roberts". The question was also asked because it could affect what we know about Chris’s perception of the world.

Jacob’s Visit
When Jacob tried to visit you last year, did you see the red flags on your own, or did one of your closer orbiters sound the alarm on him? If it’s the latter, then who warned you? Homsar (talk) 19:42, 6 November 2020 (UTC)
Approved. -Anaxis (talk) 18:56, 10 November 2020 (UTC)
Sonic's Blue Arms
With the Sonic Boom alternate continuity, Sonic's arms were blue, and you were quite unhappy to learn about this. What was it that frustrated you so much about the change to Sonic's character design, when said show was not canonical to the events of the original video game series? Furthermore, why did you support the movie that Paramount just made, which shows Sonic with blue arms, when you previously boycotted Sonic Boom? KingClark (talk) 21:17, 7 November 2020 (UTC)
Approved. -Anaxis (talk) 18:56, 10 November 2020 (UTC)
sonichuizcool
In 2009, you made a video insulting a genuinely mentally-impaired woman named "sonichuizcool" and calling her a "naive retard", who unbeknownst to you was the only genuine fan of your work at the time. Information has since come to light that you were manipulated by trolls into making the video. How do you feel about it today, and if you were to apologise to her, what would you say? FokkerTISM (talk) 23:49, 14 November 2020 (UTC)
Approved. -Anaxis (talk) 09:13, 2 January 2021 (UTC)
Childhood Trauma
When you were young, an abusive babysitter locked you in your toy-filled bedroom for a few hours, an event which you said was so traumatic that you didn't speak for years. However, as an adult, you spend a lot of your spare time in your room with your toys. Why does being alone in your room now not bring you trauma when it did one night so many years ago? KingClark (talk) 01:29, 6 December 2020 (UTC)
Approved. -Anaxis (talk) 09:13, 2 January 2021 (UTC)
Flag and emblem of CWCville
What does the flag and emblem of CWCville look like? --Little Owl (talk) 15:29, 24 February 2021 (UTC)
Note: I am looking at a possibility of creating an infobox for the fictional city, similar to the infoboxes for countries in Wikipedia.

Reverse Mortgage rumours
Rumours of a reverse mortgage have haunted many Sonichu observers for many years: this recently got fresh attention after Null stated in a Mad at the Internet podcast that Barb took out reverse mortgage on the house. I wish for Chris to come clean and confirm whether or not a reverse mortgage exists, and if so, since when? Little Owl (talk) 10:53, 11 September 2020 (UTC)
