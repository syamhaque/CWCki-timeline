================================================================================

BronyCon 2018 gift comics are individual comic pages Chris drew as gifts for some guests of BronyCon 2018. Chris later posted photos of the art to Twitter and invited his audience to guess the recipients of the drawings.[1]
Some of the dates Chris used in the drawings are in dual format using the Equestrian calendar (an Idea Guys concept).

Rarity and Luna
Art presumably for St. Germain
The first appears to be a gift for Tabitha St. Germain; it features Rarity and Luna, characters Tabitha voiced on My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic and Equestria Girls.
In the comic's first panel, Chris hands Rarity (who is a seamstress) his "iconic Ralph Lauren shirt", asking if she can restore it or at least patch up the holes, a reference to the poor condition of his shirt at the time. Rarity agrees to try her best to restore the "historical" shirt, though cringes at the difficult task (in a thought bubble, remarking that Magi-Chan had warned her of the shirt's condition).
In the second panel, Luna gives Chris's ponysona Night Star a pep talk, saying she is very strong and should do her best for everyone and not to let others intimidate her. Night Star thanks Luna for the advice.
Michelle and Apple Bloom
Art presumably for Creber
The second page appears to be a gift for Michelle Creber; it features Apple Bloom, a character she voices, and what seems to be a ponysona meant to represent her.
In the comic page, Night Star greets Michelle and Apple Bloom and exclaims she is staying for brunch.
DRWolf
Art presumably for DRWolf
The third page appears to be a gift for DRWolf; it features his ponysona.
In the comic page, Chris Chan Sonichu, Magi-Chan, and Cryzel (who are in a polyamorous marriage) are in a therapy session in DRWolf's office. DRWolf asks them if the marriage is working well. Chris Chan Sonichu confirms it, saying, "none of us has to feel alone." Cryzel replies with a jab that they have to "put up with the small details, too."
ILoveKPALot
Art presumably for ILoveKPALot
The fourth page appears to be a gift for ILoveKPALot; it features a drawing of her.
In the comic page, Discord (a magical character from My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic and a fan favorite of ILoveKPALot's), materializes out of the back of her shirt and remarks, "I like you, KP, you are quite a specimen."
In his Twitter post, Chris claimed that Discord had dictated those words for the comic piece, and that he merely was the messenger.
ObabScribbler and Reverbrony
Art presumably for either ObabScribbler or Reverbrony
The fifth page appears to be a gift for either ObabScribbler or Reverbrony. At the time, the two were in a relationship. The drawing features their ponysonas embracing against a heart-shaped background.
Nowacking
Art for Nowacking
The sixth page was for Nowacking. Chris intended to gift the drawing and a Vinyl Scratch figure to Nowacking, who had previously blocked him on Twitter. However, Nowacking rejected Chris. Chris tried to have Jai Heart give the items to Nowacking instead, but Jai Heart declined to get involved.[2]
In the drawing, Nowacking's ponysona sings the lyrics, "I'm a huge nerd, I confess, I'm a goofy, awkward mess," to which Night Star agrees, saying she is a mess too, and adds that they're both awesome.
Black Gryph0n
Art presumably for Black Gryph0n
The seventh page appears to be a gift for Black Gryph0n. In it, Chris Chan Sonichu gives a fist bump to Black Gryph0n's ponysona.
