“
I want to clear a Couple Things Up. First of all, it was not I, Christine Weston Chandler, offering "Services" a few weeks back. Nor was it I Apologizing for "Ruining Fandoms" and the Like. While it was Physically Me, that is my Physical Form, behind the Keyboard, I was being Forced to Write such things and make Dishonest Apologies. The People who Did THAT to me know who They Are and their Day is Coming and Rightfully SOON! I Know you Read This - Don't Get Too Comfortable Jerks in The Bluegrass State or Golden State!

4 May
Chris uploads Beedee, Beedee, Beedee; I’m Back, Buck! to apologize for the lack of progress on Sonichu and announces an exclusive comic to his Patreon backers featuring himself, Magi-Chan and Cryzel Rosechu.
He begs for sales money, allegedly to afford shipping out books,[3] even though he had gotten $450 from Patreon donors two days prior and made thousands of dollars from eBay sales/gifts in the previous month.
After Kenneth Erwin Engelhardt had enough of Chris's rudeness and walked away from his Facebook, he quickly backpedals, tweeting to Chris instead.[4]

Chris confirms that his recent sweethearts are Cryzel and Magi-Chan when he uploads a preview of a special wedding story for Sonichu #13.

7 May - Upset at how he was banned from Anytime Fitness, Chris turns his back on the CWCProtectSquad.[7]

Barbara and Chris beg in multiple videos for mortgage payment money, saying they must pay tomorrow and are at risk of foreclosure if they do not, and Chris states that something happened to him over the last six months which caused him to lose a lot of money.
He slashes prices on eBay and offers a celebrity visit from himself for $500.[8]
He also continues his court visit for the March 2018 trespass charge, ending with a continuance issued for 5 June.

Chris meets with Rocky Shoemaker after the Guard Dogs arrange a meeting between the two in hopes she will go with him to the local police to report the Idea Guys.

He thanks people who gave him donations, noting for his audience that he was given Food Lion gift cards as a way of ensuring he would only spend the donation on food, and that he's still in financial distress. He puts a price tag of $1,000 on his Twitter account to a fan who asks about buying it. He sets standards for the video requests he'll make, specifically no more shout-outs to school shooters and donated food he'll eat, turning down an offer for pizza as it's junk food.[22]
24 May - Chris indirectly calls out the Idea Guys and disavows some of their content.[23] He roasts Kenneth Engelhardt on Twitter.[24]
25 May - Chris hesitates on publishing Sonichu #13, as it was co-authored by Idea Guys. He tweets he's still in need of food money, suggesting that if people want to be sure the money goes to food, they can send him Food Lion gift cards, and offers to show receipts to show it won't be wasted on junk. He also says he is exploring ideas to level off his financial situation, but follows up by saying, "And NO, don't tell me to 'Get A Job' - you know I would be Harassed until the End of Equestria! I Prefer to Work From the Peace of my Own Home". A fan suggests he simply not tell people where he would be working, but Chris responds that this wouldn't be enough, saying, "They would Find Out. Lots of people in CVille know who I am - Someone would See Me Working and it would be Online within Minutes!"[25]
