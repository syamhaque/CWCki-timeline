================================================================================

Chris in November 2013. Familiar expression, as always.
In 2013, Chris mourned his expulsion from Heaven.
2013 was the fifth year since Chris's discovery. Like the two years before it, it began with nothing of note, ever since Chris began serving out his sentence for the GAMe PLACe incident. For a while, it remained to be seen if this ordeal (which ended in July) would finally knock some sense into him. However, much like past experiences, Chris had learned nothing, except for feelings of betrayal and alienation that would haunt him throughout the year, and basically define it.
2013 was the first year Chris didn't upload any art or mention sex or his delusions. He also continued to appear in public without the Medallion of Fail, and he showed more awareness of the trolls. Oddly, Chris made occasional references to his weight, claiming that he's dropping pounds despite continuing with his unhealthy lifestyle.
However, this year is still notable as being the year where Chris' ego would cause him to become alienated with the few people he has left as "friends" (namely, Anna and the congregation of his church). It even caused him to get chastised for his attention-whoring by a well-known voice actress from My Little Pony in April. And in October, Chris discovered that his high school gal pals had merely tolerated him and allowed him into their group out of pity.
Even his local Walmart had enough of him - in September, an act of blatant vandalism by Chris caused him to be thrown out and banned from the store. He cursed the Manajerks for this incident, and went back to his pattern of publicly blaming his old "forgiven" enemies. Chris would later reveal that even his own family wants nothing to do with him or his mother – Cole Smithey didn't even invite them to his wedding in March, and ignored Chris completely when confronted by the latter on Twitter.
In May, the 2013 Facebook leak revealed all of the Facebook posts made by Chris between 2012 and 2013, shedding some light on what happened during Chris's absence since the death of his father earlier in 2011.
In early November, Chris uploaded his first YouTube video since 2011. In December, Alec Benson Leary leaked the Tour of Chris's House II video to the CWCki Forums, which showed his house had deteriorated even more from the last house tour Chris made.
All in all, 2013 can be considered the least eventful year since Chris's discovery, a low point in activity and spirits alike. It marks the peak as well as the end of the Dark Ages/Second Exile, as it would be followed by the Renaissance of 2014.
