Commentary on the Watchmen's Behavior in the Taser Discussion
1 July 2021
Anaxis's summary
Silvia inquires about the Watchmen's behavior in the Taser Discussion with Praetor, pointing out how scattershot their discussion was. WCT talks about it with her, stating that while both sides were bad, the Watchmen were worse and had no plan. He states that Praetor was a "necessary evil" who did spur Chris into doing something productive, and that he would allow anyone wanting to do business with Chris as long as they aren't doing anything illegal. WCT then speaks more about his philosophy of non-interference, then discussion turns to further bashing of the other Watchmen who stayed loyal to Naught.

NOTE: Chris was not directly involved in this conversation.
Silvia 12:46 AM
So i listened to the whole praetor video and I’m quite confused.
The Fool 12:51 AM
tfw you get into the watchmen
[Picture of Will Smith in a flower costume surrounded by children dressed the same, from The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.]
Silvia 12:51 AM
Basically. Since day 1
It went from them saying Christine is an adult and can make her own choices to twizzlers and ice cream
The Fool 12:54 AM
BUT WHO BABYSITS THE BABYSITTERS
Silvia 12:54 AM
???
The WCT 12:56 AM
[Replying to "It went from them saying Christine is an adult and can make her own choices to twizzlers and ice cream"]
its a fucking mess.
Silvia 12:57 AM
I see that.
The WCT 12:57 AM
let me say this now when looking back:
Naught and the others had no plan.
He even admitted that we fucked up badly.
Silvia 12:57 AM
I see that. They attacked for no reason
The WCT 12:57 AM
because they want Chris's attention. (edited)
and they saw Praetor as a threat.
Silvia 12:58 AM
I’m shocked at how Meghan tried to guilt trip Christine by saying praetor is taking her away from them
The WCT 12:58 AM
both sides were cringe.
Silvia 12:58 AM
Yes
The WCT 12:58 AM
but I'd argue that the Watchmen were worse.
Silvia 12:59 AM
Yea I agree. They had no formal tone. Praetor at least tried to sound a bit professional
The WCT 12:59 AM
it was clearly obvious that Caden was a numbskull. lol
that whole VC was a gay op.
and was an embarrassing failure.
even Pluto/Val knew it was a joke which was why he didn't care. (edited)
Silvia 01:00 AM
I figured Pluto was just doing his normal fucking around
The WCT 01:00 AM
he clearly was.
he was doing real time shitposting.
Silvia 01:01 AM
Yup yup.
But in the end praetor was not a threat and they’re throwing a tantrum
If anything it gets Christine out of the house.
The WCT 01:02 AM
I can't believe I'm saying this but...
Praetor is a necessary evil.
They actually got Chris to do something productive.
The Fool 01:02 AM
it's better to work with people than against them, even if you don't agree on things
Silvia 01:03 AM
That’s all I care about. If she’s out of the house and doing some sort of activity safely then I don’t see a problem.
The WCT 01:03 AM
I will still suggest people to not do business with Chris. But if they insist, we'll go to the negotiating table.
The Fool 01:04 AM
nah let them get spurned it's funny
Silvia 01:04 AM
I mean me and her talk about crystals and she helped me start collecting again lol.
The WCT 01:04 AM
my words don't mean anything.
if somebody chooses to work with Chris, then work with him.
I literally don't care.
The Fool 01:04 AM
ah, just a formality then
The WCT 01:04 AM
As long as you're not doing anything illegal, I'll let you walk.
[1 👆🏽 reaction]
Silvia 01:05 AM
Or overall dangerous, which I doubt.
The WCT 01:05 AM
Do you know why we were able to repel the Sockness threat in 2019?
guess.
Silvia 01:05 AM
I was in there.
I believe because we let Christine decide right
The WCT 01:06 AM
[Replying to "I believe because we let Christine decide right"]
that's correct.
The Fool 01:06 AM
the best thing you can do is merely ask the new entity targeting chris what they want and make sure they stick to their story
The WCT 01:06 AM
unless Chris comes to us for help, we won't intervene in his affairs.
I'm done gatekeeping.
he's for the most part wide-open.
The Fool 01:06 AM
might be good to send in a double agent into any new group that want to fuck with chris to make sure they're behaving lol
The WCT 01:07 AM
Peachy would've made a good double agent but...
Silvia 01:07 AM
https://tenor.com/view/off-size-off-wacky-face-pouty-lips-gif-16675463
The WCT 01:07 AM
yeah.
The Fool 01:07 AM
I might be a good one, depends how much I care on a particular day
The WCT 01:07 AM
taking Naught's dick up the ass kinda rules him out.
Silvia 01:07 AM
Wheeze. But I feel the fool would be good
The WCT 01:08 AM
The Fool is a pretty good double agent so far. lol
I mean he's literally leaking from the place to us.
and they still haven't figured it out. 😄
Silvia 01:08 AM
https://tenor.com/view/bird-cam-spy-eye-drove-gif-12696608
Super spy
The Fool 01:09 AM
It's because I tell everyone I love them :)
I'm basically Mother from I Am Mother if you've seen that
The WCT 01:09 AM
I'm glad I reunited with Anaxis. He was the one guy in the place besides Naught who I could talk to that wouldn't call me a homo. lol
Silvia 01:09 AM
You really do remind me of the tarot card the fool and yes a long time ago
Hey I never called u one either
The WCT 01:10 AM
[Replying to "Hey I never called u one either"]
oh sorry.
Meghan and Kyle loved to call me a fag for some reason, idk why.
The Fool 01:11 AM
takes one to know one
Silvia 01:11 AM
Bc they are one. Same reason why they called me slow
The WCT 01:11 AM
Its funny they'd call me one despite the fact both of them are in beds with the same sex themselves.
Silvia 01:11 AM
https://tenor.com/view/regular-show-ooh-regular-show-gif-5715487
I mean u litterally had a gf
The WCT 01:12 AM
sorta
I wouldn't count Tiffany completely because I never actually saw her IRL.
Silvia 01:12 AM
Well the point it it was the opposite sex lol
The WCT 01:12 AM
I still kinda cope about her. If she and I were still a thing she would probably be in this server right now.
Silvia 01:13 AM
I understand….I’ve been there trust me.
The WCT 01:13 AM
she loved the attention she got from me and she probably would've taken advantage of me taking power rn. lol (edited)
[...]
Silvia 01:26 AM
Kyle sperged a lot
The WCT 01:26 AM
Pluto/Val agreed with my choice to not bring him back.
he always thought of him as somebody that just can't connect with Chris.
Silvia 01:26 AM
Who Kyle?
The Fool 01:27 AM
yeah he actively just wants to mock chris
The WCT 01:27 AM
[Replying to "Who Kyle?"]
yes
Silvia 01:27 AM
He was very rude to her but rude to everyone. I never understood why he was there
The WCT 01:27 AM
they have too many disagreements with each other and Kyle seems to be more of a troll to him than a friend.
The WCT 01:27 AM
[Replying to "He was very rude to her but rude to everyone. I never understood why he was there"]
Ask Naught that question. lol
so incompetent.
The Fool 01:27 AM
even MKR I give the benefit of the doubt and maybe she has the capacity to mesh with this group, but Kyle is very active about mocking him
The WCT 01:27 AM
Meghan can actually get along with Chris.
Kyle just wants to fuck with him.
The Fool 01:28 AM
yeah
The WCT 01:28 AM
Naught was also a retard for giving him ownership of the place.
like dude, why?
The Fool 01:28 AM
that said I trust mkr as far as I can throw her (and thats a lot to throw)
Silvia 01:28 AM
I’ve never had any ill will against mkr but I won’t tolerating her being rude to others.
The WCT 01:29 AM
Naught made a big mistake not giving me the place.
Silvia 01:29 AM
Tolerate gods I can’t spell
The WCT 01:29 AM
[Replying to "Naught made a big mistake not giving me the place."]
looking back though, he knew what i'd do if I took power. (edited)
The Fool 01:30 AM
I'm pretty sure him calling you a faggot and telling his friends to call you a faggot and gaslighting you and telling his friends to gaslight you had something to do with him actively deciding not to hand you ownership of the server, but thats just my theory
The WCT 01:30 AM
[Replying to "looking back though, he knew what i'd do if I took power. (edited)"]
If there was a time for him to give me the place, it was February 2021 when our conflict with Praetor reached its peak. That and his crayhans got banned in April.
The WCT 01:31 AM
[Replying to "I'm pretty sure him calling you a faggot and telling his friends to call you a faggot and gaslighting you and telling his friends to gaslight you had something to do with him actively deciding not to hand you ownership of the server, but thats just my theory"]
the only I was taking power was in a coup.
there was no other option.
The Fool 01:31 AM
all's fair in autism and war
The WCT 01:31 AM
him doxing me backfired because most don't really care who I am IRL, along with further justifying my cause.
Naught essentially handed me the keys on a silver platter.
The Fool Acts as a Double Agent, The WCT Creates a Kiwi Farms Post, MKR's Texts With Chris Are Leaked
1 July 2021
Anaxis's summary
The Fool shares some information from within the Place, first showcasing Nova's long commentary on Chris's tweets, then continuing to play dumb with the Watchmen while giving MKR advice on how to win Chris back. He later shares text messages sent between MKR and Chris, where MKR follows the Fool's advice and tries to guilt Chris, but he refuses her attempts in response.
Meanwhile, WCT asks for feedback on a Kiwi Farms post he is drafting, wherein he explains that he is not working with Praetor and that Nova and MKR are attempting to manipulate public opinion against him in order to get Chris to come back. I advise him to stay out of the spotlight, and he asks if I've written anything about the Watchmen's breakup for the CWCki, to which I tell him I can't because of periodic downtime. He then spends the rest of the conversation bashing the "Toxic Trio" with the Fool and Silvia.

The Fool 07:29 PM
[Screenshot of the Fool explaining why the CWCki is down, and Kyle commenting on one of Chris's tweets.]
[Screenshot of Kyle writing a long commentary on Chris's tweets.]
and he's still going but you know it's just the usual a-logging
god he's writing an essay...
he really has to pick apart every single tweet
15 minutes later he finally got the end of that tweet chain...
The WCT 07:51 PM
[Replying to "and he's still going but you know it's just the usual a-logging"]
this is why he doesn't deserve to have Chris within distance of him.
close or far.
The Fool 07:52 PM
did you show chris that he says this stuff behind his back?
The WCT 07:53 PM
[Replying to "did you show chris that he says this stuff behind his back?"]
yes.
he knows.
The Fool 07:53 PM
lol
[Video attachment]
The WCT 07:58 PM
A guy from Naught's new server told me he left said server because of Naught and some others posting Loli. (edited)
The Fool 09:11 PM
nice
The WCT 09:17 PM
[Replying to "Click to see attachment 🖼️"]
Because its true.
Meghan needs to just let go.
The Fool 09:18 PM
[Replying to "Meghan needs to just let go."]
The WCT 09:18 PM
lol.
how long can you keep them convinced you aren't a double agent?
The Fool 09:18 PM
[Screenshot of a clown character from a video game, with text in front of it reading "Immortal Clown Metal Flotsam."]
probably indefinitely as long as nothing here gets leaked
[...]
The Fool 09:43 PM
using the verb "gaslight" outright, unironically, unprompted, lol
The WCT 09:45 PM
[Replying to "Click to see attachment 🖼️"]
cringe.
The Fool 09:46 PM
make sure chris blocks them or something if he hasn't
The WCT 09:52 PM
[Replying to "make sure chris blocks them or something if he hasn't"]
tomorrow, he'll speak with us.
I'll probably tell him there.
@The Fool looks like people are beginning to realize the truth.
[Screenshot of a handful of Kiwi Farms posts commenting on Praetor and the Watchmen.]
The Fool 09:58 PM
it was pretty much assumed from the beginning
The WCT 09:58 PM
The Watchmen were a failure.
The Fool 10:07 PM
hello double agent here I have leaks
The WCT 10:09 PM
[Replying to "Click to see attachment 🖼️"]
BTFO'ed.
The Fool 10:11 PM
[Quoting "That was a straw that sold the blade to the executioner"]
he's like an AI bless his heart
The WCT 10:12 PM
What do you think of the screenshots though?
The Fool 10:13 PM
Chris [YouTube link to "TAU (2018) "F*cking Scholar" || Official Clip #4" by Scary Stories]
I'd just re-enforce his idea that he foreseen all this to keep him confident in his decision
so they don't draw him back in
I also just suggested to them that they prevent an evil OC is taking them over (I feel like if I offer them suggestions then I can tell you that they might plan to do that), so maybe warn Chris about that
The WCT 10:19 PM
[Replying to "so they don't draw him back in"]
they will fail spectacularly.
The Fool 10:20 PM
Don't let your guard down anyway
[REDACTED] 10:20 PM
@Neko Someone posted MKR's tweet accusing you to KF.
[Broken image attachment]
The WCT 10:21 PM
[Replying to "[Broken image attachment]"]
should I reply?
The Fool 10:21 PM
yeah, tell them you have nothing to do with praetor and this is them trying to manipulate chris/people
say only that
don't mention your new lax policy
The WCT 10:23 PM
[Screenshot of a drafted Kiwi Farms post written by WCT, denying that he's working with Praetor.]
let me know if I should edit anything.
The Fool 10:25 PM
Say that the whole reason you took Chris away from MKR and Kyle is specifically because they're this conniving and sleezy and don't have the best intentions for Chris, they're not better than Praetor.
they're going to want a reason
that should do it
The WCT 10:27 PM
[Screenshot of the same drafted post as before, with an extra sentence added demonizing MKR and Kyle further.]
The Fool 10:27 PM
should be good
The WCT 10:28 PM
@[REDACTED] if more people begin to associate me with Chris more on Kiwi, should I be given the Christorical Figure tag?
cause if nobody cares, I don't see a need.
[REDACTED] 10:28 PM
Won't this reveal that you're the new Watchmen or was that meant to be secret?
The WCT 10:29 PM
I think I should clarify that the Watchmen have broken up.
[REDACTED] 10:29 PM
[Replying to "@[REDACTED] if more people begin to associate me with Chris more on Kiwi, should I be given the Christorical Figure tag?"]
It's up to Null. But LYLT/Kim Wilson doesn't have one either.
The WCT 10:31 PM
@[REDACTED] I edited it.
[Screenshot of the completed draft posted onto Kiwi Farms, slightly modified, under WCT's Psychic Espeon account.]
Lainchu (Anaxis) 10:34 PM
I'd avoid putting yourself in the spotlight, especially during this period of unrest around chris and the KF ddosing
The WCT 10:34 PM
[Replying to "I'd avoid putting yourself in the spotlight, especially during this period of unrest around chris and the KF ddosing"]
have you written anything for the CWCki?
at least about this?
Lainchu (Anaxis) 10:35 PM
I tried to update the Taser discussion page, but the cwcki went down right before I could submit the changes
I have it saved though, and I'll update once the site is back online
The WCT 10:35 PM
Will the coup d'etat be mentioned in the Watchmen article?
Lainchu (Anaxis) 10:36 PM
What's public will be mentioned
The WCT 10:36 PM
or will the public be told the group no longer exists?
The Fool 10:36 PM
MKR responded to chris
The WCT 10:37 PM
[Replying to "MKR responded to chris"]
all...bullshit.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 10:37 PM
Guess it could mention what MKR wrote on twitter and what you wrote on KF as evidence that the group dissolved
Lainchu (Anaxis) 10:37 PM
[Replying to "MKR responded to chris"]
Lol, "I've had a hard life, that's why I'm a piece of shit, feel sorry for me!"
[REDACTED] 10:37 PM
[Replying to "Guess it could mention what MKR wrote on twitter and what you wrote on KF as evidence that the group dissolved"]
Agree
The WCT 10:38 PM
I kinda want to tell Chris something myself.
Meghan is obviously trying to win him back.
The Fool 10:39 PM
try not to let them find out you saw these
careful what you tell chris
Lainchu (Anaxis) 10:40 PM
You could ask him and let him tell you what he was told
The Fool 10:40 PM
yeah, just being cautious
The WCT 10:43 PM
[Screenshot of the WCT telling Chris that he would never use Chris for internet fame, and that he would call out Praetor if they made Chris do something stupid.]
I'll be honest, associating myself with Chris is kinda embarrassing.
but on the other hand, I do see it as a way for me to do some good.
However, I won't be as forceful on him as the others were. (edited)
The Fool 10:47 PM
she's taking my advice to be short and sweet and stop threatening him
make sure chris is aware this is a manipulation tactic
The WCT 10:48 PM
>I don't know why this happened.
OMG
Your buddy doxed me and you sided with him. LOL
If Meghan had recognized the reality that Naught had been responsible for my doxing, she wouldn't have lost Chris.
In fact, I was hopeful that MKR and Kyle would realize this and turn against him.
My original plan was to have those two by my side instead of the opposite.
The Fool 10:50 PM
Chris said it best, Kyle is a fucking snake
The WCT 10:50 PM
Why do so many people believe Naught word for word?
The Fool 10:51 PM
I guess he's decently charismatic
The WCT 10:51 PM
jfc, make him show the evidence to defend himself.
The WCT 10:51 PM
[Replying to "I guess he's decently charismatic"]
I believe its his tone.
And if you heard the voice clips, Naught clearly didn't give a fuck.
He was guilty.
The Fool 10:57 PM
I wish I could tell Chris I'm giving MKR orders for his protection but that would involve telling him that he can be manipulated when he thinks he's omniscient
I guess I could tell him MKR is asking me what to say because she's too dishonest to say nice things by herself
Which is true.
The WCT 11:06 PM
[Replying to "I guess I could tell him MKR is asking me what to say because she's too dishonest to say nice things by herself"]
Meghan needs some ammo.
and she clearly has none.
The Fool 11:08 PM
I'm her ammo supplier and all I'm giving her are those gag guns that eject a flag that says "bang!" on it when you pull the trigger
WHO MANIPULATES THE MANIPULATORMEN
The WCT 11:09 PM
you're living up to your name.
the fool.
[Screenshot of a Kiwi Farms post reading: "When Chris is the least retarded person in the conversation you should probably evaluate your life."]
The Fool 11:12 PM
thats how it's always been tbh
the only call where chris was the retarded one was the father call
Silvia 11:43 PM
Jesus I just caught up
I’m just floored at christines response. And Meghans. She’s doing what I call tug o warring. She’s being mean about loosing Christine then try to sound sad like I’m sorry I’ll miss u
The WCT 11:45 PM
[Replying to "I’m just floored at christines response. And Meghans. She’s doing what I call tug o warring. She’s being mean about loosing Christine then try to sound sad like I’m sorry I’ll miss u"]
she's a true blue moron.
one moment she sounds like the person that I depicted to Chris, and one moment sounds nice.
this is embarrassingly bad.
The Fool 11:46 PM
[Replying to "I’m just floored at christines response. And Meghans. She’s doing what I call tug o warring. She’s being mean about loosing Christine then try to sound sad like I’m sorry I’ll miss u"]
I'm specifically telling MKR to say that because I feel too bad watching her slip on the same banana peel over and over
The WCT 11:47 PM
concern trolling. lol
Silvia 11:47 PM
[Replying to "I'm specifically telling MKR to say that because I feel too bad watching her slip on the same banana peel over and over"]
Ahhhh makes sense.
The WCT 11:48 PM
I warned Chris she would do this.
The Fool 11:48 PM
you mean Chris foresaw all of this
Silvia 11:49 PM
Either way she’s done. Christine closed the window on the buzzard that is she
The WCT 11:49 PM
Chris will be fine without her.
The Fool 11:49 PM
Like I told Kat, don't let your guard down.
The WCT 11:49 PM
[Replying to "you mean Chris foresaw all of this"]
yes.
Silvia 11:50 PM
[Replying to "Like I told Kat, don't let your guard down."]
Nope not for a moment. She could try anything
The Fool 11:50 PM
fortunately she seems keen with sharing whatever she's trying with kyle and I in the old server
so I can leak here
Silvia 11:50 PM
That’s good. Like I said she’s just shooting herself in the foot
The WCT 11:50 PM
I'll give Kyle some kudos.
he pretty much conceded.
Silvia 11:51 PM
????
Kyle quit
The Fool 11:51 PM
I mean he did say "yeah I'll try to pester chris too"
The WCT 11:51 PM
Meghan's been spamming my DMs while Kyle hasn't.
he just said one thing to me and that was it.
The WCT 11:51 PM
[Replying to "I mean he did say "yeah I'll try to pester chris too""]
that's him giving up. lol
Silvia 11:52 PM
Jesus with what nonsense now. And I figured bc he never cared for Christine
The Fool 11:52 PM
maybe he's realizing he doesn't need to babysit chris to a-log him
The WCT 11:52 PM
Kyle should be grateful that I've allowed him to be the A-Log that he is without worrying about Chris shitting on him. (edited)
The Fool 11:53 PM
I also told MKR to not bother Chris too much since he gets irritated by that (he does) so she might try a slow-and-steady approach
The WCT on Being Honest With Chris
2 July 2021
Anaxis's summary
The Fool posts comments by Nova and MKR where they state that WCT has lied to Chris and has said worse things than they had, and that they could probably find evidence of that in the Place. WCT then asks if he should just be honest with Chris, and shares the uncut VC he had with Chris where he talks about Naught's behavior, noting his confidence that he has convinced Chris to follow him due to "tell[ing] him everything."
#cwc-general (Second Layer)
NOTE: Chris was not directly involved in this conversation.
The Fool 02:53 PM
you know I really feel like I'm watching a bunch of cartoon villains fumble around with some ridiculous evil plan
Lainchu (Anaxis) 02:58 PM
With the watchmen, it's always been that way lol
The WCT 03:04 PM
[Replying to "Click to see attachment 🖼️"]
should I just be honest with Chris?
Chris has always praised me for my honesty towards him.
The Fool 03:05 PM
yeah, I feel like Chris knows when someone is being honest and he appreciates it, but, I'm not claiming to be an expert
The WCT 03:05 PM
[YouTube link to "Neko talks to Chris about Bis." by TheMoon]
this is me VC'ing Chris.
keep this between us.
The Fool 03:06 PM
I plan on telling him I'm keeping an eye on MKR and Kyle for his protection (and that he foresaw all this and blah blah blah just that you can't be too careful and we just care about him etc)
The WCT 03:07 PM
I'm confident that tonight's VC with Chris will further cement my victory. lol
if you listen closely to the VC, I literally broke it down with Chris.
The Fool 03:08 PM
I'm not listening to two hours of that
The WCT 03:08 PM
skip to 30 minutes.
its where I tell him everything.
@The Fool if Kyle and Meghan have anyone to blame, they shouldn't blame me.
they blame Naught.

More Double Agent Reporting
3 July 2021
Anaxis's summary
The Fool shares more text messages between MKR and Chris that the former posted in the Place, and that he attempted to give MKR advice on what to say to Chris (knowing that it wouldn't work). WCT expresses disbelief at her desperation, and both he and the Fool mock her for it. Para asks why the Watchmen want Chris, and WCT and the Fool respond that it comes down to their insecurity.
The Fool then continues sharing more schemes by Nova and MKR, with WCT condemning their decision to stay with Naught, and Para argues against his reasoning. Silvia later joins the conversation, where WCT and the Fool summarize their feelings about the situation to her.

Chris is clearly ready to move on.
but she just won't let go.
The Fool 02:57 PM
and again make sure chris knows I'm telling her to say all this
I'm planning on telling him that when we call
he must not believe her
The WCT 02:58 PM
[Replying to "and again make sure chris knows I'm telling her to say all this"]
I can't believe this.
is she this desperate?
The Fool 02:58 PM
yes
The WCT 02:59 PM
And she needs someone else to do the talking?
she's almost 30 years old and should be able to do stuff by herself.
This is embarrassing.
The Fool 02:59 PM
like I said, she was screaming nonstop to chris "enjoy getting used idiot!!!" and, like, I just couldn't stand there and watch her do that, it was too much, like, oh my god how are you this bad at manipulating someone
The WCT 03:00 PM
what is your ultimate goal with this?
The Fool 03:00 PM
fun
The WCT 03:00 PM
ofc.

I'll keep reminding Chris why he had to leave them.

why
The Fool 03:02 PM
because they're insecure

If you stopped being an asshole, along with recognizing Naught's betrayal, you wouldn't be in this situation right now. Its not that hard to understand.
The Fool 03:24 PM
he doesn't know you did tell chris lol
The WCT 03:25 PM

I don't want to act too braggy, but I've become more powerful than any of them.
And if they're so keen on getting Chris back, why don't they admit to me that Naught is a traitor?
I didn't betray them, it was Naught.
Para 03:26 PM
i dont think kyle thinks naught did that
The WCT 03:26 PM
because he's in cope mode.
Para 03:26 PM
yeah i just dont think youre gonna get what you want because some people actually dont think that happened

The WCT 03:27 PM
no.
Para 03:27 PM
he just wants people to shut up
The WCT 03:27 PM
Kyle was clearly trying to derail the conversation.
and there's a possibility that Naught told him to shut me up.
Para 03:27 PM
yeah but i dont think hes a bad guy
nah i dont think so
The WCT 03:27 PM
I disagree.
Para 03:27 PM
he seems kind of depressed and has his own issues
The WCT 03:27 PM
you can tell in his voice that it was carefully planned.
Para 03:28 PM
i dont think so
but i dont know
i dont know these people
The WCT 03:28 PM
Josh said it was Naught.
the screenshots make it clearly obvious.
and most that I've talked to who knew Naught well mostly agree that it was him.
And his silence on these matters also proves his guilt.
Even if Naught apologizes to me, he's gonna have to do more than that. (edited)
He needs to delete my dox on Lolcow.org and order Nova to hand me ownership of the place...which won't happen.
Para 03:30 PM
i dont feel that nova is a bad guy is all
josh is kind of biased against naught did he provide you proof
The WCT 03:31 PM
i'm sorry to say this, but I disagree. But that guy's an asshole with some major problems in the head. I tried to do all I could to get along with him and Meghan, but they clearly hated my guts. lol
Para 03:31 PM
i am not trying to undermine your experience its important that people who help you are also doing it
out of good will
The WCT 03:31 PM
[Replying to "josh is kind of biased against naught did he provide you proof"]
yes he did.
Para 03:31 PM
okay that’s good
i think hes doing that as a defense mechanism if hes an asshole
men are assholes to eachother
The Fool 03:32 PM
not that I have any plan or intention of taking over whatsoever, but I think it's cute how little suspicion I have, if they knew my role here they'd probably think I'm the number one guy who would take over (not like anyone's taking this from kat to begin with)
The WCT 03:32 PM
We had a short but detailed conversation, and got a bit annoyed when I kept showing him screenshots.

they think Chris will only listen to women.
The Fool 04:11 PM
but if you have a vagina you can maniplate chirs!!!
Silvia 04:12 PM
But I don’t want to manipulate lol. And also bc you can’t draw doesn’t mean anything. She draws art like mid 2000s anime. Which is long overdue
Expand your drawing capacity. Try different styles
The Fool 04:13 PM
like I said she's projecting
The WCT 04:13 PM
you know, the fact that Naught is silent on everything right now speaks volumes.
Silvia 04:13 PM
Hugely.
The WCT 04:13 PM
its almost like he wants me in control.

The WCT Reflects on Watchmen Drama & His Dox, More MKR Text Leaks
3 July 2021
Anaxis's summary
WCT reflects on the Watchmen drama and his dox, as well as his plans going forward when it comes to his online presence. He later brags about how good his relationship is with Chris and how happy Chris currently is. Para and Silvia then have a discussion about the state of Chris's life and his happiness, which then transitions into WCT comparing CWCville to Afghanistan by stating that he's the real leader while Chris is a figurehead. He then seems to compare himself to the presence of the Taliban in Afghanistan by stating that he has provided hope and stability to the fictional city.
While this discussion is happening, the Fool shares more text exchanges between Chris and MKR, in which Chris essentially rejects her attempt to guilt him into coming back to her. WCT, of course, gloats about this and credits himself for this turn of events.
#cwc-general (Second Layer)
NOTE: Chris was not directly involved in this conversation.
The WCT 04:27 PM
don't overthink.
I tend to do this a lot and it doesn't work out. lol
Silvia 04:27 PM
Same
The WCT 04:27 PM
based on how things are looking now, I think the worst of the drama between me and the old Watchmen are over.
so in a couple days, I'll try resuming my production of my documentaries.
ngl, getting doxed sucks but at least that part is over.
Para 04:31 PM
did they dox your location
what was doxed
i mean it doesnt matter probably would call the local pd if your shit is out there
id be afraid of swatting
The WCT 04:32 PM
my real name, hometown, my face, facebook (idk why I still had that).
Para 04:32 PM
oh
its good its not your exact location then
The WCT 04:32 PM
I hope Naught didn't uncover any of my family members.
because if he did, I'll be contacting California authorities.
Para 04:32 PM
that is still bad (edited)
The WCT 04:33 PM
[Replying to "its good its not your exact location then"]
there is good news though:
i'm moving.
And unlike where I am now, I intend on using a VPN whenever I use sites like the Farms or lolcow.org.
but for the most part, I plan on taking a step back once my move is done.
Para 04:34 PM
like what
The WCT 04:34 PM
publicly, I won't be as active in the lolcow circles.
privately though, complete opposite with Chris and stuff.
Unlike the old Watchmen, I intend on not making anything public unless he says otherwise.
so far, most of the things we've discussed are personal stuff that he himself would never leak.
Para 04:36 PM
it should be like that anyways
The WCT 04:36 PM
when you're friends with somebody, you gotta have trust.
and it shouldn't be anybody's personal entertainment. (edited)
Para 04:37 PM
it’d probably help chris if you did that anyways
he probably likes the attention on some level from people who view him as entertaining
but i am sure that shit grinds itself down eventually
hes like 40 now
The WCT 04:38 PM
Looking back: Meghan and Kyle have always feared the day I'd rise to power. Simply because even they know that the relationship between me and Chris is really good.
Kyle's relations with Chris is terrible. Meghan's is not as bad, but Chris mostly ignores her.
As for me though, we get along very well.
Para 04:39 PM
chris has always said he prefers female attention but if you express that you arent interested i am sure he doesnt have much use for you
The WCT 04:39 PM
behind the scenes though, it may not matter anymore. 🙂
I won't disclose anything because he even requested me to keep this info private.
But Chris is doing very well right now.
I'd say this is the happiest he's been in a long time.
Silvia 04:41 PM
Agree
Para 04:42 PM
he is as happy as a delusional 40 year old tranny can be
Silvia 04:43 PM
But if she’s living her life without the full gatekeeping like the past has. Then that’s a step up in my book
Para 04:44 PM
i mean to me chris will never be a complete person
but if they kind some level of “happiness” thats better than nothjng
Silvia 04:44 PM
Exactly on point para
Para 04:45 PM
i think the way he lives is overall so toxic for a human that itd be impossible for a regular person to be happy
living with no intrinsic
goals or no ambitions
so why bother him as much as people do
its really sad
Silvia 04:46 PM
Well her “goal” is to be a goddess. So it’s better than nothing. Not exactly a healthy thing but it’s better then doing nothing
But then again I could be wrong. Idk.
The WCT 04:48 PM
[Replying to "But if she’s living her life without the full gatekeeping like the past has. Then that’s a step up in my book"]
now that I'm in charge, Chris has been set freed. For better or worse. (edited)

I feel like we r the passengers of a Rickity old ship. It’s worn it’s shitty but it’s homey
And Christine is the captain and Neko is first in command.
The WCT 04:49 PM
I don't like to think of it as a ship.
think about CWCVille.
That place is literally Afghanistan.
Silvia 04:50 PM
?????? I don’t see how elaborate
The WCT 04:50 PM
think of it this way:
Chris is like the symbolic leader.
I'm the real one.
The Fool 04:50 PM
its like that tim and eric skit about the universe. "the universe is like, if, uh, you put it in a paper bag and, uh, um..."
Silvia 04:51 PM
Like Britain? The queen is for show?
The WCT 04:51 PM
[Replying to "Like Britain? The queen is for show?"]
in a way yes.
A constitutional monarchy.
i'm like the benevolent dictator.
Para 04:52 PM
i am not sure if encouraging chris in his quest to be a goddess is overall the best idea
The WCT 04:52 PM
CWCVille just like Afghanistan is a place that has longed for some form of stability after being caught in the cross hairs of countless clout chasers.
Para 04:52 PM
but there is no alternative

Watchmen Gossip, More Complaining About Naught's Behavior, WCT & MKR's DMs
3 July 2021
Anaxis's summary
The Knights have a discussion where they gossip about the Watchmen, and MKR's behavior and mental state in the face of rejection from Chris. Naturally, WCT manages to eventually return to the topic of Naught's behavior and how Nova and MKR failed to turn against him. He then shares DMs he had with MKR, where the two of them speculate on who doxed him, with MKR shifting blame to other individuals when WCT insists that it must have been Naught. Everyone in this discussion makes fun of her while WCT is sharing these DMs.

The WCT's YouTube Channel Gets a Strike
6-7 July 2021
Anaxis's summary
The WCT reports in the first layer that his YouTube channel had gotten a strike for harassment on an episode of his Randy Stair series, sharing the automated messages he received and his attempted appeal of the decision. Despite this, he manages to reupload all of his content to a second channel.
In the second layer, WCT speculates that Naught was responsible for flagging his videos, which leads to WCT privating all of his channel content. He then shares a slapfight he had with Naught over the strikes in a different server they shared, then a discussion he had with Chris in DMs about it, and finally an attempt by MKR to provoke him in another server.
The next day, WCT shares that his appeal had been rejected by YouTube, then calls the Watchmen leaders "pathetic" and "salty" over losing Chris.

YouTube told me that the strike won't get removed until October. But because of what happened, this is concerning.

makes sense
there are currently no protocols for cancel culture, initiate preemption subroutines and close all public accounts

I made a decision, and I think I'll go on defense mode for 3-4 weeks.

The WCT & Naught Have a Slapfight Over the YouTube Strikes
8-9 July 2021
Anaxis's summary
The slapfight between Naught and WCT continues, with the latter goading the former into posting his "big boy dox" in a server they both share. I warn WCT that provoking Naught will only escalate the situation, but the Fool insists that it would also be funny. WCT then shares some reactions of other users towards Naught's behavior, as well as a mod warning the two of them to be civil in their server. Para later states that Naught's statements didn't admit guilt, but WCT still insists that Naught is responsible.

The WCT's Interview & Argument Over Praetor Joining the Server
12 July 2021
Anaxis's summary
The WCT shares a link to an interview he had with a CWCki editor about what had happened with the Watchmen, and the Fool remarks on how WCT had lied about being in contact with Chris, which he later confirms is meant to keep the Knights server a secret. The WCT and the Fool criticize the Watchmen for failing to stay secret, then WCT pivots to state his interest in inviting Caden of Praetor into the server. Para questions why WCT would bother with this, which triggers an argument where Para gradually gets more aggressive in her disagreements with WCT and the Fool's logic. The two of them take the position that Chris being exploited is inevitable, so the best they can do is remain friendly with him in the hope that Chris becomes more likely to take their advice over that of others.

yes
one thing is a fact:
The Watchmen are dead.

you're executing all this incredibly smoothly

The Knights of CWC though are like a secret society. lol

The Watchmen were originally intended on being kept a secret.
but somebody got a little too e-fame happy.
The Fool 12:24 AM
yeah, like I mentioned several times, I was kind of blown away naught just invited me in there after barely knowing him
The WCT 12:24 AM
looking back that helped kill the group. lol
we currently have around 8 members in this new server, and I have room for at least 1-2 more people.
The Fool 12:25 AM
not even the best, the only defense is being unknown. If you're known, it's only a matter of time until the enemy whittles away your defenses.
The WCT 12:25 AM
[Replying to "we currently have around 8 members in this new server, and I have room for at least 1-2 more people."]
And Praetor would be one of them.
The Fool 12:26 AM
yeah they should be here since they're essentially us
how's getting them in here going?
The WCT 12:29 AM
[Replying to "how's getting them in here going?"]
Chris sent them an invite, but they haven't budged yet.
I told Chris that I'd be interested in talking with Caden privately so I could form a compromise with him. (something that Lainchu proposed to the Watchmen back in February) (edited)

a compromise?
its to ensure that all goes well between the both of us.
The Fool 12:37 AM
chris insists on being their friends anyway so it would be for the best
Para 12:37 AM
why bother with clout chasing grifting zoomers
The WCT 12:37 AM
They're free to grift off Chris, as long as they don't do anything that might actually hurt him physically. (hence the Taser discussion)
Para 12:37 AM
isnt that something youd not want to do
The WCT 12:38 AM
[Replying to "why bother with clout chasing grifting zoomers"]
they don't have to speak with me, but I'd rather have a word with them to make sure that they aren't going to do anything that does cause them issues.
The WCT 12:38 AM
[Replying to "isnt that something youd not want to do"]
for the most part, this is all Chris's responsibility and not ours.
should anything happen to him, it will most likely be of his own doing.
The WCT 12:38 AM
[Replying to "chris insists on being their friends anyway so it would be for the best"]
exactly.
Para 12:39 AM
i mean he seems loke an attention seeking retard
why do zoomers care about chris and chase clout involvinf him
The WCT 12:40 AM
aren't they all? LOL.
Para 12:40 AM
its just bizarre
The WCT 12:40 AM
[Replying to "why do zoomers care about chris and chase clout involvinf him"]
profit.
and so far they're succeeding in doing just that despite the Watchmen's efforts to get rid of them.
amazing isn't it?
Para 12:43 AM
yeah then why enable them
also its just weird how they take pictures with chris and make efforts fl meet irl
where are these zoomers parents
just weird
The Fool 12:44 AM
like we said, we can't get rid of them, so it's better to be their friend
Para 12:44 AM
why do you need zoomers that exploit chris here
The Fool 12:44 AM
the worst case scenario is if chris was forced to side with them or us
Para 12:44 AM
i disagree
you dont have to be their friend or suck their dick
The Fool 12:45 AM
no, but we need to come to an understanding and open communications between us
they're unpredictable
so if they want to communicate with us what their intentions are, that would be great
again, they're not going away
this is just the sort of compromising you have to do when dealing with something that's barely sentient
Para 12:49 AM
they want a foot in the door
to enable their cancer
if ur complaining about how people got too thirsty for efame just u wait till u allow thirsty clout chasing zoomers in ur space
theyll act like they respect you but later on will not
idc i am just a bystander but if you do that you’re setting yourself up to be replaced
The Fool 12:51 AM
it'll also look better in chris' eyes, if he sees we're friendly and compliant and respectful of his wishes he'll side with us quicker over them
Para 12:51 AM
this server will be discarded
no thats bullshit
i am sure chris
doesnt care
The Fool 12:52 AM
it's already been demonstrated over the watchmen thing
chris chose kat over mkr
he chose real friendship over pussy
as barely cognizant as chris is, he does seem vaguely aware of intent and honesty in people, probably after a decade and a half of being manipulated
the only thing we can really do is respect his wishes, doing otherwise will make him think we're just using him. Kat is very vocal about treating chris as an adult even if he isn't one.
Para 12:56 AM
kat isnt chris’s real friend
none of you faggots are his real friend let’s not kid ourselves
you just want to be in control in some way so chris wont do more stupid shit
The Fool 12:57 AM
of course
well I don't know kat's reasoning, I'm just here for fun
Para 12:57 AM
so inviting zoomers to shit that exploit chris in the first place how does that help that
The WCT 12:57 AM
[Replying to "none of you faggots are his real friend let’s not kid ourselves"]
chill. lol
Para 12:58 AM
u can kick me idc
i am just putting my pov out there
The WCT 12:58 AM
you were invited in here to provide balance.
we're not an echo chamber.
Para 12:58 AM
chris is kind of doomed to be manipulated by zoomers
The Fool 12:59 AM
I think I explained things well enough, it's not an ideal solution but this is the reality of things
chris is a child and we have to handle him as such
The WCT 12:59 AM
Here's my prediction:
somewhere down the line, Praetor will come and go like everybody else before them.
It will happen.
I tried telling Meghan and Kyle this, but they refused to listen and were impatient as fuck.
I always keep warning people countless times to not do business with Chris because we all know how it would usually end. If they chose to listen to me, good. But if not, they'll have to face some pretty negative consequences.
The Fool 01:01 AM
we know where you're coming from para but there really is nothing we can do
all we can do is soften the blow
this is strategy
The WCT 01:02 AM
Playing the long game is always the best way to deal with a difficult group of people.
The Fool 01:03 AM
I get it's frustrating but the only alternative is to scream at chris until he gets sick of us and then leaves, like he did with watchmen
The WCT 01:03 AM
And the thing is, if Chris alerts on something happening, that's where we can come in and provide him support. (just like Sockness)
If Chris doesn't ask for help or what, its not our problem then.
We were successful in getting rid of Sockness mainly because Chris requested us to stop him.
The Fool 01:04 AM
chris is going to get into fucked up situations, it's what he does best, literally all we can do is be friendly enough to the point where he hopefully takes out advice and doesn't stay in it.
but he's a literal child so yelling at him just makes it way worse
The WCT 01:06 AM
This is how the Watchmen lost him.
The Fool 01:06 AM
exactly
The WCT 01:06 AM
I would say it was because of the Watchmen's issues with Praetor did the Watchmen lose Chris's heart and soul. (edited)
The Fool 01:07 AM
yeah, like I said, chris is actually aware of intention now, at least vaguely. if you're trying to control him, he is at least somewhat aware of it or can reflect on it to verify.
just being cool and being there for him without any stress or drama is the only thing that's sure to keep him
The WCT 01:08 AM
it really depends on the situation as a whole.
If Chris is about to do something that could potentially harm him physically, that's where we can try convincing him to not go down these foolish roads.
And based on what he's been telling us so far, Caden has successfully won Chris's heart and it appears that he has no intention of screwing him over unless for dumb reason they do. lol
The Fool 01:10 AM
like for the taser thing, I forget if I mentioned this, I probably did, but I'd tell him he hasn't fully merged with his goddess body yet and still has limits like not being able to fly so electricity could still harm him and it's better to not risk it
The WCT 01:11 AM
exactly.
playing the long game is the best overall solution with Chris at the end of the day. I mean look at Josh.
he's done this shit for nearly 10 years now, and his patience is unbelievable.

More of Naught's History
15-16 July 2021
Anaxis's summary
The WCT uncovers an old message by Naught where he posts a picture of text that says "KYS ANIME PFP," which matches the profile picture of the "Nightmare" account on Kiwi Farms, the one WCT had claimed belonged to Naught. He then shares more posts by an account belonging to Naught on lolcow.org, including one where he defends doxing a 13-year old for contacting Chris and reposts their information. I comment in disgust of his actions, and WCT reiterates that Naught is pyschopathic and "needs to be stopped." He also claims that Naught's real first name is Dominik, and that he also lives in California (same as WCT).
We discuss a bit more of his history, and eventually bring up Joseph Draft, with WCT claiming that Naught had threatened to dox Draft, causing him to do the deed himself.

The guy literally has no remorse for his wrongdoings, and he puts on a nice guy face to lure people into his trap. He will be friends with you one day, but when it doesn't benefit him anymore, he will crush you.
he needs to be stopped, and I hope he'll get whats coming to him soon.

yes.
the troll group that gone after him since last month has already found his first name.
I am aware that he does live in Yuba City, California. (which is a 2-3 hour drive from where I live)
And from what I also understand, he still lives with his family. (which is also why they haven't been able to figure out his surname)

yes, that one.
he made an awful OP on them and they were not happy about it.
they came to the server that him and I have co-owned and he got shit scared for some dumb reason.
From there, he assumed I was working for them so that's why he doxed me.
And recently, I also have been talking to a couple old friends of his ([REDACTED] and [REDACTED]), and they told me that he had been a lost cause for 2 years now when he lost his shit on Joseph Draft (also known as French in these circles).
And yes, I'm talking about the same Joseph Draft that tried making a film on Chris.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 10:09 PM

But for some reason, he told Joseph that he was talking to me
And Joseph got really angry with him and cut him off

Joseph is a bit inmature tbh.
he ended up doxing himself on Kiwi Farms after Naught threatened to do just that to him. (edited)

That was after Naught threatened him?
That's interesting
The WCT 10:13 PM
[Replying to "That was after Naught threatened him?"]
Draft just wanted to get it over with. lol
and with Naught and the Watchmen now out of power, I honestly wouldn't be too surprised if these stories began to go public.
If people who had trouble with this crew ask me if its okay to blow the whistle, I'll grant them the green light to do just that.

Anaxis's summary
Chris posts three TSSSF cards he had drawn, with the intent to show them to Null. Two of them featured Null's ponysona "KiwiMac" and the third referenced Everfree Northwest. The WCT, the Fool, Bella, and the Suitress all praise Chris's drawings and state that Null would also like them. Chris posts a set of messages he had sent to Null, one of which mentions the WCT, and then states his intention to distribute the cards among the congoers, which the others express concern over due to the negative reputation of Kiwi Farms. Chris then expresses a hope for Null to attend the convention as well, then posts a pair of drawings he had created that featured him wearing a Kiwi Farms T-shirt, which the others in the chat praise.
A brief conversation about tall people occurs, during which Chris brings up the recently-deceased Snoopy, detailing what he believes to be the dog's fate in C-197. Discussion then turns to Rick and Morty and the Care Bears, where Chris and the other server members reminisce about the characters in the latter.

Hey, everyone.
[1 sonichuthink[5] reaction]
I have had something that I have proposed to Josh Moon, aka NULL, in light of him helping me get to Washington for Everfree Northwest.
Three drawings (one everyone has seen, plus two more that have not been uploaded publicly yet).
Now, Finally, I have made them into three new Twilight Sparkle’s Secret Shipfic Folder cards.
Check it out.
The WCT 09:25 PM
Josh would be awed by that Chris.
he thinks its cute.
Chris 09:26 PM
I just shared this news with him on Signal as well.
And I have ordered seven sets of six of each of these cards from MakePlayingCards.
[3 🥝 reactions]
The Fool 09:26 PM
He better buy one of each from you
Chris 09:27 PM
I even had consulted with him on the flavour texts on the pony card.
Bella 09:27 PM
yeah that was very nice of you to do theyre lovley
Chris 09:27 PM
Bella 09:27 PM
you always go all out on thought and effort, it tuned out very cute!
The WCT 09:27 PM
knowing how grouchy Josh can be nowadays, I'm glad you made those for him.
Chris 09:28 PM
For him and everyone, in general.
At least I can spread a few copies of these cards around the convention.
Fiona 09:28 PM
Which cards?
Oh the shipfic
Nice
How much would they cost?
The Fool 09:29 PM
🤔 would that be a good idea? I mean, I think some people who would go to cons would be the type to get very uncomfortable when you mention kiwifarms
Bella 09:29 PM
that could be true
Fiona 09:29 PM
I'm sure some congoers are Kiwi Farms members
The Fool 09:29 PM
no doubt lol
Fiona 09:29 PM
We don't know for sure
The Fool 09:29 PM
in fact I know some are
Chris 09:29 PM
I’m also going to copy the bleed card files onto five flash drives, organized by deck and expansion packs, and look for those who still print the cards who can print them for less than I can.
That does not surprise me at all
The WCT 09:29 PM
[Replying to "I'm sure some congoers are Kiwi Farms members"]
they're the fans. lol
Chris 09:30 PM
In fact, it is expected
Fiona 09:30 PM
I hear Josh would be there
Chris 09:30 PM
[Replying to "I hear Josh would be there"]
I’m only optimistic he will be there, and I am praying he is.
The WCT 09:30 PM
I wouldn't be surprised if Chris going to Everfree NW helped boost attendance.
Chris 09:30 PM
He is returning to the states very shortly.
Fiona 09:30 PM
[Replying to "I’m only optimistic he will be there, and I am praying he is."]
You know I'll be checked in to the hotel at 4:00pm
Bella 09:30 PM
i didnt think he got involved as much as he used to
Chris 09:31 PM
Cool
The Fool 09:31 PM
josh is never going to be out of the game because he's burdened with a deep sense of guilt for being responsible in christine's trolling
The WCT 09:31 PM
[Replying to "josh is never going to be out of the game because he's burdened with a deep sense of guilt for being responsible in christine's trolling"]
he's repaying his debt to Chris.
Without Chris, there's no Kiwi Farms.
The Fool 09:32 PM
or maybe that
Chris 09:32 PM
Y’all want to see two really fun drawings out of yesterday’s commissions that I feel are appropriate?
One of them actually requested me with a certain logo.
The Fool 09:32 PM
I don't remember his wording perfectly
Bella 09:32 PM
id love too!
The Fool 09:32 PM

Fiona 09:32 PM

Yeah definitely
Chris 09:33 PM
These do not go public for now, not until when I get the t-shirt for real, at least.
The Fool 09:33 PM

Fiona 09:34 PM

That's the drawing you told me about the giant!
Chris 09:35 PM
Yeah, the last request of yesterday was just me with my arm around a tall guy with long hair and a mustache, so I had fun with one of my favourite things to think when I see anyone taller than me.
Fiona 09:35 PM

Chris 09:38 PM
Snoopy-Doo ended up adding two feet of height onto his self-counterpart’s body when the two merged last week.
The Fool 09:40 PM
where's snoopy living in cwcville now? he got his own place?
Chris 09:41 PM
Actually, his variant was working out in the UK; he has been really working out and loves to do so.
He even likes wearing metal armour to limit himself so he can be even stronger without the armour.
Magi-Chan had to teleport the merged Snoopy-Doo to Cwcville to brief him better.
The Fool 09:42 PM
ooh, thats really cool. I would have thought he'd be in cwcville given he lived in the temple
why the UK?
Chris 09:46 PM
[Replying to "ooh, thats really cool. I would have thought he'd be in cwcville given he lived in the temple"]
Okay, here is the thing on that: the Snoopy-Doo and Clover-Doo of C-197 are anthromorphic dogs.
Christine Chan’s Barbara actually passed away within the past couple of years, in clearing the paradox between her and Barbie, here.
And with that, Christine Chan allowed Snoopy and Clover to be free and find themselves, and so they did.
And Snoopy-Doo traveled to the UK, because in his warrior mentality and interests, Knights were among his inspirational imagery.
So, he went to there to bask and be enarmoured for his chiseled abs and great beagle physique.
I will have to get back to you on what Clover-Doo, there, is presently up to.
Also, we watched the new Rick and Morty last night on the Adult Swim app; did Anyone else get reminded from the hellspawn of Beastly from the Care Bears series?

I don't watch much R&M but I know about Beastly because my baby niece is addicted to Care Bares lol

I’m actually attracted to Gen 2 Care Bears when they were more active and individualistic.

Chris 09:55 PM
[Replying to "nono the girl with the star on her stomach who ha dteh movie about her was my favorite"]

Anaxis's summary
The WCT shares that he had just spoken to Chris, who had been thinking of MKR lately, and that WCT had shared more of the "Toxic Trio's" bullying in response to confirm that they are irredeemable. Silvia then shares a text exchange she had with Chris, where she asks for a copy of some of Chris's TSSSF cards, and Chris insists on sending them to her for free. Silvia and the Fool remark that this may be a positive development for Chris.

Weston Haiku
29 July 2021
Main article: Weston Haiku
Anaxis's summary
Chris comes into the server to share a Haiku that he had written to remember the birth order of Barb and her seven siblings. I comment on how many there are.
In the second layer, I note that Chris had swapped the positions of Harriet and Madeline according to the Weston family tree, and that Chris had referred to many of the siblings by their middle names rather than their first names. I speculate that this might have been a quirk of Barb's that Chris had picked up on.

Chris 09:21 AM
Good morning, everyone.
I have an inspired bit of poetry to share.
I am reminded of Barbara’s big family, as she is child number five out of eight children of the Weston household from Red Oak, Virginia.
The oldest to youngest are as follows: Edna, Stanley, Corina, Leroy, Barbara, Harriet, Madeline, and Wayne.
And to also help remember this very order, I am inspired to manifest a Haiku.

Chris sends what would be his final messages in the Knights server, requesting donations to his PayPal account, which he wants to be kept confidential. The Knights write lightly positive messages in response. Chris later shares that he had been "revoked" from Everfree Northwest, to which WCT asks how it happened and I ask how he is currently doing. Chris answers neither of us and instead states that he will go "radio silent" for a while.
