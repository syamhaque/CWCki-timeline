“
Christine...Please stop this, Mewtwo is not real, the merge is not happening, you need serious help. If you need help there are people to help you with these delusions. This is incredibly unhealthy for you.

Wendy Scandal

Aqua attempting to distance herself from her Wendy persona.[4]
Before becoming a white-knight of Chris's, Aqua attempted to troll Chris by fabricating a story regarding his advances on a new gal-pal he had allegedly met named "Wendy" in March 2019, taking clear inspiration from Chris' interactions with Megan Schroeder. While posting as "Wendy", Aqua attempted to frame Chris for sexually harassing her, though Aqua also posted as a seperate person when posting about these interactions on Twitter.[5] Aqua posted the following:
Wendy (Aqua)
A couple of months ago, I was befriended by someone I had no idea existed. I added her, as she seemed nice at first, and we even exchanged phone numbers, but she started sending creepy and disturbing messages, commenting on my body, and other things about me. She started talking about how she can see people who don't really exist, and how she's in a polygamist relationship with fictional people, including a Pokémon. She has copyrighted characters that fuse into one, and she has tried to make it her own franchise for years. Her name is Christine Weston Chandler. Before a few days ago, I had no idea she had an awful history on the Internet and with women. She used pet names on me (Such as Dolly, Darling, Cutie, Her Bug, and others) which I have told her to stop using, but she kept going. A few days ago, I have had enough. She asked me what bra size I was because she longed for larger breasts (she is apparently pretending to be a woman, but I am still going to respect her pronouns to cause less trouble on me), and she even tells me since I'm a bigger woman, which really insulted me to the core. She's even said every day her characters are complimenting me, which is probably her hiding how she felt about me. I have seen the videos, seen stories about her old friends, and I've seen what awful people have done to her, but I have heard about the Too Many Games convention incident. I was there at that convention. I remember seeing a scene of an oddly smelling person with a giant picture of a yellow sonic being thrown as they curled up resisting security. I thought nothing of it, but now I'm truly horrified knowing I was talking to that person for several months without knowing a single thing. I am so glad I know now. And press keep an eye out, someone could be a dangerous threat to you.
This trolling plan had failed, however, since Chris denied the allegations several times, stating that he never talked to anyone named "Wendy". It had also resulted in Chris blocking Aqua on Twitter on 26 March 2019.[6] Aqua responded to this by mocking Chris, posting about how Chris gave up his chance to prove himself innocent. Owls had also made a post on Kiwi Farms about people on Twitter telling Aqua to stop acussing Chris of these allegations.[7]
In an attempt to try and regain Chris's trust, Aqua tried to distance herself from the Wendy persona by making posts on Twitter about how Wendy manipulated her into framing Chris. In those posts she sent a screencap of the following texts:
My Girl Wendy (Aqua)
Thank you for helping me frame
Chris, [REDACTED][note 3] you and your friends
fell for it and now I get to see a
person get justice! I knew about
Chris, and a friend and I faked those
screenshots and made SURE those
were real enough, and believe it or
not you fell for it. We hate Chris, and
we needed to do something, so
thanks for getting into deep shit for
me ;) like I said I knew you'd have
my back, that's why I used you. I
knew he targeted you a while back
and I needed to avenge you, with
help ofc. Tell aqua and them I'm
sorry they're suckers, and I hope
Chris and his army fall and he dies
soon. You can block me after this
but I hope Chris gets arrested. All of
those screenshots? Meeeee and a
coworkers help! I don't even work at
McDonald's! You believed that?
Holy shit you're stupid!!!!! 🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿🖕🏿
have fun getting
out of this one, you only just started
with his slow arrest! JUSTICE FOR
MEGAN SCHROEDER!!!!!! BYE
Aqua
Wow. Eat shit and die
Involvement with the Watchmen
Aqua was one of the earlier members of the Watchmen.
In September 2020, Aqua confirmed in the comments of a Dillin Thomas video that they were no longer a part of the Watchmen.
in all honesty at first i genuinly wanted to help chris but after the incident with Wendy i wanted to make things better, and try to help him, and as someone with autism, and who has family that acts like chris, i knew how dificult it is to get them to beleive certain things. I guess going along with it and pretending to be a goddess was better than letting her be on her own and let someone else take advantage of her.
Note that i never wanted anything from Chris, and did want to help, and despite what Dillin says about MKR or some of the "enamblers, not all of them are bad, MKR is the nicest person i know and i know that she truely does care for Chris.
I wanted to to help them with keeping sockness away from Chris and though it took some time ive seen chris is no longer taking his crap serious. I do keep up to date whats been going on, but i dont interact.[8]
Attempts to Reconnect
“
By the way, #AquaDiamond, so you know, Val has progressed very well. I even managed to get him a new body; he’s about 4’3”, I estimate. Anyway, check in with me if you get this comment, AD. Be safe and well.
”
Chris trying to regain contact with Aqua
Chris had
attempted to get back into contact with Aqua on 20 July 2021, posting a tweet that had a hashtag of her screen name. Because of this The WCT wanted to give her a chance to "change sides," which Anaxis had protest against since she had been friends with MKR. WCT still expresses an intent to try, and attempts to reassure him by stating that Aqua would initially only be allowed in the server's first layer.[9]
[REDACTED] 1:49 AM
Chris is trying to get back in contact with Aquadiamond.

The WCT 01:53 AM
[Replying to "Chris is trying to get back in contact with Aquadiamond."]
I'll give her a chance.
she doesn't know the truth.
I will do my hardest to tell Aqua everything and convince her to change sides. But it won't be easy.
Anaxis 03:03 AM
I don't know her, but if she was friends with MKR, then idk if it's worth it
The WCT 03:04 AM
[Replying to "I don't know her, but if she was friends with MKR, then idk if it's worth it"]
I'd try having a talk with her in VC like we did before.
and for cautionary measures, i'd only allow her to be in First Layer before she can go any further.
OCs
Like with her friend MKRNightVee, Aqua produced a number of OCs that would become prominent to Chris's lore. The characters that Aqua created originated from the Dimension ZX-49, which is dubbed as the "Macbook Pro Dimension".
CPU Aqua
AquaDiamond8 and Magi-Chan. Drawn by Aqua November 2019.
“
Aqua is the CPU of the Mac Book Pro computer. With her partner, Val Valentino, she does her best for everyone as she is able to. She has a bit of a temper and will rush into a situation if she feels her friends are in danger. Not sure if its a flaw, she's a little gullable [sic] from past mistakes, but she is learning from them.
”
Description of CPU Aqua on her TSSSF card.[10]
In November 2019, during the Arbitarch Saga, in hopes to lure Chris away from Sockness, Aqua joined the Arbitarch CWC Alliance and embraced Chris's delusional beliefs, changing her Twitter handle to CPU Goddess Aqua of the Mac Book Pro. Later, Aqua began drawing fanart of her OC interacting with Magi-Chan.[11] She then posted a Pokémon drawing, claiming it to be an alt-dimension Magi-Chan:[12]
Chris had implemented the CPU Aqua character in a few of his Secret Shipfic cards.
Val Valentino
Aqua also created the OC Val Valentino as her interpretation of Magi-Chan, as well as CPU Aqua's companion. Aqua was the first person to play the character before passing the role off to the Watchmen who named themselves after them, Val.
On 12 December 2019, after ranting about ProjectSNT's redesign of Wild Sonichu, stating it looked like a Rokat, Aqua tried to discourage Chris from explaining the lore. Afterwards, Chris proceeded to roleplay as Val Valentino in an attempt to convince Aqua to draw fanart.[13]
Kylechu
Aqua also created Kylechu, the persona that would later be taken on by Watchman Kyle.
Art
Aqua drew art for Chris.

Notes
↑ Created a rumor involving Chris sexually harassing a made-up gal-pal "Wendy".
↑ After Chris had blocked her on Twitter, Aqua tried to present herself as being manipulated by "Wendy", who she presented as a seperate person, rather than her persona.
↑ In the screencap, Aqua censored a name, presumably her own.
