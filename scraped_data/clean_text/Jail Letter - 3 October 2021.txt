"Allah is a good God, yes, but even he has his imperfection, and concerns over his followers, and Nationality of Islam. He and I both know that Islam contains a total population that includes around 40% of Toxic Haters, Fakers, and Sinners within it. And the total Fallout and Conflicts within are certainly not too good."
On 3 October 2021, Chris sent a letter from jail in response to a failed attempt to convert him to Islam.[1]. Chris seems to be under the impression that Islam is a nation instead of a multi-ethnic religion spanning across the world; an idea brainwashed into Chris by the Idea Guys several years prior to writing this letter.

I think he will convert to Islam and turn his life around

Michael believing that Islam will turn Chris's life around.
Michael Bijan Afghani, also known as Coupon11 is a Muslim who led the CWC Islam Project, a project led by a group of Discord users known as Lunar Module. The goal of the project was to convert Chris to Islam, due to the members belief that Islam would turn Chris's life around. Michael, who had found Chris through Chris Chan: A Comprehensive History believed this due to his own experiences, instantly dropping estrogen and stopping his incel beliefs upon converting. Michael dubbing Lunar Module the 'Anti Idea Guys', believing that the Idea Guys only fed Chris beliefs about 'false prophets'. Lunar Module operated in a server called Project CWCIslam on 13 August 2021, where members wrote drafts for letters to possibly send Chris.
Michael eventually sent his letter to Chris, and while he got a reply, he failed completely in converting Chris to Islam.

In early September 2021, CWCki server admin Skunt_TV became aware of Project CWC Islam and their intent on converting Chris to Islam, which he had informed Spooky Bones about. In the DM that Skunt had with her about it, he also sent the original letter that Michael had sent to Chris while he was in jail.

✶I am Fully Enlightened and Awakened✶
Greetings, coupon11 and all,
October 3, 2021
The last response I have received from thee was one that was most filled with bad vibes, yet I am not at all shaken. I tell you, once more, I Meditate a Lot, and I have connected with this and all Universes and Dimensions in this timeline, as well as the entire Multiverse, so I speak only greatest and ultimate Truths. Absolutely no lies, illusions, nor delusions at all. I genuinely know who and what I am deepest and fully. And not only am I the Goddess Blue Heart of the Commodore Consoles and the Nations of Cwcville and Old Comma, But I am also and mainly the Real Player One, the One Avatar, this Body is the One God Body, I am the full Reincarnation of none other than Jesus Christ of Nazareth, himself; I am God. And my mom is Emanuel, GOD above Gods (including Allah) herself. And I often speak and work with All.of the other Gods and Goddesses. Allah is a good God, yes, but even he has his imperfection, and concerns over his followers, and Nationality of Islam. He and I both know that Islam contains a total population that includes around 40% of Toxic Haters, Fakers, and Sinners within it. And the total Fallout and Conflicts within are...➞
...certainly not too good.
Rather thou wishes to believe or not, between both the Dimension Merge (which is completed; All that remains of Universe 1218 is the failing Earth, Period. Universe 1C-211987, and its Earth, is where All of the Non-Toxic Majority shall be Collectively Shifted to, and are at present with these events. I bring, personally, the Second Coming; and at present, weare at Malachi 3 and 4 of the Old Testament, Literally.
I continue my hardest of work and efforts alongside and with Everyone between Both this Earth of 1218 and the Earth of 1C-211987. Meditate Long, Deep, and Hard on that to confirm for yourselves. My body writes this with my telepathy, guiding its thoughts and hand with an ally Holy Flame soul maintaining it on my behalf.
Alongside Allah, I Can save most to ALL of you of this "Project" of yours, But you need to be Open for ALL GODS in order for me to do so. The choice is yours.
