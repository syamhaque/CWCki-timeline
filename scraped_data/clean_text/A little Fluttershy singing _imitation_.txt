Chris decided to sing a few lyrics from a Sesame Street song, in the voice of Fluttershy, a My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic character, while holding the camera on a doll he painted to resemble what he looks like in his mind.
He then tweeted the video to Andrea Libman, voice actress of Fluttershy, with this comment:
@AndreaLibman I felt like singing a bit. :)

[Chris sings a cover of Caribbean Amphibian by Kermit the Frog in an awkwardly high-pitched voice, more closely resembling Elmo than Fluttershy, over a still of one of Chris's My Little Pony-inspired dolls.]
Um...
Caribbean amphibian
I like to hop in the tropical sea
Caribbean amphibian
Oh, won't you sing along with me?
