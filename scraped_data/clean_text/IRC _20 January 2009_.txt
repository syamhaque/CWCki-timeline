Artist's depiction.
On 20 January 2009, Chris engaged in another IRC chat with many important figures, such as Clyde Cash, BILLY MAYS, Sarah May, Ignatius J. Reilly, and minor appearances from Cogsdev and The Man in the Pickle Suit (canine).
Chris enters the chat, and asks Clyde Cash about why he is being harassed. When Clyde says it's because Chris caused Ryan to commit suicide, Chris attempts to compare the loss of his dog to Clyde's loss of his human brother. When this fails, Chris tells Clyde that the best thing for him is to move on, seek a sweetheart or guidance from a church, further adding, "You do not need religion to see a counsoler."
When pressed by Clyde about the release of Sonichu comics, Chris blames a lack of inspiration and tries to change the subject to Family Guy, despite Clyde repeatedly telling him he's attempting to hide the truth by lying and changing the subject. Chris then attempts to use stress as another excuse, going into a long and pointless monologue, ignoring everyone in the chat. He reveals some of the sources of his stress, notably his father and cleaning the house. He continues to lie when asked about how he could have prevented Ryan's death.
Clyde switches the topic to Chris's homosexuality, to which Chris replies, "I am straight, it is you who are the homo." Chris is asked about the purchase of his sex toys, including a dildo, which he says came with the purchase of one of his blow-up dolls, and the only reason he has this dildo now is to give to his future sweetheart. He also states that he has spent most of his life with female friends, and has therefore picked up interests that primarily apply to women, such as My Little Pony action figures. Clyde goes on to say that Chris is just a man who wants to be a woman, and brings up the picture of Chris in his mother's underwear as an example. Chris proceeds to make the now-infamous admission that he has "NUMBERS OF PAIRS OF DIRTY, CRAPPED BRIEFS." After having a moment to recover from that statement, Clyde and BILLY MAYS continue to accuse Chris of homosexuality, to which Chris retorts with such brilliant quotes as "I am rubber, you are glue; whatever you say bounces off me and sticks to you," as well as continuing to rant on and on about how he's straight. BILLY MAYS sums up Chris quite nicely: "YOU KNOW, NOT FOR NOTHING, BUT I KNOW I'M STRAIGHT, IF SOMEBODY CALLS ME GAY, I DON'T FEEL A NEED TO RANT ABOUT IT FOR TEN MINUTES."
Ironically, years after this chat, Clyde Cash's words about Chris' desire to dress like a woman would come to pass.
In a return to discussion about Sonichu, Chris says that Sonichu is perfectly legal as it is a parody of Sonic and Pikachu. Clyde then informs Chris of the dire fact that Sonichu will never be successful with any company. Chris then responds to Clyde's hacking of the Sonichu websites with "I do not like it, but I OWE YOU NO REACTION" and that he does not want to fight back against Clyde except in person. Sarah May then enters the chat to defend Chris from Clyde, and after some discussion about homosexual fans of Sonichu being trolls, Ignatius J. Reilly enters the chat and tells Chris about what his comic has inspired him to do, notably create Gay 4 Sonichu. Chris states that he appreciates gay friends, so long as they are nothing more than "good acquaintances." Reilly then says that the reasons the comic appeals to the gay community are the rainbows, the fact that most of the women are drawn like men, Megagi's relationship with Bionic, and the Sonichu Balls. What follows is Chris continuing to defend his straightness, while Reilly says that Chris's sexual insecurity and the things that Sonichu has done for the gay community is enough reason for him to come out of the closet. Chris finally explodes with a fit of rage, stating that "I AM FUCKING STRAIGHT FOR WOMEN, THEIR VAGINAS, THEIR BREASTS, and most importantly, I AM STRAIGHT FOR THEIR INDIVIDUAL SWEETNESS." Finally, he says that he only came out of the closet as a straight autistic, and shouts his usual "Peace out" before quitting the chat.

20:34 <%ChrisChanSonichu> Ryan, I understand the loss has been REALLY TOUGH on you emotionally and physically, and I understand your reasons behind why you've been shooting off smoke like you are now. But you should really speak to a counsoler at a local church to help you put things back in perspective with your life.
20:34 <@clydeC> I HAVE NO RELIGION
20:34 <@clydeC> SO WHY SHOULD I GO TO CHURCH
20:34 <@clydeC> LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING CHRIS
20:34 <@clydeC> WHY WOULD YOU RELEASE COMICS SO SLOWLY
20:34 <%ChrisChanSonichu> You do not need religion to see a counsoler.

20:45 <%ChrisChanSonichu> Why does one feel soo saddened to become unable to draw comics at will as easily and swiftly as before? Why can't one trust someone trust others as easily now right-off at the start? Why does one take emotinal bullets of lies, deciet, slanders, accusations and the like?
20:46 <@clydeC> THAT ISN'T ANSWERING MY GOD DAMN QUESTION
20:46 <@clydeC> WHY ARE YOU NOT ANSWERING THEM

20:48 <%ChrisChanSonichu> Stress from life's problems of bullies, janitorial duties, loss of lives and friendships from others, a father who starts more arguements than there are flies at a garbage dump, and sooo many other stressors only add up to an emotional breakdown, and then inability to feel well enough to complete a task as swiftly as before the matter.

21:12 <@clydeC> EXACTLY CHRIS
21:12 <@clydeC> YOUR FRIENDS ARE FEMALE
21:12 <@clydeC> YOU"RE OBVIOUSLY AFRAID OF MALES BECAUSE YOU MIGHT HAVE POP A BONER WHILE YOU'RE NEXT TO THEM
21:12 <%ChrisChanSonichu> But I can safely say that a LOT OF MEN have a Good Number of Female Friends.
21:12 <@clydeC> YEAH, BUT THEY'RE BANGING THEM
21:12 <@clydeC> WHAT ABOUT YOU
21:13 <@clydeC> YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT YOUR "FEELINGS" AND SHIT
21:13 <@clydeC> FACE IT, YOU WANT TO BE A GIRL
21:13 <@clydeC> YOU WANT A MAN DEEP INSIDE YOU
21:13 <%ChrisChanSonichu> That, sir is INCORRECT.
21:13 <@clydeC> YOU WANT TO WEAR A BRA AND PANTIES
21:13 <@clydeC> OH WAIT, YOU HAVE!

21:14 <@clydeC> THAT ISN'T CLOTHING CHRIS
21:14 <@clydeC> IT IS YOUR DESIRE TO BE A GIRL
21:14 <@clydeC> THAT IS SHOWING
21:14 <%ChrisChanSonichu> Bras and Panties are considered UNDERWEAR, and UNDERWEAR is a type of CLOTHING.
21:14 <@clydeC> LOOK, I KNOW EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE
21:14 <@BILLY_MAYS> T-SHIRT = CLOTHING, BRA = FEMALE SUPPORT GARMENT
21:14 <@clydeC> LOOK, BRAS ARE FOR FEMALES
21:14 <@clydeC> SO EXPLAIN THAT
21:15 <@clydeC> AND SO ARE PANTIES, UNLESS YOU'RE GAY
21:15 <@clydeC> WHICH YOU ARE
21:15 <%ChrisChanSonichu> Brief and Boxer = Clothing as well.
21:15 <@clydeC> BUT THOSE ARE FOR GUYS
21:15 <@clydeC> WHICH YOU DON'T WEAR APPARENTLY
21:15 <@clydeC> BECAUSE YOU WEAR PANTIES
21:15 <%ChrisChanSonichu> I have NUMBERS OF PAIRS OF DIRTY, CRAPPED BRIEFS.

22:04 <@clydeC> OH, HE'S THE STRAIGHT ONE?
22:04 <%ChrisChanSonichu> even though he had the best over me in that battle.
22:04 <@clydeC> I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
22:04 <@clydeC> SO YOU'RE GAY
22:04 <@canine> so, you're suppressing your homosexual urges?
22:04 <@clydeC> JUST AS I THOUGHT
22:04 <@cogsdev> so you advocate beating up gays?
22:04 <+QueerSonichuLuvr> Dr. Kinsey said most men have homosexual urges.
22:04 <%Sarah_May> Clyde stop being such a child!
22:04 <@cogsdev> that's just barbaric
22:05 <%ChrisChanSonichu> I, Christian Weston Chandler am STRAIGHT; Reldnahc Notsew Naitirhc is the homo.
22:05 <+falsion> I don't know about you, but I don't have a gay counterpart.
22:05 <@BILLY_MAYS> <%ChrisChanSonichu> Reldhach Notsew Naitsirhc is the COMPLETE OPPOSITE OF ME, the straight man
22:05 <@BILLY_MAYS> HA!

22:06 <%ChrisChanSonichu> Because I HAVE IMMATURE JERKS LIKE YOU BUNCH TO TELL THE TRUE INFORMATION TO OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN
22:06 <@clydeC> YOU CAN JUST SAY YOU'RE STRAIGHT
22:06 <@clydeC> BUT THAT'S NOT PROOF
22:06 <@clydeC> YOU CAN SAY I'M GAY
22:06 <@clydeC> BUT WHERE"S YOUR PROOF
22:06 <+QueerSonichuLuvr> Chris, if you're so certain about your sexuality, why defend it?
22:06 <@cogsdev> clyde, we're not jerks, we just want the truth
22:06 <+QueerSonichuLuvr> It was you who said in your advice video not to listen to the peanuts.
22:06 <+falsion> What did I say? You can repeat yourself 100 times. I can tell you 100 times that the sky is green. IS IT?
22:06 <+QueerSonichuLuvr> Your words have inspired so many gays.
22:06 <+falsion> No, it's blue.

22:07 <%ChrisChanSonichu> GET IT THROUGH YOUR THICK SKULLS AS YOU FUCKING POSSIBLY CAN, I AM FUCKING STRAIGHT FOR WOMEN, THEIR VAGINAS, THEIR BREASTS, and most importantly, I AM STRAIGHT FOR THEIR INDIVIDUAL SWEETNESS.
22:07 <@clydeC> NOT ALL WOMEN ARE SWEET
22:07 <@clydeC> MY EX WAS A FIESTY BITCH
22:07 <+QueerSonichuLuvr> Indeed.
22:07 <@BILLY_MAYS> WOW, YOU'RE SWEARING
22:07 <@clydeC> BUT DAMN I LOVED HER
22:07 <@BILLY_MAYS> THAT'S A SPICY MEAT-A-BALL
22:07 <@canine> chris, you're very sexist
22:07 <@clydeC> TOO BAD SHE'S DEAD
22:07 <+QueerSonichuLuvr> Several broke my hearts :(
22:07 <+QueerSonichuLuvr> But then I read Sonichu comics and saw how great it is to be gay.
22:07 <@clydeC> GOD, YOU ARE UNBELIEVABLE SEXIST
22:07 <+QueerSonichuLuvr> And then I came out of the closet.
22:07 <%ChrisChanSonichu> I DESPISE MEN for their IMMATURITY and CRUELTY.
22:07 <+QueerSonichuLuvr> Now I live with my boyfriend.
22:07 <@clydeC> WHAT
22:07 <%Sarah_May> LISTEN TO HIM! YOU'RE ALL SO DISGUSTING!
22:07 <+QueerSonichuLuvr> And it's so great.
22:08 <@cogsdev> yeah chris, you're right
22:08 <@cogsdev> you call everyone a jerk like a child
22:08 <@cogsdev> and cruelly dismiss your gay fans
22:08 <@cogsdev> and advocate their brutal beating

22:08 <@clydeC> I KNEW HE WAS PRETENDING!
22:08 <+QueerSonichuLuvr> Also Chris, lots of your male characters in your comics are totally passive.
22:08 <+QueerSonichuLuvr> Just like so many gay guys I know.
