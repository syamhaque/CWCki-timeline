================================================================================

"Thriller" is the 14th track from SPARKLE like you mean it: ROBEE'S BALLAD by Robee Sonee and the Tomgirls. It is a cover of the song "Thriller" by Michael Jackson, a song that makes references to the themes of classic '50s horror cinema, and has absolutely nothing to do with cross-dressing. Why Chris included it on an album of tomgirl-themed songs is anyone's guess.

Lyrics
[sung over Michael Jackson's "Thriller"]
Its close to midnight-night!
Something evils lurkin in the dark.
Under-der moon light, you see a sights thats almost stops your heart.
You try to scream but terror takes the sound before you make it
(anticipating start of line)y-y-you start to freeze as horror looks you right between the eyes,
You're paralyzed!
Cause this is thriller! Thriller night!
No ones gonna save you from the beast about to strike.
Th-the thriller! Thriller night!
(speeds ahead of Michael Jackson)
You're fightin-fightin for your life inside a killer thriller tonight!
You hear the door-sloor slam
And realize there’s nowhere left to run.
You feel the cold hand and wonder if you’ll ever see the sun.
You close your eyes, and hope that this is just imagination girl!
But all, all the while, you hear the creature creeping up behind.
You’re out of time!
Cause this is thriller, thriller night,
Ain’t no second chance against the thing with forty eyes, girl,
Thriller, Thriller night!
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight!
C-creatures calling, dead start to walk in their masquerade.(Struggles to pronounce this word)
There's no escapin’ the jaws of the alien dis time … they’re open wide!
This is the end of your life.
‘Bout to get-shit you, [mumbling] on every side.
They will possess you, unless you change that number on your dial.
Now this the time, for you and I to cuddle close together, yeah!
Oh, all through the night, I’ll save you from the terror on the screen.
I’ll make you see.
That this is thrillaaa, thriller night
Cause I can drill you more than any ghosts would ever dare try,
Thriller! Thriller night!
Let me hold you tight and share a killer, diller chiller shriller here tonight!
Cause this is thriller, thriller night!
Girl, I can drill you more than any ghosts would ever dare try,
Thriller! Thriler night!
Jackie, let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller, ow!
Gonna thrill you tonight!
(Vincent Price begins his monologue, Chris misses the start)
…ness has crossed the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blooood
To terrorize ya’lls neighborhood!
I’m thrillyoutonight …
(Incoherant mumbling, thankfully drowned out by Vincent Price. Sounds like he’s quietly repeating the lines.)
I’m gonna thrill you tonight! Oh baby!
I'm gonna thrill tonight! Oh Jackie Baby!
Thriller night baby! Ooooohh
Baby, Jackie, baby. Ooh I’m gonna thrill you tonight!
Foul stench in the air, the funk of forty-thousand years,
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb,
Are closing in to seal to your doom.
And though you fight to stay alive, your body starts to shiver.
For no mere mortal can resist;
The evil of the ThriLLAR!
(Ending laugh cuts off after almost a second)
