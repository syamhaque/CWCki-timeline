December 2012 was the final month of Chris's least active year since his discovery. It was also Chris's second C-Mas without his father. With him making it past this month without returning to YouTube, 2012 officially has the distinction of being the first year since trolling began that Chris hadn't uploaded a single video.
December 2012 was also the month where Nintendo Power ceased publication.
