Anyway... oh! I've upgraded to a lovely little angled roof on my house. And... mostly cobblestone I had- made mostly stone brick! I had to leave cobblestone with where is... for... Well, do you really wanna chop down cobblestone just- chop... the way the cobblestone to, put the posters back up to get the [unintelligible] like it was before? [impression] Tha-aat's a real time waster! And not to mention the size you had on those cobblestone bricks where you have to retype that from memory? That's another detail. [impression] That's another detail! And I should take a picture of it. Doot-doot dee-doot... [singing]
[impression] And where's the other guy? Beep-beep! "C'mon move it!" *weeh!* Darn traffic jam.
Moving on up. We're moving all up. To the east side, to the apartment in the sky. Woo hoo we on up, moving all up to the east side. To Tiiinaa's apartment.
Wee-zee(?)! Get torch! [unintelligible] At least you did good on the show. To Tiiina's apartment.
Anyway yeah just dropping it right there, but dropping it there didn't get me the achievement! Now, hey guys: stay up there. And I don't think I'd just be able to simply just drop it right below me at that height.
Well let's try this then. Okey-dokey... [achievement noise] Lol, I didn't even place scaffolding yet. Well now I did. [jumps down the pillar] Wee!
Oh yeah, so of course I've been earning most of my achievements on the Switch at this point, even though I earned a lot over that's been recorded on my PlayStation network account. Hmm but yeah let's see...
I'm just walking around needing to... one of my few lamas.
Alright so I- my seed code I looked up online at least in regards to java when this was originally made and latest bedrock edition, and to my firm believe and considering I know that the way south had a lot of ocean between it which that was confirmed, I confirmed that there is uh, an ender porner- an ender portal to the east and to the west.
Let's see if we can get her(?) to join in after a nap. But yeah essentially we're gonna go ender portal hunting. As you might know I have over 30, and I've looked up another video online and looked at my seed code online. I think it's called chunkbed.com. Um, I'll be sure to put a link in the description to that particular webpage. But I have a good feeling that y'know I'll be able to pick it out
So now it's time waiting for the day to arrive, or 3 more players to hit the hay.
Anyway, once we get going I'm gonna search to the east. And I'll mark the path with torches and there's an ocean in the way and maybe... I'll use cobblestone to make a bridge. [impression] "It's your idea and that's a plan!" Nobody ordered people flan with that. Well...
[sneezes] Ohh bless me.
Yep, village is blocked off. Security is... only two villagers in there, one of them is a librarian.
Another day till I feel the fishes(?) a random-random moment. Oh, [impression] "Any comment about what happened to trump lately?" Yeah. That's the first time. The next time he's shot *snap* that'll hit 'em. And ding-dong the trump is dead. And so will Vladimir Putin. By his own sword though. You can quote me on that. Premonitions.
Heh, generation 2 changeables(?) that's my favorite cheeseburger. Is this like bumblebee wearing a sweater? Hehe, I dunno I thought it was cute. [transforms toy] I mean that's just a simple 3 step classic.
Alright let's see: Rises from the east, sets in the west, I wanna go east. Let's confirm so, if we do this correctly one ender pearl should guide us. Go ruby!
Alright, lets saddle up and make tracks! *coughs* excuse me. Oh that helps! A path I made already.
That helps, a bridge I made already. [singing] Adventure time! C'mon grab your friends, go to the fairy, this is lands [unintelligible] Jesus Christ's [unintelligible] It's times you'll find, [unintelligible] The funland never ends; it's adventure time!
Okay so this is good... [throws pearl] I couldn't tell where I went, I think there's a (?) right above me.
Oh- Okay there it is... Okay still gotta go that way.
Alright, anyway this looks like a good place to... give this another toss. Ok... still that away. Okay, going uphill.
Okey-dokey, this is [unintelligible] doo-doo doo-doo... tada-tada... [whistles and sings]
Four versions of the same game, so many achievements and trophies.
[starts watching a video explaining minecraft enchantments and weapons] [skips forward] Ah, let's see about that enchantment.
Oh! This (is) the first time I've seen one of these bees. Oh, and bonfire... gonna make a note of this location... (makes a picture of the game screen with phone)
Alright my intuition tells me to check, so I'm gonna check again... (throws pearl, which flies up and bursts into an explosion) ... it broke! Okay, that's the first time I saw that explode. Let's see...
Hm, oh- looks like we're still going.
[does an impression] "Hey! (?) You better respect that boat! It's a very nice boat." "It's for a disabled person you dumb fucks." "Well then I guess if it's for a disabled person then it [unintelligible] some more."
[Creeper and zombie approach the entrance of the house she's in] Oh...
Heh, [shoots and kills the creeper and zombie] Okay well that was actually kinda cute, the zombie wanted to...
protect the creeper... Lol.
[starts watching the first azumanga opening] Oh, the sun's coming up.
Heh, lol. [azumanga still playing in the background] Hehe, lol. He didn't like being compared to the prime minister. [does an impression of the lines playing in the video] "Oh, he's-a sorry. She's-a sorry." Oh that looks like a boat!
[watching more minecraft explanation videos] Hmm, ok that's a good deal.
Mm, lol! Okay. Alright, well thanks to the help of my friends we found... ender portal. I get to put it together. [warps] Wow.
Alright well you know what, I'm gonna leave it at that. At least I'll be able to find my way back easily. Alright, so we have found an ender dome, and I believe in a future video we will take on the ender dragon. So, I'm gonna say that's it for now for this lovely little recording. Y'all have a good day and a safe night. Take care.
