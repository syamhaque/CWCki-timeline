Bob: Hello?
Craig: Hello, Robert! This is Craig and Amfermee, how are you doing?
Bob: Not too swift.
Craig: No?
Bob: No...
Craig: A- are you feeling better?
Bob: No, not really.
Craig: Uh, your wife told us that we- that you got out of the hospital, and we just wanted to see how you're doing.
Bob: Well, I- I got through the surgery okay.
Craig: Well that's good, that's good. But h-how is your day?
Bob: P- pretty boring.
Craig: Oh really? Why is that?
Bob: Well... I got other little problems too.
Craig: Oh, okay, alright. What kind of problems?
Amfermee: What happened?
Bob: I also have had two triple bypasses, and three heart attacks, and a pacemaker.
Craig: Oh wow.
Amfermee: Oh damn.
Craig: Oh man, Bob.
Bob: And... and then... on top of this surgery and stuff, I'm now gettin', um, fluid build up in my foot, and feet, and legs. Which could lead, I guess, to heart failure.
Craig: Ah no...
Bob: But I'm fightin' it. But anyway, I've been better.
Craig: Well that's good Ro- that's good, Bobby, that's good. You know, I- I really hope that you pull through this, you know?
Bob: Oh, I will. [Bob then tries to say something but is interrupted.]
Craig: That's good. I-is it possible- is it- Oh, sorry? [No reply from Bob.] So- so what're you watching, Bobby?
Bob: Wheel of Fortune.
Craig: Aw nice!
Bob: What else?
Craig: Oh nothin', I'm just asking, you know. I- I thought you might be a Price Is Right fan, you know? [Awkward silence.]
Bob: Anyway...
Amfermee: [brief laugh]
Craig: Is it- is it possible, Bobby, that we could talk to Chris?
Amfermee: Is- uh-
Bob: W-we'll make it, alright.
Craig: Well that's good.
Bob: I just- just hangin' in.
Craig: Well that's good! You know, cuz you- I was thinking about- I was thinking about you for the past couple days after we spoke to your wife, and I was actually- I was actually praying for you, you know? Uh...
Bob: I ma- I made it through. I could've died in surgery real easy.
Craig: Oh... Bob...
Amfermee: Oh man, that's scary to think about.
Craig: That is, that is.
Bob: Well, you just- you take 'em, and you take what comes, I guess.
Craig: Well yeah. Well, you know, you're a pretty strong man, you know. You served in Korea. You know, and tha- if you survive Korea, you know, you could pretty much survive anything.
Amfermee: [Whispering to Craig] Ask for Chris. Ask for Chris.
Craig: Uh, hey, uh, Bobby, is it possible that we could talk to Chris?
Bob: No, he's not here.
Craig: Oh okay. Alright. So, wuh, d- d-
Bob: He's downtown. [???] this ain't his phone.
Amfermee: Do you know where he's at?
Craig: Yeah.
Bob: This ain't his phone.
Craig: Yeah, he- he... sorry?
Amfermee: Oh- oh. We didn't- well, we didn't know if he picked- if- we didn't know he didn't, uh, answer this phone. I mean-
Bob: No, he's got his own phone.
Craig: Oh okay, nice, nice. He's probably got one of those, uh, probably has one of those iPhones, eh?
Bob: Yeah, cellphones, whatever.
Craig: Yeah, psh, I- I hate my cellphone and I hardly even use it.
Bob: [chuckles]
Craig: You know what I'm talking about.
Bob: I don't have one, so...
Craig: Yeah, and they're so much of a nuisance, you know? All the money you pay into it, and then if you lose it, ugh. Ah...
Bob: That's right... That's the way the world goes around.
Craig: Yeah, no, I understand, I understand, you know? It's all about money and making, like, you know, tiny electronic things that are easy to lose.
Bob: Oh, it's all about somethin' else, too.
Craig: Oh yeah, it's-
Bob: You're missin' the most important thing.
Craig: What's that, Bobby?
Bob: Most people, probably 98% of the people, it's all about 'What can you do for me?'.
Craig: Exactly. I agree. That is- that- that is how it's always been, like...
Bob: Yep-
Craig: ever since the dawn of time, you know? Ever since the dawn of time, and the Pilgrims came to Plymouth Rock, it's always been like that.
Bob: Yep, it'll always be that way, too. Bunch of greedy individuals in this world.
Craig: Oh, unbelievably how greedy people are in this world. It's- it's very disgusting, you know? Like, I'm going to school, and- I- it's so disgusting on how people are, like, in group projects for engineering and stuff like that, they just- they don't wanna do any work. They would rather have you do all the work for them, and they get the grade. It's just horrible.
Bob: That's right. That's what I went through.
Craig: Yeah, like, I hate-
Bob: The only people that would do any studying were the ones that were on the G.I. Bill.
Craig: Yup. Yup. I-
Bob: And... the others just wanted to play around.
Craig: Yup, the ones with the money and the ones from the rich families who didn't deserve it, you know. They were just the ones, "Oh, let's go out and party," you know?
Bob: Yup.
Craig: Aw man, you know-
Bob: That's right.
Craig: Oh, I got some good news, actually. I've- duh- I've actually signed up in the reserves', uh, light armored infantry.
Bob: You did, huh?
Craig: Yeah!
Bob: You may- might get to go get some more G.I. Bill.
Craig: Yeah! Ne- never know, hey! [chuckle] Serving my country and getting an education, there's nothing wrong with that, eh?
Bob: Yeah, that's what- that's the way I got an education.
Craig: Ah- that- that's actually how my, uh, my dad got his education too.
Bob: Yeah.
Craig: Yeah, it's, uh, it's pretty good, you know?
Bob: It's not- it's not a bad thing. If you come back, it is. [chuckles]
Craig: Oh yeah, it's not a bad thing at all! It's- you know- it's just- it's just the- it's just the adventure of life, you know? Where you take a step forward and you, you know, cut the tie between family, and you go off and you serve your country, and if you get an education out of it, that's good, you know? Better yourself and your country, I always say.
Bob: Well, that's the way they figured it.
Craig: Yeah!
Bob: They- they- they got trained people back on there.
Craig: Yeah, it's- it's- it's amazing. Like, you must have a- like, a million awesome stories about Korea.
Bob: Eh, not too many.
Craig: No? Like-
Bob: I was there before the Korean war.
Craig: Oh okay. So were you in North Korea?
Bob: No, I was in South Korea.
Craig: South Korea?
Bob: I- I was there when we liberated Korea from the Japanese.
Craig: Oh really?
Bob: You didn't know that Japan owned Korea?
Craig: Yes, I- I- I remember that. They, uh- they exported most of their rice back to Japan.
Bob: Yeah, and... they- they- they were using Korea as a stepping point in attacking China.
Craig: Yup, I remember that in history class.
Bob: And then... in 1947, we were in there liberating Korea from the Japanese.
Craig: I- I remember that, that- aw man, Bobby. That- that must have been exciting for you.
Bob: Well... then the UN, in all their great wisdom, split Korea in two, right?
Craig: Yup.
Bob: And gave North Korea to China. [chuckles]
Craig: Ugh, talk about a big mistake on the UN, eh?
Bob: Yeah, well, they did the same thing with North and South Vietnam.
Craig: I r- I remem- Yes, that- that is- that's correct.
Bob: And then they did the same thing with [???].
Craig: Oh-
Bob: And then they- quite a few that they did that to, that they kind of screwed up on.
Craig: Well-
Bob: They did the same thing to Czechoslovakia. And then they gave all of Western Europe to Russia. Or Eastern Europe, excuse me. Bless you.
Craig: S- It- Yeah- Oh y- That's okay. Yeah, and, uh, same with-
Bob: In all of their infinite wisdom, I think they screwed up a little bit.
Craig: Oh yeah, like, uh, the whole is- giving Israel to the Jews after World War II, and that was a part of Palestine that belonged to the Palestinians?
Bob: Well, everybody in the world was kickin' 'em out, so what're you gonna do? You gotta give 'em some place.
Craig: That is true.
Bob: They deserve a home country.
Craig: That i- that is exactly true, Bobby. I agree with you on that.
Bob: [chuckles] They can't seem to get happy with their own self over there.
Craig: [chuckles] Ex- exactly! Like, aw man... Like, I- the UN is just so phenomenal to me. It is such a great entity of democracy and protecting the lives of innocent people, and, you know, just taking care of the human race in general. And- the f- you know, just- just the whole history of it. It always like- it always like, ugh, it always nourished my mind with it, you know? It's- it's- it's like, this is the reason why I joined the reserves, I'm serving my- I wanna serve my country in Afghanistan and Iraq. And this is why I wanna be an engineer, to better the lives of the people.
Bob: Well, they also broke up, uh, Persia
Craig: Yes.
Bob: into Iraq and Iran...
Craig: Yes, I remember that.
Bob: and Saudi Arabia, that's another little deal they did that didn't work too swift.
Craig: [chuckles]
Bob: But- but anyway, I'm a firm believer in the UN too. I always have been.
Craig: Yep, same here. You know, the UN does a lot of good peacekeeping missions overseas.
Bob: In fact, I've got a UN seal on my car.
Craig: Are you serious?
Bob: I do. M- my license plate reads, "UN4EVER".
Craig: Oh nice! That is awesome, like- nah, that- that is really awesome. My uncle did a few peacekeeping missions for the United Nations over in Cyprus back in the '80s.
Bob: Yeah.
Craig: Yeah! That- that is awesome, Bobby. I did not know that.
Bob: Well, we all got our little pet peeves, I guess.
Craig: No, it's understandable.
Bob: [chuckles]
Craig: [chuckles] Mine's Hillary Clinton.
Bob: Anyway, I gotta go, I got- my foot's hurtin'.
Craig: Alright, Bobby. Hey, you have a good night and I'll talk to you later, okay?
Bob: Okay, we'll see ya. Bye-bye.
Craig: Alright, good night! Bye!
