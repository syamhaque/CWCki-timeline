Jacob sex obsessions
July 1/3
Jacob Sockness AKA the original Chris Kink (@JacobSockness):
I can help myself that I love hugs so much. I'll more to be sweet and innocent to a certain someone. If not the most heavenly goddess, I need to chase something, I'm lonely and short a few millions sales of hugs.
Stop with the sex obsessions already! Seriously, Please: chill out.
@CPU_CWCSonichu You have a son. A freind I have in Sunnyvale just visited a women who confessed to having your son to him. They live in San Jose, CA. The child looks like you, he's 10 years old later this year. I got contacted via text that Mia Ham is in San Jose under another name with a 10 year old. He bought time with her and payed $500. Her price has gone up significantly since Chris Chan, the fame is gotten her money. If they are still in San Jose, I intend to meet them somehow, but they might move on before life returns to normal. This all came by total surprise. Ben paid them well. So they will do well over this month. I'll see of Ben can get more info. I am going to bed.
Jake, you can shut up on all this right now. The facts are obvious and against your claims.
Firstly: Mama Chris Chan did indeed have only two instances of sexual intercourse in the span of one week in the same month: April, 2012.
That was with the kind woman who was traveling who went by the surname, Mia.
Second: A while back, months to over a year ago, a young adult male who was Mama's son, literally from the future, came to personally visit and meet her.
That was that one video of him with the mask and white ensemble outfit with the word of prophecy and warning.
Third: Mia was on birth control of her own volition; that information was not directly revealed, but it was obvious.
Also, Mama wore a condom both times.
So the chances of Mia getting knocked up at that time are very slim, but possible and highly slim.
And Lastly: Given a nine month period to even make the conception from the time of intercourse would mark any birth from Mama's essence to be around January, 2013.
And the child would be more than Seven Years Old today, and no more.
Therefore, all of your information is false, and, once again, you can shut the hell up about this bull shit. End of discussion. ⚡⚡⚡
Animu
July 3
Just to comment, Rosey and I have just finished binging the series of #StarVstheForcesofEvil on @disneyplus; it was very satisfying. There is a lovely depiction of something like the Dimension Merge in it. I loved the ship between Star and Marco, and how it ended
Presently, Rosey, Cryzel and I are now checking out #BNA on @netflix; this is a very good anime so far.

Happy #IndependenceDay2020, everyone. ⚡⚡⚡
Dillin
July 4
Replying to Dillin Thomas (DHT) (@DHTDillinThomas), whose Tweets are protected:
So, it was You who chronicled Omelette, Dillin. And Bowsette was already hard enough on us as Bowser’s daughter. She’s been a pain in all of our sides along with all of the other villains, yet she’s more of a cunning neiusance. That’s another chip on my shoulder against you.⚡⚡
Chris tells Jacob to get help
July 5
Jacob Sockness AKA the original Chris Kink (@JacobSockness):
@CPU_CWCSonichu Letting you know the portal on my end is closed. I retired from magic until the FAKEdemic ends. I can't reopen it until my mind is somehow healed. Nothing I have here can heal my mind and soul. All my light is gone right now.
Jacob, you have done very well on your end. You do need to seek help. There is a website I can recommend https://goodrx.com/treatment to get you help through the Internet for the time being.
After all the shit I've done, your more a friends than anyone in my family right now. If I could drive, I'd go from free state to free state to maintain contact with humans. A mood stabilizer for now is better than nothing. Thanks.
I'll contact them Monday. I'll research it tomorrow. Thanks for the help.

In response to an enabler who made a drawing of Sonichu
Simple, effective, and to the point: I like it. 😊⚡️⚡️
Chandler's List
July 8
Continuing a thread from June when Sonichu said that "The time has come to start listing out the back-talkers who have been speaking bad of Chris Chan Sonichu within up to the past decade."
Been delayed due to the events and being linked to them, but here are the lists for even more of the back-talkers.
So, do what you will with this dox bunch.
Jewels etc
July 9
In response to a giveaway for semi-precious stones..
We’ve got a lovely assortment of crystals and gems here; there is lots of magic and genuine power here. ⚡⚡
CosmicKeyframe
July 12
CosmicKeyframe:
Im not okay. Im trying to be okay, but Im not.
Doing my best, but Im tired and Im sick and I just want to be better.
maybe Ill stream today to distract myself, I dont know, we'll see. Im just sorry if Im not normal.
Stay strong, Key. Optimism, strong will, and laughter will help stave off the ailment, as well as some rest. I have faith Golden is keeping you in good company and care. Stay awesome.

as above, so below (@JacobSockness):
I proved my power and summoned real spirits that I can photograph. I have to admit you have some power. You predicted the god's power I used to rape China with Uvachau the God of Domination and Ego.
I am only going to tell you this once, Jacob: I am not taking credit for anything at all. You need to cool your head off. Hating on others is not okay at all. I’m sorry, Dude, but I needed to say my piece about you. Mama has not broken up with you; that is not my call to make.
But know you have no control over her, and you have no control over me. And Mama still cares about Kidasuna and its people as well. My statement was not directed at anyone, other than you, Jacob. ⚡⚡⚡
Argni (@The13collectiv):
Oh
sonichu, Christine and Jakob are dating ?
No. At least, not yet.
Creepy comment to female artist
July 15
🐰Christine Usagi🐰 (@Fluffy_TG)'s tweet:
Without cheating how old have you assumed I am this entire time?
Chris's reply:
Honestly, Mama thought you were roughly veering on 18 or 21; entering young adulthood, and cute enough to still get away at times.
Fluffy_TG then blocked Chris.
In a comment to another fan, Fluffy_TG stated she was in her early thirties.
invisible with a medallion
July 14-16
TheOdd1sOut (@theodd1sout):
Image [If I turned invisible and put my hand over a necklace I was wearing, would the necklace disappear also?]
If you turned invisible with a medallion on, the medallion will turn invisible with you most of the time.
On that, though, it will turn invisible if the medallion is enchanted as typical; an unenchanted medallion will remain visible. In other words: if the medallion does allow you to change your own form, then it will become invisible when you do.
Jacob 2
July 18
as above, so below (@JacobSockness):
I created the ultimate ritual and I think it worked. Sonichu is here. The room got really hot and smelled like sulfur, but it's
the very same being I channeled before.
Magi-Chan is 100% real and I've got my usual proof. Than ks Jubali for the love boost the other night.
Dude. Just because you stained a few cards with blood, it does not make you a blood brother to ANY of us, especially me, Magi-Chan and Mama Chris Chan. All you did was greatly offend me, Jacob. 😠⚡
And for everyone’s reference: yes, Jake did pay in full in legitimate purchase of the Autographed card set. What he did here was more offensive than that time Mama was selling her extra Rare Pokemon cards, sold her Shining Raichu card to a kid, and then he ripped it in half. 😠⚡
VICE
July 21
DaftPina (@DaftPina):
Fine Vice, I'll watch it. 🙄 [video showing Geno Samuel's documentary as being on VICE]
Acknowledged: watched it on Geno’s Channel. ⚡⚡⚡
The tweet by VICE was actually fake and tweet is 4 months old.
human sonichus
July 23/25
Greer - Ko-Fi Open! (@kuurocats):
more human sonichus!! this time it was just warm up doodles of the chaotic combo along with some names i thought might fit them 👀
all these characters originally belong to @CPU_CWCSonichu and these are just my own interpretations😊
[art of the chaotic combo as multiracial humans]
That’s cool, and I do like the art; it is good.
I, Sonichu, am tired of being human; I wish this body of Mama’s would get into C-197 already, so it can unlock and transform into its Sonichu form, and all else that needs to be done. ⚡⚡⚡
[long thread]
Jacob Sockness AKA the original Chris Kink (@JacobSockness):
China made the virus, their people will be punished for it.
You know, Jake, in the alt-timeline where everyone was born on the opposite side of the world, Chris Chan was born in China. You were born in Germany. And Covid was leaked from the East Coast of the United States; not China. Ponder about that. Also, you are definitely not a Nazi.
SonichuReborn: Project (@sonichureborn):
How would you know ? your soul is unable to cross to any dimension because of your hate, no matter if it's in the past, the bad has been done, therefore your soul won't be able to cross or communicate with any dimension, conclusions, you're just making it all up
And you’ve proven yourself moreso of a Hater type of troll, with a statement like that.
Protoman00 (@milk_cookies16):
If you don’t verify and prove the things that you say, why do you expect people to believe them? People aren’t just going to believe what you say, especially with the merge.
All right. How do I prove Astral Projection in “Tangible Proof” to be able to satisfy you all? Mama has astral projected many times; I have as well. Therefore, you can stop being doubting Trolling-Stupids.⚡⚡⚡
Jacob again
July 25
Jacob Sockness AKA the original Chris Kink (@JacobSockness):
Michiro: @CPU_CWCSonichu I can help you both if you meet up with Jacob. If not, I will withdraw power the both my covens. I will assume I shall withdraw my power since she rejected the Blood Oaths.
Michiro is already helping us; whatever you’re “saying” on his behalf with that you and Mama are both needed is relatively false. We have all of the deities on our side and ally ship. I’m zapping it up in Cwcville, right now. Gonna go play #GOFest2020 in Cwcville, in C-197. ⚡⚡
Pokécrap
July 25
MegaMeh Hundred (@100MegaMeh):
Azure: *Choke holds fake magi-chan (she speaks in a cumbric/finnish accent)* So, the next time the tiny mean Hedgehog thing decides to cause trouble what will you do?
Magi-chan: C-Call you...
Azure: Please do. *tightens grip*
Fortunately the number of those fake ones are very low, at least around us. They dare not come near this body, and the Temple anymore. How heavily Psychic and Light-Power Guarded are we? Massively.
Pokemon GO fest

#PokemonGOFest2020
How does a PokéBall compare in size with Inuyasha? How decent it is to get him into one of those; much as well or less, me (Sonichu). ⚡️⚡️⚡️

Gex
July 25
MegaMeh Hundred (@100MegaMeh):
May I introduce you to... Gex? If you're already acquainted, what're your thoughts on it?
[image of Gex, a lizard from a 1995 game]
We’ve known of Gex; he’s cool.
Need friends
July 26
Let's be friends in Pokémon GO! My Trainer Code is 8428 0202 7339!
Need a new friend.
I had posted the Tweet earlier, because a new friend head tasked of me in the Special Tasks for #PokemonGOFest2020. The roster had been full, and I should have known to remove those with less than three hearts and been absent for more than 2+ Days to make room. Cleared some room.
Thanks for the response.

Helena G. F. (@PickinyFelliny):
Guess who the guys found at the mall today? Slaweel Ryam! She is no longer evil or so she says.
They went and checked the place since last house didn't even have a roof and is hella cold around here. The coldest day in the year they said.

What is thy verdict, our goddess @CPU_CWCSonichu? 🙏🏻⚡️💙⚡️🙏🏻
Actually, that is correct; Mary Lee Walsh, there, is on our side now. Very good observation.

Pokémon GO (@PokemonGoApp):
What is virtually worthless in terms of both power and speed? It’s Magikarp, the featured Pokémon for August #PokemonGOCommunityDay! 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊 https://pokemongolive.com/events/community-day/
I really do not like Great Cup, and I need a few Charged TMs and Rare Candies.

Saberspark (@Saberspark):
So I was recently told & discovered that Cosmodore had knowingly dated a minor along with some other unsavory things. I wanted to be careful addressing this and make sure the victim was safe and ok before I said anything (she is)
I don't tolerate that shit for a second & he'll no longer be editing any videos on my channel. Any uploads he appeared in have already been unlisted & I've cut all ties with him. I fully support the victim and I'm incredibly disappointed in Cosmo. You think you know a person
Cosmodore is a YouTube critic who committed the unimaginable crime of dating a 15-year-old when he was 19.
Ah, shit. Here we go again. I agree with you, Saberspark; you’re doing the right thing. Good on you. ⚡️⚡️⚡️

TaidaKun_Tweets (@TaidakunT):
And this was done just last week.
So don't complain, shape up, practice, and for the love of God, actually learn to draw.
[drawing of Sonichu]
Very awesome improvement on your skill. ⚡️⚡️⚡️
Nuka (@_Nukaaa):
I drew sonichu too! In my headcanon he loves shooting rabbits
[drawing of Sonichu as a hunter]
Only in that distant Alt-Dimension and timeline that your headcanon accesses.
Wait, so you’re telling me he doesn’t like blasting rabbits?
Yes, I, Sonichu (Prime), do not like shooting rabbits.
DARE!

William Crowe (@crowew1978):
What song is @CosmicKeyframe exercising to?
“Dare” by Stan Bush, or “Twist of Fate” by Olivia Newton John. ⚡️⚡️⚡️
