Jungle bells was a video uploaded on 18th December 2015, in which Chris sings a garbled version of "Jungle Bells", a parody of "Jingle Bells" sung by The Four Seasons in 1962; almost certainly an old record of Bob's.
Furthermore, Chris also shows off two new shirts that anonymous people have sent him. Ever the picture of gratitude, he lets everyone know just how much he hates one of them.

Hellooo! Happy day, happy day, fun day! Very good day so far. Hm. I got the shirt in the mail, whoever bought it. Thank you, this is really nice, I like this. I like this. It's positive. You know, pony, good, like Rain-Boom. Nice. I'll tell you something else, uh, another shirt that came in recently also, alright. [holds up a new shirt] Princess Celestia. Hm. Yeah. It made me smile, but then. [holds up bottom half of the shirt, which reads: Troll Harder] I hate Internet memes. Especially def- especially those that have trolls or boys on them. [shakes head] Are you serious? Mmm. [shakes head, frowning] Anyway, pbbt. [drops shirt] So, I'll be, uh, definitely drawing that up- drawing that facial expression up later. But right now here's another Christmas tune that somebody can put music to. And uh, good stuff. Alright. [holds controller up, then puts it down] Oh well.
[to rhythm of Jingle Bells] Dun dun dun, dun dun dun, dun dun dun dun.
Jungle bells, jungle bells, jungle all the way.
[akin to Tarzan, holding onto imaginary vine] o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0oHHHHHHHHHH, fwam! [pretends to whack into tree]
Jungle bells, jungle bells, jungle all the way.
[akin to Tarzan, holding onto imaginary vine] o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0oHHHHHHHHHH, whafmph! [holds out arms]
Dashing through the trees, fumping vine to vine, o-er the fields we go, laughing all the way.
Bells on bob- er, raindrops on leaves rain, making spirits bright, what fun it is to laugh and sing a SWINGING song tonight!
Oh, jungle bells, Tarzan smells, George of the Jungle!
Swinging through the forest, vine to vine. Watch out for that tree! WHAM!
Jungle bells, Tarzan smells, George of the Jungle!
Swinging through the forest, vine to vine. Watch out for that tree! PHEW!
[finishes singing and holds up controller again]
Anyhow, another new song, another new day. Donations still appreciated very much, and continue ordering. I'm doin the best I can to try to get- get- the last- the uh- old- the uh- the oldest orders out before the holiday. Thank you. Have a good day.
[Selfie remote refuses to work]
