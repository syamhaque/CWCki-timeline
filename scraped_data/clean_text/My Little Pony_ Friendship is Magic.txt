The "Mane 6" cast
My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic is the fourth generation (G4) of the My Little Pony animation franchise. It is the 2010s incarnation and the longest-running animated series in its history. It ran for nine seasons, from October 2010-October 2019. While intended for a young female audience, it wound up gaining a massive adult audience, especially among men, known as the brony fandom. With that in mind, plus his previous track record for loving children's shows, it's not surprising that Chris was later turned onto the show, and that he'd have even more confidence with being publicly interested in it.
Chris went into heavy denial over the ending of the series. He protested its ending and raged over the subsequent reboots of the My Little Pony franchise into Pony Life (G4.5) and especially Make Your Mark (G5).

Characters mentioned by Chris
Mane 6
The "Mane 6" is a fandom term used to describe the six main characters of the show: Applejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, Rarity, and Twilight Sparkle.
Chris's favorites are a tie between Rainbow Dash and Applejack, and he also identifies with Princess Twilight Sparkle.[1] In her princess form, Twilight is an alicorn, the highest tier of pony types.
Applejack
Chris's drawing of Applejack.
Applejack, voiced by Ashleigh Ball, is an Earth pony representing the Element of Honesty. Other traits include her passion for hard work.
Chris used a picture of Applejack as his Tomboys and Tomgirls of Virginia forum avatar, although his screen name was modeled after the name of another major character – Rainbow Dash.
Fluttershy

Fluttershy, voiced by Andrea Libman, is a Pegasus pony representing the Element of Kindness.
Chris's associate Flutter is nicknamed after Fluttershy.[2]
Pinkie Pie
Chris's OC Night Star and Pinkie Pie
Pinkie Pie, voiced by Andrea Libman, is an Earth pony representing the Element of Laughter.
Rainbow Dash
Rainbow Dash, voiced by Ashleigh Ball, is a Pegasus pony representing the Element of Loyalty. She is also known for her athleticism.
Chris ranks Rainbow Dash as one of his two favorite characters of the show's "Mane 6" cast.[3]
He has multiple figures of her. A toy can be sighted in the background of the August 2011 video "Correction of EX relationship status", in February 2018, he bought a Funko Pop figure of her,[4] and in October 2020, he showed The Place a humanoid figurine of her which had cost him $100.[3]
A character by the same name was featured in the prior My Little Pony generation, G3. Chris was also a fan of this character, seen by him having a sticker of her on his 3DS in the Wristwatch-SwissWatch for Jeremy "Thorg" video.

Rarity
Rarity agrees to try to mend The Classic
Rarity, voiced by Tabitha St. Germain, is a unicorn pony representing the Element of Generosity. She works as a seamstress and is a socialite.
Chris drew a comic panel of himself asking Rarity (as her humanized Equestria Girls form), to mend The Classic shirt. Rarity agrees to try, though cringes at the difficulty of the task.
Twilight Sparkle
Twilight Sparkle, voiced by Tara Strong, is a unicorn pony (who later evolved into an alicorn at the end of season 3) representing the Element of Magic.
Derpy
Chris's Lego pony in question; talented as always.
Derpy, sometimes called Muffins, is a fan-given name to a background character which had been erroneously animated with crossed-eyes.
On 24 April 2012, Chris wrote a note on his Facebook, calling for the rescue of the MLP:FiM character "Derpy Hooves" (later officially credited as "Ditzy Doo" and then "Muffins"), a character who is characterized by her lazy eyes and comical method of thinking, whose first speaking appearance in the episode "The Last Roundup" was re-edited because one person (who would later be heavily criticized by the MLP:FiM fanbase) thought Derpy's voice and personality in said appearance was offensive to the disabled. Naturally, Chris saw it as a vehicle to gain more pity towards him by sympathizing with a character that appeared to have some sort of disorder.
In October 2014, Chris posted his own Lego "Derpy" to his Facebook page.
On 27 June 2019, Chris posted a video clip of him demonstrating his psychic powers at moving a Derpy Hooves flash drive.[5] He commented in July 2024 that he had later lost the cap of the drive.[6]
Discord
Discord
Discord is a male draconequus and former antagonist.
In November 2017, as a result of the main Idea Guy's schemes involving Hyperdimension Neptunia lore,
Chris felt he needed bodyguards in the real world to protect him from manipulation by fictional Neptunia character Kurome, choosing imaginary friends Magi-Chan, Silvana and Discord.
He went to his Pokemon club at The End Games escorted by Magi-Chan and Discord, and said he let Discord watch some Dungeons and Dragons games. Chris also asked one of his Pokémon League friends if she could see the imaginary friend, and claimed to have worn Discord as a draconequus vest.[7]
Luna
Luna, voiced by Tabitha St. Germain, is an alicorn pony (the highest tier of the pony types). She rules over the night and controls the moon, and has been a co-ruler of Equestria alongside Celestia.
Other
Chris also has a Friendship is Magic playlist on his ChristianWChandler YouTube account, which included what was then all of its episodes.[8] In the Facebook note he made on 31 March 2012, he complains about "gum gabbing gossip columnists working for a corrupt editor", which is the plot for the episode "Ponyville Confidential" (which aired not too long before the note was made), the giveaway being that the nom de plume used in the episode was "Gabby Gums".
Chris gets intimate with one of his favorite characters.
On 26 June 2012, Chris whined about dark pony-related media on his Facebook via Twitter. He mentioned watching an animated adaption of the infamous fanfiction Cupcakes and SHED.MOV (an episode of HotDiggedyDemon's PONY.MOV series). He took particular offense at Rainbow Dash, a tomboyish character, being gorily killed in both videos and, in a characteristic fit of fatuous egotism, suggested that it was done because people hate tomboys and tomgirls. He went on to rant about the "Dark Parodies" being the reason behind his writer's block, before descending into the usual tirade of hatred against people in general.
In a twist of irony, it was later discovered that Chris has not one,[9] but two[10] playlists from HotDiggedyDemon, the creator of SHED.MOV that he hated so much. Also, he eventually would share a word of wisdom HotDiggedyDemon posted to his Facebook account that trolls noted would be useful for himself.
Pony cosplays
Chris's Rainbow Dash cosplay.
On 26 December 2014, Chris donned a pair of novelty My Little Pony sunglasses as a "disguise" while vandalizing a Sonic Boom display and macing a GameStop employee.
On 19 January 2015, a photo was leaked depicting Chris dressed up in a Rainbow Dash costume. His unclean, frazzled appearance unsurprisingly doesn't mix at all with her colorful design.
On 29 August 2015, Chris was seen cosplaying, again, at OmegaCon; this time as "Vinyl Scratch, A.K.A. DJ Pon3!". This time, instead of slapping on a wig and horse ears and calling it a day, Chris put at least a little effort into his costume; the result, while striking, was still far from good.
Possible cameo in cartoon
Pony Chris and Borb?
On 7 October 2017, an episode for season 7, entitled "Once Upon a Zeppelin", was released, and many people noticed a background pony that looked similar to Chris, and two more in the background that looked similar to Barb and Bob.
Ironically, the episode's story was about Twilight Sparkle learning that her parents have won a free zeppelin cruise for their family. Upon boarding, Twilight discovers the cruise to be a vacation experience where the other passengers pay to spend time with her, invading her and her family's privacy.
The pony in question, known as "Mossy Rock", is a grey unicorn, with pedo glasses, a striped shirt (similar in design to the Horizontal Horror), and a receding light green mane. Humorously, he is the only character in the audience to not smile when Twilight announces the winner.

The speculation about the pony was noticed by Chris, who commented:[11]
I was just made aware of this speculation from the MLP Zappelin episode. I highly doubt that Unicorn was based from myself.
The only way to confirm or bust this is by the testimony from Tara or someone official on the MLP staff.
Aside from that, I would rather be on there, personally voicing my OC pony, Night Star.
Equestria Girls spin-off
When the Equestria Girls trailer was released, Chris threw a fit on Facebook, citing that it would attract "pedofile [sic] perverts" into the fanbase.[12] Never mind that the MLP:FiM fanbase has always had perverts (not to mention that so does every other fanbase in the world) and he himself has drawn porn of underage characters. He then goes on to say that the Friendship is Magic crew is "Out Of Their Minds", immediately after saying "With All Due Respect", even going so far as to name-drop Lauren Faust, who at that point had left the show more than a year prior. He then comments on his note, loudly demanding in ALL CAPS that somebody pulls the plug on it. Much to the surprise of nobody, Hasbro did not respond to Chris's suggestions. Chris later "liked" some videos related to the movie online and named it his #2 favorite.
