================================================================================

What Chris likely calls this Bikini Kill album.
"Rebel Girl" is the sixth track from SPARKLE like you mean it: ROBEE'S BALLAD by Chris's second fictional band Robee Sonee and the Tomgirls. It is a cover of the song of the same name by Bikini Kill.
Chris seems to have chosen this song as emblematic of his ideal tomboy sweetheart--either that, or because it was featured in Rock Band 2. He also chose to sing over the single version, likely due to the vocals being higher than the gruff, angry vocals on the album/EP versions.
As per typical Chris fare, his singing lacks the emotional performance of Kathleen Hanna in the original, and he skips, mumbles and messes up tons of lyrics. Notably, he doesn't scream the line "I TASTE THE REVOLUTION!" at the end of the second verse, instead opting to excitedly (in the loosest sense of the term) say it in his signature monotone. Then again, it's likely he is unable to carry a scream like that, unless he's in the right mood.

[sung over Bikini Kill's "Rebel Girl"]
Chris's Rendition
That girl thinks she's the queen of the neighborhood
She's got the hottest trike in town
That girl, she holds her head up high
I think I want to be your best friend, yeah
Rebel girl, rebel girl
Rebel girl, you are the queen of my world
Rebel girl, rebel girl
I think I wanna take you home and wanna try your clothes on
When she talks, I hear the revolution
In her l--hips, there’s revolution
When she walks, the revolution's comin’
In her kiss, I taste the revolution!
Rebel girl, rebel girl
You are the queen of my world
Rebel girl, rebel girl
...y--you need--home, and then I'll try your clothes on, oh
That girl thinks she’s the queen of the neighborhood
I got news for you, she is
They say she’s a dyke, but I know
She’s my--is my best friend, yeah
Rebel girl, rebel girl

I really like you, I wanna be your best friend
Be my sweetheart, rebel girl!
Original Lyrics
That girl thinks she's the queen of the neighborhood
She's got the hottest dyke in town
That girl, she holds her head up high
I think I wanna be your best friend, yeah
Rebel girl, rebel girl
Rebel girl, you are the queen of my world
Rebel girl, rebel girl
I think I wanna take you home, I wanna try on your clothes
When she talks, I hear the revolution
In her hips, there’s revolution
When she walks, the revolution's coming
In her kiss, I taste the revolution!
Rebel girl, rebel girl
Rebel girl, you are the queen of my world
Rebel girl, rebel girl
I know I wanna take you home, I wanna try on your clothes, oh
That girl thinks she’s the queen of the neighborhood
I got news for you: she is
They say she’s a dyke, but I know
She is my best friend, yeah
Rebel girl, rebel girl
Rebel girl, you are the queen of my world
Rebel girl, rebel girl
I know I wanna take you home, I wanna try on your clothes
Love you like a sister, always, soul sister, rebel girl
Come and be my best friend, really rebel girl
I really like you, I wanna be your best friend
Be my rebel girl!
