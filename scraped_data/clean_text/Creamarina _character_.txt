Creamarina is an OC created by MKRNightVee. She is a Primarina mixed with Cream the Rabbit from the Sonic the Hedgehog series. In the NightVee comic, she serves as the main female character and the primary romantic interest. MKR later made a Twitter account named after the character and would eventually give Chris access to it so he could evade the blocks people set onto his other accounts.

Biography
At the same time as the events of Sonichu issue 0, the rainbow created from Super Sonic and Pikachu's collision strikes a Primarina just off the coast of Station Square. This transformed Primarina, now known as Creamarina, soon encounters Rosechu. After initially yelling at Creamarina’s neglectful owner for mistreating her, the two quickly become friends, and Rosechu brings Creamarina back to her owner Kel's house.
Later that evening, Creamarina and Rosechu are drinking Zapbud tea when a news broadcast shows Team Rocket attacking Pokémon Tower. Rosechu suggests going to help, but Creamarina points out that it’s too far away. They watch as NightVee arrives and drives Team Rocket off. After seeing this, Creamarina says she will be going to MKRtroplis and quietly thinks to herself that she might try to find NightVee. According to MKR in a deleted Tumblr post, after the events of Episode 1, Creamarina and Rosechu made out,[1] despite Rosechu being with Sonichu by then. It’s unclear if Chris ever approved of this.
Powers, abilities, and weaknesses
Creamarina is a strong and adaptable Water/Fairy-type Pokémon with a versatile moveset that includes attacks like Bubble Beam, Surf, Aqua Tail, and Dazzling Gleam. Thanks to her Liquid Voice ability, even sound-based moves become Water-type attacks. Despite her strength and resilience, she’s shy and slow to trust due to a past abandonment, making her cautious and reserved. She can glide by using her ears and tail to move, but her lack of legs can limit her mobility on land.
