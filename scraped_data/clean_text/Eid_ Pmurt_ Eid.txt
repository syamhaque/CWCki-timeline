Eid, Pmurt, Eid!!! is a video Chris uploaded on 9 November 2016, as his response to news of Pmurt winning the 2016 US presidential election over Hillary Clinton, his preferred choice. The title spells "Die, Trump, Die" backwards, or more accurately, "!!!diE, trumP, diE".
The video itself features Chris yelling anti-Donald Trump slurs and calling for his death while smashing a Transformers toy into the ground repeatedly, reminiscent of his voodoo magic revenge fantasies against his perceived enemies. During the last 10 seconds of the video, Chris readjusts the grip on his phone to pick up the toy, revealing that a live cat was being held in his left hand the whole time.
In an example of Chris's poor camerawork, he recorded the video handheld on a phone in portrait mode (which would cause YouTube to apply pillarboxing), then enabled YouTube's stabilization onto it, resulting in both the video and pillarbox effect becoming erratically distorted. This distortion, however, did not hide the disgusting conditions of the hallway Chris was filming in, featuring clutter strewn about and large, dark colored stains on the carpet.
Unusually, he failed to disable comments on the video.
