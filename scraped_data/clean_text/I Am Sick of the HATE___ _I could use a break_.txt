================================================================================

I Am Sick of the HATE!!! (I could use a break) is a video where Chris rants about the presence of trolls on his Twitter. This comes after posting a series of unusually angry tweets towards the weens making disparaging comments within his posts. The video serves as proof that he wrote the aforementioned Twitter posts himself, and was not hacked as some had speculated. For no discernible reason, Chris puts on a strange, raised voice with an exaggerated accent in this video, making his words more difficult to understand.
It should also be noted that Chris is clearly reading off of a script, or a vague outline, and this video is not done in his usual unscripted rage video style. Chris may also have written it himself in order to keep his ranting more cohesive, which it did not. Chris also says that it was his father who revealed their address and phone number, which is patently false, since he doxxed himself on multiple occasions.
