“
I have drawn a card for all of you; today, your card is Audience. I do believe you all will be in for quite the show of a lifetime.
”
Chris, after drawing the Abundance card.[1]
The tarot is a pack of playing cards that have been used for divination since the late 18th century. Chris owns a colorfully illustrated set known as the Osho Zen Tarot. Unlike a standard 78-card tarot deck, this one has a 79th card depicting Osho, the leader of the Rajneesh cult who endorsed this set and whose followers were responsible for a bioterror attack and assassination attempt on a United States Attorney in the mid 1980s.
Chris apparently began a hobby of daily tarot readings on June 3, 2021. He would draw a random card from the deck and interpret its meaning to his Twitter followers (referring to them as the Collective), and would also draw a card for himself. Sometimes he would draw two or three cards. He drew a Schizophrenia card for the collective two days in a row on June 23 and 24, and again on July 3, which may be an ominous sign for the rest of us.
In mid July, the tarot cards provided some comfort for Chris as he mourned the death of Snoopy, drawing the Maturity card for the Collective and the Healing card for himself on July 16. Twitter users accused him of misusing cards and selecting them himself rather than drawing them randomly.[2]
The final card for the next several years would be drawn on July 30, Turning In. Chris would be arrested the next day, beginning the Jail Saga. It is unknown whether Chris has attempted any card-based divination while he was incarcerated, though he was known to play solitaire on a Personally Blessed Turkish prayer rug.[3]
The tarot cards returned in August 2024, when Chris tweeted about drawing Trust.[4] Chris then got a new Tarot deck around the end of August.[5]
