Troll disclosure: This persona was created, appropriated, or otherwise used by trolls to manipulate Chris. Though this identity is contrived, the CWCki may treat it as if it were a real identity because it was to Chris. (It's also funnier that way.)

“
Im single right now, I wish I had a good man to love me and take care of me, and maybe someday I could have a beautiful little girl of my very own to love on and take care of...

No, Sarah was definitely not a troll...
Sarah Jackson (21 March 1981[2] - 13 October 2008) was a troll and one of Chris's former heartsweets.
Sarah lived in Alabama and found about Chris through her autistic sister Rose, a Sonic fan. She made contact with Chris through The OFFICIAL Sonichu & Rosechu Blog; the two quickly "developed a good trust." Then, however, Chris told her that he had feelings for Blanca at the same time. After an exchange of emails among the three, Chris chose Blanca. Her plans to troll Chris never came to fruition after Chris rejected her. Sarah was tragically killed by Optimus Prime disguised as a truck. Chris mourned her loss in Sonichu #9, drawing her like a forty-year-old.
