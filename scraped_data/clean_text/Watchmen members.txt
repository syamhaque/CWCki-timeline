This article is still yet to be completed due to stress. We get a lot of stressful torture in our lives that makes us crash into slumber. Given that inspiration is a big variable, and we may have been lacking of it, this article will be completed as soon as possible, at our own pace... HONEST! This article is missing the following:

Anaxis
Main article: Anaxis
Anaxis, the third admin of the Official CWCki Server, and another former CWCki editor, played the role of Lainchu in The Place and The Knights of CWC.[1] Anaxis was the third to have the role, after Klop, who handed it off on 29 August 2020.[2] Sometime after joining the CWCki server, he was invited into The Place and became a Watchman.
Anaxis was a target of infighting problems in The Place Discord server, particularly by MKRNightVee and Val. Beginning in November 2020 and extending through December, MKR threw a tantrum at Anaxis over her being demodded from the Official CWCki Server, carrying on after he mentioned that the demodding was done by his predecessor after a group discussion, that it took her months to notice being demodded, and that he declined to re-add her to modstaff.[3][4] In January 2021, during a debate on the ethics of Christubers, Val instigated more drama with personal attacks, with MKR joining in, and both expressing they wanted Anaxis gone.[5]
Anaxis was one of the people involved in the Watchmen group chat, Regarding Chris, questioning Bella's role in the Incest Call leaks.
On 4 April 2023, Anaxis began posting an ongoing essay, The Lainchu Manifesto, covering his interactions with Chris and the Watchmen members.
AquaDiamond8
Main article: AquaDiamond8
AquaDiamond8 is a Twitter user who has bounced from being a ween,[6] to a white knight, to an enabler and Watchman. In November 2019, during the Jacob Sockness saga, in hopes to lure Chris away from Sockness, Aqua joined the Watchmen and embraced Chris's delusional beliefs, changing her Twitter handle to CPU Goddess Aqua of the Mac Book Pro. Later, Aqua began drawing fanart of her OC interacting with Magi-Chan.[7] She then posted a Pokémon drawing, claiming it to be an alt-dimension Magi-Chan:[8]
Klop
Main article: Klop
Klop is the creator and first admin of the Official CWCki Server and a former CWCki editor. In August 2020, he coined the "Watchmen" group's name, naming it after the DC Comics graphic novel. He initially wanted to be called "Rorschach", a character from the Watchmen graphic novel who acted as a kind of chronicler.[9]
Klop was the second to hold the Lainchu role. On 29 August 2020, he passed it onto Anaxis.[10]
KND
KND was one of the Watchmen who tried to assist in dealing with Praetor. When the Watchmen had decided to confront Caden following allegations involving Chris trying to use a taser, KND suggested that they all use VPNs to avoid having their IPs snatched while also went on a paranoid rant about Discord staff potentially giving personal details away to Praetor.[11] When Chris had posted a long text about his disappointment in how things are elevating with regards to the Watchmen and the Praetor, KND tries to explain things diplomatically to him, telling him that if Chris shocking the rock doesn't make a spectacle, it could disappoint people, telling Chris that Praetor intends to make a spectacle out of him. [12]
He also argued with Kyle about how they could expose them, but Anaxis pointed out to both of them that Chris wouldn't care either way so long as Praetor continued to play along with his delusions.[13] Directly after Chris confronted the Watchmen about their feud with Praetor, KND tries to suggest a number of elaborate schemes to dismantle Praetor and win Chris back, but none of them appeared to come into fruition.[14]
Kyle
Main article: Kyle
Kyle in TSSSF form.
Naught's "second-in-command", Kyle, also known as Nova[15], was present in the Google Hangout chats. Kyle was also the inspiration for Chris's Kylechu OC.
Chris had mixed feelings on Kyle. In a 26 June 2021 text to Null, Chris said that Kyle "talks soo damn much, boasting his smart-talk, interrogating my intentions and present mentalities. Damn, he's seriously tiring."[16] Kyle was one of the first people that Chris told of his plans to shock his crystals with electricity, citing a click-baity article about using the phenomenon to open up portals and believing that Kyle could help explain piezoelectricity to him. Kyle attempted to reason with Chris regarding this. When Kyle questioned Chris's findings, Chris was flustered.
MKRNightVee
Main article: MKRNightVee
MKRNightVee IRL
Meghan K. Ringo, also known as MKRNightVee, CPUMagentaHeart and thepixietailartist, and sometimes referred to as Maker by Chris, appeared in early 2019. She got into contact with Chris through a friend looking up Chris's phone number for her.[17] She presented herself to Chris as being the CPU goddess of the Nintendo Switch, offering him validation on his fantasies of having magic powers.[17] She has stated that her goal isn't to feed into Chris's delusions so much as to offer advice and help.[17] Chris offered her several of his possessions in his Last Will and Testament.
Naught
Main article: Naught
Naught's Kiwi Farms profile picture
Naught, also known as Bismuth and CPU Bismuth Heart to Chris was the self-proclaimed "leader" of the group, taking over the group after Owls left.[18] He monitored and doxed potential weens or outside enablers. Naught also kept records on orders for Chris's TSSSF cards and his Sonichu comics. Naught also showed Chris various anime and manga, much of which Chris had implemented into his fantasies. Naught has also implied himself to have shown Chris the inspiration for the Lainchu character, Serial Experiments Lain.
In June 2021, Naught posted fellow Watchmen The WCT's dox onto Kiwi Farms in retaliation for WCT declining to share his Kiwi Farms account with him after Naught had been banned from the site following the use of sockpuppets after told to stop from Null,[19] which lead to WCT ousting Naught and two others who had sided with Naught from the group.
Owls
Owls IRL.
Main article: Owls
Ryan Winger, more commonly referred to as Owls was an associate of MKRNightVee. He was GhostBird50 on the Kiwi Farms[20] and the CWCki, and as CpuTurquoiseHeart to Chris.[21][18]
Para
Peachy
Gender disclosure: This person currently identifies as MTF transgender. Pronoun usage on this page may or may not reflect biological sex and/or gender identity.
Peachy, a member of The Place, pestered members of Praetor. In February 2021, Peachy mentioned having used multiple Instagram accounts over a span of weeks, beginning from when The Place learned of Praetor, to attempt to contact Annie, getting no response from her. Peachy also mentioned being in DMs with Owen, and offered to attempt to get info from him for The Place.[22]
Spunky
Spunky the Hyenadoom, also known as Silvia and Emily,[23] is a former member of The Place and The Knights of CWC. She was one of the people Chris hinted at regarding his affair with a "lady friend over 50". Chris's last known mention
of Spunky is from a May 2022 jail letter in which he listed her as among the psychics Kenneth Engelhardt could choose to consult.[24]
Spunky posted an account describing her treatment by the Watchmen members Naught and MKR:[25]
Hello there.
Please call me spunk or silvia.
I was a former watchmen who had the kiwifarms account thetarotreader96 as well, but naught wished for me to hand over the account for his purposes, and sadly renamed it death of chans. He told me that it would be beneficial to the group, but I see i just fed his plots without even knowing it.
In the beginning, I was told by naught and others that I would be of value, which was odd because I didnt have anything to offer except friendship, (yea yea you can all judge me for my thought process.) I didnt know how to operate the farms at all, and I didnt know most of the code names and all. Sadly though, I (believe) was doxxed for they knew my full name without me telling them. In the server I thought I was making friends, but it seemed that they didnt care about me at all, making fun of me (naught telling me to shut my mouth alot, and MKR putting me down and was apparently had a hatred towards me for no legitimate reason at all, besides what I can assume is because I speak to Chris like a normal person and can relate to him with mlp and just general nerd stuff.) and making me feel inferior to them, especially naught and MKR. It really hurt for I never wished any harm on anyone. As naught put it "I was just some random fur who wanted to be friends with chris." Which is still true to this day. Its a little hard to lay it all out, but if you all have any questions please dont be afraid to ask me. But I will say this, the watchmen are mean people, they will use you for their personal gains and will easily backstab and will use "loving words" to make you feel accepted. Behind the scenes they are just mean individuals.
I thank you all for hearing me out, and hope you all have a good day.
Spunk or Silvia.
The Fool
Main article: The Fool
The Fool was a late addition to the Watchmen, added in April 2021 by Naught, who noted his interest in tarot.[26] He wound up becoming an active member of WCT's The Knights of CWC.
The WCT
The WCT IRL
Main article: The WCT
Sean Walker, also known as The WCT and CPU Onyx Heart, and primarily known in the context of the Watchmen as Conner or neko, had created The Knights of CWC, "taking over" after a conflict with Naught. He archived calls involving Chris and occasionally gave interviews to observers. In November 2020, Chris took an interest in mass shooter Randy Stair, whose belief system regarding cartoons and alternative universes bears more than a passing relationship with Chris's, after watching a YouTube documentary on Stair produced by WCT.[27] In February 2021, WCT attempted to become the fourth person behind the role of Lainchu but Chris rejected his attempt. In June 2021, Naught doxed WCT for declining to share his Kiwi Farms account after Naught had been banned from the site;[19] WCT responded by convincing Chris to leave the Watchmen's then-current Discord server The Place.[28] WCT then founded The Knights of CWC, a Watchmen splinter Discord server, where eventually in July 2021 Chris invited Isabella Loretta Janke. Prior to Chris's arrest for incest, WCT reached out to Bella again asking for her side of the story, who was able to manipulate WCT into attempting to shift blame from Isabella to Fiona.
XIII
XIII was present during the Watchmen's raid on Midnight Moonflower's Discord server. He accused Midnight of stealing Chris's wallet during Chris's visit to Midnight's house[29] - according to Chris, however, the wallet had been misplaced by Chris at a gas station and was later turned into the police station where he picked it up.[30] XIII also claimed to be in an affair with a server member, who protested the claim.[31]
XIII was also a member of the Watchmen Discord server The Place though he would later delete his account.[32]
The "Lainchu" role
Main article: Lainchu
Lainchu, also known as Lainchu the Chronicler, is an OC created by Chris, whose purpose is to document Chris's activities (and unofficially, to provide Christorians with first hand information), based on the protagonist of the anime, Serial Experiments Lain, in which a teenage girl finds herself engaging with a virtual world network, reminiscent of the internet.
Many different people have played the role of Lainchu, though it was mainly played by Anaxis, who was Lainchu from August 2020 to July 2021, as opposed to the other Watchmen, who were only Lainchu for around a month.
