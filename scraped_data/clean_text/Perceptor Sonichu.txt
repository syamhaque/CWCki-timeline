Perceptor is a shiny, female (born as a male Sonichu before being forcibly turned into a transwoman by a Nazi scientist), asexual Sonichu that was probably created by the Idea Guys to use as another RP character to convince Chris that Nazis were invading CWCville, although the extent of their involvement is uncertain.
She is also another lazy recolor whose personality boils down to "smart' and nothing else that Chris make up the lore on spot. She was initially believed to be a new member of the Chaotic Combo, but Chris implied that this wasn't the case in Discord Q&A 5.

Backstory
Perceptor Sonichu's egg was created in 2003 and sent through time by the Chaotic Rainbow to 2017. She appeared in front of Mewtwo and Magi-Chan, and was raised by them. Somehow, through their psychic powers, they taught Perceptor all conceivable knowledge. After completing her education, Preceptor made it her mission to teach her knowledge to dumb people worldwide. This, of course, excludes Chris' enemies and all that seek to troll him. She also hunts Nazis that have invaded CWCville, and had her body experimented on at some point by the Idea Guys.
Abilities
Perceptor has the totally achievable IQ of 500, which is even higher than the 300 IQ of Eggman in Sonichu Canon. She holds immunity to any mental or emotional manipulation, as well as deceptions and trickery. The irony of this was lost on Chris. Also, she has the power to disable any Nazi Technology and defeat any superhuman Nazi. As previously mentioned, this relates to issue #13 of Sonichu, or The Awakening of a CPU, where they invade CWCville and threaten to blow it up with a laser on the moon. Perceptor, while not seen in the Sonichu comics, can combat the Nazis with her power.
