On 19 June 2021, Chris tweeted a short video of himself baby-talking to and playing with one of his cats, Sylvia.
“
Sylvia’s being comfy and a little bobble-headed. Still cute. 😸
”
The video is noteworthy for featuring a seemingly overweight Sylvia, which is a sign of possible improper feeding habits.

Transcript
[Chris lies filming in bed, an overweight Sylvia sprawled out beside him. As he jiggles his leg, Sylvia jiggles with it.]
I wanna see you do this. You're a bobbly, aren't you, bobble-head? [Chris chuckles] You're a bobble-headed kitty. [Sylvia rolls onto her back] Aww, you're so cute. [high-pitched baby voice] He's so cute! [Zooms in on Sylvia's face] Hello. Hello! Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow! [Nonsensical cooing] Heh. N'aww, look at you.
[Sylvia continues to purr loudly.]
