This article is still yet to be completed due to stress. We get a lot of stressful torture in our lives that makes us crash into slumber. Given that inspiration is a big variable, and we may have been lacking of it, this article will be completed as soon as possible, at our own pace... HONEST! This article is missing the following:

eBay is an online auction site that Chris used from May 2001 to June 2019. During that time, Chris regularly purchased and sold stuff on the website. The site was also used by Chris for selling Sonichu and Chris Chan products.
His sales listings dramatically increased during the Financhu Crisis and Idea Guys sagas in order to raise money for creditors, bills, and more toys, and to pay off the Idea Guys so they wouldn't destroy CWCville, respectively.
Due to poor seller performance, Chris had his seller privileges suspended, although he made a new account with a clean slate years later.

Chris as a buyer
Main article: List of Chris's eBay purchases
Chris bought a number of My Little Pony action figures from the site. His many eBay purchases helped Chris accumulate a debt of $2,000 on his credit card.
During the Megan Saga, Megan often got Chris to buy her stuff — pictures of World War II Wehrmacht soldiers, anime CDs, Sailor Moon paraphernalia — from eBay, probably because she didn't have a credit card herself. In an email from 2007, Megan revealed the nature of the transactions, offering to repay Chris with "cash and or unneeded goodies",[2] though it seems in some cases Chris would buy things as gifts for her.
According to his feedback history as of 31 March 2010, he spent $12.97 on God of War III The Forgotten Warrior Skin Code for PS3 and $9.99 for a God of War III Apollo In Game Skin Code. On 1 September 2010, he spent $30 on a ModNation Racers Ratchet & Clank Mod. To put that in perspective, he could have bought the PSP version of ModNation Racers with that money, which he already did.[3] The Ratchet & Clank Mod was later released on the PSN for merely $2.[4] Chris also purchased a Lego Friends promotional display stand for $30.[3] Lego Friends is a series of Lego aimed at preteen girls, as evidenced by its general kiddiness and ease of assembly.
After being MIA on eBay for 2 years, he came back in late 2012 as a seller. A new noteworthy feedback was the Skylanders Giants Wii Bundle Pack plus Bonus, which he sold for $165.
Immediately after listing and successfully selling various drawings (including the Original Sonichu and Rosechu Drawing) and multiple autographed photos in early July 2014, Chris bought several Lego minifig parts on eBay.[3]
In 2015, Chris showed himself to be an avid consumer of Amiibo, which he'd buy from eBay scalpers at around $30 a pop. Chris seems to be going for a complete collection of Amiibo. In spite of the implied financial troubles that come with legal difficulties and having your home rebuilt from the Ground-Up, trolls noted that Chris bought a $30 Lego minifigure and hundreds of dollars in Lego sets; the typical spending spree for Chris ends in about $600 of tugboat being forked over to various eBayers in exchange for second-hand toys.
In 2016, Chris switched his interests from Amiibos to Transformers, spending hundreds of dollars on acquiring new figures, despite being neck-deep in the Financhu Crisis.
On 8 September 2016, he spent $62.64 to buy a Titans Returns: Optimus Prime figure. He left feedback on the item, stating, "It was opened, and it was missing one wheel." Oddly, he still rated the transaction positive[5].
Barbara's $400 gold necklace was purchased by Chris via eBay.

History
Since late 2008, when the Chris-Chan phenomenon became more widely known, people used Chris's eBay account as a means to troll him. They would bid on his auction, not pay, and then leave lulzy negative feedback.
Early in 2009, Chris tried to stop this form of trolling by changing his eBay name to "jesusguidesme2", and deleting information from his account; it didn't work. The account went dormant in September 2010, but became active again around August 2012.
On 22 June 2015, Chris opened a second, concurrent eBay account, pristinechristine1982: according to his Facebook announcement in June 2015, pristinechristine1982 was created to "start fresh on my selling limits and all".
eBay does not allow users to create additional accounts to avoid buying and selling restrictions or limits,[6] but Chris was able to buy and sell items without notable issues until being suspended on 16 June 2019.
On 2 September 2015, Chris announced on Facebook that he was moving from eBay to Etsy, stating that Etsy was easier to use, but after losing his Etsy shop in June 2016,[7] Chris returned to eBay as a seller, by listing Pokémon cards in July 2016. Over the next few years he would offer Sonichu and Chris Chan-related products on the site.
2008-2013 listings
Main article: 2008-2013 Sales Listings
Around September 2009, Chris, in a rare display of monetary wisdom, sold two of his Guitar Hero controllers. While not the autistic magnum opus we know as the Gitar of Fail, "Meatwad's Shredwad" shows off Chris's disregard for copyright and his fail art in one fell stroke. It's perfectly okay for Chris to sell his crappy fake Aqua Teen Hunger Force merch, but none of those slanderous trolls can do the exact same goddamn thing with Sonichu products. He also sold his Gibson model controller, which was covered in stickers. Someone purchased both controllers for a ridiculous $90.99, plus $6 for shipping.
He also sold a Bumblebee 2008 Concept Camaro claiming that it was unopened, which wasn't true.
On 18 September 2013, Chris returned to eBay and tried to sell the "kre-o micro changers Series 1, 12 piece set complete" collection for $65.

Many of Chris's sales were due to alleged extortion from the Idea Guys. Guard Dog The Captain stated that the Idea Guys "were telling him what to sell/urging him to dig through more boxes, etc. in an effort to find things to hawk on eBay to make money for them."[8]

Throw blankets
Set of Sonichu books (a replacement for Patreon, since he'd been bleeding subscribers on that platform for failing to ship)
At this point, Chris's seller account was restricted for poor performance and all his listings cancelled by eBay.
Suspension of Chris's eBay
Chris's seller account rated at an abysmally low 85%, and the negative feedback it had accummulated.
Chris's response to his eBay account getting nuked.
On 16 June 2019, Chris's eBay account was restricted. A likely reason for this was Chris's failure to ship out items to his buyers on time or at all. When they did arrive, they would often be damaged due to poor packaging. Chris had an approval rating of 85% on eBay prior to his removal. For those unfamiliar with the eBay rating system, a sub-90% rating for a seller is extremely poor. An 85% approval rating means 3 out of every 20 customers were unsatisfied with how the item shipped. The loss of his eBay marketplace dealt yet another huge blow to his monthly income, as he had already lost his Etsy shop for similar reasons.
Three days later, Chris confirmed that his eBay was restricted. He claimed "I don't need a listing", trying to get fans to donate money directly to him in exchange for items. Of course, anyone who would attempt such a deal does so at their own risk, since they wouldn't have buyer protection like eBay offered.
On 18 September 2025, Chris made a new eBay account under the handle chrischa831 in order to sell his Xbox One X.
