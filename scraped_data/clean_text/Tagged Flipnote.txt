Uh-huh.
A more accurate assessment.
This untitled animation is the eighth of Christian's Flipnote Hatena animations. The video has been dubbed "Tagged Flipnote," as it is based off a meme on the site where people get 'tagged' and write about themselves; Chris provides us with ten "facts" about himself, most of which are blatantly false. It should be noted that in order to be able to read it on the Internet, one must turn one's head or screen 90°.
This video was removed due to Chris's signature; sharing your True and Honest name is against Flipnote Hatena's rules.
