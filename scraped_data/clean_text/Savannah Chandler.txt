Savannah Chandler (born 17 August 1995) is Chris's half-niece, Bob's granddaughter and the daughter of David Alan Chandler (Chris's half-brother) and his wife Kimberly. She is currently the youngest known member of the Chandler family.
A troll impersonated Savannah in 2012 to bait Chris into conversation.
Family member
According to a Richmond Times-Dispatch article from 10 June 2015, she shares the same disability as her more famous uncle, and spent 2014-2015 working as an intern at a hospital.[2]
Chris did not meet Savannah until Bob's funeral in 2011, and he did not even know of her existence until she was eight years old, when he mentioned in a 6 January 2004 blog entry that he had discovered her.
Troll impersonation
Troll disclosure: This persona was created, appropriated, or otherwise used by trolls to manipulate Chris. Though this identity is contrived, the CWCki may treat it as if it were a real identity because it was to Chris. (It's also funnier that way.)
In October 2012, it was revealed that a "Savannah Chandler" was on Chris's Facebook friends list. Further communications between the two were eventually leaked after Chris determined "Savannah" was a troll.[3][4][5][6][7][8]
Savannah's messages are in pink, Chris's in light blue.

I am indeed Christian Chandler, David Alan Chandler’s brother. I have my own fears of people pretending to be other people on the Internet, so I need a bit of confirmation of you actually being my real one niece or not.
During your grandpa’s funeral last year, I gave your father a gift to give to you for me; simply tell me what the gift was, and I will know for sure.

That is a whole other long story; in a nutshell, I became Internet-famous, and I have had trolls and cyber-bullies attacking me and ruining my life and sanity over the past five years. And that is a big reason as to why I am so paranoid and cautious, and why identity confirmations are very important to me over the Internet.
Let me make your confirmation a bit more quick. I want you to send me a photograph of yourself, with your mom and dad. CURRENT, via U.S. Postal Mail to my address, 14 Branchland Ct. Ruckersville, VA 22968.
Either “Chris” or “Christian” is good with me.

Hi, Uncle Chris! Just wondering if you received the photo?
I know it’s important for you to have proof of who I am, but I’m a little bit worried. Like I said a while back, you have a lot of impostor accounts on facebook.
So how do I know you’re really my uncle? This could easily be a fake trying to trap me or something. I’d like to think that you are honest, but you have to understand I’m a little unsure because of all the different accounts claiming to be you.
Still very creepy. I don’t know what I’d do if I had s many people pretending to be me.
So yeah. Not trying to turn this back on you or anything, I’d just like proof that I’m actually talking to my uncle.

Firstly, I am aware of the impostors on Facebok; rest assured I am the real deal. I informed you that a year ago at grandpa’s funeral, I gave your father something close to me that I wanted you to have. Another detail Only I know is the weekend your grandpa and I traveled to your house one weekend to try to visit you all, with gifts. Y’all were not at home; we left the gifts with your next door neighbors for them to give to y’all for us. An angel from grandpa and squinkles with a display from me.
I have not received the photo yet, but I am still watching my mailbox.

I believe you, I can’t see what people would get out of lying to me, especially considering I was looking for you and not the other way round
But my friends are saying that maybe you’re a fake account. They said that maybe you didn’t accept my friend request because I’d more easily be able to tell it’s a fake if you did.
I’m not sure though. You do know a lot. I trust you, but anybody can make a fake account and not add me and make me think it’s them.
Sorry, I was talking to daddy and friends about this. Dad told me just to be careful online because I could get involved with internet weirdoes and my friends say the same thing.
Please don’t think I’m saying you ARE fake because I cannot know either way. ):

Hey I was wondering if you knew of any costume sale websites? Just a longshot but I’m asking everyone.
Halloween is coming up and I’m trying to get a costume together for Trick Or Treat.
Do you know Super Mario? (The game, not in person lololol) I want to dress as the princess for Halloween but it’s not spooky enough.
What do you think, should I go as the princess, or get together a monster suit? (Raaargh! (: )

For the Zombie Princess I would recommend some facial makeup and paint: go a bit gorey with grey skins rip your outfit a bit. Be a princess who was whisked through time forward to an appocalyptic time: bitten and infected: her soul stayed and brought a rule over the zombie hoard in that region.

You can talk to him about it if you wish. I created Sonichu, Rosechu and the city of Cwcville: I have artistic talent etc. Trolls have been terrorizing me for near five years now; they got shit on me from me from hacking my online stuff, blackmail, a bunch of other s***. Whatever their reasons: jealousy, boredom, desire for “more content”, being vicious, cruel, mean, their own family and life problems…. They got me, because I was weaker then, easy to deceive and trick: now I know better and I am stronger from the past experiences. They continue to pester me for new “content”: trying to break me further, emotionally and mentally, than they already have. All I have to keep me calm now is my mother, dog, God and Jesus, and my hobbies.

I am 30, 5’10’’, left is blue and right is green, (Crayola’s) Battery-Charge Blue, and I like fun shows and movies, video games, Lego building, arts and crafts; I get out and walk a lot daily, and I care a lot about my family and friends (but I could do with more friends my age range (mostly female)).

I would also be interested in reading what you can tell me about your dad, mom and Carol. Like how often do they think of our father (your grandpa) (before and after his passing). How do they feel about me as a sibling and a person? And what HAS Carol been up to, because dad was always concerned about Carol, because none of us knew what was going on with her. Last any of heard, she was working in DC with the government with her PhD in Mathematics.

Yes, I have sculpted a number of things, I have needleworked, paper mache clay, etc. I have taken a great number of art classes in my lifetime. I have drawn over ten comic books.
I would be very interested in seeing your art. As for mine, I have loads of photograph images of my work, and most of them are on my life DVD in the slideshow (made it on my 25th birthday; I will have to make and send a copy to you if I have not done so to your father already.
A lot of people can be creative, but it does depend on their skill set. At least reading and writing are still being taught in the public school. ):

Currently, I have been care taking and running a number errands for my mother, and we enjoy our two beagles, although they can be mischievous sometimes; they are mostly good and behave well. I am in and out of the house daily, and it does get really stressful mentally. I am a thinker as well, but I have to take my time often to think, because I have retarded moments. It is a bother. I am High-Functionally Autistic so my socializing abilities are stifled as well, although I was better at socializing during my middle and high school days. I often wish I could travel back to 1999 and re-route my future for the better. Since I moved back to Ruckersville from Midlothian, it was mostly downhill for me socially and emotionally.

But I digress. So you are in New York and traveling; now I understand your time zone dilemma better. I have wanted to visit NYC to visit the Pokemon Center, now known as a Nintendo Store. I like Pokemon. I have been playing the video game and the Trading Card Game since the Red/Blue/Yellow Generation I ‘8. I was also in the TCG League for years, and I am thinking about starting up a New League in C-Ville but I am having a spot of trouble locating a number associated with my POP ID: I contacted Tech Support about that.
Tell me, Sweetie, why are you currently traveling the states instead of being at home with your folks and going to school?

Well I had pretty good grades in school, so my parents weren’t too annoyed when my friend invited me along to NYC. When I get back, I’ll either return to school or find alternate education. Consider it a break for doing so well (:
Besides I’m almost an adult, life would absolutely suck if I spent all my time with my parents. I love them but it would be pretty lame if I hung out with them lol. I do have a life.
So what’s stopping you from going to NYC? Sounds like you’d really love it here.

Stopping me from traveling: lack of funds, responsibilities here at home; autism enforcing routine after routine in life (look it up on autism.org or Wikipedia), and I think I would not be able to last long there. “Nice place to visit, but I wouldn’t want to live there”.
I insist you to go back to school, finish your education and earn your diploma; life “free and wild” is okay in fair does, but Knowledge IS Power, and I would not want to see you bad off from learning the wrong things alternatively or not being able to make new friends in a good public setting such as in a school.
I describe myself a bit there: I feel uncomfortable in a large crowd setting like at a concert or out in the open like on the mall; I would feel better in a smaller area, such as a waiting room at an office or something, with a small amount of people, and where it is more quiet, controlled and peaceful.
Do you understand what I am saying, Sweetie?

Oh, like I said I fully intend to continue my education, whether that’s school or a form of alternative education.
But there’s truth to the saying that true knowledge comes from living and experiencing. Not everything can be taught from a book. If people didn’t live and experiment and do something with their lives, then there would be nothing to put in a book anyway, lol.
Thank you for your concern but I have my entire life to worry about that. I have studied hard for a good few years and almost got straight As, so right now I’m just regaining my sanity with a bit of rest and relaxation (:
Just because I’m taking a small break from school doesn’t mean all my friends will disappear either. They’re my friends, it’s not like they only exist AT school.
If I only saw my friends at school and not outside, then they wouldn’t really be my friends, would they?
And I do understand what you’re saying. Even I feel uneasy in big crowds. I can handle it sure, and sometimes it’s good, but there are a lot of times when I just want to retreat to my room with a nice book and shut the world out for a while (:
Oh, and I know about autism. It’s not exactly something mysterious. It’s pretty much well understood these days.
Still, a lot of lifes’ best moments come from breaking your routine even if it is hard. I had an autistic boyfriend when I was 13. He reacted badly to new situations but once he’d gotten used to them he was happier than I’d ever seen him.
But yes. I understand, and I’m sorry to hear about your situation.
What do you do for a living?
Like job-wise?

Yesterday was just a bad day for me; Mondays usually are; just another re-ranting about my tyrant adversary.
Yes, the experiences do count towards a greater knowledge, and book learning still leads to the option of learning for yourself.
I am currently unemployed; it is online-common-to-the-trolls knowledge that I get social security income. With the tainted, greatly dirty reputation the Trolls have taken out of context and twisted into great exaggeration and lies, every time I try to apply for a job, my BG check is bad and I never have been able to get hired.
Send me an email to my email address,

If you don’t want to wait for the DVD, and I put this with regret, the trolls got a copy of my DVD wrongfully, by posing as an old girl friend of mine and conning me out of it. And they have uploaded the individual videos onto their YouTube account, “The Cwcville Library” (Unofficial and Lucritious if you ask me). I will have to type you the list of the official videos from my DVD from start t finish, so you don’t pull up the wrong ones. In total, it is over six hours in vintage content.
That is a shame of the lost Drive, but you still have all of the original artworks in your collection; even in the digital age, I feel it is still very valuable and required for personal references to keep a Paper Trail of most to every things.
If I may ask, have you been using your phone to access the Internet as well? I use an iPhone 4, 8 GB; works great, especially with the occasional upgrades. Feel free to call me and leave a message at (434)-760-0848; I screen my calls, so if you call me, please inform me of the number of your cell phone of which you will be calling me from.
I am feeling better today, (:
So you Stay Safe and have yourself a good day, Sweetie.

Another little thing, I called your home recently, and I get from the machine, “Hello. No One is available”. I miss your message from last year, “Hi, you’ve reached the home of the Chandlers with our pets,” something and something; I forgot the names of your pets. What were their names?

I highly recommend that you set ALL of your photographs to Friends Only, because I would really hate for someone to get them and use them to their own evil will, like pretending to be you or whatever. The Trolls would have a field day if they got your photos. Friends Only; NOT Public.
