Delusion disclosure: This article or section takes place during Chris's phase of role-playing as Sonichu. He may refer to his Christine Chandler personality and physical body in the third person by using terms such as "mama".
On 5 November 2020, Chris posted in the Watchmen Discord server The Place about his
thoughts on the Chris Chan YouTube series Beneath the Bridge, describing it as "another trip down memory lane, with dives into hell and back." Chris noted that the coverage of Megan Schroeder in particular to be "a real mixed bag", and that he had been cringing and crying for much of it.

Hey, y’all.
I’m about to hit the hay, but just a few thoughts I feel like sharing with y’all.
Kyle
Happy 4 AM.

Hey sonichu
Chris (as Sonichu)
I just watched the “Beneath the Bridge” series on YouTube about Mama’s past trolls; good for the most part. I found the series through @Neko Onyx (Kat)’s playlist.
Definitely another trip down memory lane, with dives into hell and back, for this brain and body, and informative to me, Rosey and Cryzel.
The multi-part vids about Megan were a real mixed bag; more than half of the time, it hit the nerves in the core of this body, some cringe, a bunch of crying, and so on.
How Mama handled her theoretical exes, though, she really did not know what she was doing and was going based on the wrong instincts fueled by the wrong hormones and shit.
Kyle
Sidenote, that's quite extreme terminology, might want to talk to someone about that.
Chris (as Sonichu)
She has truly learned and developed throughout all of that, though; she does come around on the better meaning of maintaining a relationship, and she has literally emotinally and soulfully died, revived, and died and revived again and again from all of that. If that does not spell quality growth for a Goddess, I don’t know what does.
Beg your pardon, @Nova?
What do you mean by “extreme terminology”? (edited)
Kyle
The emotional response described.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Well, I am being direct and truthful about that. Everything about Megan and those pitfalls struck this body and the emotions that deep.
This body cried so much, the eyes got to feeling dry; had to drink some water.
MKRNightVee
I'm sorry you and your mama had to endure such hardships, but they really did make you stronger.
Kyle
Well, here if you need me, it sounds more destructive than constructive.
Chris (as Sonichu)
I’ll admit, I can’t always be as optimistic as Mama; I’ve had my really rough days and adventures in C-197 and then some.
And counting being in this body and this restrictive dimension for over seven months now.
It took me by surprise, though, and it is likely a misiinterpretation to actual events, but as mentioned a bit in the Blanca video, Mama failed at sticking with one woman at that time (regardless of both of them being total fakes, obviously), but freaking confused hormones perked her up in the worst misdirection back then at times.
Kyle
It's difficult to determine, learning sure, but having something still illicit a radical response is more a sign of obsessive thoughts.
Chris (as Sonichu)
I will take that into further thought and self-analysis, Kyle.
Kyle
Well, what metrics are we using for success?
Chris (as Sonichu)
But, yeah, Mama was not meant to be a playboy stud, slut, or whatever term you want to use.
That question feels like a topic change to me, Kyle.
Kyle
It's meta analysis, to see if the methodology applied is valid.
Central thesis, nothing easier than saying things will be different, God knows that's the only thing that ever kept Nigeria cash-solvent.
MKRNightVee
It's good to reflect on things to understand what went wrong and improve ourselves from those experiences. However, if we dwell and stew over it, we only cause ourselves pain.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Yes, I am not dwelling. But, the conscious memory in this noggin needed refreshing at this point.
Kyle
Epistemology, more or less.
Chris (as Sonichu)
I’ll recover.
MKRNightVee
That's good
We really care about you and your mama very much.
Kyle
"A little knowledge is dangerous", why the methodology is far more helpful than getting lucky.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Kyle, I’ve just come up with an espression for when you say such terminology that is traditional and comprehensive to you, yet flies over this noggin into too much thought: You’re just being NovaKyle.
l.hug
Chris (as Sonichu)
Thank you, Meghan.
Kyle
Reminds me of that Voy line.
MKRNightVee
Np thanks for the hugs
Chris (as Sonichu)
You’re not Pinkie, so I can’t say you’re just being Pinkie Pie, dude.
ALOL
Thanks for the listen.
I’ll check y’all later.
Goodnight.
