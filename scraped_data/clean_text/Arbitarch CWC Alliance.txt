Arbitarch, Watchmen
The Arbitarch CWC Alliance was a group of fantasy enablers created and led by Owls, an associate of MKRNightVee.[2] The group's membership also consisted of several of MKR's other associates, such as AquaDiamond8, Naught, and Kyle, and several obscure Chris orbiters such as ThatSperge, Smoky Chris, and Talia Nakara.[3] Joseph Draft, the creator of the cancelled Chris Chan VS. The Internet, has also been stated by Naught to have ties with the group.[2]
The group itself can be thought of as the precursor to the Watchmen, as several of its members would also become members of Naught's The Place, and served a similar purpose, to target various orbiters of Chris. Their Discord server was seemingly created around the same time The Place was, giving further credence to this. In particular, the group is most noted for their conflicts with the orbiters Jacob Sockness, Sarah and Steve, Richard Righteous and several Christubers such as GiBi and Dillin Thomas.
Unlike with the Watchmen, however, the Arbitarch Alliance seemed to interact with Chris primarily through the roles of CPU Goddesses, all with pre-defined lore and fanart, mirroring the practices of similar groups. Under Naught's rule, the Watchmen seemingly abandoned this practice sometime before mid-2020, instead providing Chris with other lore. The Arbitarch Alliance also posed as patrons of Chris's work, a facade they used to wrangle up potential victims of doxing.[2]
Also in spite of their supposed goals, the group's previous Discord server, The Sons of the Miscreants, was created for the discussing and archiving of the group's interactions with Chris, with several of the members in that server trying to come up with various ways to mess with him while roleplaying as CPU Goddesses. The group's leader Owls has also had a history of A-logging Chris and getting involved with weens, factors that led to the group's disbandment.[4][5]
Naught has alleged that he was the one that shut down the Arbitarch group, taking ownership of what would become the Watchmen away from Owls due to some of its members, particularly Joseph and Smoky, using the server to gather content. While some of its members, such as AquaDiamond8, opted out of this new change in leadership, others like MKR and Kyle remained, and became some of the Watchmen's most prominent members.[2] Naught also doxed several of the group's members on 15 August 2020, including Owls himself, calling it a "culmination of a few meta-sagas".[6][note 1]
Following the doxes, CWCki jerkop Hurtful Truth Level shared a set of screenshots from a DM about the disgraced leader of the group on Kiwi Farms on 14 September 2020. Owls tried to defend himself afterwards, but to no avail, and has left the Internet since.

Server Activity
Most of Chris's interactions on the server boil down to playing along with the members' newly created lore.
During their server's operation, people on Twitter commented on Chris's posts about it, revealing some troubling aspects of the server; not only were the admins and mods notoriously power-hungry and dictatorial, but in order to take part, users had to 'verify' their Discord accounts through a rather shady bot which requested access to user data, including any other servers the user was a member of.
Chris's Invite
“
To everyone who has heard and experienced the messages and events of the Merge and so forth, and blessings of me, join the Arbitarch CWC Alliance in sincere good will and faith.
”
Cris[7]
Chris had posted an invite link to the group's Discord server on Twitter on 6 January 2020.[7] This led to an influx of trolls and weens to go onto the server, and began spamming it. As a result, the entire server had to be purged. Despite that, Chris was still a member on the server.[8]
Leaks
MKRs Bloody Chunks

On 27 January 2020, a Kiwi Farms account under the name MKRs Bloody Chunks shared an assortment of leaks from both the Arbitarch and Place servers. Anaxis was later accused of being connected to this account after his ban from The Place, and the Watchmen became aware of one of the members giving Anaxis intel on the server's happenings.[9]

Notes
↑ The "meta-sagas" Naught was referring to appear to be in-fighting amongst former Arbitarch members about things related to Chris, most of which involved him, Owls, Smoky Chris, ThatSperge, Joseph Draft, and Talia.
