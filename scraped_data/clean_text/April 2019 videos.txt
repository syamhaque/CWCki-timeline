Hey everybody, got a little situation here. [Turns camera to face fuel gauge on car, which reads that the tank is about 1/8 full, then camera returns to Chris' face.] Less than an eighth full of gas in our one s-tangible vide-vehicle here, and, in pocket money only [Car horn honks] as well as a little bit of [pauses and adjusts camera] ...petty cash. [Turns camera to show out window] And I'm stopped by the way, I'm in the yard at home. Anyway, I need like 20 dollars for gas, please. Please help me out. Really need it so we can use this van, before our money-so we can use this van some more before our money comes in by next week. It's like next Wednesday or Thursday! Nyeeeeeeeeh! Thank you.
