================================================================================

Curse-ye-ha-me-ha Retraction (originally titled "Forgiveness/Blessings") is a video uploaded by Chris on 15 August 2009, in which he retracts all his Curse-ye-ha-me-ha's from the past, by conducting some anchuent magical rites not frequently practiced by mainstream Christianity (or any other religion familiar to the rest of the humankind). Perhaps it's Cherokian?
Of course, this retraction didn't stop him from spouting more curses at various people later on.
Description

[Brief jumpcut]
I take this moment, to most everyone I have put a curse upon, either from Curse-ye-ha-me-ha or simple [points finger like a gun and "fires"] Curse Shot.
[Chris closes his eyes and makes a face as if he was constipated as he holds his hands out]
This is for... all you individuals... [Stays in that pose for 10 seconds, then lifts his head up and sticks his hands out] Forgiveness... BLESSINGS!
[Raises his hands, open for five seconds. Then puts his hands down, stares at the camera and grabs his Gitar of Fail. Then he strikes a pose and flashes both his high school ring and Autobot insignia]
Everybody, have a safe day.
