In 2024, Chris backed a loser.
2024 was the sixteenth year since Chris's discovery. It was Chris's first full year not spent in jail since 2020.
This year marked the first time in Chris's life that he traveled outside the United States, visiting Finland in April, September and December with Flutter.
2024 also saw a U.S. presidential election, with Pmurt defeating against vice president and democrat candidate Kamala Harris; Chris had shown open support for the latter. Chris was eligible to vote, because his felony incest case was dropped by the autism disorder deferred disposition.

January
Main article: January 2024
Chris attended his first post-jail convention, Animate! Raleigh, and, unsurprisingly, was kicked out. Chris would also be interviewed by Keffals.

Chris in February 2024.
This month consisted of Chris releasing streams and videos under the influence of Praetor and getting spotted at Liberty University. Chris spent his 42nd birthday playing Pokémon GO.[1]
March
Main article: March 2024
Chris in March 2024.
This month consisted of Chris releasing streams and videos under the influence of Praetor and getting banned from BABScon. Chris would also be interviewed by TheGamerFromMars.[2]
April
Main article: April 2024
Chris in April 2024.
Chris's internet activity slowed down a considerable amount compared to previous months since his online return. Chris also did not stream this month, which he had done at least once per month the previous six months. Chris would publish his first video at 14 Branchland Court since July 2021 to promote the fake rocks on his Etsy store.[3] It was revealed about 6 months later that he had flown to Finland alongside Flutter this month, the first time he's traveled outside the United States.
May
Main article: May 2024
Chris in May 2024.
Chris flew on an airplane for the first time in 35 years as he was spotted at a Dallas Airport terminal. Chris's online activity this month consisted of a single video and complaining about being photographed in public despite his continued refusal to dress normally. CCTV cameras were used at Chris's house to discourage weens from visiting.
June
Main article: June 2024
Chris in June 2024.
The start of summer was marked by a lengthy period of social invisibility, making this Chris's quietest month since April. After issuing empty threats of legal action against anyone who recorded or photographed him unaware, he went without being sighted for almost the full length of June, being seen only once at the end of the month alongside Flutter - the first time the two had been seen together since March. He would return to streaming himself playing video games for the first time since mid-February, but aside from advertising what would be his only video in June his online presence and social media activity likewise diminished; the most outstanding development otherwise was a post made to Twitter on the 15th, a rambling address that attributed his lack of activity to 'soul searching'.
July
Main article: July 2024
Chris in July 2024.
July would commence with a brace of sightings a week apart, with Chris and Flutter being seen shopping at Walmart stores in Lynchburg. They would be seen once again on the road a few days after the second sighting, seemingly moving towards Charlottesville. Chris's social media activity was very sporadic with most of his few Twitter posts being made mid-July, and the month came and went without a stream.
August
Main article: August 2024
Chris in August 2024.
Chris was sighted on three separate occasions across August, in both Roanoke and Lynchburg; Flutter accompanied him in two of these sightings. On the 14th of August, he crossed the 100,000 subscriber milestone on his YouTube channel, taking to Twitter to celebrate. On the 31st, he also uploaded a video - his first in two months - commemorating this achievement upon receiving his silver Play Button. Bodycam footage of his encounter with Henrico County police three years prior was also uploaded to YouTube on the 17th, providing the clearest picture yet of the circumstances of his arrest.
September
Main article: September 2024
Chris in September 2024.
Chris launched a new website for selling items and posting blogs, Cwclight, with the help of Praetor. He was spotted at Walmart in Lynchburg again, and - more surprisingly - was seen with Flutter in Helsinki, Finland.
October
Main article: October 2024
October went without any sightings of Chris for the first time since he was rediscovered after his release from jail, likely due to Chris possibly still being in Finland. He provided another image of an uncolored page of Sonichu 0 HD, uploaded a number of videos from July and August to YouTube that were primarily related to ongoing Minecraft projects, and posted an image of a Sonichu pumpkin carving to Twitter to celebrate Halloween.
November
Main article: November 2024
Chris in November 2024.
Chris was confirmed to be back in the United States on the first of November after his car was spotted at a Wendy's drive-thru in Lynchburg. This month was also the Presidential Election between former President Pmurt and Vice-President Kamala Harris. After Pmurt won, Chris expressed his disappointment by posting about it on Bluesky, a Twitter alternative that Chris began "transitioning" to this month. Chris's reasoning for moving mainly being his disapproval for Elon Musk and Donald Trump. Chris's excuse for not using Bluesky exclusively is that he doesn't have enough followers yet.
Rumors spread online that Flutter was pregnant, and were even reported in the Daily Mail and The Times of India; Chris denied this in a livestream.[4]
December
Main article: December 2024
Chris continued his social invisibility throughout the end of the year. He was sighted only once, alongside Flutter at the Redi shopping center in the Kalasatama neighborhood of Helsinki, Finland on 17 December, confirming his third known visit to the country. He uploaded three Light Powered Cwclight reviews, his first new additions to the series since January, and both Christmas and New Year's came and went with little fanfare.
