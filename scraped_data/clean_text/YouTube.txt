“
We'd tell Chris to make videos and address them to people. Then we had those people respond. Since Chris has seen evidence that the method works, he doesn't need a more complicated explanation than "word gets around".

The Man in the Pickle Suit on Chris's habit of trying to address people over YouTube.[1]

Chris commenting on a (now deleted) video thinking it was meant for him.
YouTube is the primary arena in the online world of Chris, who has occasionally called it "the YouTube". His websites have gotten hacked, Encyclopedia Dramatica crashed forever, and even this very wiki sucks balls sometimes, but YouTube is always up and operational, and, except during his "final departure from the Internet" in 2010, Chris has always produced new Captain's Log videos and reacted to the videos of his friends and enemies. From 2017 onward, Chris's YouTube presence started to dwindle as he shifted his online presence to Twitter, but he still uploaded videos every now and then.
For Chris, YouTube wasn't merely a way to post videos dedicated to his alleged adoring fanbase and issue broad condemnations of trolling; it was also a communication channel. Chris has posted several videos on his YouTube channel that he apparently believed would be only viewed by the people he addressed the videos to, and that they'd view the video even when they haven't been made aware of Chris's channel. He has addressed individual trolls, individual alleged fans, sweethearts and especially former sweethearts, journalists[2] and TV shows[3][4], local business managers[5] and other people within driving distance of his house. As of 2009, Chris is wary of email and other text-based forms of communication, having been burned by alleged sweethearts who turned out to have pickles. Chris has also been known to search videos labeled "Chris-chan" in order to satisfy his ego.
There's a certain beauty to the way Chris's videos are displayed to the world: The videos he wants the world to see end up on YouTube. The videos he reconsiders and deletes also end up on YouTube. The videos he sends privately to trusted gal pals end up on YouTube. The videos he makes depicting himself in the nude usually get taken down from YouTube, but that's what SlutLoad is for. A high priority among the internet bullies is to archive every video Chris has ever made, which is fairly challenging since Chris will often DELETE ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING when he thinks he's embarrassed himself or left himself open to attack.

Main article: Chris and cameras
C'mon! You can TOTALLY see his face!
When viewing one of Chris's videos, one of the first things the viewer will notice is the excruciatingly poor quality. One of his major flaws as a cameraman is lighting; any amateur cinematographer would know that if you're recording a video indoors, you need to turn the lights on, but Chris doesn't adhere to this basic rule. As a result, almost all videos recorded indoors have a sickly greenish-yellow tinge to them. Also, due to this, almost every video suffers from blurriness thanks to the lack of proper lighting.
Whenever Chris is recording, he seems to fail to grasp the basic object of "focus"; to make sure that the camera is appropriately trained on whatever it is he is trying to film. As such, whenever he is filming, he is often way out of center. It also doesn't help that he often adjusts the camera angle without regards to what his audience will see, which means that you can't even see what it is he's filming. For a very good example, when Chris was gloating about the picture of Clyde Cash he had found online, he was holding it far too close to the camera's lens, so that you never really do get to look at the picture as a whole.
Chris also seems to lack any basic video editing skills, be it pre- or post-production. Whenever he needs to put text in a video, he chooses to write it down on a piece of paper and record it with his camera. Almost any basic video editing software, even Windows Movie Maker, has an option to display computer-generated text within the video and in the occasions that he needs to insert a TV clip, he instead opts to record directly from the TV screen, even though it would be far more prudent to insert the clips in via editing.[6]
What makes this all pathetic is that Chris chooses to blame these flaws on his equipment, when anyone as devoted to video blogging as himself would choose a far superior and more devoted option than the PSEye camera, and buy the basic essentials such as a tripod, as well as some decent video editing software such as Sony Vegas. But that would leave him without money to spend on other things.
Chris's YouTube accounts
Sonichu (May 2007 – September 2008)
Chris's original YouTube channel, after it was hacked.
Status: Deleted
Chris's ORIGINAL and OFFICIAL YouTube account was Sonichu, created on 8 May 2007. The account originally served to host the trailer for his DVD, his Future Message, and the clips of himself on the evening news.
Following his discovery of the ED page in November 2007, Chris began using the account to post videos arguing against ED's Laughs Under Lucricities, and by August 2008 it had become the base of operations for his war against all of ED. The Sonichu account was hacked during a massive ED counteroffensive on 11 September; Chris deleted the account, apparently hoping to escape from the trolls under a new username.
CChan6789 (September 2008 – March 2009)
Status: Alive
Chris created CChan6789 on 18 September 2008, and abandoned it on 30 March 2009. This account saw many of the most famous and classic Chris-chan moments, including him crashing into slumber and raging at Clyde Cash for the first time. Amazingly, CChan6789 remains open with several videos still intact. According to his talks with Jackie, the only reason this account was lost was because Chris lost his password and he didn't realize that there's a password recovery function.
CChanSonichu (April 2009 – July 2009)
Status: Deleted
Although Chris abandoned CChan6789 with the intent of preventing the trolls from having new footage to mock him with, Chris returned with CChanSonichu on 09 April 2009. This account saw even more classic Chris moments, such as him admitting to drinking his jizz. The account was hacked on 05 June 2009, although Chris subsequently regained access. He later posted three insulting and threatening videos, which caused the account to be suspended on 11 July.
IBAChandler (July 2009 – August 2009)
Status: Deleted
Rather than attempt to reactivate CChanSonichu or simply reuse CChan6789, Chris immediately created IBAChandler on 11 July 2009. This new username confused many people, requiring Chris to slowly explain thousands of times that "IBAChandler" is a pun meaning "I be a Chandler", as in "I, Christian, am one of the Chandlers".
Chris's initial use of the IBAChandler account was to post a video with his new look, claiming he was and had always been a troll posing as an autistic manchild. This resulted in the narrative that the owner of IBAChandler was an impostor named Ian Brandon Anderson, and that CChanSonichuCWC was in fact the TRUE and HONEST Christian Weston Chandler. The rest is history.
ChristianWChandler (August 2009 – August 2011)
Status: Alive
To dispel the claims he's Ian Brandon Anderson, Chris made a new account, ChristianWChandler, which makes it clear (or so he believes) that he is Christian Weston Chandler on 18 August 2009. There is, however, no proof that he ever worked as a sacristan, or any other type of a Christian WC handler.
On 22 November 2010, Chris uploaded a video in which he announces his departure from the Internet again. After uploading this video, Chris removed all his other videos from his ChristianWChandler account, not to update again for little more than 2/3 of a year. However, after a string of blackmail videos, Chris's account was stricken again. The account still remains open. The last video uploaded was Gratitude for a good person in N.C.
ClydeGreggCashMays (October 2009 – November 2009)
Status: Alive
Apparently very vaguely aware that YouTube accounts that are used for blackmailing people tend to get shut down, Chris created ClydeGreggCashMays on 26 October 2009 to post his blackmail videos of Clyde Cash, so that in the unlikely event of YouTube noticing these prohibited activities, his main account won't get shut down. However, due to the fact that Chris's blackmailing scheme lacked any chance of success in the first place, nobody even gave a damn. As a result, the account still remains open to this day. (The first time YouTube actually reacted to Chris's TOS violations happened over year and a half later, during his second blackmail saga – and Chris posted these videos on his bright, shiny and law-abiding ChristianWChandler account.) Several videos originally aired on the channel are absent, with the most recent surviving video being Apology for 9/11 Joke.
CwcvilleGuardian (February 2012 – July 2021; September 2023 – Present)
Status: Alive
Chris's profile picture, drawn by DoopieDoOver.
While CwcvilleGuardian was initially created by Chris to post a comment on 27 February 2012, he later primarily used it to favorite My Little Pony videos, Lego-related animation, clips from The Simpsons, video games, and his own videos.
Curiously, he has added several videos from TheCWCvilleLibrary in his playlists, ignoring how their titles openly mock him. Even more curiously, he has also added several videos from Hotdiggedydemon's PONY.MOV series, videos he claimed were responsible for killing his inspiration for drawing more Sonichu. He has subscribed to Michael Snyder's YouTube account, ultimately proving that he will never be able to forget his petty, one-sided grudge against this man, even after nearly going to jail over this obsession.
For almost two years, no videos were uploaded. However, on 5 November 2013, he uploaded his first video under the CwcvilleGuardian username and his first since the end of the Tomgirl Saga: CWC Lego Manchester High School Oct 18 2013. Later, on 17 July 2014, Chris uploaded his first Mario Kart 8 video that would soon be followed by other lazily made videos just like that. Then, on 4 October 2014, Chris uploaded a video titled I Love You, Catherine, revealing the name of his then anonymous sweetheart.
Chris fully returned to YouTube on 25 October 2015, and uploaded videos regularly here.
He has also monetized most of the videos which appear on this channel, as another way of profiting from his internet infamy. As further proof of his entitlement issues, at one point around March 2016, he received $80 and was "pissed" that he hadn't gotten more.[7]
This account was dormant during Chris's jail stay for incest. On 16 August 2021, a ween hacked into the account and uploaded clips of Anthony LoGatto imitating Chris's cries of "JULAAAAAY" in "For Julie's Eyes Only".
On 30 September 2023, the ween-uploaded video of Anthony LoGatto was "removed by the uploader",[8] indicating Chris re-gained access to the account. The removal came around a month after Chris DMed Helena Fiorenza declaring that his online return would be coming.
The following month, Chris made his full return to YouTube. Beginning in November 2023, several old begging videos which had featured himself and Barbara were Privated on his channel (but were archived elsewhere).[9][10][11][12][13]
On 14 August 2024, Chris hit 100k subscribers.[14][15] He had been looking forward to the milestone.[16] Chris stated that YouTube owed him a Silver Creator Award for the milestone; two weeks later, he would later receive one.[17]
CwcvilleGuardian (November 2014)
Status: Deleted
In late 2014, Chris created another account also named CwcvilleGuardian and uploaded the Brushfire Video.
The account was deleted at some point after January 2023, the last point at which the Wayback Machine had saved a copy. The circumstances behind the deletion are unknown.
This account was possibly made due to complications arising from YouTube infamously integrating the failed Google+ service onto the site, which, among other things, required users to make a Google+ account in order to comment on videos.
Christine Chandler (October 2013 – July 2016)
Status: Alive
Despite being made in 2013, Christine Chandler has only three videos. All of them were paid video requests made when his CwcvilleGuardian account was banned for two weeks in July 2016. After the ban was lifted, this channel was quickly abandoned aside from a renaming to "Jesus Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu Prime" sometime in Late-2023, which is likely due to Chris renaming his connected Google account as such.
Christ Chan (June 2023 - Present)
Status: Alive
Created 2 months prior to his charges being dropped, Christ Chan is the first YouTube channel Chris has created since his arrest. Chris has posted no videos from the account but a playlist made by the account was featured in
Very First Media Share Suggestion Live Stream.

Comments and reactions
Many of Chris’s YouTube videos have more dislikes than likes, and where comments are allowed, they mostly range from the genuinely concerned,[18] and enablers rallying behind Chris,[19] to weens blurting out outdated memes[20] and those telling Chris to "get a job".[21]
Fan archives and leaks
As subject material or Chris's regrets can lead to videos being deleted, many fans archive copies of his videos on their YouTube accounts. Videos are occasionally also recorded by Chris without intention of sharing publicly, and later leaked by fans. One of the first channels dedicated to this was TheCWCvilleLibrary, run by troll character Arjen Van Dierten.
Chris's other video site, Veoh
“
The Ignored Veoh.com, with all the free porn to download at 5kbits a second
”
Chris, on Encyclopedia Dramatica
Veoh was an internet video distribution site, not unlike YouTube, launched in 2005. Several months later, Chris created a profile, "Sonichu," and used the site to upload his early videos and watch children's animation. He used his full name, portrayed himself with a cartoon drawing, and linked to his Tripod Sonichu site. He continued to upload his videos to the site into 2009, but did not seem to give it the same attention as YouTube (understandable, given Veoh's severe lack of popularity). It is perhaps most noteworthy to Christorians as the place where his once-lost "CWC is Angry" video was found in 2009. Chris's long-inactive account was still available on the site until its closure on November 11, 2024.[22]
