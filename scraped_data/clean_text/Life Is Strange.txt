This is what Chris actually believes.
Life Is Strange is an episodic graphic adventure video game series that was released for multiple consoles. The first game's plot focuses on Max Caulfield, a photography student who discovers that she has the ability to rewind time at any moment, leading her every choice to enact the butterfly effect. After having foreseen an approaching storm, Max must take on the responsibility to prevent it from destroying her town. It is followed by a prequel, Life Is Strange: Before the Storm, which focuses on the romantic relationship between Chloe Price and Rachel Amber. Following Before the Storm is Life Is Strange 2, which focuses on a new set of characters and a new story, followed by Life Is Strange: True Colors, which also features a different set of characters and story, followed by another game, Life Is Strange: Double Exposure, which features the return of Max Caulfield.

Chris and Life Is Strange
Chris seems to relate mostly to Chloe Price, saying how he wishes that he could be saved by his own Rachel Amber. He may not understand the story of the games, since no matter what, their relationship is doomed to fail, and just latched onto the idea that a blue-haired lesbian hooks up with another woman. Or, perhaps he does understand the plot and has come to realize that there is no possible future in which he has a girlfriend, however unlikely this outcome is.
On 4 October 2017, Chris brought up the Life Is Strange gameplay when talking about his Adult Chronicles game in a Q&A he did for Kiwi Farms. He said,
Mm. Oh yeah, um... Adul-- The... heh. There was a video game of my adult life to be made, it would have to be something like a choice-making game like, either Life Is Strange or Gone Home. I like both of those, both of those are really good.
Strangely enough, Gone Home is not a choice-making game or at all similar to Life Is Strange. The only theme the two games have in common is lesbian romance between two teens.
Origins
In 2017, Chris was likely aware of the franchise's sizable following, and the player-determinant lesbian implications of the games. According to Chris' PSN account, he played Life Is Strange on 11 June and completed it.[1] On 4 September, he started episode one of Before the Storm.[2]
7 September, 2017
On 7 September, Chris posted a status on Facebook, complaining that he was lonely:
I feel like Chloe Price from "Life Is Strange - Before The Storm", waiting and praying for my "Rachel f***ing Amber" to come swoop in and Batwoman me to somewhere safe.
Later that day, Chris uploaded a video, scorning the trolls. Again, he used a Life Is Strange analogy to make clear that he was yet to become friends with his contacts:
Just like Chloe didn't have much information about Rachel Amber when Victoria was like “Oh! Rachel put the photo on the inter-, on her Facebook of you two at the... at the band last night! Guess what? That makes y'all B.F.F.s forever!”
