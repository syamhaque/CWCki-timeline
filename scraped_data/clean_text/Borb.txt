Hey y'all! This is a disambiguation page — but I digress...
Borb is a colloquial term used to refer to Chris's parents; a portmanteau of their nicknames Bob and Barb (It is also an old Irish word meaning "foolish", or "uncouth" fittingly enough).
Bob Chandler, father of Chris
Barbara Chandler, mother of Chris
