Sonic Rebuilt
Information
Released
6 March 2020
Sonic Rebuilt is a crowdfunded shot-for-shot remake of the 1996 OVA series of Sonic the Hedgehog, released on 6 March 2020 after some delay. It is the second of such project from 3GI Productions, who previously did the similar Shrek Retold.
Once again, Chris took part in the project; this time being assigned to scene #63-69, where Sonic sprints along the side of a cliff to rescue Tails and Old Man Owl from a crashing jet plane. For his scene, Chris simply traced most (if not all) of his art to the original scene and had Sonic transform into his own creation part-way through. Like the last time, it appears a third party is doing the animations for him.
