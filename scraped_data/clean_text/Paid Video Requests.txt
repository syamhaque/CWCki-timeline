Title: Paid Video Requests

Paid Video Requests are videos Chris records in exchange for money.
On 18 July 2016, Chris announced that he would be offering video messages for sale, for $50 each, arranged through texting instead of his defunct Etsy shop. On 26 July, he changed his pricing, saying "it starts at $50, but I'm negotiable to as low as $10, and no less." Fans flooded him with requests.
Two videos had (unintentionally) funny results. In Singing "Yellow Submarine", Chris drops the camera for a moment, revealing an upskirt shot and showing him wearing a pantiliner. After Chris uploaded Fuck, Fuck, Fuck, Shake my boobies, YouTube deleted it and issued a strike against his account. Chris reacted to the fallout from both the following day on Facebook[1].
Following the strike, which barred him from uploading videos to his CwcvilleGuardian YouTube account for two weeks, Chris continued the video request program by uploading to an alternate account[2], then returning to his main account after the ban expired.
Fans continued buying more video requests throughout 2016, although the number of public videos gradually diminished.
