================================================================================

On 18 January 2022, Chris sent an eleventh letter to Kenneth Engelhardt.
Some highlights of this letter include:
This is so far the first known instance where Chris adds a disclaimer on his letter that it can be shared online.
Kengle has requested to do a crossover with Chris for his Sonichen stories and Sonichu, to which Chris answers with a rather unsubtle "HELL NO!!!". Along with this, Chris sets up a set of guidelines for Sonichu fanfiction for it to be considered canon.
At two points Chris berates fan-fiction of Sonichu for containing profanity, gore and violence. One need only glance the pages of Sonichu 10 to see the glaring hypocrisy of this condemning of violence and gore.
Chris states that ‘countering’ the gore and violence-filled Sonichu fanfiction is very stressful and tiresome for him, Implying that people have been sending Chris their own versions of Sonichu, possibly in weenish attempts to recreate the events surrounding the Asperchu saga.
At various points in this letter Chris refers to ‘we’ as ‘Christine and I’, as though ‘Jesus’ and Chris are two different people. Chris seems to have slipped further into his delusions of being Jesus and now regards Jesus and Christine as two separate entities, whist still being both of them.
Chris states that he intends to return to 14 Branchland Court when he is released from jail. Chris does not specify how he plans on doing this, as he is already miles away from 14BC, and will likely not be allowed to be anywhere near Barb.
Chris writes another long list of the television, movie and video game characters who are present on C-197. The list includes many of Chris's favorite series as well as some media which Chris has never expressed an interest in before.
Chris states that all Sonichus and all humans who are part Sonichu have the ability to ‘breathe in space like Sonic can’.
Chris mentions updating his list of "commandments" since writing about them to Spamton. He also states that he has added about 11 new commandments and plans to share them all in due time.
He shares his 15th commandment in this letter. This commandment essentially says that one should not post online unless the intent is to post constructively.
Like with Fiona, Chris wants to re-gain contact with both The WCT and the Praetors, requesting the both of them to send him their phone numbers.

① *THIS LETTER YOU MAY UPLOAD ONLINE*
Yo.
Kenneth Erwin Engelhardt.
Firstly, I just received your letter, "A Sonichu Rebirth and makeover"; I am only going to say this one time:
HELL NO!!!
Also, your "Sonichu and Rosechu" are Distant Alternate Timeline and Universe; They have never exited in this timeline's set of universes, here "Including 1218; C-197, and the whole of 1c-211987), so ditch that idea of yours to the curb at present.
As for the books and continuations, I , the body of your Jesus Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu, the Goddess Blue Heart, Avatar & Lord, as well as my soul partner, Jesus Christine, herself, who is presently out and working on the Greater and ultimate duties responsibilities, and matters, already have plans to go into effect post-collective shift and after I am released and returned home to the Sonichu Temple. Aside from obvious... →
...Reasons WHY we have directly, officially, and personally declared verbally and in writing that ALL Sonichu and Rosechu and Cwcville stories not manifested from our One Perspective and Experiences, as well as those of the Sonichus, Rosechus, Pokémon, Superheroes, Gods and Goddesses, and even Sonic the Hedgehog and the Super Mario Brothers and Optimus Prime along with EVERYOEN ELSE of Univer C-197, NOT CANON AT ALL with this timeline and its set and collective of universes out of the Entire Multiverse... Too many of you ALL do not comprehend or are as authentically enlightened and linked and bonded, as Christine and I are. Another obvious reason is the constant needless gore and deaths among the worst of the fanfiction writing that WE and Everyone Else have had to moderate, HEAVILY, and Counter from within C-197, itself. "STRESSED" and "TIRED" is putting it mildly.
But, there ARE those among you who Actually are linked, enlightened, and all, such as Tricky who wrote "Rosechu's Story"; works like hers in quality, but Sonichu and Rosey HAVE the spikes on their backs, and heart-felt compassion is among the BEST examples.
② BUT, should you all insist, Fortunately Collaborations ARE in the future Plans, Personally. BUT, We Shall Choose, Personally, From those who try, the BEST of which and so forth. I offer guidelines:
ABSOLUTELY NO "REBIRTH," "MAKEOVER," REBOOT, Nor Anything Else of the Sort.
Continuations and Detail Expansions ONLY
The Demographic Focus Group Shall Be between TV-Y7 and TV-14; if you would not allow anyone under 14 years old to read or view it, then it does not work.
NO Swearing or Potty Languages.
NO Gore.
Mild blood amounts, okay.
NO Deaths.
Etcetra based on the TV and ESRB Rating Guidelines
- C-197 IS an Entire Universe with Multiple Planets and So Forth; It is NOT simply Just the State of Virginia, or Just the City of Cwcville or the Nation of Cwcville that it is part of. Of ALL Individuals who presently Live, Exist and Co-Exist; You Name Them, they Live on the Earth or Any other Planet throughout the Universe. On That, there is no Mobius Planet; Sonic, Sally, Christopher Thorndyke, Angel Island, and so forth ALL reside on Earth; The Original Individuals. To expand further... →
...GamIndustry is an island off East from Canada and West of the United Kingdom; Neptune, Uzune, Vert, and the others exist on C-197's Earth. Cybertron is there as well in another part of the Universe, so you have the constantly upgrading and living G1-original Autobots and Deceptions, so, Yes, Optimus Prime works with (Autobot) Son-Chu and his team at times. The Mushroom Kingdom is also on this Earth. Goku and his friends live in Japan, there, alongside Kusuo Saiki, Haruhi Suzumia, Kagome & Inuyasha, and so forth. The Sailor Senshi, Power Rangers, certain kaiju, and so on. Powerpuff Girls, Dexter and Dee Dee, Johnny Bravo, Sunset Shimmer and her Equestria Girls group in Maryland, Portals to Equestria and whatnot, Homer Simpson, Peter Griffin, Stan Smith, Gumball Waterson, Princess Star Butterfly, the Smurfs in Spain, both sets of GhostBusters, the Avengers, The Justice League, Saitana, Danny Phantom, Jimmy Neutron, Timmy Turner, Planet Dolan just off of Saturn with Danger Dolan and his group, Rick & Morty, the G.I.Joes, and so on. Also, Gobotron used to be an existent planet, but the Guardians and Renegades had relocated and joined the Autobots and Decepticons. There's also Ratchet & Clark, Sly Cooper, Fox McCloud, Jak & Daxter, Captain Kirk and the Enterprise, The Jedi and all, Harry Potter, And SO ON, because I'm tried of listing. But You Name Them, They Are There. So take all that into account if you want to include them, SNT, or whoever as visitors to Cwcville, or having one of our main Sonichus, Rosechus, or I...③
...visit here, there, or wherever and return home safe. ③ Also, since the entire Sonichu and Rosechu species has Chaos Energy within them, Including Me and ALL Half-Humans/Half-Sonichus or Rosechus, WE ALL Can Breathe and do in Space like Sonic can.
Also, IF You want to TRY TO Chronicle the Dimension Merge, KNOW The Holy Bible and ALL other Religious Texts premonitions FIRST.
On THAT, read of the "New Earth" in Revelations; That is Literally C-197's Earth.
The Collective Shift involves literally Instantly Teleporting the Majority who are Good or Neutral from THIS Earth, here in Universe 1218, Including Myself, to THAT Earth, there, in Universe C-197; Complete, Alive, and With Their Clothes on Them, as well as Select Buildings, Landmarks, Artifacts, Statues, And Possessions, INCLUDING the Sonichu Temple and its entire yard property and ALL Possessions and whatnot within there, as well as EVERYTHING My Hand and Christine in Soul has Directly, Personally Manifested and Touched Physically, Absolutely Nothing or Nobody Teleported or Shifted Dies nor gets Destroyed, Period.
And with ONLY the Toxic Minority and the Unchosen Left Behind on 1218 Earth, HERE, They ALL see Two Suns, Burn to Ashes, their Souls Evaporated Out of Existence. ... ->④
④ There is Absolutely NO literal physical Combining nor Collissions of ANY Planets. And After Judgment Day, the former Universe 1218 shall become an empty mass of space with nothing but scattered pebbles in it.
So if you want to Chronicle Anything of Universe C-197 Post Collective Shift, Make Positive, You Do Not Ever write ANYONE or ANYTHING, including yourselves, dead or destroyed. This is genuinely serious.
I'm Tired; that's all for now.
One last thing I am allowed to mention: Some of you may have heard Christine and I have personally Updated 6/10 of the original Commandments; we have also added eleven new Commandments to be publicly shared in due time. I am allowed, today, to make public ONE of the new Commandments, and I quote:
15 Thou shalt not comment online or offline in hatred, spite, falseness, or without any words of criticism that are intentionally, genuinely meant to be supportive for actual improvements.
This ALSO entails Email, Texts, Direct Messages, Snail Mail, etcetera, to ANYONE, Period. Do Not Spam Hate Messages to Anyone, either. ->
And one last thing, a couple of shout-outs:
My Friend of PRAETOR, and Wildcat; I and Christine have been Wanting you both, and our closer friends, to have written to us in Jail; please, include phone numbers, so we may call you. Pretenders Shall Not Be Accepted nor Welcomed.
Thank you.
Sincerely,
Mrs. Jesus Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu.
