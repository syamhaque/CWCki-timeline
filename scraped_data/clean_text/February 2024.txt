Chris in February 2024
I- I am not crazy. I am NOT crazy! I know he fucked that mother, it was in 2021, one after COVID, as if Id ever make such a mistake. Never. Never! I-I-I just couldn't prove it. He covered his tracks, he got that insane woman on Discord to lie for him! Wh- you think this is something? You think this is bad? this? this CHICANERY? He's done worse! That billboard - Sonic's arms turned blue again just like that? He orchestrated it! Chris-chan! He ejaculated into a Fanta! And I trolled him. And I shouldn't have. Made him his own wiki site- what was I thinking? He'll never change. He'll NEVER change, ever since he was 18, couldn't keep his hands off his galpals! 'but not our Chrissy, couldn't be precious Chrissy.' Groping them blind! And he get's to be a free man again? What a joke! I should have stopped him when I had the chance and you, you have to stop him you....
February is the second month of 2024.
