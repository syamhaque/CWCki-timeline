How Chris uses science and technology to achieve his ultimate transformation.
“
I was actually surprised on how my torso would look blue, then after I painted my face, before the headwear, I reminded myself of the Marvel superhero Nightcrawler
”
Chris to Jackie[1]
ECV 00002 is a video uploaded on 10 October 2010 in which Chris uses the power of Random Access Humor and jump cuts to transform into his Super-Mode. Jackie requested this video two days prior.[2]
The results are mixed; Chris at least attempts to use the same pose and positioning before and after the jump cut, but this baby step towards competence is overshadowed by a retard-fall back by the slip-shod cosplay self-paint job. An odd, incomplete white field over most of his face meant to resemble Sonic/Sonichu-style eyes, a cone-ear constructed out of construction paper (which regularly falls off, despite Chris's lack of movement), and a white "chest-fur" patch, which is supposed to be an outline of the Medallion of Fail only serve to further damage Chris's physical appearance.

Hello, folks! Hm. Well, and now for something completely different. Electric Hedgehog power! PEW!
[Jump cut. Chris is now dressed as Chris-Chan Sonichu. The transformation straightens his back, lowers and bends his arms, and moves a few items in the background]
Pew. [Chris-chan Sonichu's right ear begins to fall off] This would be me in my super mode! [Chris puts the right ear back on] ...if I actually had the super powers! [The right ear falls off yet again, but is put back in place] But I don't in real life. But I dressed up like this anyway, to, I don't know, [The same ear falls off yet again, promptly readjusted] just to say something or just to have fun.
Anyway, live an honest life, don't curse, don't badmouth people... It's just not cool. You know? Don't pic- don't torture me. At least I am doing this and... I have myself a woman, so there. So she'll appreciate this very much. She appreciates almo- everything I do for her. Especially these videos.
Jackie, I love you. I want to hold you in my arms, sweetheart. You come over right on here and we'll do each other right. Sweet times...
[Pause.]
Alright, anyway, stay in school, stay well... um... you know. Just live rife peace- live peacefully. Don't take- don't be angry at people. Don't be mean. OK? A'ight. Take care.
