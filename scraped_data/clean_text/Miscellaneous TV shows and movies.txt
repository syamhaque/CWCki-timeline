Beetlejuice Beetlejuice
Chris mentions his awareness of this film in his Minecraft livestream on 30 June 2024.[1]
Cannibal Holocaust
Cannibal Holocaust, released in 1980, is a horror film known for its extreme gore and nudity (including pickles).
In late July 2010, Jackie suggested that Chris watch the movie. While he was reluctant, over not liking cannibalism, he agreed to watch it.[2]
The following month, Chris wrote that he was bothered by the gore in the movie, but chalked it up to "Hollywood magic" to cope with it (despite the fact that there are real, onscreen animal deaths). He also described a rape scene as "I liked the part where the professor lured out the women of the tribe to play with him in the water."[3]
Donnie Darko
“
But long story short: We OCs and FCs - that’s Original Characters and Fictional Characters - we all exist to coexist, right next to an invisible curtain divide that’s invisible for the most part, but you can sense it. If you watch the movie Donnie Darko and that liquid metal barrier, It’s essentially that.
”
Chris comparing Dimensional Merge lore to a plot element from Donnie Darko[4]
Chris is a fan of Donnie Darko (which he misspells as "Darkko").[5][6] On 26 September 2020, Chris suggested a Richard Kelly theme for The Place's Movie Night, listing movies directed/written by Kelly including Donnie Darko and its sequel S. Darko.[5] Chris referenced Donnie Darko during an October 2020 livestream[4] and in a June 2021 tweet.[6]
Everything Everywhere All at Once
Frasier

Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths
“
The bomb went off and the bad one became gone.
”
Chris summing up a plot point.[10]
In a chat with The Place from December 2020, Kyle pondered over the concept of empty dimensions, and Chris replied that the only real one is a void between dimensions. Chris cited the animated movie Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths as proof (though misremembered its title as "Justice League Infinite Crisis").[10]
The Justice League franchise itself has been referenced by Chris in other contexts. His OC CWC Psychlight rips off from Justice League settings and characters. Justice League is also commonly included in Chris's descriptions of what his fantasy dimension C-197 contains.[11][12][13]

Knuckles
Chris watched the Knuckles series on streaming service Paramount+, reviewing it in May 2024. He rated it 8/10, saying the series could have used more of the titular character. Chris praised Christopher Lloyd's portrayal of Pachacamac. He also mentioned liking how Knuckles was accepted by a Jewish family.[14]
Ready Player One
Ready Player One is a science-fiction movie released in 2018. Its plot revolves around a virtual reality simulation which the populace uses for escapism, and the movie is notable for its many cameos from multiple franchises. Characters in the movie have avatars used in the virtual reality setting.
Chris has made frequent allusions to the movie's plot as part of his expanding messiah complex, calling himself the "Real Player One" and "the One Avatar"[15] (later lengthened to "the one Avatar of all existence").[16] These first known mentions began during the Jail Saga, and Chris replied to fan inquiries directly stating "Real Player One" to be a reference to the movie.[17][18]
Regular Show
In his Minecraft livestream on 30 June 2024, Chris mentions watching up to Season 4 of this Cartoon Network animated series. (He likely finds the two main characters relatable, as they are slackers who never want to work.)[1]
Saturday Night Live

Sex & the City

Steven Universe

Steven Universe resides in an alt-timeline where WWII Never Happened, so he’s not in C-197
”
Chris on Steven's absence from his fantasy dimension[22]
Chris is a fan of Steven Universe. His first known mention of it is from 28 July 2016, when he wrote in a Facebook post that it's a good show, that his favorite of the lead gem characters is Pearl, and that the lesbian characters Ruby and Sapphire's relationship is sweet.[23]
In a paid video request from September 2016, Chris talked about why he likes Pearl.[24]
The 40-Year-Old Virgin
After Chris had uploaded to Encyclopedia Dramatica his pornographic drawing ShecameforCWC.JPG, which depicted himself and Megan Schroeder, Megan sent an email to Chris expressing her anger and hurt over the image. In his 14 March 2008 email reply, Chris tried suggested she rent the movie The 40-Year-Old Virgin so that she could empathize with his position of being a frustrated virgin and be exposed to sexual issues, even offering to loan her his copy of the movie. Megan did not take him up on it, futilely attempting to explain to him her real reasons for being upset over his porn drawing of her.[25]
In Common Questions from December 2009, Chris listed the movie among his top 5 favorites.
In Mailbag 35 from January 2010, Chris said he has watched the movie over 20 times and has owned an unrated DVD of it since release day.
The Box

Chris also told The Place to watch the three Annabelle movies for their Movie Night but said he would not join them, as his dream mandated that he watch the six franchise movies on his own (and with his imaginary friends Rosechu and Mewtwo). Chris implied that watching the movies would help in unlocking the Dimensional Merge.[26]

WataMote
In 2016, during the infamous BraveryJerk Interviews, Chris mentioned watching and enjoying the anime No Matter How I Look at It, It's You Guys' Fault I'm Not Popular!, often referred to as simply WataMote. He mentioned relating heavily to the lead character Tomoko Kuroki, due to her tending to "overthink at socializing," although he couldn't recall her name.
In August 2024, Chris posted a GIF of Tomoko on Twitter, along side a rant about a "realization" he had about online friendships.[28]
