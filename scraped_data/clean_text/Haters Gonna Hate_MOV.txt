Indeed!
Haters Gonna Hate is a video released on 6 September 2010. In it, a smug Chris dismisses the various rumors about his death, and announces that he's going to distance himself from the trolls and the Internet (again).
This video marks the return of the Sonichu medallion after being missing for half the year, and Chris prominently displays his high school ring in classic fashion at the opening of the video. Also, following the PS3 destruction videos, there's already a new one on the top shelf, next to the television.

Transcript
I feel fantastic, and I'm still alive.
*sigh* September... [counting under his breath] 4..5...sits! Two thousand ten.
I am not dead. [dramatic glasses removal] I am very much alive, healthy and well! And I aims to keep it that way, so don't believe any god damn rumors from the dang trolls, 'cause you know they alls gonna be falsified. [pause] And I'll tell y'all something else - Patti ain't dug up! She's still underground! All them trolls are doing between their forum and what they lie- what they spread about and their dang rumors, is just blowin' a bunch of smoke. [pause] So, what do you [mumbles] so do you- should you believe a whole bunch of smoke? No. Because all there is with the smoke is just a bunch of [mumbles] it's just a fire of web lies.
[Long pause]
So there. [Pause] And also, I am going to ignore the trolls and they are not going to bother me anymore. I am regaining control of my life. They have played with me tur-lo- for long enough and they're not gonna play with me anymore; I'm not going to let them. And also I will say another thing. [Starts digging into his pocket, fishing out some sort of string] Haters. [Twirls string] Are gonna. Hate. Pew! [Throws it like a whip, turns off camera]
