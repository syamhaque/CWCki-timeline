================================================================================

Magical Man Potion is a video released 24 February 2010.
In it, Chris acts out a skit in which he is a mad scientist creating a vile potion that transforms him into a different person, who is portrayed by a mysterious guest visiting his home.
Whether the concept was that the potion makes Chris more handsome, or if it's simply that being anybody but Chris is automatically an improvement, is unclear.
That a plotline in Asperchu involving similar themes emerged shortly after this video was made is certainly no coincidence.
This video is notable in that it is the first time a person not related to Chris has appeared in one of his videos.
Previously the only known humans/animals who have ever breached the sanctum of Chris's room during a video were Bob Chandler and Kitty.
Chris clearly could not be assed to hide his sex toys when he had company over, as the Plush Breasts of Fail once again make an appearance.
Chris appears thinner than usual in this video as the camera was set to the 16:9 widescreen format, but the video was squished into 4:3 at some point prior to upload.
