================================================================================

On 28 October 2011, Chris was slapped with a felony charge.
October was the tenth month of 2011. It was a mostly quiet month for Chris, who was still mourning his departed father and playing his PS3. Judging from an attempt to sell an old TV on Craigslist, the Chandlers may have been attempting to sell stuff around the house to get some extra cash. The Calling Out saga from August did not continue.
At the end of the month, things took an extreme and surprising twist, as Chris managed to put himself in very deep trouble with the law. As his burning hatred for Michael Snyder boiled up again, he entered The GAMe PLACe for a third time since his ban, resulting in several charges.
Events
1 October - Barbara's 70th birthday.
2 October - In yet another unfortunate involvement with the mainstream media, Chris inadvertently earns himself the "Manboob of the Month Award."
18 October - Chris lists an old, mid-range CRT television on Craigslist for a ludicrous price of $250 "or better offer." In Chris's own unique words, the television set "DEFINED SUPER BOWL SUNDAY."
27 October - MTV revives Beavis and Butt-head.
28 October - Chris gets himself arrested on two misdemeanor charges (assault and trespassing), and one felony charge (failure to stop at the scene of an accident causing over $1,000 in damage). Barb is arrested for assaulting a police officer and failure to stop, both felonies.
29 October - Chris and Barb are bailed out of jail by Rocky Shoemaker.
