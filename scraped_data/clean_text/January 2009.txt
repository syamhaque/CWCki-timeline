January was the first month of 2009. Chris spent most of his time this month under the assumption that Shigeru Miyamoto and Reggie Fils-Aimé of Nintendo were in regular contact with him, arranging a partnership to create a series of video games based on Sonichu. This hoax primarily involved having Miyamoto and Fils-Aimé asking Chris about his background, forcing Chris to explain away things like the information on his Encyclopedia Dramatica page. When asked to travel to Nintendo of America headquarters in Redmond, Washington, Chris continually stalled, until he finally disappeared from the Internet for several days in late January, raising questions about whether he was really dumb enough to travel cross-country. However, his claims to have visited "Red Mond" were quickly exposed, and the Sonichu Alpha project collapsed shortly thereafter.
During this month Chris's website, Sonichu.net would be hacked, causing him to abandon it and launch Sonichu.info, which was then also immediately hacked.
On 5 January Chris completed Episode 18, the long-awaited "Spring Break" feature of Sonichu #8, after being prompted by the suicide of Ryan Cash. Ryan's brother Clyde would emerge this month, blaming Chris for Ryan's death and threatening to seek revenge. In time, both the Miyamoto saga and the website hacking would be attributed to the master plan of Clyde and his secret organization bent on ruining Chris's life, to give Chris an archenemy to rail against.
