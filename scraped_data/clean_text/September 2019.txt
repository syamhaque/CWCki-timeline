Chris in September 2019
September was the ninth month of 2019. Chris publicly continued to roleplay as Magi-Chan on Twitter until the 14th, though relapsed later in the month in chats with The Place. He also began his interest in the unofficial My Little Pony trading card game called Twilight Sparkle's Secret Shipfic Folder this month. Sockness continued his machinations. At the end of the month, the Watchmen pressured Chris to act against Ben Saint, though Chris defended Ben.
