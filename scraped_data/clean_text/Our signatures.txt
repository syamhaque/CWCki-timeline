================================================================================

Our signatures is a video of Chris and Barb signing their names, in response to a fan who questioned whether Barb's signature was real after purchasing one of Cole's comics.[1] This is the first video in which Barb's room can be seen; Chris has clearly been taking very good care of Barb as she sleeps on a mattress on the floor surrounded by piles of boxes, papers and junk that could fall on her in the middle of the night. Also, the Yoshi plushie that Chris gave Bob for Christmas many years ago survived the fire as it can be seen on top of the fridge. It's also interesting to note that Chris calls Barb "mommy" and "dear" in the video, and Barb at moments looks like she is being held hostage.
