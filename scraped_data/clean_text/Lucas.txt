================================================================================

The dimensional merge is upon us! It has been suggested that this article be merged with Daniel Mimms. Discuss on the talk page.
Lucas White was one of the frequent patrons of The GAMe PLACe, who has known Chris since middle school.
Chris decided for a subtle approach to indicate he knew Lucas was responsible for the picture of Chris uploaded to 4chan/ED with the now infamous CWC-ism: "Well, that's something new you didn't know about 'be-4' about this 'Chan'".
The only memory he has of Chris being a decent person is him bringing his Wii to The GAMe PLACe and letting other people play Super Smash Bros. Brawl on it. Lucas also once brought in da HEXBox in to play Rock Band on, and Chris threw a hissy-fit over it.
“
Thus, my family came in and we found that Mimms had the camera in question, but he did not take the picture. Then we've suspected Lucas, but we did not question him at the time. But a more obvious expression reply was found by myself, when Saturday March 8, 2008, at the Gamestop in Forest Lakes, the Midnight release event of Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Mimms and I were watching a pair of tournament players brawling; one was playing Donkey Kong. So it brought up to mind my first word being "Monkey", so I told Mimms that. And with a turn around towards the accompanying Lucas, I said in his direction, "Well, that's something new you didn't know about "be-4" about this "Chan". I noticed a look on his face like, "Wow, I can totally wail on that tidbit of information." He said nothing."
