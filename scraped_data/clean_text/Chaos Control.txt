Chaos Control is a fictional power from the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, granting its user the ability to manipulate space and time through the use of the seven Chaos Emeralds. It was originally introduced in the game Sonic Adventure 2, where it was used by the character Shadow the Hedgehog, and it would go on to appear in future games such as Sonic the Hedgehog (2006). Chris has copied the term and co-opted it for his fantasies involving the Dimensional Merge and breaking of the Iron Curtain.
Mentions
Chaos Control got two dedicated cards in the Sonichu & Rosechu (TSSSF pack). Most of the cards were made public in 2019, including one of the Chaos Control cards, while the other was made public in 2022. Later in 2023, a series of drawings titled Chaos Crystal Control was released. This marked the first time the ability was used in the canon Sonichu series.
