Our savior
“
#MLPG5 is literally Russian Propaganda, Demons included, in disguise as a non Timeline canon series. In other words, if you do any art, acknowledge or even Love MLPG5, you are supporting not only a further dysfunction of this very timeline, but you're supporting Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin.
We Know, @Hasbro. You can end this right now by completely shelving MLPG5 and even Pony Life like Coyote Vs Acme, and Redeem Yourselves by reinstating the original cast, staff and #AdobeFlash animation art of #FriendshipIsMagic and #EquestriaGirls, along with my help, personally, as I have stated before.
Divine Timing is ticking away, and you can clearly see it happening in front of you that G5 is going down with Modern Day Babylon (Russia). ⚡️💙⚡️

My Little Pony: Make Your Mark is a Netflix series that's part of the fifth generation (G5) of the My Little Pony animation franchise. It is the 2020s incarnation, succeeding My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic and its related spin-offs. A movie, My Little Pony: A New Generation, premiered in September 2021 which lead off the transition from the Friendship is Magic era.

Post-jail protests
“
Still have not watched ANY of MLPG5 At All, and I Never Shall until AFTER My Little Pony - Friendship is Magic, Season 14 Episode 26 is aired on tv, streaming services and all, @Hasbro
”
Chris, still mad about G5 after having spent over a year and a half in jail[2]
In 2023, after having been released from the Central Virginia Regional Jail while awaiting legal proceedings for incest with his mother, Chris promptly resumed protesting against My Little Pony G5 on Twitter in October 2023, claiming that he apparently used his psychic powers prior to his arrest to predict Generation 5's supposed poor quality.
NOBODY Cares for MLP G5; Resume Friendship is Magic Already, @Hasbro, Please! I Literally Foreknew and Foretold how Premature and Awful G5 was to be. #PsychicPowers #Avatar #JesusChristIsRightHere[2]
Chris began blocking the Twitter profiles of people involved in anything related to G5 in February 2024,[3] ironic as years before he had complained about being blocked by popular MLP personalities themselves.
During a livestream that same month, a ween donated money to play a clip of the show. Chris responded by throwing a massive tantrum and going "LALALA" while covering his ears.[4]
In May 2024, news of Make Your Mark's cancellation spread over Twitter. A Twitter user asked Chris if the series ending meant that Friendship is Magic would receive the five additional seasons he had been demanding, and Chris answered, "As prophecised."[5]
At least twice, Chris has taken to "censoring" G5 characters out of images which people had shared on social media. In September 2024, he scribbled out the characters from an image Equestria Daily posted,[6] and in November 2024, he cropped out the characters from an image shared by a MLP fan.[7]
On 20 November 2024, Chris accused Hasbro of using AI for G5, likely due to a debunked rumour about the French dub of Tell Your Tale, and used it as an excuse to not like it.[8]
Russia comparisons
In late February 2024, Chris began comparing Make Your Mark to Russia.[9][1] On 21 February, Chris began to spam the Twitter replies of MLP fans posting G5 content with messages demanding they stop acknowledging G5.[10] Chris would continue to spam repily about G5 until he finally stopped on 10 March 2024[11] but would still continue posting about G5 occasionally.
“
Ugh! #RussiaIsMLPG5. Please Stop even acknowledging G5 and promoting Putin and the mostly toxic, darkest sinning country, there.
”

Characters mentioned by Chris
Pipp Petals
Pipp Petals
A Pegasus princess and main character of Make Your Mark.
In reply to a MLP fan who posted a gif of Pipp and called her a cutie, Chris made the snide tweet, "Nope.
That’s a demon in disguise, along with the rest of MLPG5’s cast."[13]
YouTube video
Chris has released a YouTube video dedicated to the topic after his release, it will most likely not be the last.
Telling It To All of You, and the Hasbro Executives and Staff
Chris: "We know your greedy game... and corporate excuses..."
On March 18th 2024, Chris released a YouTube video where he covered his "evidence"
linking My Little Pony G5 to Russia. He claimed former Hasbro CEO Brian Goldner was assassinated by Russians, despite Goldner dying of cancer, and said he spoke with Goldner’s soul, who allegedly regretted approving MLP G5.
