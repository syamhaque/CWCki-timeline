================================================================================

"Chris's Plea to Clyde Cash", uploaded on 19 January 2009, is the first of several videos in which Christian Weston Chandler responds to threats of revenge by Clyde Cash. It's not clear from the video what Clyde has threatened to do, but Christian is clearly concerned that Clyde will torture and kill the people he loves. Christian attempts to talk him down by assuring him that he'll get over Ryan Cash's death by finding a girlfriend and by noting Christian himself didn't try to torture anyone when his dog died. His dead fish expression is extremely pronounced in this video, which makes his apology seem even more insincere.
At one point in the video Chris is obviously confused as to which one of the Cash brothers committed a Sonichu-inspired suicide, and which one is promising to make his life a living hell. It's an easy mistake to make.

I'm addressing this video to Clyde Cash, older brother of Ryan, who, uh, s—who sadfully commi—committed suicide upon himself when I... made the idle threat to, uh, stop my—stop doing my comics in, uh, protest of the Encyclopedia Dramatica page.
[winces]
Clyde, I'm sorry your brother died, but that doesn't mean you have to go pickin' on me for the cause of his death, because... I did not do any—I did not do it personally to him, and I did not mean to do it. I'm just an—I'm just an innocent bystander in all this. Even though... I gave him the reason. I'm sorry. You don't have to do anything mean. I mean, would Cly—would... Clyde. Would Ryan want you to go... killi—would Ryan want you to doin' anything stupid as torturing other people or even go as far as killing them? You don't have to do this. Just live on your life and move on. You'll find yourself a girlfriend! And she'll make you about as—she'll make you happier than... possibly how, uh, Ryan could have done it. You don't have to go off killing people. You don't have to harm anybody, emotionally or physically. Just take some deep breaths... some time to yourself. Maybe find yourself, uh...shoot, what's the wor—find yourself a counselor at your local church that you can talk to. And, uh, hopefully, you'll feel better.
I mean, I feel for you, man. I mean, I've had people die on—die on me somet—some—a few times before, and I went to their funerals. But I didn't—I did not want to go off torturing and killing anybody in response. I just basically waited out for my sad emotions to, uh... eventually fade away and you know I did get better from that. I mean, my dog died. I was sad. I cried for weeks. But yet I got over it. I saw my—I saw Patti in my dreams. And she reassured me that thing were—that she was okay, and that God is taking good care of her. And with that I'm—I was able to move on, live my life a little bit more happier and more luckily. Been ov—been over a year—been over two years now since she died.
Clyde, you do not have to do anything rash or drastic. Just move on. You'll find a lot of other things that make about AS or greater than happy as you were with, uh, Ryan around. Just take it one day at a time, one moment at a time. You'll get over it. Peace, mon.
