Troll disclosure: This persona was created, appropriated, or otherwise used by trolls to manipulate Chris. Though this identity is contrived, the CWCki may treat it as if it were a real identity because it was to Chris. (It's also funnier that way.)

Uses of Gwen
Nuking of CWCville
The first known use of the Gwen persona was in the Discord Chat, The Bad Beginning. Gwen started the chat off by telling Chris that he owed her $20000, to which she would threaten nuking the city of CWCville if he didn't make the payment.

As a Transformers OC
Gwen is one of many concepts by the Idea Guys which Chris retained after their ousting. He created a TSSSF custom card featuring "Gwenmi Mikoto" as a Transformers OC. In December 2023, he also customized a Transformers figure to represent Gwenmi.[2] In Chris's custom box art for Punislav, Gwenmi is mentioned as the boss of Megatron, with both responsible for upgrading Punislav.[3] Chris had promoted the figurine of Gwenmi Mikoto on 1 August 2025.[4]
