This article is still yet to be completed due to stress. We get a lot of stressful torture in our lives that makes us crash into slumber. Given that inspiration is a big variable, and we may have been lacking of it, this article will be completed as soon as possible, at our own pace... HONEST!

Improvement

I've just read through Sonichu #0 for the 1st in a long while; compared to today's #11, you can REALLY see my improvement!
Major WOW!
And I also noticed a few overlooked typos in Book 0; etched in history forever now; Oops. My bad, but I do not regret making these books and continuing Stronger.

Doopie knows about Chris
12 July, 10:21 pm
A ween necro-bumped a Twitter thread from April. Doopie responded:
Finally, something worth replying to. It's hard to find someone with common decency to just talk to me about the situation, rather than making assumptions and "trolling" me(?). I've been following the "Chris chan" saga since the beginning. I know everything that (s)he's done. And yeah, it's pretty shitty, but what other people have done to him/her as been pretty shitty too. I'm also just not the type of person to turn someone away when they're being nothing but kind to me. It may be a fake, it may be a show, but I'm not emotionally invested in this enough to really care. I just don't appreciate people being little shits on my twitter. It's annoying. That's pretty much as deep as it gets. (S)he's paid me to do a commission, and is a patron on my patreon, and as a woman of business, I'm going to treat him/her as every other commissioner and patron. I wish people would mind their business, but it seems that people are so invested in "Chris chan" that they have to make multiple twitter accounts to harrass me. I appreciate the people on Kiwi since most people there tend to just keep the conversation there. I do, however, like I said, appreciate you coming to me with concern, rather than just being an asshole wanting attention. Thank you, but I'm a big girl.
Chris then jumped in, annoyed at the ween:
Honestly, how dare you put past errors that I do intend to remedy as soon as humanly possible, albeit within my own financial restrictions I Never intended to scam anyone, so that part of your textful image is B.S. And in the years ago, for the latter, I was naive for a number of things, even that was reflected in my previous Sonichu Books, as I was testing the woodwork, seeing what works and whatnot. I actually matured mentally and emotionally, and I have gained more and better wisdom. I, personally, prefer not to address Trolls Such as yourself, @TheSmollestMage, but when one unnecessarily and constantly attacks an innocent person with such outdated trash, then I feel need to step in. In other words, Trolling Stupid, quit assuming the worst about me, or Anyone; all you are doing from that is making an ass yourself, @TheSmollestMage. I will not warn you again. Leave the people I talk with Alone. Good day.
Chris downplays the macing incident while simping for the Planet Dolan crew
13 July, 10:43 pm
Chris responds to a thread posted by Planet Dolan collaborator ladyDeadBat with the following message.
Lots of Love back at ya. 💖💖💖🌸😊
A troll responded with the a post linking to that time Chris maced a GameStop employee.
Heres a need to see video
Chris responded:
You can go Fuck Off. Quit Trolling People with past, outdated B.S.
Doopie, darling
18 July, 9:52 pm
Doopie:
5 more icons to get done. Then patreon rewards! Thanks for being so patient, I know I say that a lot, but it's much appreciated.
Chris:
It's alright, darling. It is always comforting to know about the people who like and appreciate you and your talents. 😊💖🌸
Chris knew Doopie has a boyfriend
20 July, 4:20 pm
Jaltoid:

Resuming begging
22 July, 4:08 am
I hate to bring it up again, but my mom and I Need More Money to get through the week, please. Perhaps $50?
Holographic cards
25 July, 12:29 pm
Doopie:
I'm actually going to be making my holographic prints from home! :) Exciting! Twitch con is going to be so much fun.
Mcmaxel:
Good luck! I could never figure out how to do those
Chris:
I have tried my hand at making Holographic trading cards from my homemade set of Pokémon cards; I printed onto aluminum foil. Not perfect.
Doopie (responding to Mcmaxel):
a Laminater and holographic heat transfer paper!
Chris:
Interesting. If and when I have a project that requires a Holographic, I will look this up. Thanks, Darling. 😊🌸💖
Here are three of my olden Holographic cards. I attached the foil between contact paper and the printed card.
Reaction to Trump's transgender military ban
26 July, 1:46 pm
Chris responded to Trump's online announcement to ban transgender people from the US military. Later, in true Chris fashion, he compared the President to DuckTales' Scrooge McDuck:
@realDonaldTrump How dare you Trump?! Quell your Phobias and Paranoias already! Cheapness is a Terrible Trait too. Invest Back into what you've taken from. 😠
Also, you will Never be as rich as Scrooge McDuck, because aside from the money, he Actually gets L💖ve And Respect from His Family & Friends
Tara Strong weighed in on Trump's decision:
My insides are boiling.My heart is breaking. ARE YOU F-ING KIDDING?! I am with you trans bros & sis. 🌈🌈 never hated anyone more u ignorant f
Chris replied:
I thank not only @tarastrong for bringing this up, but also to Each and Every person who served for our country. My dad was proud to serve not only in the Signal corp in Souel Korea, but alongside all of his fellow soldiers who were LGBTQ as well.
Chris reminds Cole of Barb
26 July, 1:56 pm
Cole Smithey tweeted to his followers of Mick Jagger's birthday:
Happy 74 Birthday to Mick Jagger! 20 years older than me to the day!
Chris saw this as an appropriate time to remind Cole of their mother:
Huh. 54 Years Old; you know someone else who is a bit more than 20 years older than @colesmithey? Our mother, Barbara Anne Weston; Alive.
Kindness in people
26 July, 1:59 pm
Chris replied to Kelly Sheridan, another MLP voice actress, who expressed support for trans people.
I Love seeing the Kindness in People. Thank you, @KSheridanVoice. ⚡️💖💖💖⚡️
Military draft
26 July, 2:05 pm
A fan said, in response to Trump's military policy:
Chris, this means you can't get drafted.
Chris:
Regardless, I support those who genuinely want to serve and have served our country.
Don't like hate
26 July, 3:20 pm
Ellen DeGeneres:
We're spreading hate instead of love in our country today.
Chris:
I do not like Hatred.
Tara Strong is beautiful
27 July, 3:10 pm
Tara Strong linked to a tweet by a transwoman who had complimented her by saying, "Last year I met @tarastrong who made me feel beautiful despite me being trans. Now she fights for trans military. They are ALL heroes to me!"
You are beautiful. 🌈♥️
Chris:
@tarastrong, you are beautiful for having a kind and open heart with lots of care and love. 😊🌸 ⚡️💖💖💖⚡️
