Celestial Key

Open The Door or Portal (Retrieve): While this card is in your hand, you may choose a Pony card on the grid and put it into your hand, then play this card in its place. This power cannot be copied.
A Key of a Clestial [sic] or Goddess that is able to unlock and open about any enchantment and blessing, including between Dimensions. This particular key is a chunk of Lightning Strike Quartz, infused and linked with Chris Chan Sonichu: the Goddess, CPU Blue Heart. With this personally enchanted key, she can and will complete the Dimension Merge when the time is correct to do so by the course of fated events.

Celestial Mojo - Light Power
Pony
Male or Female, Alicorn
Light-Powered Healing (Copy): You may copy the power of any Pony card currently on the shipping grid, except for Pony cards with the Changeling keyword.
Combining a set of Healing Stones of certain colours, and one Quartz, they can be combined to make a combination known as the Celestial Mojo. This set of stones can only be enchanted by one with deity-level magic powers and abilities. If powered by Dark Magic, it becomes a WMD. If powered by Light Magic, it heals in a very wide range, up to the distance of a galaxy or so. When the two are activated, the Light always overpowers the Dark.
