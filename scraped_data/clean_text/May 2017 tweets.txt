Q&A on restored shirt
4 May, 3:24 am
Fan
Is that the orginal?
Chris
Yes it is.
Fan 2
I thought the money from the auction went towards a professional restoration. You just sewed the holes up with the stitches still visible.
Chris
I went around with it to multiple cleaners and tailors; they had called it "Beyond Help"; wouldn't touch it. I did not think that; so there.
Trump’s not winning
4 May, 2:26 pm
Tara Strong
💔 innocent blood is on your hands @realDonaldTrump . Your need for "winning" will bankrupt this country and kill millions.
Chris
Yes, @realDonaldTrump, you are Not winning, and people are needlessly dying from your actions.
Tara Strong
Congratulations Health Insurance Companies. #AHCA 😡😡😡😡
Chris
Me too! 😡😡😡 Frigging Drumpf.
I feel for the veterans
5 May, 11:46 am
Tara Strong
Thank you for your service. Sorry @realDonaldTrump & his money hungry goons have turned their backs on you. [she linked to a veteran's tweet]
Chris
I feel for the veterans too. My father was one (Signal Corp, Souel Korea, after WWII); I'm glad he is not here to feel this.
Mocking Cole for requesting donations
5 May, 11:49 am
Cole Smithey
Help keep Cole Smithey's independent film criticism, video essays, and podcasts alive; pledge your monthly support through Patreon. Even just $5 a month does a lot, plus you get rewards!

Oh, My Gosh. My Half-Brother is suddenly asking for money now. I Would pledge, Bro, but you haven't apologized or made up with our mom.
Very special livestream
5 May, 6:18 pm

Salty Squid
So this is what @DoopieDoOver thinks about >v> she linked to an animation
Chris
With respect to @DoopieDoOver, I agree, this was dumb. You do not know what she's thinking, or has on her mind. On the flip side, the grey head-holding part, but with either silence or random thought clusters for the sound, that's my mind when Stressed
Princess Unikitty

Tara Strong
'Lego Movie's' Unikitty Gets Animated Series at Cartoon Network
Chris
I Know! Princess Unikitty is Super Cute and Happy! :D Do you think Raven would love Unikitty as much as her Pretty Pretty Pegasus? :)
Agreed on career advice
11 May, 1:22 am
Amazing Facts
Never pursue a career because others want you to. You'll be the one spending half your life at that job. Pursue your passion.
Chris
I agree with that. My dad pushed me to get the CADD education and degree; no jobs avail after graduation. Sonichu was already well-popular.

Ranting on online dating
16 May, 8:32 pm
After watching a Planet Dolan video, in which DoopieDoOver talks about finding success at online dating, Chris ranted at her about the difficulties he's had with it.
Chris
@DoopieDoOver, I have tried online dating years in a row; mostly-to-nothing-but pretentious Trolls. With such people faking interests to tug at numerous heartstrings, I hardly believe, and can barely comprehend, how people who meet online First actually end up meeting sincere people through dating and social sites. For me, it is In Person First, or bust, and even that is difficult for me. And I just finished watching the new Planet Dolan video, with your successful online dating. I will Never Ever Understand, nor will I Ever summon any courage to meet people online, Anywhere. Dating sites, in games, ecetera! UGH! I feel jealous of every person who has been successful of online dating. And I feel upset and lonely again. I really do not want any negative responses. But,...WHY DO WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD WHO HATE EVERYTHING FOR EVERYTHING BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO NOT HATE OR LOVE,... who love to take advantage of people, in general, who feel need to mess with us? And WHY is it that I attract such hurtful people? UGH! Damn Haters can go to the left & kiss off *sigh*...
Begging to Cole again
16 May, 11:56 pm
Chris tweets at an unrelated message on Cole's account, unwittingly tagging several other accounts as well.
Chris
Help Us, Please, Brother!
He linked to Paypal.me, again requesting $1,000.
Transformers porn

Everyone likes drawing lewd of a robot character. Hmmm. 😤👌💦✨
Chris
There are fewer female Transformers than male; the Transformer porn is a rarity. LOL
Responding to troll questions
Chris posted a message to Facebook, reading:
Today, a Trolling-Stupid texted me that he was from the future; I replied "Go back; you forgot your 2010-2020 Sports Almanac." 😏
It was auto-posted to his Twitter, where several people commented on it. Chris replied to a couple of questions.
17 May, 10:55 pm

Andrea Libman
A busy #FluttershyFriday - hope you had a great day!

Answering questions on the poster
20 May, 10:11 pm
Fan 1

Chris
No, it stands for "Straight" (or Cisgender); both the Straight and Cisgender flags are above the "S".
Fan 2

Could be a scam

perrysheartbeat
If Beyoncé's twins ain't Gemini, I will give everyone who retweets this $100💸 [image of a Paypal account]
Chris
I think this could be a scam; the person who retweets it could be considered the origin from the last retweet. Like @KisakaToriama could appear to be where to get $100 from. Rtweeter Beware. **Retweeter Beware.
Note: @KisakaToriama is a Planet Dolan staff member who had liked perrysheartbeat's tweet, which had caught Chris's attention.
Transformers toy

ashleigh ball‏
[She linked to an article on her new album]
Chris

Sonichu/Planet Dolan crossover
31 May, 2:44 pm
Chris
I finished it yesterday, while Not going to be an official cover or story, this is an awesome fan art piece for @ThePlanetDolan.
We are curious as to what is Planet Dolan; the local places and scenery therein. All we have to go by are their videos on SuperPlanetDolan.
Chris noticed one of the Planet Dolan writers had commented on someone else's fanart, and he decided to reply about his own.
ScGooby
That's a lot of people o.0 [she linked to fanart by CrapisLazuli]
Chris
As many as there are in my piece?
CrapisLazuli
We actually have the same amount. 39.
Drawing philosophies
31 May, 4:05 pm
Chris
I may draw and color similar to a child with pen and markers, but I Own that Media, with Lots of Heart!
To throw one more wisdom bit for now: Soo many details, So little time.
The more detail in a drawn piece, the longer it takes me.
