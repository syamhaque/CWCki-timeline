Chris' home for April 2022
April was the fourth month of 2022. It was the first month in over a decade that we saw no new activity involving Chris, who spent the entire month incommunicado in Western State Hospital: Chris's thoughts about the heavy snow in Virginia would not be known until late-July.
Notable events
2 April
The third episode of The Chris Chan Conspiracy is released, featuring new footage of TheGamerFromMars and Copitz at 14BC in December 2019.
The r/Place Reddit event relaunched on April 1st and lasted for three and a half days, during this event Reddit users coordinated to design pixel art of Sonichu.[1]
9 April - The fourth episode of The Chris Chan Conspiracy is released, also featuring footage of TheGamerFromMars and Copitz at 14BC in December 2019, and also some appearances by Barb.
9 to 10 April - Copitz uploads a video showing him playing Tetris 99 with Chris. In the comment section, he has a conversation with Drewdog, who had also played Tetris 99 with Chris.[2][3]
15 to 17 April - BABSCon, an unofficial My Little Pony convention held in San Francisco, finally took place after several pandemic-induced delays. Thankfully, it was spared from Chris' presence due to his incest charge being continued into July.
Late April - Heavy snow falls in Virginia. Chris viewed this as a sign of the ongoing Dimensional Merge.[4]
