Brütal Legend
Brütal Legend is a heavy metal action-adventure game starring Jack Black as roadie Eddie Riggs, who battles to save a rock-inspired fantasy world. Chris was a fan of the game and published three videos about it, the first of which had no audio.
Crash Bandicoot
Crash Bandicoot is a platformer video game franchise published by Sony, originally released for the PlayStation. It follows a genetically enhanced bandicoot as he battles the evil genius Dr. Neo Cortex. Chris purchased the first three games in the series on the PlayStation Network and later would buy the Crash and Cortex figures for Skylanders Imaginators.
Destiny
Destiny is a online first-person shooter video game franchise. In March 2016, Chris streamed himself playing the game. The video features no audio from Chris due to his controller pad being plugged into the headphone jack, which he explained in a video uploaded the following day.
Donkey Kong Jr. Math
Donkey Kong Jr. Math is an edutainment game for the NES, where players control Donkey Kong Jr. and help him solve math problems. Chris brought it up as being one of his favorite NES games to play in Animal Crossing for the GameCube in the Animal Crossing Documentary, saying "it really challenges the mind in the math area and gets your memory fresh there." (Note that the math featured in the game is 4th grade/middle school-level arithmetic, and Chris was 21 at the time.)
Hey You, Pikachu!
Hey You, Pikachu! is a virtual pet game for the Nintendo 64 where players can adopt a wild Pikachu, and then play and communicate with them, using a microphone and the Voice Recognition Unit system bundled with the game. Chris got the game at some point not long after its release. Later on, he used the game's microphone to communicate with fans and trolls on Mumble. The mic made an appearance during the notorious Julie Reveals Herself call.
Mega Man
Mega Man is a platformer video game franchise published by Capcom, originally released for the NES. It follows a heroic robot named Rock as he battles the evil scientist Dr. Wily and his army of rogue Robot Masters. Mega Man appeared as a Lego minifigure in the Mario Kart 64 Lego Raceway series, and an ad for the fictional game Mega Man X 64 was featured in Chris's homemade Nintendo Power magazine.
Metroid
Metroid is a sci-fi action-adventure video game franchise published by Nintendo, originally released for the NES. It follows a heroic bounty hunter named Samus Aran. Though Chris isn’t a vocal fan, he has bought nearly every game in the franchise, including niche entries like Metroid Prime Pinball. In 2018, his Amazon Wishlist featured two Metroid related items, a Samus and Metroid Amiibo two-pack, and a Special Edition of Metroid: Samus Returns, a remake of the GameBoy game for 3DS. During the 2009 Chris-chan Discusses... interview series hosted by Larry Bundy, Larry mentioned the remake's announcement, Chris replied simply, "Huh. That sounds pretty good."
Ratchet & Clank
Methed out ratchet
Ratchet & Clank is a long-running action-platformer series starring the inventive lombax Ratchet and his robotic sidekick Clank. On April 2016, Chris hyped up the film adaptation on Facebook, calling it "Totes Swag". Nearly a decade later, in 2025, he crafted a custom Ratchet medallion for a buyer.[1]
Saints Row
Saints Row is an open-world action-adventure video game franchise published by Deep Silver and originally THQ, similar to Grand Theft Auto. It follows the rise of a street gang known as the 3rd Street Saints as they battle rival factions, build their criminal empire, and take over the city. Chris purchased the second game in the series, Saints Row 2, at Best Buy in 2009.
Spyro the Dragon
Spyro the Dragon is a platformer video game franchise published by Sony, originally released for the PlayStation. It follows a purple dragon named Spyro. Chris purchased the first three games in the series on the PlayStation Network and later became a fan of the spinoff series, Skylanders.
Star Fox
Star Fox is a sci-fi action-adventure video game franchise published by Nintendo. It follows Fox McCloud, the leader of the Star Fox team, as he travels across the Lylat system battling enemies and uncovering galactic threats to protect the universe. Chris was shown to be a fan of the series as early as 2000, when he included a song from it on the Christian's Favorite Hits! CD. Later, in 2019, he revealed that he owned a Star Fox figure attachment for the game Starlink when he was gifted a Nintendo Switch from Sarah and Steve.
Uncharted
Uncharted is a action-adventure video game franchise published by Sony. It follows a treasure hunter named Nathan Drake as he travels across the world to uncover various historical mysteries. In May 2016, Chris streamed himself playing the game but was unable to beat a level, which resulted in people mocking him. Three days later, Chris posted a video where he successfully completed the level.
