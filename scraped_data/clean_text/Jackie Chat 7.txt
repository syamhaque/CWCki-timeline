[7:06 pm] CWC:
Hey, Sweetheart. :) h
[7:06 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
hi!!
[7:06 pm] CWC:
How are you?
[7:06 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i'm doing okay.
[7:06 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
how was your weekend?
[7:06 pm] CWC:
I'm doing well too.
[7:06 pm] CWC:
Sunday, I went to church, and it was a quiet day. And I watched the new Fox shows, and I uploaded the video, as you know. :) h
[7:07 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i loved the chris-chan sonichu video! you did really well with your body-painting
[7:08 pm] CWC:
I was actually surprised on how my torso would look blue, then after I painted my face, before the headwear, I reminded myself of the Marvel superhero Nightcrawler (is that his name?).
[7:08 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
yeah, nightcrawler, thats it
[7:08 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
he can teleport.
[7:09 pm] CWC:
X-Men fan too?
[7:09 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i think he was like a born-again christian in the comics
[7:09 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i am somewhat.
[7:09 pm] CWC:
me too.
[7:09 pm] CWC:
I enjoyed the Marvel heroes from time and again.
[7:09 pm] CWC:
I also downloaded recently the 10 comic book set of Marvel Zombies.
[7:09 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i never read that one, but i heard it was a really good series
[7:10 pm] CWC:
I felt the stories were good, aside from the gorey details.
[7:10 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
you dont like the gore? isnt that the point of a zombie story?
[7:10 pm] CWC:
Yes. to name a sole survivor that was able to move onto the next set of 5 books, was the Black Panther.
[7:10 pm] CWC:
when it comes to gore, it's kinda 75-25; 3/4 I can stand, 1/4 I would feel sick after seeing.
[7:11 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i thought you liked horror stuff, though. i know you like the saw movies
[7:12 pm] CWC:
altogether, it's not exactly smile-worthy, you understand.
[7:12 pm] CWC:
I do like horror stuff.
[7:12 pm] CWC:
And I do like the Saw movies.
[7:12 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
those have lots of blood.
[7:12 pm] CWC:
it just depends on how I feel at the time.
[7:12 pm] CWC:
mostly, I am cool with it.
[7:12 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
hey, that reminds me of something
[7:12 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
remember i said i listened to the recordings of your talks with alec benson leary? at one point, you said that you believed cartoon characters exist in their own real world of sorts
[7:13 pm] CWC:
yes.
[7:13 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
could you elaborate on that?
[7:13 pm] CWC:
certainly.
[7:13 pm] CWC:
you remember the movie, "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"
[7:13 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
yes
[7:13 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i remember there was a rumor that donald duck screamed "GODDAMN YOU NIGGER", but that was just a myth, he really said something inoccuous.
[7:15 pm] CWC:
well, even though they used a bunch of hollywood magic to portray the toons in real life, there is a good chance still that there is a dimension where the characters we draw or create live in and in their own areas of that dimension.
[7:15 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
good chance?
[7:15 pm] CWC:
You may be referring to the bought between Donald and Daffy.
[7:15 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
yeah, thats the scene
[7:15 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but what makes you draw that conclusion about another dimension?
[7:16 pm] CWC:
mostly from what I watched from shows and movies that talk about different dimensions.
[7:16 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i thought you must have taken some physics classes or something. I took a physics class once that dealt with multiple dimensions, string theory, etc
[7:16 pm] CWC:
Like there also could be a dimension where our complete opposite selves wouldreside in.
[7:17 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
they didnt talk about a cartoon dimension in my class, though
[7:17 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but you brought up the subject because you were angry at alec for abusing his characters, if i remember correctly
[7:17 pm] CWC:
I have taken one physics class in PVCC.
So you know more than I do from book learning.
[7:17 pm] CWC:
I think you mean Alec abusing MY characters in his works.
[7:18 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
no, mostly you were specifically referencing his abuse of his own character, Asperchu
[7:19 pm] CWC:
oh. yes, I did go there at one point; I just could not understand why create a character with Aspergers, when the creator has Aspergers him/herself, and he/she wants to better him/herself, they would more likely draw More Normal Characters.
[7:20 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well doesnt sonichu have autism though?
[7:20 pm] CWC:
Sonichu does NOT have Autism.
[7:20 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
he goes to special education, like the dating ed and stuff though
[7:20 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i thought that meant he was in special ed.
[7:20 pm] CWC:
No, Dating Education was a Normal Class; it was not classified as a "Special Educational" class.
[7:20 pm] CWC:
Nobody in my comics has any Special Education.
[7:21 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but they dont have dating ed in real life. most people dont need help forming relationships
[7:21 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so are your sonichus just slow in the minds? or otherwise special needs?
[7:21 pm] CWC:
And my Leading Characters are Normal-Minded or Stronger.
[7:21 pm] CWC:
NONE of them are Retarded.
[7:21 pm] CWC:
ALL of them are Normal-Speed or Faster mentally.
[7:22 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
why do they go to dating ed then?
[7:22 pm] CWC:
It was only Wild and Punchy who took the class.
[7:22 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
oh. is it because they're foreigners/
[7:22 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
?
[7:22 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
or are they slow in the mind?
[7:23 pm] CWC:
And it was because Wild was feeling lack-confident in the dating scene, and Punchy was looking for tips for what he already and confidently knows.
[7:23 pm] CWC:
they are not foreigners or slow-minded.
[7:23 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
oh, i thought punchy was chinese
[7:23 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
the only people i know who might need that sort of class are slow in the minds or foreigners
[7:24 pm] CWC:
Punchy was NOT Chinese or Asian; I drew his eyes that way, based on Knuckles' eyes, but I drew them more squinted accidentially.
[7:24 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i kind of wondered if knuckles was a chinaman
[7:24 pm] CWC:
You do not have to be Retarded to feel Lack of Self-Confidence in ANY area.
[7:24 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
he knows kung fu, afterall
[7:24 pm] CWC:
I don't think Knuckles is chinese.
[7:24 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so lets go back to the cartoon world thing
[7:25 pm] CWC:
okay
[7:25 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
now, you told alec you didnt like him abusing his characters, because they were like real people and would be hurt and suffering
[7:25 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but you have some characters who suffer in sonichu, like the villains
[7:26 pm] CWC:
In most scenarios, the Villains do get the bad rap and hurt for their misdeeds and wrongdoings.
[7:26 pm] CWC:
...
[7:26 pm] CWC:
In their dimension, the characters would have their own individual feelings and emotions.
[7:26 pm] CWC:
So I feel it is proper for the heroes to stay feeling good.
[7:27 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
wouldnt the villains feel bad about being created to be tormented though?
[7:27 pm] CWC:
yet when they are down, they do get hurt.
[7:27 pm] CWC:
yes, they would feel bad.
[7:28 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but surely they dont deserve that
[7:28 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
right?
[7:28 pm] CWC:
They deserved it for after doing Wrongdoings to other people, characters, etc in little to mass destruction.
[7:28 pm] CWC:
Take Dr. Robotnik.
[7:28 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but you drew them to do wrong, they didnt have a choice
[7:29 pm] CWC:
he did his own wrongs, but he did learn later.
[7:29 pm] CWC:
and he also lead a life outside of villany
[7:29 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
and sega made robotnik, so i guess they're guilty of portraying him as a villain-type person
[7:30 pm] CWC:
He went out jogging, did a spot of good, or did nothing that involved plotting or scheming.
[7:30 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
wait, robotnik goes jogging? what game is that in
[7:30 pm] CWC:
It was in an episode of Sonic X
[7:30 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but thats still on tv, not in the other dimension
[7:30 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
what does he do when he's not on tv or in a game or whatever?
[7:31 pm] CWC:
it doesn't matter; if Robotnik is portrayed jogging, then he is jogging.
[7:31 pm] CWC:
exactly.
[7:31 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so if asperchu is portrayed having aspergers, he has aspergers. quid pro quo
[7:31 pm] CWC:
he does what he would do in a normal life in that dimension.
[7:31 pm] CWC:
yes.
[7:31 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
from reading those asperchu comics, asperchu seemed fairly happy
[7:31 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but i'm curious about something. when these people are created, who truly gives them life?
[7:31 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
does god breathe life into their soul, or do you use more magic to do it?
[7:32 pm] CWC:
the artist, creator.
[7:32 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so you are God?
[7:32 pm] CWC:
they put a piece of their own selves into the characters and what they create.
[7:32 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i thought only God could create life
[7:32 pm] CWC:
I do not consider myself God.
[7:32 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but do the cartoons you make?
[7:32 pm] CWC:
and I am sure any artist, creator would tell you the same.
[7:32 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
alec told you that he didnt believe that, actually
[7:32 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but to each his own opinion
[7:32 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but then, once a character is created, does it just exist for the rest of time as it is?
[7:33 pm] CWC:
I do not think the cartoons created think consider their own creators god.
[7:33 pm] CWC:
I would think so, yes, until it is portrayed dead by the hand of its one creator.
[7:33 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but what gives a creator the right to decide if a character lives or dies?
[7:33 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
wouldnt that be murder?
[7:34 pm] CWC:
that is a valid point.
[7:34 pm] CWC:
it does coincide with acts of our own God; why do some of our people die considerably prematurely?
[7:34 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so you're comparing yourself to God.
[7:34 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i see
[7:35 pm] CWC:
if it was by God's hand, then would you think it would be considered murder on his part?
[7:35 pm] CWC:
NO.
[7:35 pm] CWC:
I am not comparing myself to god.
[7:35 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i'm not sure i believe God takes any active role in the affairs of this mortal coil. I'm more of a deist that way
[7:35 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but a comic artist necessarily does take a hand in the affairs of his cartoon world
[7:35 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but it seems there is a similarity. God made the real world, and decided what would happen, and you made CWCville, and decide what happens to the innocent people living there
[7:37 pm] CWC:
I agree with you.
[7:37 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so then, what happens when you draw a real person as a cartoon character? does a clone of that person come into being?
[7:37 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
like, if they touched each other would both cease to exist like in Timecop, or how does it work metaphysically?
[7:38 pm] CWC:
I would think so, but metaphysically, I would think they would coexist respectively.
[7:38 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
for example, you drew Clyde Cash in your comic , and showed him dying. yet he survives in the real world
[7:38 pm] CWC:
it depends on how they are drawn or portrayed.
[7:39 pm] CWC:
that version of C.C. would be dead there, but by someone else's hand, their version of C.C. would be alive or dead based on that creator's desires.
[7:39 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but you drew his death. isnt it you who killed him?
[7:40 pm] CWC:
good point, but within that dimension, it can be portrayed on how the death was executed, and a guilty person can be assigned respectively, or it could be natural there.
[7:41 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
oh. i just ask because you blamed alec for all the things you didnt like happening in his comic, but now it sounds like you're saying he wasn't at fault for any of it
[7:42 pm] CWC:
Upon retrospect and with the current reasoning, I can understand your point.
[7:42 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
one more comic question before we move on:
[7:42 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
you had a character named Count Graduon. what was your inspiration for him?
[7:42 pm] CWC:
I wish I had the reasoning I have now back then, and I wouldn't have had to bring up trouble then.
[7:43 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well, maybe you can point that out with Alec when you talk to him again
[7:43 pm] CWC:
Essentially, an energy or soul of a dark or evil contained in a prison, such as an orb on a scepter, is a common practice.
[7:43 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
where did the name come from?
[7:44 pm] CWC:
quite right.
[7:45 pm] CWC:
At the instance of the naming of the character of evil, it came to me at random; I had no real immediate thought of inspiration then. But I think if it came from anything, the name "Graduon" was inspired from the bad Graduation I had when I left High School.
[7:45 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
ah, i see.
[7:45 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
that makes sense
[7:46 pm] CWC:
BTW
[7:46 pm] CWC:
I have been thinking deeper and deeper into your question on the Deserving of the SSI...
[7:46 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
oh?
[7:47 pm] CWC:
Originally, I was given that blessing through my father, on one theory of me NOT being able to do the basics of a job, which I have told you I disagree with fully.
[7:48 pm] CWC:
Yesterday, I have actually asked God the question, because all I was coming up with was having deserved it from my trials and tribulations in my life.
[7:48 pm] CWC:
God responded...
[7:48 pm] CWC:
He told me that he blessed me because he saw me as one of the appreciative and less richer people, so he gave me that blessing through the approval.
[7:49 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
???
[7:49 pm] CWC:
And I also asked him about the Job situation; why have I not been able to get a job then?
[7:49 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
that doesnt make sense
[7:49 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
why would God approve you to rip off the government when there are people starving and dying on the streets who genuinely need help
[7:50 pm] CWC:
he told me that he felt I was not ready to tackle a job yet, but he will bless me with a job when he sees fit.
[7:50 pm] CWC:
I don't know.
[7:50 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
thats not my understanding of how God works
[7:50 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
God wants you to try to fix your own life, not just sit and wait for Him to fix it for you
[7:51 pm] CWC:
God does take away likely from the rich when they are unappreciative or have their own ills of the spirit.
[7:51 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
what about the poor people who legitimately need that SSI money? the ones who would spend it on food and housing rather than video games? why would God think you deserve it more than they do when you spend it on toys
[7:52 pm] CWC:
Likely, there are people in the Government God felt did not deserve such fortune.
[7:52 pm] CWC:
I don't know.
[7:52 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
and you dont want to think about it either. you just accept that you have money, and have decided God believes you are holier than anyone else and thats why they dont get it
[7:53 pm] CWC:
WOAH!
[7:53 pm] CWC:
I do not think I am above anyone else.
[7:53 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but God does, you're saying?
[7:53 pm] CWC:
I am a human being; no better or less than any other human being.
[7:53 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
hey, i'm sorry if my belief is shocking but this is NOT the God I grew up to believe existed
[7:54 pm] CWC:
I don't know either; I'm just informing you what God told me yesterday.
[7:54 pm] CWC:
Anyway, I am still trying to come up with a conclusion and sound answer to the Deserving question.
[7:54 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
on the cwcki, it says you once believed God told you Julie was real, and that God wanted you to drive to Ohio to meet her
[7:55 pm] CWC:
Actually, that is incorrect.
[7:55 pm] CWC:
God did not tell me to drive to Ohio; he said nothing.
[7:55 pm] CWC:
It was the spirits of my ancestors in the graveyard that my Aunt Corina was buried in on that same day, which was my 27th birthday, who wished me a Safe Trip to Ohio.
[7:56 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
uh...
[7:56 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i'm pretty sure you have said at various points that God sent you the girls who you thought were real at the time
[7:56 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but then they turned out to be trolls
[7:58 pm] CWC:
No, God did not say anything to me of what those exes were back then.
[7:59 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
brb
[8:00 pm] CWC:
It was my immature experience on the internet and my assumptions that lead me to the belief before the truth came up later.
[8:00 pm] CWC:
okay.
[8:00 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so, maybe it's your reluctance to let go of free money that you didnt earn that is leading you to the belief that God approves of this?
[8:01 pm] CWC:
???
[8:01 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
lots of people beleive [sic] that God wants them to do something, but in reality they're just rationalizing their own selfish behavior
[8:01 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
there are serial killers who kill because they think they are God's judges on earth. Crazy world leaders start wars because they think God told them to go conquer some holy land
[8:01 pm] CWC:
I will admit I do have a reluctance to letting go of "free money", but that does not lead me to anything of God approving of it. He told me himself what he told me yesterday.
[8:02 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i am just having a really, really hard time believing that God wants you to sit and collect free money and not work or do anything, when everyone else is expected to work and actually improve their lives
[8:02 pm] CWC:
There is a difference; they Thought God was talking to them, but the question was, were those people Praying to God or Consulting with him beforehand?
[8:02 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
you know, whenever I talk to God he always challenges me to improve my own life.
[8:02 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
my friends are the same way
[8:03 pm] CWC:
I prayed and asked him for his input.
[8:03 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i'm gonna pray right now quck, and see what God tells me
[8:04 pm] CWC:
okay
[8:04 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
ok, quck prayer... brb
[8:04 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
ok, back
[8:04 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
hopefully i'll hear back soon
[8:04 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
But i've been in spots in my life where i had a choice between some easy, seductive evil, and a harder, more difficult but righteous choice
[8:04 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
and usually God doesnt tell me what to do, but he does suggest that I take the harder route
[8:05 pm] CWC:
I hear you.
[8:05 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i mean, are you sure you heard him correctly? no one I know has EVER heard God tell them "hey, just sit back and do nothing, i'll hand you a job and money so you can just play games all day"
[8:06 pm] CWC:
he did not say that quote.
[8:07 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
why would God even have all the rules and commandments about life if he didnt mean people to overcome their temptation to just do nothing? if God were just going to give people whatever they want, why would he make rules in the first palce?
[8:07 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
*place
[8:08 pm] CWC:
I can't say.
[8:08 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but considering that what you think God told you sounds vastly different from everything else God ever says, dont you question it?
[8:08 pm] CWC:
I did question him.
[8:08 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
Chris, i hate to bring up something that i know might be a disturbing thing to think about...
[8:08 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but remember when i warned you that all your black magic use would open the door for Satan to get into your heart?
[8:09 pm] CWC:
I'm hearing the Devil instead of God?
[8:09 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
yes, thats it. thats what i'm worried about
[8:09 pm] CWC:
That is stupid.
[8:09 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
"do nothing, let others take care of you" is exactly what the Devil would say and you knwo it
[8:10 pm] CWC:
Look, I don't know every detail for sure, and I do put questions out now and then...
[8:10 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
You're being told that its ok to keep committing fraud, lying to the state of virginia, collecting money that other people need far more than you do
[8:10 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
how is that not something that Satan would support?
[8:10 pm] CWC:
I hear you, and I agree.
[8:10 pm] CWC:
I don't know.
[8:10 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so i think you'd better reconsider this answer to the question
[8:11 pm] CWC:
yes.
[8:11 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
and i think you should leave God out of the question of why you deserve SSI. because its too risky to involve God when you cant confirm where the answer is actually coming from
[8:11 pm] CWC:
I was only informing you what I have so far in thinking about the question.
[8:11 pm] CWC:
I agree.
[8:11 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
this time you should consider it purely from a logical standpoint. be able to explain in worldly, practical terms why you deserve SSI
[8:11 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
ok, i understand that
[8:11 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i dont mean to say i think your answer is stupid or anything, because I dont mean that. i just dont like this "godly" message because i'm worried about where it really comes from
[8:13 pm] CWC:
I see your point.
[8:13 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so why dont you think on it for a few more days, and we can talk about it again later?
[8:13 pm] CWC:
I mean, I HAVE tried to see it all through Logical Aspects, but I keep coming up blank.
[8:13 pm] CWC:
sure.
[8:13 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
wait
[8:13 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
if you're not coming up with any logical reason, maybe that's because there isnt one.
[8:13 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
which would mean you really dont deserve the SSI
[8:14 pm] CWC:
you are probably right, but right now I still am without a job, and until I get one, I still am going to need this income.
[8:14 pm] CWC:
And I am looking to apply at other places too.
[8:15 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well, its not for people who dont have a job, its for people who are unable to work.
[8:15 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but once you get a job, you can get off it once and for all
[8:15 pm] CWC:
yes.
[8:15 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
hey, maybe you should start sending me updates on where you apply!
[8:15 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
like, once a week, send me a list of all the places you applied to that week
[8:16 pm] CWC:
sounds fair.
[8:16 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
:-D
[8:16 pm] CWC:
I've just sent you a photo.
[8:16 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
email?
[8:16 pm] CWC:
yes
[8:16 pm] CWC:
I took it last night before the video.
[8:17 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
aww, its you in your sonichu costume!!
[8:17 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
:-) :-)
[8:17 pm] CWC:
well, in a bunch of paint anyway.
[8:17 pm] CWC:
you keep that for yourself to smile about.
[8:17 pm] CWC:
:) h
[8:17 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i will. :-)
[8:17 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
hey, i have a question about clyde cash
[8:18 pm] CWC:
yes?
[8:18 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i was watching the video where you make fun of him agian
[8:18 pm] CWC:
hmm hmm
[8:18 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
and you say he was "handed everything on a silver platter"
[8:18 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
what did you mean by that?
[8:20 pm] CWC:
Considering he has All That Money of his; he Rapes my Australian girlfriend, then is blessed with a Daughter from her and SHE marries HIM, he gets more damned supporters then he deserves... Everything on a Silver Platter.
[8:20 pm] CWC:
He does not deserve his One Cent Daughter.
[8:20 pm] CWC:
BTW. her name is Penny.
[8:20 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i dont think that raping a woman is the same thing as being handed something.
[8:20 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
yeah, the "one cent daughter", right?
[8:21 pm] CWC:
yes; I was making a pun.
[8:21 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i hope that panda doesnt see that. she'd probably be crushed if she heard her rape baby called that
[8:21 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but anway
[8:21 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
*anyway
[8:21 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
hey, i had a question about your hiking video!
[8:22 pm] CWC:
still, Sarah, after months of getting to know me, and we were emotionally close, she was going to fly to USA to be with me, then HE rapes her, she gets pregnant, THEN she Leaves me for HIM. Got-Dangit!!!!
[8:22 pm] CWC:
okay, the hiking video.
[8:23 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
how many miles did you walk?
[8:23 pm] CWC:
I'd say 2 or 3
[8:23 pm] CWC:
I don't have a visual knowledge on measuring a mile as I walk it.
[8:25 pm] CWC:
better expression, I can't eyeball a mile.
[8:26 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
oh
[8:26 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
where did you end on the trail before turning back?
[8:27 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
was it the palmer woodland theater? looks like it
[8:27 pm] CWC:
it was into the forest a long way before I turned back, then I took the second path at the clearing and found myself at the Carter overlook.
[8:27 pm] CWC:
No, the Woodland Theater was actually Early in the trail.
[8:27 pm] CWC:
like the first quarter mile.
[8:28 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so, you went from the trailhead parking lot to the carter overlook?
[8:28 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
and then turned back?
[8:28 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
thats only like %15 of a mile
[8:28 pm] CWC:
No.
[8:28 pm] CWC:
I went into the forest OFF the Trail.
[8:29 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
ah
[8:30 pm] CWC:
I went Right at the first clearing, into the forest, then farthest in, I turned back, and took the second path at the second clearing and found myself at the Carter Overlook.
[8:30 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i thought you had walked all over the park, considering how much you were panting
[8:30 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
it seemed like you had been hiking all day
[8:31 pm] CWC:
I had been hiking a lot, and it was in the 70s.
[8:31 pm] CWC:
there was a nip of chilly air going into and out of my nose.
[8:31 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
oh, that sounds really chilly.
[8:31 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
how long were you hiking?
[8:31 pm] CWC:
well, when I get a LOT of chill in my throat, it does make me pant.
[8:31 pm] CWC:
over an hour.
[8:32 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so, you probably actually went like half a mile?
[8:32 pm] CWC:
No, I am sure I walked well over a mile.
[8:32 pm] CWC:
I should have brought a step counter with me.
[8:32 pm] CWC:
Anyway.
[8:32 pm] CWC:
for tonight's video, I'm going to do the Fred Flintsone routine.
[8:33 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
ooh! cant wait to see
[8:33 pm] CWC:
and uh... oh shoot. had a blank moment...
[8:33 pm] CWC:
OH
[8:33 pm] CWC:
today, I went into my closet; had to dig and sort out a lot, but I got out my M.M.P.R. zords to sell on Craigslist; I still need to assemble and take the photographs to upload.
[8:33 pm] CWC:
did I tell you when they lost me as a fan in the series?
[8:35 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i never really watched power rangers, i always thought it was too kiddy.
[8:35 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
every episode is the exact same. a monster appears, they fight it, it gets bigger, they get into their zords and kill it, repeat
[8:35 pm] CWC:
I have watched the vast majority of the series.
[8:36 pm] CWC:
still, the scenarios are different. PLUS, between seasons, the old Zord set gets destroyed, and they are upgraded to the next set.
[8:36 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
the scenarios are the same. big robots beat up the monster
[8:36 pm] CWC:
Did you watch Tommy fall in love with Kimberly?
[8:36 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i dont know who those people are
[8:36 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
as i said, i never got into the show
[8:37 pm] CWC:
anyway, they lost in the Lost in Space season, when at the end of it all, they killed Zordon.
[8:37 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
yeah, but they just upgraded the zordons at the beginning of the next season like you said, right?
[8:37 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so whats the big deal
[8:38 pm] CWC:
NO, after they killed Zordon, in the next season, a Government Official puts together the next of Power Rangers.
[8:38 pm] CWC:
I did not care for a Government Official doing the job.
[8:38 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
wait, you said they get a new set of zordons every season
[8:38 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i dont get it
[8:39 pm] CWC:
You are confusing Zords, the Robots, with Zordon, the GIANT HEAD who guides the rangers with his assistant Alpha.
[8:39 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
sound the same to me. but like i said, i never was really interested in power rangers
[8:40 pm] CWC:
okay
[8:40 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so you're gonna sell your zordon toys?
[8:40 pm] CWC:
Zords, and yes.
[8:41 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
dont you have like $130 saved up for when we meet? you could use some of that for your new pc
[8:42 pm] CWC:
About that, after you told me we couldn't meet as planned in September, but instead in November, I spent the money to pay off my father some more.
[8:42 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
oh.
[8:42 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so what sort of pc are you looking at getting?
[8:42 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
like, a cheap netbook or something
[8:42 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
?
[8:42 pm] CWC:
And I was planning on setting aside the amount from November's income for our dates.
[8:42 pm] CWC:
I am looking to replace the motherboard in this PC first.
[8:42 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
why? how old is that pc?
[8:43 pm] CWC:
And when we can afford 300 or more, we'll buy a new PC.
[8:43 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
have you even confirmed the motherboard is the problem?
[8:43 pm] CWC:
7 years.
[8:43 pm] CWC:
yes, it was confirmed.
[8:43 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
how so?
[8:44 pm] CWC:
I had it examined between people on Best Buy's Geek Squad and recently my new acquaintance at PC Pro, John, that the problem is in the motherboard.
[8:44 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
ah. but didnt you say the motherboard you're looking for is like $80 or something?
[8:44 pm] CWC:
yes
[8:44 pm] CWC:
and 80 is less than 300
[8:44 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
thats a good chunk of money for an antique piece of equipment that might break as easily as the one you're replacing did
[8:44 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
um, how many ps3 games did you buy in the last 30 days?
[8:44 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
didnt you just buy beatles rock band AND lego rock band?
[8:45 pm] CWC:
yes, those two.
[8:45 pm] CWC:
it was only the two, and they both were 10 piece on clearance where I got them from.
[8:45 pm] CWC:
B.R.B. was ten at Sam's Club, and L.R.B. was ten at Target.
[8:47 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i just looked at best buy's site. beatles rock band is $30, lego is $20
[8:47 pm] CWC:
so, yes, it was just those two games in the last month.
[8:47 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
and plus, how much have you spent on DLC songs for them?
[8:48 pm] CWC:
they were both on clearance at Sam's Club and Target.
[8:48 pm] CWC:
and I only spent 15 on DLC for B.R.B.
[8:48 pm] CWC:
no money on L.R.B., because most of the past Rock Band Tracks and DLC were playable in L.R.B.
[8:48 pm] CWC:
You wanted "A Day in the Life."
[8:49 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
if lego rock band didnt add anything new, why did you buy it?
[8:49 pm] CWC:
L.R.B. has it own set of tracks, including "Ghostbuster" to name one.
[8:49 pm] CWC:
plus, it is LEGO, and I am a Lego Fan too.
[8:50 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
yes, i surmised its lego-related from the title
[8:50 pm] CWC:
looking to get it since it came out; it finally was on clearance for 10; so I got it.
[8:50 pm] CWC:
I have the receipts.
[8:50 pm] CWC:
anyway, what else?
[8:50 pm] CWC:
...
[8:52 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i have a question about something you said to tito and clyde cash when you were trying to get that $9000.
[8:52 pm] CWC:
sure.
[8:52 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
you said about the destruction of your PS3: "I have endured the Pains of Loss, and the Healing of Cleansing; FREE of the Lonely and Anguished Soul that went into that machine the past three years from destroying that vessel."
[8:53 pm] CWC:
yes, and that was true; I DID feel that.
[8:53 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but then you went and bought a new one
[8:53 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
right away
[8:53 pm] CWC:
Post-Destruction, two days later, I started feeling impulsive and tense from its absence.
[8:54 pm] CWC:
And AFTER I learned NO 9000 was coming my way.
[8:54 pm] CWC:
Which was a week later
[8:54 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but now even after those impulses have passed, you still wont let it go.
[8:54 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i know that you have told me that letting go of your PS3 addiction is non-negotiable, i'm not going to try to push it. but i just have trouble understanding why you wont drop the same amount of money (or less) on a new PC, or other useful things
[8:54 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
it just confuses me, is all
[8:56 pm] CWC:
Firstly, the other useful things, non-console related, don't come up until later.
[8:56 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
"saving money" is always useful. just because you had $300 on hand didnt mean you were required to go throw it on a video game
[8:56 pm] CWC:
Second, I would drop to get money for you definitely as we meet.
[8:56 pm] CWC:
I hear you.
[8:56 pm] CWC:
and when we meet
[8:56 pm] CWC:
and all times in the future after that.
[8:57 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
see, its stuff like this that is why i want you to seriously look at why you think you deserve your SSI. because all you spend it on, aside from paying off your debts to your dad, is video games
[8:57 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
which is not what its intended for
[8:57 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
see how the two issues are connected?
[8:57 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
like i said, take a few more days to consider it, i dont need an answer right now
[8:58 pm] CWC:
I understand what you are saying.
[8:58 pm] CWC:
Yes, Sweetheart.
[8:58 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i mean, if you really needed it, if you couldnt feed or clothe or house yourself without it, i wouldnt have a problem with it
[8:59 pm] CWC:
I don't understand your sentence.
[8:59 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
what i mean is
[8:59 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
even if you didnt have the tugboat, your parents would still house and feed you.
[9:00 pm] CWC:
I get it now.
[9:00 pm] CWC:
But I am looking to improve myself; I will get a job as soon as possible.
[9:00 pm] CWC:
I'm also going to reapply for the new Wal-Mart.
[9:00 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well see? there you go!
[9:01 pm] CWC:
yeah.
[9:01 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i knew that you saw deep down God would never tell you not to work.
[9:01 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well anyway, i'm gonna go to bed soon
[9:01 pm] CWC:
That is obvious.
[9:01 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but i have a great idea for tomorrow's video!
[9:01 pm] CWC:
tell me.
[9:01 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
is there a park or playground or somewhere near you?
[9:01 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
somewhere with a jungle gym
[9:02 pm] CWC:
there are one or two
[9:02 pm] CWC:
plus, there is a place with a Bounce and Play thing.
[9:02 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i want to see you go to one, and make a video of yourself doing pull-ips.
[9:02 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
pull-ups, i mean
[9:02 pm] CWC:
Pull-Ups; that is no problem.
[9:02 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
a jungle gym is good for that, you can use the bars
[9:03 pm] CWC:
yes, Monkey Bars.
[9:03 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
yeah, thats it
[9:03 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i want to see you do 20 pull-ups!
[9:03 pm] CWC:
cool.
[9:03 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
set the camera down from afar, and then show yourself doing the pull-ups.
[9:03 pm] CWC:
okay
[9:04 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
make sure you find a set of bars that are like 8 feet off the ground or something, so that your feet cant touch the ground
[9:04 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
yay!! :-D :-D :-D
[9:04 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i look forward to seeing it tomorrow.
[9:04 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
and the fred flinstone video tonight!!
[9:04 pm] CWC:
yes.
[9:04 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
also, i have a few more video ideas for you, but i'll put them in an email and send them to you by tomorrow.
[9:04 pm] CWC:
that's good.
[9:05 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
okay, well i'm gonna go to bed now.
[9:05 pm] CWC:
Aside all of my problems, you understand me.
[9:05 pm] CWC:
I want you to know I appreciate that. :) h
[9:05 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
aww
[9:05 pm] CWC:
:-* h
[9:05 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i appreciate your honesty, too. :-*
[9:05 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
goodnight!
[9:05 pm] CWC:
I Love You.
