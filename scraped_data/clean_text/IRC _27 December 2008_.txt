A chat involving Chris and PandaHalo in #sonichu from 27 December 2008.
Summary
This chat is almost entirely between Panda and Chris - the other trolls only show up at the very beginning and very end. Panda, as usual, takes advantage of Chris's naïveté and raging hormones to extract all kinds of bizarre sexual confessions.
From this chat we learn that Chris would be willing to have intercourse with a dog. (He specifies a female dog, however, and mentions that he would be especially turned on by a border collie.) He'd also be okay with Panda penetrating him in the ass with a strap-on or unleashing foul-smelling farts during sex. On the other hand, he's not interested in the prospect of a three-way with Panda and Robert Simmons V, and while he would have sex with a man to save Panda's life, he wouldn't like it.
“
23:45 <@ChrisChanSonichu> for your life, I would.
the idea makes my eyelid twich, though.
23:46 <@ChrisChanSonichu> and that happens only from a big amount of bad stress; the eyelid twich.
”
Aside from talking about his contemporary fetishes and tastes, and the chocolate condom he bought specially for his first time with Panda, Chris spills various details of his own and his family's sexual history. He talks about learning to mass debate from watching porn, and in fact learning just about everything he knows about sex from porn. He also shares some information about his parents' sex life (or lack thereof), showing a knowledge of that particular subject that isn't quite unhealthy, but certainly seems pretty weird.
Talking about a recent visit from Anna McLerran, Chris claims that she's a lesbian, despite also being a member of the Mormon church (a faith that hates homos almost as much as Chris does). Anna's numerous blogs have revealed that she invented this lie to deflect Chris's romantic intentions.
A couple of times during the chat, Panda tries to make Chris jealous by hinting that she's attracted to Robert. Eventually she gets him on the hook, and we are treated to several lines of Chris whining about how much they shared together (i.e. a lot of chatting on the internet) and abjectly begging Panda not to leave him.
“
00:26 <@ChrisChanSonichu> just remind me as often as possible that you still Honestly, Truly Love me.

22:48 <@PandaHalo> when will the next comic be out?
22:48 <@ChrisChanSonichu> is everyone else on the IRC able to read our chat details here, or did someone fix it so we can talk in private?
22:48 <@PandaHalo> this is private i think
22:48 <@ChrisChanSonichu> okay.
22:49 <@PandaHalo> I remember checking my skype briefly once when i had the chance and one of your offline messages said you were colouring in
22:49 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I still have pages to color, but I've been busy with other things around the house.
22:49 <@ChrisChanSonichu> aside from the coloring.
22:50 <@PandaHalo> ahhh like what?
22:50 <@ChrisChanSonichu> but I will definitely have it up on January 3 or 4.
22:50 <@PandaHalo> that is good :)
22:50 <@PandaHalo> i'm not sure if you heard but Robert Simmons the Fifth came to Australia for a holiday and we met up :)
22:51 <@ChrisChanSonichu> a few chores; taking out garbage, a bit of cleaning up, setting up our christmas tree, and lot of other things.
22:51 <@PandaHalo> ohhh pretty
22:51 <@ChrisChanSonichu> really, Bob?

22:51 <@ChrisChanSonichu> okay. :)
22:52 <@PandaHalo> which is id

22:53 <@PandaHalo> how is your mother and father?
22:53 <@PandaHalo> did you draw them anything for xmas?
22:53 <@ChrisChanSonichu> they're well.
22:53 <@ChrisChanSonichu> did you call him or vice-versa?
22:53 <@PandaHalo> we called each other
22:53 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I see; who made the first call?
22:54 <@PandaHalo> i did :)
22:54 <@ChrisChanSonichu> okay.
22:54 <@PandaHalo> do you mind?
22:54 <@ChrisChanSonichu> that's cool.
22:54 <@ChrisChanSonichu> what did y'all do?
22:55 <@ChrisChanSonichu> *together?
22:55 <@PandaHalo> went shopping for a bit, and went to the beach, stuff like that
22:55 <@PandaHalo> I got a new bikini so I was able to try it out. It's a pink ripcurl brand one
22:55 <@ChrisChanSonichu> sexy. :D
22:56 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I'd like to see a pic, if you can send me one.
22:57 <@ChrisChanSonichu> so, y'all just had a nice time; no sex, right?
22:58 <@PandaHalo> would that have been bad?
22:58 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I'm cool either way.
22:58 -!- Irssi: #sonichu: Total of 21 nicks [5 ops, 0 halfops, 0 voices, 16 normal]
22:59 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I'm only curious.
22:59 <@PandaHalo> ahhh nah we havent not yet :)
23:00 <@ChrisChanSonichu> that's good. I feel better.
23:00 <@PandaHalo> :)
23:00 <@PandaHalo> that's good
23:00 <@PandaHalo> have you done anything naughty lately?
23:00 <@ChrisChanSonichu> no.
23:00 <@PandaHalo> would you ever have a threesome with bob involved?
23:00 <@ChrisChanSonichu> no
23:01 <@PandaHalo> ahh
23:01 <@PandaHalo> okay
23:01 <@PandaHalo> just curious!
23:01 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I understand.

23:01 <@PandaHalo> you dont seem talkative D:
23:01 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I'm cool.
23:02 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I just don't have a lot on my mind right now, other than the happy feeling from being able to talk to you again. :D
23:02 <@PandaHalo> did you miss me?
23:02 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I did.
23:02 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I think about you every day.
23:02 <@PandaHalo> that is sweet
23:02 <@ChrisChanSonichu> seriously.
23:02 <@PandaHalo> do you still mass debate?
23:02 <@ChrisChanSonichu> sometimes.
23:03 <@PandaHalo> oh please tell me about it
23:03 <@ChrisChanSonichu> nothing special; just a reliver to get some stress off.
23:03 <@ChrisChanSonichu> once in a while.
23:03 <@PandaHalo> ahhhh yes
23:04 <@ChrisChanSonichu> how about u?
23:04 <@ChrisChanSonichu> mass debate? finally gone into the sex store? and what's the current situation of your PO Box?
23:05 <@PandaHalo> i havent had the chance to get a new one.. but i still be going into the post office and seeing if i can get another one until i leave for the states
23:05 <@PandaHalo> I did! i saw lots of interesting things there
23:06 <@ChrisChanSonichu> neat.
23:06 <@PandaHalo> I saw a thing called a strap on and the lady was telling me about how sometimes couples buy one, and the girl wears it and uses it on the guy and it's perfectly okay because it's not gay, but the guy likes it
23:06 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I'm willing to go for that when we're together.
23:07 <@ChrisChanSonichu> as for the PO Box, please keep me up to date, so I can give my dad the OK to mail you the books he has for you about Virgina.
23:07 <@PandaHalo> Your dad is very kind
23:08 <@ChrisChanSonichu> yes, he can be kind.
23:08 <@ChrisChanSonichu> for Christmas, he did something really thoughtful for my mother.
23:08 <@PandaHalo> what?
23:08 <@PandaHalo> have sex with her?
23:09 <@ChrisChanSonichu> he gave her an arranged box of ornaments, with tags attached to them; each one representing her blessings; three angels, me, dad and my half-bro, Cole. Ones for Ruckersville, Red Oak, our cats, and one for her.
23:09 <@ChrisChanSonichu> they have not had sex in at least two decades.
23:10 <@PandaHalo> oh that is sweet
23:10 <@PandaHalo> how do you know?
23:11 <@ChrisChanSonichu> well, they're old, more consious of germs, stresses of life, and they told me so.
23:11 <@ChrisChanSonichu> and for the past few years, they've slept in seperate [sic] rooms of the house.
23:11 <@ChrisChanSonichu> IMHO, kind of sad.
23:12 <@ChrisChanSonichu> because they're not as close as they should, used to or can be.
23:12 <@ChrisChanSonichu> yet they still love and care for each other.

23:12 <@PandaHalo> that does sound sad :(
23:12 <@ChrisChanSonichu> yeah.
23:12 <@PandaHalo> what do they do instead?
23:13 <@PandaHalo> go to strip clubs or prostitutes or something? or just mass debate?
23:13 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I had a nice day Tuesday, when my gal-pal, Anna, came back to Virgina to be with her family here; she called me and we met at the mall, walked and shopped together; we had a good time enjoying each other's company.
23:14 <@ChrisChanSonichu> mass debate and porn on vhs or dvd
23:14 <@PandaHalo> ahhhh thats fair enough
23:14 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I do not know of any strip clubs around here.
23:14 -!- Decoy_Octillery [~sonichu@Rizon-922579A6.lsanca.dsl-w.verizon.net] has joined #sonichu
23:14 <@PandaHalo> do you ever see your dad watching pron?
23:15 <@PandaHalo> by the way
23:15 <@ChrisChanSonichu> he has not for decades, if he's watched any at all.
23:15 <@PandaHalo> one thing i've always been curious about.. where did you learn to mass debate?
23:16 -!- Irssi: #sonichu: Total of 22 nicks [5 ops, 0 halfops, 0 voices, 17 normal]
23:16 <@ChrisChanSonichu> actually figured it out for myself, in my room one night after having unlocked the parental lock; I found the pool scene in "I Like to Play Games 2", and I just figured it out for myself.
23:16 <@ChrisChanSonichu> at about 16 years old.
23:17 <@ChrisChanSonichu> and I did take a sex-ed class in High School.
23:17 <@PandaHalo> ahhh
23:17 <@PandaHalo> chris have you heard of world of warcraft?
23:18 <@ChrisChanSonichu> yet they only taught things like the STDs, semen, eggs, that sort of thing; no mass debate or sexual positions; again I had to learn that for myself from the porn.
23:18 <@PandaHalo> hey chris, you should really make a new video of the things you've been up to
23:18 <@PandaHalo> Ohhhhh
23:18 <@PandaHalo> great thing that porn is very educational
23:18 <@PandaHalo> it's how i learnt about dog sex
23:19 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I've heard of Warcraft; I don't care much for it, with the exception for the Free Track "I Am Murloc" that was downloadable for play on Guitar Hero III.
23:19 <@ChrisChanSonichu> and the South Park episode.
23:19 <@PandaHalo> you should play world of warcraft with me
23:19 <@PandaHalo> please make a new video soon?
23:20 <@ChrisChanSonichu> speaking of animal sex, I've thought about it some more, and if you help me with that and watch, I may do it with a female dog for you.
23:20 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I'll think about a new video; I've been busy you know.
23:20 <@ChrisChanSonichu> also, I've created a new Sonichu club on Playstation Home.
23:20 <@PandaHalo> ohhh that would be very interesting :)
23:20 <@ChrisChanSonichu> simply called the Sonichu Home Club.
23:21 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I have a few members already, but I can only have a certain number.
23:21 <@PandaHalo> Ohhhhhhhh
23:21 <@ChrisChanSonichu> still, with your account on my PS3, I can switch between them and make a seat for you there.
23:21 <@PandaHalo> cool
23:21 <@ChrisChanSonichu> *in the Home Club.
23:22 <@ChrisChanSonichu> BTW, have you been able to access the Playstation Store from Wi-Fi on your PSP or your PC?
23:22 <@PandaHalo> my wifi isnt working unfortunately. my modem is hooked up to the computers by cables
23:24 <@ChrisChanSonichu> well, I recommend trying to get to it from your PC; go to http://store.playstation.com, select Australia, download the PSP Media Manager Program, and you can access the store from there and download the games, demos and videos to your PSP through the USB cable.
23:24 <@PandaHalo> what kind of dog would you have sex with? a fluffy one?
23:24 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I don't think so; I can imagine myself doing it with a collie at least.
23:24 <@ChrisChanSonichu> you know, like Lassie.
23:25 <@PandaHalo> Ohhh Lassie is a pretty dog
23:26 <@ChrisChanSonichu> IDK why, but something about the color scheme and face of a collie just strikes me in that sense.
23:26 <@ChrisChanSonichu> anyway, when you can, you should try to access the Store through your PC and get in on the good stuff you can download from your account there.
23:27 <@PandaHalo> okay that is a good suggestion
23:27 <@ChrisChanSonichu> and also, after you access it, you may want to update the address in your account.
23:27 <@PandaHalo> good idea
23:27 <@ChrisChanSonichu> because when I created it for you, I think I used your previous PO Box.
23:28 <@ChrisChanSonichu> but you can check for yourself if I did or not.
23:28 <@ChrisChanSonichu> at least it won't be shared so easily.
23:29 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I left that check box unchecked for them to share it with their associating companies, or to send you any advertisements and offers for Playstation products.
23:29 <@ChrisChanSonichu> *both check boxes
23:30 <@ChrisChanSonichu> did I tell you about the chocolate condom I found at my sex store recently?
23:30 -!- Crasscrab [~crasscrab@Rizon-BA057588.c3-0.smt-ubr2.atw-smt.pa.cable.rcn.com] has joined #sonichu
23:30 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I got it for only a dollar, because they sell them individually or in a set of three for a higher price.
23:30 <@ChrisChanSonichu> and I found only one in the individual bunch.
23:31 <@PandaHalo> ohhhhh cool
23:31 <@ChrisChanSonichu> at least when I want to order some more, I can look up their website and order some; it's Trustex brand.
23:31 <@PandaHalo> Ohhh
23:31 <@PandaHalo> it has trust in the name
23:31 <@PandaHalo> that means you can trust them
23:32 <@PandaHalo> If Anna wanted sex, would you sleep with her?
23:32 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I hope so, if it doesn't work, I also can locally get Trojan brand.
23:32 <@ChrisChanSonichu> if she did, yes, but she's labled herself as a lesbian, so I doubt it.
23:32 <@PandaHalo> aw
23:33 <@ChrisChanSonichu> also, she's a Morman.
23:33 <@PandaHalo> Ohhhh
23:34 <@PandaHalo> Mormans can have multiple wives did you know that?
23:34 <@PandaHalo> they also have magic underpants (you think im joking but I'm serious)
23:34 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I've heard of that from an episode of Family Guy, but he got turned off when he heard he couldn't drink beer.
23:34 <@ChrisChanSonichu> magic underpants? is there a picture of these garments?
23:35 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I've just found the place where I can order a 12 pack of the trustex chocolate condoms for 7.99 US. you can see for yourself at http://www.condomdepot.com/product/detail.cfm/pid/2366
23:35 <@PandaHalo> http://www.getreligion.org/wp-content/photos/Garment.jpg <- they you go
23:38 <@PandaHalo> wow!
23:38 <@ChrisChanSonichu> interesting.
23:39 <@ChrisChanSonichu> anyway, that condom is the same one that I found for a dollar; I'm saving the one I have for our first time.
23:39 <@ChrisChanSonichu> it's good till Jan, 2013
23:40 <@PandaHalo> have you heard of dental dams?
23:40 <@ChrisChanSonichu> no
23:41 <@ChrisChanSonichu> please inform me.
23:41 <@ChrisChanSonichu> BTW, a member on the IRC has a PSN account, LeonSpike, so that's how I knew to come to the IRC right away.
23:41 <@ChrisChanSonichu> to talk to you in particular.
23:42 <@PandaHalo> ohhhh that was cool , i was talking to them just beforeyou came i n
23:42 <@PandaHalo> its good beacuse i havent been able to get in touch over skype
23:43 <@ChrisChanSonichu> that's cool.
23:43 <@PandaHalo> i have a question
23:43 <@ChrisChanSonichu> yes.
23:43 <@PandaHalo> imagine that i'm kidnapped by terrorists
23:43 <@PandaHalo> and they say
23:43 <@PandaHalo> they're going to shoot me in the head
23:43 <@PandaHalo> unless you have sex with a guy
23:43 <@ChrisChanSonichu> D:
23:43 <@PandaHalo> would you have sex with a guy to save my life?
23:44 <@PandaHalo> you could pick any guy in the world though
23:45 <@ChrisChanSonichu> for your life, I would. the idea makes my eyelid twich, though.
23:46 <@ChrisChanSonichu> and that happens only from a big amount of bad stress; the eyelid twich.
23:46 <@PandaHalo> Ahhhhh
23:46 <@PandaHalo> thank you
23:46 <@ChrisChanSonichu> let me ask you, in return...
23:47 <@ChrisChanSonichu> would you stay with me, no matter how my gas smelled, because IMHO... peeeeew.
23:47 <@ChrisChanSonichu> ?
23:48 <@PandaHalo> well when i was at the sex shop, they had these things called anal butt plugs.. so you could use one of them and there wouldnt be a problem
23:48 <@PandaHalo> have you seen them?
23:48 <@PandaHalo> i can google a picture for you
23:48 <@ChrisChanSonichu> that's alright.
23:48 <@ChrisChanSonichu> but if there weren't butt plugs, would you still stay with me?
23:49 <@PandaHalo> well i could get your dad to make one because he invented plastic and could make a plastic one
23:49 <@ChrisChanSonichu> also, it's actually a bad idea, since constriction of the gas-release can result in spontaneous combustion.
23:50 <@ChrisChanSonichu> he's retired, remember?
23:50 <@ChrisChanSonichu> besides, he only invented the Controls for the machines.
23:50 <@ChrisChanSonichu> regardless of my smell, would you stay with me; yes or no?
23:52 -!- mode/#sonichu [+o Spankety] by ChanServ
23:53 <@PandaHalo> Ohhhh
23:54 <@PandaHalo> i would try and get it fixed
23:54 <@PandaHalo> and besides, there's always axe body spray
23:56 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I guess. let me put it another way.
23:56 <@PandaHalo> I'll brb
23:59 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I would definitely stay with you, even if the loudest, smelliest fart slipped out of you. I would stay with you regardless of any considerably gross accidents or habits you may have. I'm still loving you, even considering your dog fetish.
23:59 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I'm only asking if you would do the same for me.

00:14 <@ChrisChanSonichu> do you still LOVE me?
00:14 <@ChrisChanSonichu> honestly*
00:14 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I do not mean to sound jealous, but I'm still feeling shocked.
00:15 <@ChrisChanSonichu> Bob wears glasses too.
00:16 <@ChrisChanSonichu> and i saw his figure on YouTube; it's about the same as mine.
00:16 <@PandaHalo> of course I care about you!
00:16 <@ChrisChanSonichu> okay, now I'm feeling sad. :_(
00:17 <@PandaHalo> hmmm
00:17 <@ChrisChanSonichu> we've shared soo much; the phone-like sex, the role-play of our married life and a LOT of chats with text and voice.
00:17 <@ChrisChanSonichu> and over like two months.
00:17 <@PandaHalo> you told me you had feelings for that restaurant chick so i thought it would be okay for me to get feelings for robert
00:18 <@PandaHalo> sorry if i hurt you christian
00:18 <@ChrisChanSonichu> yeah, I guess it's fair.
00:18 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I'm sorry too; for emotionally falling like I just did.
00:19 <@ChrisChanSonichu> Let me ask you something.
00:19 <@PandaHalo> yeah i guess it must be different with the shoe on the other foot
00:20 <@ChrisChanSonichu> you have Bob there at the moment; would you feel better to lose your virginity with him now, or wait until June and lose it mutually with me.
00:20 <@ChrisChanSonichu> ?
00:20 <@PandaHalo> if he fucks me in the ass it means im still a virgin
00:21 <@PandaHalo> i do like you and think you're SUPER COOL and AWESOME but you havent released any comics for a while and that makes me sad.
00:21 <@PandaHalo> but, im not sure about that question. i will wait and see.
00:21 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I'm sorry for the delay in the comic.
