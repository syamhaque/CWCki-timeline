================================================================================

Delusion disclosure: This article or section takes place during Chris's phase of role-playing as Sonichu. He may refer to his Christine Chandler personality and physical body in the third person by using terms such as "mama".
On 20 September 2020, Chris posted in the Watchmen Discord server The Place about his obsessive thoughts on Megan Schroeder. Chris described having had an emotional breakdown, sobbing over her, and vented about his perceived issues with Megan.
Chat
Chris (as Sonichu)
I’m back. I will give the app a download and a go to check it out in a little while.
Anyway
The “Chris Chan VS. The Internet” trailer
I loved it; still love it; can’t say that enough about it, genuinely.
Naught
I hate to be the bearer of bad news but once the footage was recorded Megan and others involved started to get harassed by randoms on the internet so Joe destroyed it
Kyle
It's a neat idea, I ain't got much experience with movies, but independent stuff is a hard sell, easier than games, but anything is.
Chris (as Sonichu)
There were two parts that really move me, one of which further moved the core of this body (Chris-Core):
Naught
Chris (as Sonichu)
I was in awe seeing Mama as she was drawing me yet again. It is always so fascinating to me, no matter how many times I see it; it just gives me an inspired rush to continue on being myself.
I believe a lot of the OCs feel that way of their respective chroniclers who draw them.
Naught
Yes the cinematography was good
Chris (as Sonichu)
And the bonus at the end; personally confirming that is indeed Megan Schroeder, herself, and her voice as she spoke.
Kyle
Simpler is generally happier.
Chris (as Sonichu)
It felt like closure that generally made Chris-Core, and in that matter would do the same with Mama, herself, awe in surprise. Like seeing someone who died suddenly come back to life after years of being gone.
Kyle
Things happen, people move away, it's generally not productive to focus on that.
Chris (as Sonichu)
And, also, this brain could hear and sense her emotions in her voice, even though we all know in her gang-ho type, she would hardly admit it initally.
There were genuine feelings of remorse and regret in her voice. (edited)
Naught
Did you experience a sense of closure?
Chris (as Sonichu)
And the empathy kicked in as well; putting us in her point of view and perspective for a moment.
Naught
Or finality? At least in regards to that portion of mama's life?
Kyle
Closure is distance, letting go isn't weakness it's a strength.
Chris (as Sonichu)
It is obvious. She was caught up on just about the basics of everything that happened with Mama from after April, 2008, when Megan last saw Mama.
And, Chris-Core ended up thinking further and further, and there’s still the emotional baggage that feels need to be sorted out, and can only be done so between Mama, herself, and Megan, in a heart-to-heart talk.
Kyle
What is there honestly left to say?
Chris (as Sonichu)
Yes, Mama feels guilt for being touch-feel with Megan on her shoulders and hair (she didn’t touch anything else on her body, and only one time, the two of them did hold hands for a moment). (edited)
Naught
When the trailer for that documentary was released whole bunch of people flooded her Facebook and vandalized her website where she's trying to sell her goods (edited)
Kyle
Let sleeping dogs lie, just think that thing fits best.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Mama realized that she had tried too hard to be close to Megan, and Megan was right in closing herself emotionally off from Mama.
Kyle
It's about respect, fuck, I've burned bridges, let things lie.
Chris (as Sonichu)
She realized she could have done better in keeping personal space and doing better in respect and being a friend.
I will also point out, clear and true:
Although Mama did have a very small hormonal feeling around Megan, as she was attracted to women, obviously, but for the majority of their time together, sex was literally the farthest thing in her mind.
Kyle
I'd leave it up to her own discretion.
Chris (as Sonichu)
And then Mama found Encyclopedia Dramatica, and started going NSFW in her drawing.
Kyle
It's awkward and, strange circumstances considering.
Chris (as Sonichu)
And then, out of frustration, the “She Came for CWC” drawing.
Naught
I understand that aspect especially in regards to Mama's Gal Pals Megan was one of Mama's first true friends
Chris (as Sonichu)
Mama said she had drawn that out of wishful thinking; only partly true.
Kyle
Some of these things, won't come off as well as others.
MKRNightVee
It's sad how things happened. But we learn and do better in the future. Its how we grow
Chris (as Sonichu)
Megan was also using Mama, as well as trolling her; taking advantage of her kindness and loyalty.
Kyle
Things like that, would come off wrong...
Chris (as Sonichu)
The merchandise Mama had bought for Megan and getting compensated in trade with “merchandise from Megan’s collection of things”.
Mama never ever read any of the manga she received from Megan.
And all of those things she bought for Megan, I tell you all in strict confidence, just kept piling onto her credit card debt at the time.
Mama really should have been paid cash, but she was used.
MKRNightVee
That's no good...
Kyle
So planning out, how would you plan about ordering these topics, it's not coming off in a good light verbatim.
Chris (as Sonichu)
And there was also that time Mama witnessed Megan making out with her beard of a fake boyfriend (the dude was obviously a gay boy) that literally shocked Mama to the core.
Kyle
Least waiting for her to reach out would at least get rid of a lot of awkwardness.
Chris (as Sonichu)
And shortly after, while speaking in a monotone robot voice out of the shock and stress while playing a game of Pokemon TCG with one of the other players, Mimms and Lucas took that infamous photo of her that ended up on Encyclopedia Dramatica.
Naught
Well sometimes people want to explore and oddly enough someone who is gay would be the optimal choice since in theory they don't want anything further
Chris (as Sonichu)
Mama’s real reason for drawing that Came piece was out of frustration she was subconsciously feeling from Megan continually playing her on and on and making her spend money for Megan.
A freaking ZUNE.
Lainchu
True, it can remain an experiment without risk of either of them catching feelings
Chris (as Sonichu)
Megan wanted a freaking ZUNE, and she bought it for her for some of her “merchandise”.
Naught
Hahaha I remember zunes
Kyle
Well, odds are that won't go down well mentioning.
I just remember the leap year bug.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Another one for one of Mama’s credit card accounts.
And when Mama and Barb were being “Escorted” out of the PLace by Snyder, Megan was there, watching, as Mama was being forced out.
Kyle
It was a poor decision at the time, I can't say as this is a very well considered plan... Just saying.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Megan could have spoken in Mama’s defense, but she did not.
Mama had said in an uploaded video that she had forgiven Megan, but there’s still the emotional baggage.
There are certain aspects that would have been really different with Mama had Megan not push Mama away like that.
Coming out as a Transwoman would still be a highly likely eventual, regardless.
Kyle
Well realistically how does something like this come off? From her perspective?
Chris (as Sonichu)
But the damage was massive.
Mama off and on would also see Megan in her dreams; simply being there. An awkward moment, and Mama’s impulse was to back away and leave her be.
Now, I can move back to last night.
While trying to fall asleep after hitting the hay at about 1:30 am, for Hours, Chris-Core kept on thinking about it and searching further into these emotions and all. This body cried a LOT, and yes, I’ve had to blow its nose.
I, Rosey and Cryzel, even Val, tried to calm it down, but it could not be helped.
And the Fitbit didn’t register body rest until about 2:30, and there were awake gaps until finally falling asleep and having a dream at what felt like about 5:30 am.
Yet I still managed to get five and a half hours of rest, despite all of that.
But there was a lot of No Sleep.
Chris-Core got all of its emotions out.
I encouraged and supported that the emotions needed to be felt and addressed.
Kyle
Just saying be measured about some of these things, odds aren't fantastic all things considered.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Copy that, Kyle.
Kyle
Realistically would she want to make contact again, if so, why?
Chris (as Sonichu)
Anyway, I felt like a half-awake mess getting up, it’s after midnight now, yesterday morning at about 10:00 am, and I had the Porygon Day and all that fated and foreseen bunch of things to do.
Realistically, the way this noggin interprets it and recalls her personality, Megan does have her remorse and regret, and certainly remaining issues that have to be dealt with directly with Mama. But would she do it? She’d likely want to tough it out and keep it to herself, but there is the possibility she would realize she would have to face Mama again and want to get it over with.
Val
This game can serve as a love letter to those who have helped mama Chris Chan.
Even a bit of a fuck you to the haters.
Chris (as Sonichu)
These eyes are still feeling nearly dry after all of that crying last night.
Kyle
That's well, tough to do right...
Chris (as Sonichu)
Yep. The Sonichu/Rosechu Dating Sim.
Val
Hidden details, I mean.
The WCT

We all want closure.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Yes.
Kyle
Part of closure is, well closure...
Chris (as Sonichu)
Thanks, Neko.
Naught
The issue isn't so much with Mama but the issue lies with the fact that so much of this is in the public domain and that would further complicate even ruin her business (edited)
Kyle
It's a big split, things might have sucked, but things are, apart from now, closed off fairly well.
Naught
You know trouble some fans and fake fans
MKRNightVee
I never knew that megan was such a jerk to your mama, I'm sorry she had to go through that.
Kyle
Only sense of closure now is letting go.
Chris (as Sonichu)
By the way, Megan is still a CPU, herself, and her self-counterpart in C-197; CPU Red Heart of the obscure German Nintendo Console that is hardly able to be found most anywhere; online information is scarce about it.
Naught
.img German Nintendo console
Chris (as Sonichu)
Nope
Not an NES
Kyle
The market for that, unless, famiclone?
Makes no sense, more familiar with Brazilian fakes.
How close to Nintendo?
I think I might know something with maybe similar hardware?
MKRNightVee
I think I might know this console
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interton_Video_Computer_4000
Naught
Inherton
Chris (as Sonichu)
According to Mama’s memory when she tried to find it online, it was an officially licensed product by Nintendo, exclusive to Germany, and released around the time of the Virtual Boy console, but it’s not the VB.
Kyle
So prior to 95'
Naught
1978?
Kyle
Handheld?
MKRNightVee
It's my best guess?
Kyle
I might know one or two regional things.
A German exclusive would be poor marketing considering associated manufacturing costs.
Several early microcomputers that are similar enough in design.
Chris (as Sonichu)
It was as rare as a SEGA Neptune.
But not as rare, I’m certain.
Kyle
So how would it have a region, prototypes aren't that specific.
If microcomputers work, I can find a few systems.
Chris (as Sonichu)
All I can do is consult with the Cosmos further about this console, and even then I’d end up with vague details about it.
Kyle
Like there's the Supervision, uses a 6502 variant.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Part of its backstory was that it ended up being not a very good console, and Germany wanted all records of it be stripped from historic databases and catalogs, and so forth.
Either that, or Germany had some sort of thing against video games at the time.
Oh, my Chris Chan.
Anyway
Kyle
First one, not really feasible, Berlin wall already came down.
East Germany might have more specifics, but that would be a minimum 5 year gap.
The WCT
[quotes Chris's "Either that, or Germany had some sort of thing against video games at the time." line]
East Germany or West Germany?
Chris (as Sonichu)
I’m feeling like I want to hit the hay very soon. But I wanted to share all of that with y’all.
Mostly in confidence, of course.
But also to sort out details between Mama and Megan.
Lainchu
Any part of this you want made public, or are we keeping it all here?
Chris (as Sonichu)
Anyway, thank you all for listening.
The WCT
We're glad you've came to chat with us as always.
Naught
Ok let's make it a regular occurrence so we can hammer out these issues
Kyle
There's Robotron?
The WCT
We're always around. @Sonichu982
MKRNightVee
Rest well sonichu
Lainchu
Goodnight
Val
Sleep well.
Kyle
Used a Z80 knockoff, those are very common.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Let me get back to you on that, Lainchu.
Naught
Nite nite
Lainchu
Sure thing
I only ask because of the "mostly in confidence" mention
Kyle
25k tops, discontinued mid 90's.
Naught
I'm pretty sure Megan wants to be left out of this Meghan knows about it
Chris (as Sonichu)
Thanks. I’ll see you later, Val. Hop back into this body if you need to once again to make further adjustments.
Naught
Nobody else needs to know in my opinion
Val
I'm here to help.
