Transcript
[Removes glasses, leaves them on a table his right] Alright, let's get some similarities and differences compared. Personality traits: in the longer run who has been the cooler man, who has origin on everything in the Sonichu and Rosechu comics, as you noticed in all the videos I have been the cooler man, I have been more calm and even my voice sounds more similar to everything in the past recordings, including my 25th birthday and [drops PS3 controller and points with both hands at his head] look at my face. The very same face from February 24th [makes 2's with both hands] two years ago.
And another thing: yes. [Lowers down to grab his plastic guitar] I have never learned to play a real guitar, but that doesn't mean I could not rock, so that's a good reason why [strikes the guitar, as finishing a riff] I play on the Guitar Hero. [Leaves guitar at his right side] Started out on PlayStation 2, where it originally started, you know. And another thing...
[Video jumps]
I have still been having a ch- harder time of trying find a boyfriend-free girl int- to make to a sweetheart from the ground-up. Yet he was able to get a girlfriend... [snaps his fingers] like that. Big difference! In the longer run, the real Christopher Christian Weston Chandler had a harder time... and still is having a bit of a hard time. [Deep breath]
And also if you look at the eight-year old photo, and I have recently looked back upon it, an eight-year old video. Eight-year old video. And in previous videos and photographs including on the Encyclopaedia Dramatica page, yes it is true. I'm no longer ashamed of it. [Moves body 90 degrees to his left] I was born with the body type that has MANBOOBS! [Grabs both breasts with both hands and plays with them] My type. [Lowers shirt] You might say a little type in the "A" and a little bit of size A. But I'm a man, so there. I'm still a man.
My DICK was on that Encyclopaedia Dramatica page. They, it was falsely brought on, because the trolls posed as women who falsely gained my trust. I know, it's my fault, my fault that those trolls got the information, but still they documented it for the longest time since about... some about 2006 or 2007, when I first found the ED page in 2007 in [mumbles]. It was just getting started on that... about late October then.
Plus also, green and purple striped shirt. I think the picture was blurry, but that's still my face, so there you go. That's a few big differences between me and him. Is he the man with the body-type of manboobs, A negative blood. Born on 24 February 1982, born with the name of Christopher Weston Chandler, went to Regency Square found- had the inspiration for the name change in 1989 by the English speaking conductor Leonard Bearstein. Does he? [Shakes head horizontally] No. And you know his diploma and his degree that he had displayed, counterfeited from the pictures that were taken from the slideshow on a DVD which was only distributed family and close friend-wise. It would not have leaked if the troll had not posed as my very first female crush on all the way back to Greene County Primary days. [Long pause, staring at the camera] So there.
Remember, who has a longer history? I do. Who has the body type that has been mocked for the long time? I do. He does not have any of these things. He has nothing, all that he has [lowers his body to grab a white sheet of paper] is a piece of paper that I can get 500 sheets of at Walmart [tears sheet of paper] for five bucks.
So I'll leave you with that. Quit with this game, man and quit with the- with the supporting the impostor, trolls. I have thanked you for the documentations. You can go troll Joshua Martinez for all I care because he is a liar. He is a liar. At this point I don't care much about him, so go ahead, troll him.
Peace out, have a good day, stay safe.
