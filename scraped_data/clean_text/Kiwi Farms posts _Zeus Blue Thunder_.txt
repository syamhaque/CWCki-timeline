Persona Commission
13 August 2024[1]
Another update to commissions.
This time it's not as big of a bombshell. Still funny, but not a bombshell.
It seems as if one Persona commission was not enough. I got a picture of a SECOND one, this time of Persona 4 Golden.
This one's even funnier because it wasn't commissioned by Ren Ryghts. It seems as if this ween thought the Persona 3 one was so funny, they just HAD to do it again.
The timing is also interesting. The work is signed July 13th, right smack in the middle of the Ren Ryghts/Sonichu Psychology drama.
Pregnancy Rumor
24 November 2024[2]
Guys...
Idk how to tell you this...
I was just talking with a few of my buddies about stream highlights, to have them added to the CWCki, and I saw Net Narcolepsy added some already...
And...uhhh
Here, have this clip.

I have no idea where this question even came from or what Chris is talking about, but...
Chris expects a child this summer.
Omori Commission
3 June 2025[3]
I got contacted about another Chris commission, this time...I think it's Omori? The guy that sent these pics it to me didn't actually say. Personally, I thought this was that incest game everyone talked about, which would have been peak comedy.
The guy stated that Chris was asked to recreate some picture but with himself in the middle, but the guy didn't actually send me any followup pics...instead sending me some shitty Tiktok meme from Monsters University that has nothing to do with the drawing.
I will update you if he somehow delivers, or I find it on the internet somehow.
Edit: Sorry for shit quality, but I found the image in question on Google.

God, Chris sucks at his job.
Photo Analysis
14 June 2025[4]
Folks. I have made a great discovery.
It's not something I'm able to figure out on my own, however.
It all has been buried in the house pictures that Chris took.
I've actually searched any and all previous pics of the place Chris has posted on Twitter and Bluesky to look for more of this, but he doesn't seem to have slipped up in either of them.
But before I reveal the main thing, I have a few smaller things which I am not exactly able to figure out.
First, the four main pics from the ebegging post.
So.
From least important to most.
This is the picture of the table in Chris's streaming room, as confirmed by this thingy being visible in the Part 3 of the Sonic 06 steam and in the Grounded Deep Response.
[Posts three close up images of the "thingy"]
Then, the laptop stickers. The laptop seems to be the same old one he got back in 2021, but it has a few stickers on it now. I am not sure what a lot of these are from, I suspect some random furry shit Chris has bought or from the conventions he's been on.
The more interesting shit starts here.
See, in all four of these pictures, you can see this...post card? I have no idea what this thingy is, I mainly got these things as birthday cards.
It's impossible to read the whole text on it, but what you can read is interesting.
The date at the side means it's from May 10th, 2025 (theoretically could be any year, though I doubt it, especially as we've never seen it prior). It could mean, therefore, that this card is from Finland, as Chris's first confirmed US appearance was a livestream from May 17, then a sighting a day later.
The photo is of Chris Chan on a weird background and with a weird filter over him, which reminds me of the type of thing my school photographers would do in class photos. Could be taken at a photobooth.
The text at the top is impossible to read in full, but the words "PAVILLION", "PHOTOGRAPH" and "ULTRA IMAGE" are readable.
Below it, we can read "PHOTOGRAPH REPRESENTS" "...ONS OF YOUR HEART"
At the bottom, we cannot read the left text, but the right we can, and reads "Left/Feminine".
The title is "...Expression of Light".
No idea what the fuck that's about.
However, the big thing in those images is something that I haven't seen in any other image Chris posted of his house online. A detail that I almost missed and have only noticed it when I tried to analyse that postcard for details.
A photo, next to a Sonichu medallion that doesn't appear to be of Chris's make.
It shows Chris...it appears next to someone...possibly Flutter (of course obscured as always) in front of some building.
I have no idea about what this place is and I bet the GeoGuessers can figure it out.
I've wanted to post it here anyway due to that postcard, but the photo...this one thing that we have all missed...just leads to so many questions...
What do you think of this?
Update: I used a photo AI for help, and it have me...an interesting answer.

[Xela puts the AI's message below under a spoiler tag]
The image appears to be digitally generated rather than captured by a camera, though it may represent one of these locations:
1. Finland
- Helsinki, GPS location around: 60.160805,24.918120
- Kilo, GPS location around: 60.160790,24.918085
- Lahti, GPS location around: 60.272514,24.763184
- Kittilae, GPS location around: 60.272514,24.763184
2. Braendoe
- Mariehamn, GPS location around: 60.160866,24.918083
Hmmm...certainly possible. This is the Helsinki address, I got it consistently whenether I narrowed down the search to Finland. Certainly possible, though finding the right angle might be difficult, especially with the limitations of the Google Maps.
Kiwi Farms user Varis replied
I think it's from a local amusement park, Linnanmäki. There seems to be a sign on top of the building and a structure that looks like a crane or part of a roller coaster. It's also closer to the area where Chris has been sighted in the past.

I can scout it out tomorrow.
Xela responded
Oh. Oh shit. We're getting somewhere.

This specific location is very feasable. Almost the right angle. The trees cover it, but if you went there in the winter/early Spring, you wouldn't have an issue with the trees anyway.
Now Chris can no longer deny being in Finland.
