This article is still yet to be completed due to stress. We get a lot of stressful torture in our lives that makes us crash into slumber. Given that inspiration is a big variable, and we may have been lacking of it, this article will be completed as soon as possible, at our own pace... HONEST!

Sonichu 12: A Work in Progress
1 July, 7:18 pm
The First Three Pages of Sonichu #12, having been drawn in 2011, are finally coloured and uploaded. Also, an alternate version of the cover that did not make it (for the muse was a Troll; "she" know who they are). And some commentary.

Friendship with Jessica Quinn
2 July, 6:35 pm
Chris's Facebook generated a slideshow video featuring photos from his and Quinn's Facebooks to note the two-year anniversary of them becoming Facebook friends.
Quinn:
How cute! 😊
Thank you for sharing!
Chris:
Thank Facebook for suggesting it yesterday. 😊💖
Don't Be Discouraged
2 July, 6:28 pm
This is still one of my favourite pieces of Fan Art.
Thank you, Minnie.
🌸
Meanwhile, I'm 🖍📝 Page 4 of Sonichu 12.
Have a great day or night.
Quinn:
Hey... what's my name doing up there?
Chris:
Jessica Quinn paper behind the drawing was a print out of your earlier suggestions to the Simonchu and Bananafunkel episode. Not to be a downer, or you may keep your interpretation, but it was more of the coincidence. Love for you, though.
Handling Dem Bullies
2 July, 9:29 pm
This is one good way to stand up to a bully you may have more in common with than you thought.

Clickbait Analyzers

He linked to one of those Facebook websites that "analyzes" your personality traits, Nametests.com.
Eye Contact
Eye Contact remains very important, also attractive.
He linked to wittybunny.com, apparently his eyes are his most important asset.

A Man's Gotta Eat
5 July, 5:34 pm
I just cooked up and enjoyed a Hot Hamburger Plate with mashed potatoes, like my father's old friend, Tony (worked at Reid's Supermarket during the off-seasons); I picked the right gravy; it really took me back.
Yum!
This picture is actually taken from a Google search for "Hot Hamburger Plate."
Crayola
7 July, 9:31 am
Seriously, I could do a commercial for Crayola.
"Rather just to add colour to your day, or just keeping it all inside the drawn lines, #Crayola Rocks for artists of All Ages."

Any Computer is a modern day Telegraph.

Think a bit about it, it is true and funny.

Kidney Stone
9 July, 6:05 am
I had a mildly painful couple of days, but then I realized this morning it was a kidney stone; I just passed my first kidney stone. Better!🌸
Ouch! Hope it wasn't a mega stone 💎
Only the first one?
Congratulations. You lived through it too. I have had Gallbladder stones in my past. Both are not fun.
You may want to have a doctor take a look at it soon.
I was misdiagnosed with acid reflux disease for a year and a half. I had a really bad episode with my gall stones. Then I got a sonogram performed. It revealed golf size gall stones and I had to get surgery done to remove my gallbladder. Trust me you don't want to wait to long to have it checked out.
Worst thing to do is ignore it.

Sonichu Max Speed
9 July, 5:24 pm
Ever wondered the speed of our Prime Sonichu?
Well, the average wild Sonichu can achieve a top running speed of 6,500 Miles Per Hour.
Our Leading Sonichu practices and runs Every Day, Everywhere, with his cell phone on-hand, his Sonichite in his sock's pocket, and the most Heavy-Duty Built Shoes, Sonichu has been Clocked In running beyond 10,000 Miles Per Hour.
Break out the Vegeta Meme: "IT'S OVER 9,000!!!!!"

You'll have to revise your estimate. Something moving by kicking against the ground wouldn't be able to stay on the ground at that speed without significant downforce.
He was running towards you from a great distance; the "dirt" was his path.
