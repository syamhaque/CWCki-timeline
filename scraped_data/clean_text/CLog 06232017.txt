CLog 06232017 is another one of Chris's Captain's Log videos, despite the abbreviation term of the title. In the video, Chris shills for his Patreon and updates his supporters on his plans for releasing the rest of the long-awaited Sonichu 11. Notably, he plans to delay releasing the pages to non-supporters, despite the fact that DStecks already paid for (almost) all of them.

Transcript
[Chris holds a large binder, apparently a physical book of Sonichu 11, throughout]
Coming to you live from home once again, stardate... Captain's Log, stardate... um, [huff] 0-6-2-3-2-0-1-7 - uh, think I did that right. Anyway, so this part, this update, we actually have something special to talk about. Ah! We are so - I am so close to finishing book 11 and its 100-page set - it'll probably end up being a little more because we have a lot of people to thank... for their generous donations.
Anyway, also, you should definitely, also, ah - since this'll be completed by the first of July, this will be the very first book to go out to all Patreons, all people who pledged, and successfully collected their Patreons, be the first book of the month, and the $20 minimum level, the more you pay the more books you get, which, by the way, I forgot to mention on the $50 tier, you get three books per month. So, you do $50, you get book eleven, zero and one. All these books will be autographed, personally.
And also, this marks a very special notation, this book finally being completed, [picks up another binder, presumably Sonichu 10] 'cause, not only was it a long time coming, but it's definitely gonna be the first Sonichu book completed since #10, on, [reads the binder, then holds it up to the camera] quote, February 24th, 2010. So many years of depression I've had upon myself and self-revelation throughout, I never stopped creating and remembering the details within for the future pieces.
[sets down the second binder] So, along with that, we're def- I definitely wanna thank everybody that I can't specifically name names, 'cause that's a long list, but everybody who donated will be mentioned at the end of book 11, probably be about two to four pages.
Anyway, now would be a good time to pledge, so, on uploading this video, as it's being streamed right now, there will be a link in the description below, to my Patreon page, so... after you are able to see this video, go down to the - pl- pledge the thing though, and pledge at least $20. You'll be among the first to get [taps the book in his hand] long time coming... the Christmas story. [childish voice] Even the bananasaur! And part one of the clip show. [holds out his arms and speaks with a high pitch] The clip show! Though, not actually using previous comic book clips, new stuff. Totally new stuff. Including Sonichu and Rosechu's wedding, as part of it.
So that's it for now, so, I don't think I need to repeat myself. You can press rewind. Y'all have a great, safe day. Thank you, everyone.
