Chris in January 2012.
Chris's Mii.
January was the first month of 2012, beginning the new year with relatively little action. Following the events of 28 October 2011, Chris and Barb attended a hearing, only for it to be postponed until April. That, and another fat guy jiggled his belly on camera in response to Chris's Calling Out videos. In the second half of the month, however, Chris started to post regularly on Facebook, which he would continue to do without interruption for the next four years.
