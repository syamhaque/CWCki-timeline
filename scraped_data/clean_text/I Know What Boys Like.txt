================================================================================

"I Know What Boys Like" is the second track from SPARKLE like you mean it: ROBEE'S BALLAD by Robee Sonee and the Tomgirls. It is a cover of the song "I Know What Boys Like" by The Waitresses.
As per Chris's usual brand of laziness, the original song played under his "singing" is pitched up to PAL levels rather than the song's normal pitch. Also, he replaces all mention of boys with "girls" or "gals". That said, he does actually do a better job of singing this song compared to his other efforts, though is is mainly because the original song is sung in a deadpan, carefree manner.

Lyrics
I know what girls like,
I know what gals want,
I know what girls like,
I've got what girls like.
Ah- [hums, realizes no lyrics are sung here].
I know what girls like,
I know what gals want.
I see them lookin'
Ahh, uhh...
I make them want me,
I like to tease them,
I thu-they wanna touch me,
They never let them.
I know what girls like,
I know what gals want.
I know what girls like,
Girls like... girls like me.
[starts late] -but you are special...
[Chris skips the line "I might let you"]
You're so much different!...
[...and again]
Oooh wouldya like that?...
[...and yet again]
I know what girls like,
I know what gals want.
I know what girls like,
I know what's on their minds.
I know what girls like,
I know what gals want.
They talk about me.
I got my cat moves,
That so upsets them,
Zippers and buttons,
Fun to frustrate them.
They get so angry,
Like pouty children,
Thennn neither can be,
I laugh right at them,
[late] -I know what girls like,
I know what gals want,
I know what girls like,
Girls like... girls like me.
[brief interlude]
La la la laa laaa,
La la la laa LAH [fumbles microphone]
I see you're sad now,
[skips "I will let you"]
Emsorry I teeeeased you,
[skips "I will let you"]
This time I mean it,
[skips "I will let you"]
Anything you want,
[skips "You can trust me"]
I really want to.
[skips "You can trust me"]
Ahwould you like it,
Sssweetie!
I know what girls like,
I got what gals want.
I know what girls like,
Girls like... girls like me.
LA LA LA LAA LAAH,
LA LA LA LAA LAWW.
LA LA LA LAA LAAH,
LA LA LA LAA LAAW.
[Lowers voice to imitate song fade out]
La la la laa laah,
La la la laa laaw. [fumbles mic again]
