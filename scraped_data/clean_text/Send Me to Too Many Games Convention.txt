Send Me to Too Many Games Convention! was uploaded on 13 June 2018. Chris begs for $400 to afford a trip to TooManyGames. The GoFundMe campaign he linked to closed with only $120 raised; he attended nevertheless.
Notably, Chris cannot contain his excitement in this video; the pitch in his voice skyrockets, expressions in his face contort wildly and inappropriately, and he overeagerly shakes his fist.

Hey everybody, this is Christine Chandler coming to you live from home once again, and today I'm here to make an announcement. Who wants to help me go to a gaming convention in Pennsylvania? "Too Many Games"! [excited, childish, somewhat endearing chuckle] I really wanna go… I've been invited… I need the money though. Gas… hotel… I need help a little here. So I set up a GoFundMe! Help me achieve a goal of four hundred dollars to pay for everything I nee‑eed! You can see me… in a couple weekends: the weekend after this coming one! Yeah! Now help me reach the goal of four hundred dollars by this weekend to make it a real guarantee to see me in Pennsylvania! [Pause and a stare] Thank you all so much and have an awesome, terrific day. Yaay!
