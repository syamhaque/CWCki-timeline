Summary
This chat takes place between takes 1 and 2 of Captain's Log, Stardate February 5th, 2009. Clyde is unimpressed by the first video, in which Chris calls himself a "gaybian". Chris claims that the term means gay but Clyde doesn't buy it. Chris owns up to the fact that his half-assed first attempt is an "inferior product." As usual, Chris is too inconsiderate to turn down his radio.

Chris: [sigh] Hello, Clyde. So, you saw the video?
Clyde: What video?
Chris: The one I uploaded.
Clyde: Oh. I should probably watch that.
Chris: You probably... oh, yeah, there ya go, Julie.
Clyde: Chris, I gotta perform rites. I gotta perform rites.
[Clyde begins chanting]
Julie: Chris, though, I think you should stay in here though, just to be sure... [cut off by background noise]
[Chris leaves, a troll laughs, Chris returns]
Chris: Er, I put him on my lap, just how I was, like how I was on that principal's lap.
Clyde: I said Optimus Prime, you know... "Transformers roll out."
Chris: [sigh] I... look, I just... I used- I- It was an action figure, I put it on my lap just like I was on the lap of that principal, awright? Now watch the video.
Clyde: Whoa, man, I didn't know you wanted to do it with Optimus Prime. I mean...
Chris: [sigh]
Clyde: I didn't tell you to have sex with Optimus Prime, if that's what you're saying, so...
Chris: [sigh]
Clyde: What is this... what is this gaybian stuff? That's not a word! It's not even a word!
Chris: Mmm... well, it's like...
Julie: Clyde, you're gonna leave me alone now, right?
Clyde: No. Of course not.
Chris: [extreme sigh]
Julie: But that's what you said?
Clyde: What's a gaybian?
Chris: Yeah, you said you were gonna leave her alone... I said, uhh...
Clyde: Ok, Chris. What is a gaybian? I have never heard this word in my life!
Chris: [exhales deeply] It's like, it's like, uh, a lesbian except, except, for, it's like guy and guy. [voice cracks] But basically it means gay.
Clyde: No, it means you're straight!
Chris: Well, if you don't like it, I can redo the vid- I can redo it.
Clyde: Go ahead. But, if you're going to do things like this, come on, man! You don't know how to keep a promise, do you?
Chris: [sigh] Well, I did. I said, "gaaaaaaay."
Clyde: -bian, at the end. We all heard it. We're not deaf. Except, I'm half deaf, but that is not the point.
Chris: Awright.
Clyde: The point is a person can hear things, a person can see things... [muffled by background noise]
Chris: Ok, I accept that. I made an inferior product. I'll prove... I'll uh, improve it, if they'll, if you'll, if uh, what hel- if it will, if you will, if you'll give me a bit of, if you will... [sigh] If you'll leave Julie, if you'll leave Julie- if you'll leave her alone.
Clyde: Man, you sure look centered. Alright, I'll leave her alone. But I'm gonna send her some chocolates, ok? Is that ok?
Chris: Uh, Julie, is that ok with you if, uh, he sends you chocolates?
Julie: Um... ok?
Clyde: And I'll send you some flowers.
Julie: Ok. Why?
Clyde: Because I'm hitting on you. Come on, you are dense, woman.
Julie: Yes, but why? Why would you hit on me?
Clyde: Because you're good-looking. Man, you are a damn good-looking woman, you know that, right?
Chris: [sigh]
Julie: But, I, I like, I was...
