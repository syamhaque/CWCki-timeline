OkCupid determines match rankings between its users by asking them a series of questions, and determining how they answer. These questions are randomly assigned, and can be answered whenever the user feels like it. The user can select a single answer for themselves, and multiple answers that he or she would be okay with potential matches picking. The user can also choose to add a brief personal comment to an answered question. Chris has answered hundreds of questions over the years on his various profiles.

Due to the tireless efforts of Clyde Cash we have obtained archives of many of Chris's answers submitted for his second OkCupid profile in 2009. As is the norm with Chris, the answers range from completely Honest, to untrue things that he genuinely believes, to complete lies that he thinks girls want to hear.
Chris's personal answers are underlined, and answers he would like girls to pick are in green. There is considerable overlap between the two.
