[Sorbet tries to get away from Chris while crickets chirp and "Womanizer" by Britney Spears is being played in the background]
[Chris mumbles before speaking in a childish, sing-songy voice] Hey, Sorbet...breathing okay? [Sorbet coughs] No...sounds like you're breathing through your mouth.
Oh baby, mmm... you're not breathing through your mouth right now, you were though. Hope everybody's able to hear this... [Sorbet meows, probably wanting to get away from Chris, but Chris meows back at Sorbet] Yeah baby...
[Sorbet sneezes] Aw, bless you... that might be cute though... [Sorbet meows again while trying to escape Chris's grasp] Okay, I will let you go then. [Chris puts the camera down, briefly capturing a blurry image of his desk with pages of Sonichu 12]
