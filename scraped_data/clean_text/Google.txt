Chris with his Silver Play Button
YouTube, founded in 2005 and acquired by Google in 2006, was Chris's primary platform for posting content starting in 2007 with his Sonichu account. Chris would go on to make 9 other accounts and would eventually settle on the channel CwcvilleGuardian. YouTube remained his main outlet until 2017, when his activity decreased as he shifted focus to Twitter. He occasionally uploaded videos until his arrest in 2021, after which he didn’t post online again until his release from Central Virginia Regional Jail in March 2023. On 16 October 2023, Chris returned to posting on videos onto YouTube and continues to stream himself playing video games.
Google Drive
Chris has occasionally uploaded videos to his Google Drive for privately sharing.
On 9 March 2018, Chris recorded the Tour of Chris's House III video for the Idea Guys. A portion of the video was leaked by the Teen Troon Squad on 11 December 2018, which they were able to acquire since Chris did not delete the file.[1] Two years later, on 11 August 2020, the Watchmen member Klop posted both the full video and the original Google Drive link to it,[2] showing Chris had still not deleted the file. Eventually, the file was deleted from the Drive.
On 6 August 2020, Chris recorded a video on his Last Will and Testament and uploaded to his Drive account. The video link was later leaked by Naught to the CWCki.
Google Hangout
Google Hangouts, a now-discontinued Google service for online chatting similar to Discord or Skype, was used by Chris on two occasions: on 20 July 2020, to communicate with the Watchmen, and again on 28 August 2020 for a Q&A.

Dustin was very professional and prepared with the right tools.
