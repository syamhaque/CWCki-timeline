This article, like Chris's pickle, is a bit small. You can help CWCki by expanding it.
Figure Painting is a series of three videos, uploaded on 22 November 2023, where Chris paints a Sonichu custom Amiibo. Notably, this gives us new footage of Chris's current housing, which appears to be as cluttered with trinkets and toys as 14 Branchland Court.
Despite the fact that he completed at least one during the course of these videos, they were only put up on sale on 31 March 2024.
