Amount Chris got from Patreon in January.
C-Log 01312018 - Selling my Older Pokémon Cards for my mother’s teeth is a 16-minute video of Chris begging fans to buy his old Pokémon cards, allegedly for Barb's dental bills. Ironically, the video was made shortly after Chris's Patreon had hit its peak of $820 in donations[1].
Chris's priorities.
Chris's Dark Arbok "memory card" he received on 9/11.
Notably, only three days prior, Chris was photographed at The End Games with his haul of new Pokémon cards.
On Facebook, Chris's Pokemon club friend Alexa P., who had attempted to give him advice on finding work through Virginia's DARS program in the past, posted:
Hey Christine! How much are you selling your cards for?
Buyers purchased the $150 and $200 sets on the same day the video was uploaded. Also on the same day, Chris purchased a video game, Blast Juggler for the PS1.
"Cabal Coffers", a trading card buyer and distributor, offered to buy the third for $500 on 3 February. According to Cabal, Chris had initially declined, but accepted within the same 24 hours. After receiving the binder, Cabal uploaded an unboxing video. The binder was shipped in a box with no packaging, allowing the binder full of valuable cards to slide around freely. Cabal used gloves to protect his health and the quality of the cards while perusing the binder. He proceeded to sanitize the entire binder page-by-page on camera. He found hair, original Chris art, E-mail printouts, and Pokemon deck lists in the process. Cabal appraised the binder page-by-page on his website. In doing this, he found several Memory Cards, which apparently held sentimental value for Chris. Cabal expects to sell these over several years for a combined potential profit of $3.5-4K. He also released scans of the original Chris art, Memory Cards, and Custom Checklist Cards.
Cabal was banned from Kiwi Farms 20 days after he purchased the collection.[2] This ban could have come from Null himself, who at the time was growing increasingly hostile towards anyone interacting with Chris.

Intro (0:00-0:39)
'ello everybody, this is Christine Chandler coming to you live from home once again, Captain's Log: Stardate 01312018, haha! Yes, and uh... before we begin with this I would like to give a special shout-out, and appreciation to Bryanfrogboy on Twitter for... the, s- Chris-Chan Prologue comic book. Eh, we're gonna try an- I'm working with him, we're gonna try and get a few copies of that book going around. Personally doing that, I'm giv- it's the okay, though with the stor--the details are a bit off here and there, it's still very good.
Explanation of the sale (0:39-1:34)
Anyway, this video, uh aside from that is about... in particular, my collec--my collection of old Pokémon cards. I am literally going to be selling these, on eBay, and I'm pretty much showing you all what you get, here. I'll be listing both listings in the- underneath this video... after I get 'em up so, firstly you're definitely gonna get all the artwork that I have originally drawn throughout these p-throughout these pages and what-not, and... even the... huh, things I put together. Er, making a short card list. It goes all the way up to legendary collection in this book, all the way up to legendary, so you... you know there's... it's a random collection, but anyway. Uh, there's duplicates, so be aware of that.
Showing the goods (1:34-6:01)
I'm just gonna thumb through this uh, so you can see everybody and, you can prove definitely that these are the real deal. 'Cause the text is right; I pulled out a double from right behind it, there ya go. Anyway, so it of course... personally verified they are non-transparent. But we got a little chip in that one, but that's just because the foil. [in a high-pitched voice:] It's old! It's an old card, but it's cool. Anyway, so I'm just gonna thumb through this and you'll get to see what you get. You get more than one-hundred fifty or so cards... you're never gonna fi- you're never gonna find these elsewhere and you're gonna get plenty of bang for your buck not only because of of the cards but because of the bonus content that is mine and mine alone, between these and... there's some places where there's more than one double but that's right- that's my- 'here in the back there, anyway these organized all alphabetically. [under breath] That's a legendary Charizard but that's on the next page. That's on the next page, yay!
Yup. [singing to self] Do do-do do-do do do do-do do. By the way, you can get, um, non-holographic Charizard was in legendary collection, in the base set, haha. Hm, do do-do. Uh yeah, just now y'get- hm- doubles in the back. And just, giving y'all, uh... feel free to pause at any time, or if you feel like, you need to catch up... but you're definitely gettin' bang for you're buck for... this big binder. Full of... I'd say like, more than a hundred-fifty cards definitely, I promise you that, more than a hundred-fifty cards, the old sets. Help you complete your collection though. You know I had completed the base set at one time or another, but obviously, I traded some cards away and had to sell a few before but, not I'm selling the whole lot of my remainder.
[Flips through some nice looking base set cards]
[singing to self] Da dee-dee dee dee dee da doh.
And there's Southern Island in here, too! Because, y'know how rare those are! They came in that one thing! That one binder.
[singing to self] De-de dee-dee-dee
The one set with all the lovely postcards.
[Continues flipping through the card folder.]
And I lost the post cards some time ago, so s- I'm sorry.
[Makes some Pokemon-like noises] muh- muh- hurme! Hurme! Muh- Bwedwoom!
[singing to self] Ai- de-dee de dee- de-dee-dee~ Anama da- daa da- da- da. De-dee de dee- de-dee-de-
[Stops on some copies of Mewtwo] Hey Mewtwo! Whatcha know?
Mewtwo: Oh! I'm keeping my mind in good shape. Very good shape!
[Continues flipping through the cards]
Chris: [singing to self] da-da-da da- daa da- da- daa~
[Sees the Japanese Pokemon card back on the next page] Oh! We got a Japanese one right there, I wonder what it is...
[Turns the page to reveal it is a Japanese Pichu] [High voice:] Hey Pichu! I had an American one in front of that some time ago. I think I... traded it off, or sold it. [High voice:] Anyway.
[singing to self] Dee- de-dee de dee- de-dee-dee dee~ Alda dada dee- deei Lil' Pump, [Many more noises]
[Still flipping through the card binder, it's all in base set order, but there are cards from other sets too.]

Lots of bonuses in this minder, definitely. [Closes the binder and moves it to the side]
Conclusion for first binder (8:06-8:33)
Anyway that's one listing, [Brings it back an and slaps it to emphasise the deals] you get a bang for your buck with this binder. And you get all the... pa- all the pages, all the sleeves, everything you see, in this video, Oh! I've gotta show you the back! Because there's something on the back, bloop!
[Turns the binder over to reveal a cutout of the Neo Revelation poster, featuring the generation II legendaries, Entei, Raikou and Suicune]
I think that came from a poster... Anyway... ye. That's fine.
[More singing]
Showing the second binder (8:33-12:24)
N'alright, then, the other listing is for, the Promos! Is there anything on the back of that? No... Back's blank, used- ha- y'once again, oh, that's a classic Pokemon league sticker! [These stickers were specific to Virginia and were given out at Pokemon league games from 6 January 2001 to October 2001. more info] Oh, that capsile- caught some scratches on that that now and then naa.
Hm, old days, how fun.
[Opens the binder the first page, which is a hand drawn promo set cover] Hm, anyways, here's this drawing, look at that, I drew that. I need to sign it, I should sign it. I'm gonna sign it.
[Signs the cover on video] There ya go.
[Turns to the first page which has a lot of Pikachu promos in it] Yep, and also the complete... bi-lingual... multi-lingual Piquachu set with all the... lightning tail stamps on each of them.
Plippity, plippity, blooty-looo,
Plippity, plippity, moo!
And, Sabrina's Abra, you know how rare that is. [This is an extremely rare card estimated to be $35 as of August 2020 (note it is a black star promo), but Chris is bending it and it's sad] It's very rare- very rare, look at that... boop, there's only one!

Silly song, that I made up, silly thing, all that- all that! Zoop! Zoop.
That's fine, we're having fun! We like fun! YAAAY! Oh look! From the Pokemon Trading Card video game! Yay!
[Shows the promo Venasaur that was released to promote the Pokemon Trading Card video game for Gameboy] It's, and over-powered Venasaur. Yay!
Echt- um- peedly pum pum, pum- pum peedly pum!
Eyum pum pum pee ya paa- pum pum peya pum!
Epa ya pee pa puuum, ra pa pum padum.
Ra pum pum pum- you're a winner! You're a winner, YAY! [Chris won these Multi Energy cards at Pokemon TCG tournaments, most likely at ones hosted in The GAMe PLACe. Don't worry, Chris will notify you if these come up again further into the binder.]
Yip pa du pa du pa da, dupa dupa dup.
And, extras back here... extraas... shurti... WINNNER! And, Bondeses, I'm keeping one for myself, but... hey, do you remember this thing? Huh? You remember this thing, hm? Whoop, whoop, YAY! [Folds promotional card to reveal more information] Yay! [Folds more] Yay! [Folds back to normal] Yay! There's the one right there! Or is there more than one? I'm not sure... yeah, it's just the one. Totally unfolded. Never been used.
Bonuses, bonuses, BONUSES!
Bonus, bonus, monus.
Many many bonus. Good bonus.
And, this... is your Pokeball! For some reason, on the back of the thing, zip! Anyway.
Chris's first Pokemon card (12:24-16:19)
[Closes the promo binder and slaps it] Very few booked for this listing, too!
And also, special bonus, because I'm feeling generous to share, at least visually as, oh, I do have it nearby, ributetuh. There is is.
[Shows a Base set Charmeleon] There's my very first Pokemon card, Base set Charmeleon, and do you know where I got this card from?
[Drops something] Then I drop something [Blows a raspberry in exasperation] I literally got it from this Nintendo Power magazine! And look! It even has my address on there, from when I lived there! A long, long time ago! In a galaxy far, far away! I'm thinking about adding this to a listing, and this, as well, for it's own listing and... I can sign it, here, watch me sign it right now. Alright?
[Heavily devalues the magazine by signing it] Now this guy's gonna need a dental job, he's gonna have to have his teeth cleaned! Uh, speaking of that, pfff, this listing is definitely going to help restore my mother's teeth, she still has, lots of problems with that. Anyway, yep, right here, this page, eh, all this, right here, and, Charmeleon was... right there! [Places Charmeleon promo where it was when Chris received the magazine]
Yaay! Separate listing... this is it! This is my very first card ever! I personally documented it. And I definitely personally documented it, on... the card that's in here, [Reveals that also in the sleeve is a documentation of the event on a blank card]
See, there we go. "I got my very first Pokemon card from the February 1999 Nintendo Power issue. YAY! Number 1 card."
[NOTE: This was actually the March 1999 issue, not February 1999]
Hmmm, better sign this, too! This is my personal, authentication that this, I personally verify, is the very first Pokemon card I have ever... aquired.
Pff, behave, behave! Behave. whool- whool whool whool pllp pllp. Pllp pllp pllp pllp. Maah!
[Signs the card] I'm signing my old name, because... that's the way it was, back- waaaay back then. Well, it's difficult holding a, small card with a pinkie, and the phone with one hand, and the pen in the other. My pen, my pen, my pen, it works.
[Shows off his pen] This thing is detachable... that thing is detachable by tape, and I can attach it to, the pen cap. When I'm using it.
Do- do- do- do- do- do.
Anyway, um, put it all back in there, oh! On the back of that, zoop!
[Shows that the blank card has CWC and a drawing of Sonichu on the back]
Yep! No rival! Put that in there... Put this in there... Yay! Anyway, this will be a separate listing because, it is all that special! This card has seen a few playthroughs, along with my very first base set Charizard! In that one deck. So that will be a separate listing. Anyway...
Outro (16:19-16:40)
[Turns the camera back around to face him] Alright, so that's it for now! In a little while, I'll probably do a dance video, because that was a paid request, but, I have so many things... obligations to take care of right now, believe it or not. It's true, alright? But, so, y'all have a great and safe day! Keep a happy thought!
