================================================================================

"I'm Sexy For My Ivy" is Christian and the Hedgehog Boys's version of Justin Timberlake's "SexyBack", and is (thankfully) the last track from Christian and the Hedgehog Boys COMEBACK!.
This is standard fare from Chris, the new lyrics frequently break the rhyming scheme of the original and are sung out of time. He also inconsistently uses some of the original lines, causing much of the song to make no sense.

Lyrics
[sung over Justin Timberlake's "SexyBack"]
I'm sexy for you gal
Them other girls don't make your cut
I think it's awesome what'cha got for me
So turn around and fix my messed up clock
Sweetest Ivy
You see these shackles Ivy - I'm your slave!
I'll let you whip me if I misbehave
It's just that no-one makes me feel this way
Go ahead - be your sweet self!
Go ahead - be your fun self!
Go ahead - be your sweet self!
Go ahead - be your fun self!
Go ahead - be your sweet self!
Go ahead - be your fun self!
Go ahead - be your sweet self!

Go ahead - be your fun self!
Go ahead - be your sweet self!
Go ahead - be your fun self!
Go ahead - be your sweet self!
Go ahead - be your fun self!
I'm sexy for you gal
Them other girls don't make your cut
Come make me interest you with my harvest
'Cos you turn me on with your sweetest little self
Sweetest Ivy
You see these shackles Ivy - I'm your slave!
I'll let you whip me if I misbehave
It's just that no-one makes me feel this way
Go ahead - be your sweet self!
Go ahead - be your fun self!
Go ahead - be your sweet self!
Go ahead - be your fun self!
Go ahead - be your sweet self!

Them other girls will stay farthest away
You girls are smart and use me so right
Our love remains right and true and that's a fact
Go ahead - be your sweet self!
Go ahead - be your fun self!
Go ahead - be your sweet self!
Go ahead - be your fun self!
