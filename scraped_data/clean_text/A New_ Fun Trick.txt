================================================================================

A New, Fun Trick! is a video Chris uploaded to YouTube on 30 August 2017. In it, Chris showcases his ability to "roll" his 'r's. In reality, instead of doing a proper alveolar trill (the actual rolled 'r'), Chris only manages to pull off a series of retroflex flaps and approximants with his tongue, making a strange gurgling sound, which has been compared to the gobbling of a turkey, in the process.
Of note is how Chris randomly brings up Planet Dolan at one point of the video. It is unknown if this is a product of Chris' random-access humor, or if it is meant to have rather strange implications.

[video starts with Chris staring at the camera]
Hello everyone, this is Christine Chandler coming to you live from home once again with a special brand new skill I just figured out! Yes! For I am ze kind and compassionate Chr-r-r-r-r-ristine Chandler. And now I can r-r-r-r-r-r-oll my r’s. I am still in pr-r-r-r-r-actice. So everybody is honored to be r-r-r-r-r-olling in the b-r-r-r-r-ass, for I am not Danger Dolan, the cr-r-r-r-eator of the z-s-s-uper Planet Dolan videos. But, I am powerful nonetheless and not since. Not great and powerful, I am kind and compassionate. Chr-r-r-r-r-istine Chandler. Now everyone stay green and go out and zap to the extr-r-r-r-r-eme. Have a lovely day.
