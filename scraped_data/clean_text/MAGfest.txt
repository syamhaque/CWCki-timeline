2011
Chris wanted to go during 2011, thinking he could hook up with a friend's cousin while there. However, he failed to budget money and could not afford a room.[1] When he told his parents of the dilemma, and his potential solution of sleeping in the hotel lobby or car, they forbade him from going, citing cold weather and the high crime rate, and threatened to lock him out of the house if he went. Chris tried to manipulate them with an "Autistic Treatment" (ignoring them during a family dinner) at Country Cookin', but later at home his mother threatened suicide to manipulate him into feeling guilty enough to cancel his ill-conceived plans. Altogether, Chris lost $40 from preregistration.[2]
2018
Schedule for the CWC panel. Yes, really.[3]
Chris' interest in going during 2018 was apparently piqued in December 2017 when Marvin informed him that there would be a CWC-themed panel.[4] On arrival, Chris was met by a small group of fans who ended up cheering him on, as well as recording a selection of his trademark antics.
Several people sought him out for photos.
A video was posted of Chris posing with CWC fan Spinalpalm (although shot from another phone).

Chris showed appreciation for his fans on social media after the event. On Facebook, he posted:
I Love Every One Of You All (including all of those who could not make it, But were there in thought and spirit. The MAGFest Panel Of January 7, 2018, 1:30 AM: The Christory Of Sonichu.
This felt more awesome than a simple Birthday Party, and it was not even my Birthday yet (not until February 24).
Michael J. Hirtes is upset about Chris having fun at MAGfest.
On Twitter, he said, in response to a Tao of Maud message (Let your hopes rather than your hurts shape your future):
Commemorated on a TSSSF card
So true! Especially when that Hope and Love comes truly from a Lot Of Kind People. I Love All of my People, Family and Friends! Thank You All for appreciating me. 🤘😊❤️
He posted a panoramic video of the crowd.

Emily, who was in attendance, gave her field report:
I came here to find out if Chris got his dick sucked or nah (story shortly).
So the panel was created to definitely be a huge mockery of Chris. Chris wasn't invited as far as I'm aware of, and only decided to come because he got wind of it. It was more or less of a surprise to the people running the panel when they found out he was there. They definitely glossed over a lot of their slides and made it seem more positive. They stopped shortly before the end of the slideshow to have Chris talk.
A lot of the shit they said was wrong, even simple stuff like "he got fired from Burger King." Apparently their biggest source wasn't even the CWCkipedia, but random videos of other people talking about him or interviews, which is just lazy but pretty funny.
Story time. So after Chris spoke and was heading back to his seat in the back, he was highfiving people. This one girl got a highfive and a hug from him and basically just shrieked with happiness. She shook her hand at her friend yelling about how Chris touched her hand and wouldn't let anything touch that hand. And kept going on and on about how Chris touched her and was overjoyed by it to the point that I actually thought this girl was going to go find him to suck his dick. She wasn't even a fat or unattractive girl either so idk.[9]
This moment was captured in the "Adulation" video above.
The Man in the Pickle Suit also provided a report:
Heh, so, what everyone seems to be wondering: does Chris smell? No. At least, there isn't like some miasma cloud hanging around him. I was pretty close to him, but I obviously didn't stick my nose in his shirt or anything. So if he's got a smell, you definitely won't notice anything just casually hanging around him, and even if you really are determined to get a whiff, it's probably not that strong. (It helps that it's the winter, and so he's not hustling around in the heat.)
No perfume or axe this time either.[10]
The Aftermath
After the panel, a pack of fans asked for more pictures and a few snagged video clips.

With the panel creator.
"Btw contrary to assertions on Kiwi Farms, I found CWC to actually smell surprisingly pleasant"
I AM STILL IN ABSOLUTE AWE THANK YOU @CWCSonichu

On Twitter, Chris followed and tweeted to some of them[11].
“
Anybody ever want to know how strong SpinalPalm is, he can bear hug and Lift me up high without a sweat; more than 212 pounds.
@Spinalpalm is a really strong dude.
Awesome!

And afterwards, I drank a Sonic the Hedgehog Energy Drink from the Merchandise booths, signed the empty can with her sharpie marker, and gave her the can. Thank you for your Love and Awesomeness, @PeachSaliva ! ❤️

2019
Despite the success of his 2018 visit, Chris skipped the 2019 con (3-6 January 2019), in part due to the Dimensional Merge.[12]
