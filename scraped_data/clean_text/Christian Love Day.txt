================================================================================

Magi-Chan describes Failmas, and expresses his severe disappointment with a startling lack of accuracy.
Christian Love Day, or the 24th of February, is a proposed holiday mused upon by Chris, also being his birthday. It was first mentioned in the CWC blog entry of 7 January 2010. On the same day, it made an appearance in Sonichu #10, in which it is celebrated for Magi-Chan using a vaccine based on Chris's blood to eradicate homosexuality.
Significance
“
Upon reflection, February 24 SHOULD be a Holiday of sorts (even a Second Day for Love in addition to Valentine's Day), because the day, to me at least, just FEELS like a Holiday, in addition to it being my Birthday. I have looked it up before, and it is some sort of forgettable (Holi)day in Mexico or somewhere. February 24 Should have More Significance and Recognition like a Holiday.
”
Chris, in his CWC Blog for 7 January 2010
Chris bases the holiday not only on his horrifically misguided and disturbing Gay Holocaust but grants it full significance for being his birthday. Chris actually believes a milestone date in his amateur webcomic should be celebrated worldwide, because he "feels" like it should, especially since it "feels" like a holiday to him, neglecting that everyone tends to view their own birthday as a holiday. He attempts to mask this fact with ill-researched hearsay. The "forgettable" holiday occurring on the 24th is Mexican Flag Day, celebrated at most with a flag ceremony in elementary schools and maybe a short lecture on the history of the Mexican flag. This is notable for being both a minor and momentous holiday, doubly defeating Chris's point. On a historical note, it was also the same day the Nazi Party was founded in 1920. Additionally, it is also the day that the Russian invasion of Ukraine began in 2022, coinciding with Chris's 40th birthday.
Interesting to note is the celebration of a "man"(child) giving his "blood" to "save" the population of the Earth from "damnation". Chris thinks he's Jesus. Big surprise.
The Declaration
True and Original Declaration of the Christian Love Day. Note the buttocks Chris drew on his crotch.
“
Good morning. In less than an hour, Sonichu fans from here will join others from around the world as you will be witnessing the largest personal change in the history of mankind. Mankind...that word should have new meaning for us all today. We cannot be consumed by our petty differences anymore. We will be united in our common interests. Perhaps it is fate that today is Metsico's flllag day. And we will once again be saluting an image of our freedom. Not just from trolling, loneliness, or persecution, but also from heartbreak. We are fighting for our right to love, to be honest, and when the sun sets today, the twenty-fourth of February will no longer be known as only a Metsican holiday, but as today the Sonichu fans declared what wuv was. We will not go quietly into the night! We will not vanish without a fight! We are going to live on! We are going to survive, to celebr--today we celebrate our CHRISTIAN LOVE DAY!

Chris, totally not ripping off the movie Independence Day
Chris is so engrossed by the idea, that he went as far as making a video for the occasion, asking his army of fans to celebrate his hubris. To remove any doubt about the issue, he admitted to Alec Benson Leary that he believes he is important enough to celebrate his birthday across the country. On the other side, he denies ever writing the declaration, claiming a friend did it for him, and says he saw the movie Independence Day only once.
In the comic
As described in the events of the comics, on 24 February 2009 Magi-Chan completed his mission of distributing Chris's Gay Vaccine to the world, officially eradicating all homosexuality in a massive genocide. "Thanks to the blood of Christian Weston Chandler", all homosexuality and, in a stunning display of overkill, asexuality are eradicated. Chris uses this as an excuse for a second Valentine's Day late in the month. Presumably, the day will be celebrated with unabashed, BUT STRAIGHT, monkey sex.
