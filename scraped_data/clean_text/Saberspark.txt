You watch Scott Pilgrim Takes Off because you're a fan of the original comic and movie
I watch it because Chris Chan expects it of me
We are not the same

Stephen Carver, known by the username Saberspark (born 11 October 1988), is an American YouTuber who lives in Virginia and makes videos critiquing and discussing animation. Chris is a fan of his channel, knowing about him since at least September 2017,[2] and still watching his content as of March 2025.[3] CosmicKeyframe has also occasionally done video editing work for Saberspark.
Early Interactions
On 1 September 2017, Chris replied to Saberspark on Twitter saying he stays with traditional art rather than digital.
On 30 January 2019, Chris replied to Saberspark's tweet on Gaither's Pond.[4]
On 29 July 2020, Chris replied to Saberspark on Twitter, agreeing with him cutting ties with a YouTuber after they were exposed in a grooming scandal.[5]
On 16 October 2020, Chris, while roleplaying as Sonichu, discussed Saberspark and his videos at The Place, saying he has binged a number of his review videos, and said Saberspark is "a real good and funny card."[6]
On 24 November 2020, Chris asked Saberspark over Twitter if he has a favorite retort line from the cartoon character Pinky.[7]
On 7 March 2021, Chris told Saberspark over Twitter that he is glad to not be a premium subscriber to Disney Plus.[8]
On 18 November 2023, Chris gave his thoughts on Twitter about Scott Pilgrim Takes Off, mentioning that he is looking forward to Saberspark's thoughts and review on it.[9] Two days later, Saberspark tweeted that he was watching it because "Chris Chan expects it of [him]." Chris replied to the tweet the next day saying he just foreknew he would watch it because it was highly likely.[10]
On 17 January 2025, Chris posted to Bluesky, saying he agreed with Saberspark's recent video about AI content farms, and used some basic talking points against AI.[11]
On 28 March 2025, Chris posted to Bluesky, saying he agreed with Saberspark's video about a "brainrot problem" on YouTube.[12] In a livestream the next day, Chris read a subscribers' name, "Skibidicel", prompting him to mention Saberspark's video again.[13] Chris also mentioned brainrot a few other times during the stream.

Chris.[14]
On 1 May 2025, the Brony Celebrity ILoveKimPossibleAlot made and posted a video titled "What RUINED Saberspark and DAGames" onto YouTube, where she makes rape allegations against Saberspark, showing the alleged grooming of a young fan into a relationship between 2012 and 2013.[15] Chris posted the video on Bluesky, writing that "#Saberspark is not so Sabersmart."[16]
On 12 May, Saberspark posted a YouTube video denying the sexual assault allegations[17]. Chris made a response to the video on Twitter hours after it was posted.[14] In typical Chris fashion, he decided to make the drama about himself, despite what little role he played in it. He makes a warning that due to the drama they got involved in, Saber and KP could end up just like him. He compared the drama, which involved KP literally accusing Saber of sex-related crimes, to himself trying to give his ED page an "information overload" in an attempt to take it down.
On 19 May, Chris uploaded Grounded Deep Response, likely inspired by Saberspark's response video with a similar thumbnail. Chris also briefly mentions Saberspark in the video.
