The dimensional merge is upon us! It has been suggested that this article be merged with Sonichu Headquarters Google Intro Video. Discuss on the talk page.
PROTIP:
There is little point in adding a listing at 14 Branchland Court nowadays: not only it is weening, but Chris does not live there any more, and Google Maps has come under pressure over fake and fraudulent listings. However, don’t brag about removing the listing on Reddit or something, because that is also weening.
When Google approved the listing of 14 Branchland Court as Sonichu Headquarters a gaggle of weens swooped in and started flooding the listing with negative reviews, fake pictures, and suggested edits to the site listed and the type of place it's listed as. The most prominent changes involved suggesting the ED page as the website and that the place should be listed as a recycling center.
