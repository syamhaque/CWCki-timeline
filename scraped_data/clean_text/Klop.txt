Ties with CWCki Server and The Place
Klop created the Official CWCki Server on 1 July 2020. After the Last Will and Testament video was leaked by Naught on 6 August 2020, Klop investigated and was invited into Naught's The Place Discord server.[3] On 10 August, Naught began leaking a hoard of content in the CWCki Server that he had collected from Chris. Klop also participated by posting leaks onto Kiwi Farms.[3] Klop briefly gave moderator roles in CWCki Server to Naught and MKRNightVee, another member in The Place, as well as to Anaxis, who would later be invited into The Place and promoted to CWCki Server's owner.[4] The Watchmen, however, disliked the CWCki Server, believing its members to be irritating and ill-informed about Chris. These conditions inadvertently laid the groundwork for a future conflict between MKRNightVee and Anaxis, in which Chris sided with Anaxis.[5][6]
On 10 August 2020, Naught invited Chris himself into the CWCki Server. Prior to that, its staff had a plan that in the event Chris joined, he would be relegated to a separate channel and be locked off from typing in the rest of the server.[7] Klop also set up the server that in such an event, only certain users with a "True and Honest" role would have the ability to go into this specialized channel to talk to Chris and ask him questions. When Chris finally did join the server, the news spread quickly, which led to an influx of new users on the server, all of whom tried to interact with Chris in some way, be it trolling, asking questions, or just having a casual conversation. Chris only sent two messages during his time on the server, both of which related to the Dimensional Merge. Klop then opted to ban Chris from the server and attempted to set up cwc frens as an alternative.[8]
Role as Lainchu
On 7 August 2020, Naught transferred the role of Lainchu onto Klop for "reasons he could no longer recall".[9]
When he proposed the name "Watchmen" for the members in The Place server, in keeping with his role as Lainchu, Klop initially wanted to be called "Rorschach", a character from the Watchmen graphic novel who acted as a kind of chronicler.
cwc frens
“
In the last few days lots have happend [sic] in this server. Chris has joined this place for starters. This was met with mixed reception. The CWCki's goal is only to document Chris and not provide him a platform to push his agendas. It was never imagined that Chris will use this server to ramble about his fantasies. And due to this it has been decided to give Chris his own server where he may do as he pleases.
”
Klop's statement on Chris's banning.[8]
During Chris's stay on the server, and the influx of new users, Klop felt that Chris being in the server would be too cumbersome to handle, and went against the CWCki's initial goal in only documenting Chris and to not give him a platform to push his fantasies. To remedy this, Klop worked on a new server under the name "cwc frens", whose purpose was to separate Chris from the CWCki Discord server, and accommodate for the new members that were interested in communicating with Chris, allowing them to do so via interaction with the Watchmen. The server had a "mailbag" channel, similar to the Mailbag from the CWCipedia, which would be the precursor to the server CWC Questions, where the Discord Q&A took shape. Q&As 1 through 4 happened in this server and Klop, while roleplaying as Lainchu, participated in Q&As 2 and 3. Klop announced the cwc frens server on 14 August 2020 before completing it and right after he banned Chris, leading to the server being filled up with weens before Chris got the chance to join.
Retirement
When handling both servers became more hectic, Klop decided to transfer ownership of the CWCki server onto another mod, and gave ownership of the cwc frens server to Naught. He also wanted to abandon his role as Lainchu, transferring the role over to Anaxis on 29 August 2020. After Anaxis was booted from The Place server, the Watchmen that were still in the server tried to ask Klop if he wanted the role back, but he declined.[7]
Aftermath
While he has given up both his role as owner of the CWCki Server and as Lainchu, Klop was still in The Place and interacted with Chris on occasion.
On 8 September 2020, Klop asked Chris if he could post his Sonichu comics on Amazon, and also suggested the creation of a website for them. Kyle showed support for both ideas.[10]
Klop was also somewhat involved during the escalation of Crystalgate, insisting that Praetor was purposefully trying to creating some form of infighting, and noted when Naught left the server following Chris's confrontation with the Watchmen.[11]
