Chris in November 2020
November was the eleventh month of 2020. Joe Biden won the presidential 2020 election of the United States this month. Aside from that, Chris took an interest in Randy Stair, uploaded a video of himself criticizing a fanfiction, and recorded a few audio clips for Sonic World.
Highlights
2 November - While at Target, Chris buys a figurine of an XBox trophy, then recalls his high school graduation ceremony.[1]
3 November - The Election of the next President of the United States of America occurs, with Joe Biden challenging Donald Trump during his re-election bid. Virginia will also elect a Senator, and there will be a House seat in Virginia's 5th congressional district. Chris claims to have cast his presidential ballot for Lisa Simpson. Biden wins Virginia, while Mark Warner (D) is elected Senator and Bob Good (R) is elected to Congress. Due to the amount of time it takes to sort through the mail-in ballots, a winner is not declared on this night.
4 November
The WCT relays to other Watchmen that Chris had asked him to remove his documentaries on Thaddeus and Randy Stair from his old playlist "Comprehensive History Canon", and that WCT obliged Chris's request.[2]
Chris, while role-playing as Sonichu, has a daydream about Sonic.EXE, a creepypasta involving Sonic the Hedgehog, fantasizing that Sonic.EXE has attacked his dimension and that Chris-in-Sonichu's-body was rescued by Magi-Chan and is seeking refuge in California with The WCT and Naught. Chris, believing his fantasy, DMs both The WCT and Naught to tell them of it.[3]
