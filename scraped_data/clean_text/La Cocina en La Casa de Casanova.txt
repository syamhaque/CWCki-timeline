================================================================================

"La Cocina en La Casa de Casanova" ("The kitchen in Casanova's house") is the fifth track from Christian and the Hedgehog Boys. It is sung over "La copa de la vida", the Spanish version of Ricky Martin's "The Cup of Life."
More than anything else, this song demonstrates Chris's total mastery of Spanish, as well as the ability to count to three (if mispronounced) in French. The third "olé" in the second chorus is also one of the only times he matches a note in the entire album.
It should also be noted that the real-life Giacomo Casanova was Venetian, not Spanish; Chris probably mistook him for Spanish because his name resembles casa nueva, Spanish for "new house."
