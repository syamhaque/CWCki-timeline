22 February - After spilling paint on a few in-progress pages of Sonichu #14, Chris decides to cash in on the mistake by listing a set of them on eBay for $100. It sells out in 2 minutes.

27 February - Searching through the hoard for more junk to sell, Chris finds a package of 25 bootleg Pokémon LeafGreen/Emerald games from a concerned fan who mailed them to him years ago, and puts them up on eBay, where they quickly sell out.
