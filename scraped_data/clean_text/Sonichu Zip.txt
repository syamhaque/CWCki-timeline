================================================================================

"Sonichu Zip" is the second track from Christian and the Hedgehog Boys. It is sung over "Sonic Drive" by Hironobu Kageyama and Hideaki Takatori, the theme song to Sonic X in Japan.
This is arguably the most impenetrable of Chris's songs, if only because the non-stop Japanese yelling from the underlying track masks much of Chris's own "singing."

Lyrics
[sung over Hironobu Kageyama and Hideaki Takatori's "Sonic Drive"]
S-O-N-I-C-H-U!
S-O-N-I-C-H-U!
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Let's zip!
Born from energy
Of extreme power!
Go wild and free
At the speed of sound!
Y'all keep it together, yeah you do [??]
In Pokémon!
There is a girl! [?]
Rosechu!
Fighting with physical power!
Everybody shocks all villains! [?]
In a world with humans and Pokémon!
Hey, look! There’s Sonic the Hedgehog!
(Inside! Outside!) Zappin' together!
(Inside! Outside!) Let's zip!
No matter how you try,
He's uncatchable!
(Inside! Outside!) Go, Sonichu!
(Inside! Outside!) Zipping along, Yes, Sonichu!
Zappin' the villains when you are there! Yeah!
C’mon! You’re the greatest friend!
Conquer trouble!
Save you all, and zip away!
S-O-N-I-CHU!
S-O-N-I-CHU!
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Let's zip!
