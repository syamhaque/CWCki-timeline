This article is still yet to be completed due to stress. We get a lot of stressful torture in our lives that makes us crash into slumber. Given that inspiration is a big variable, and we may have been lacking of it, this article will be completed as soon as possible, at our own pace... HONEST! This article is missing the following:
• the stuff from "Dimension C-197 as Chris's version of Heaven" needs to be moved to the post-Idea guys section, the Pre-Idea guys section is missing this: Possibly more stuff. The Reincarnation section needs to be expanded with info from the jail letters and it needs a list of charaters/people Chris believes have been reincarnated.
“
For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God— not by works, so that no one can boast. For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.
”
Ephesians 2:8-10, on the place of good deeds in the Christian faith.
“
Like most people; our souls leave our bodies, we end up in Heaven or Hell depending on our deeds/misdeeds, and possibly Reincarnation.
”
Chris.[1]
The afterlife or life after death is a concept found in many religions where the essential part of a person's identity continues to exist after the death of their physical body.[2]

Understanding of the Afterlife
Pre-Idea Guys
While the idea of good deeds causing someone to go to Heaven and bad deeds sending them to Hell is a common one, most Protestant theology explicitly states that the salvation of one's soul is based completely on one's faith. Defying this, Chris has stated that one goes to Heaven or Hell based completely on personal actions. He thinks that he will go to heaven because he's done "a lot of good deeds". Likewise, he feels that homos are almost certainly bound to go to Hell, and need to become heterosexuals to "better their chances of going to Heaven". He has also stated numerous times that he feels various trolls are bound for Hell for making fun of people over the Internet. He has suggested that they commit suicide so that they might receive their eternal punishment faster. In Common Questions 9 Jan 2010, Thorg questioned Chris for threatening damnation against his Internet adversaries:
"You often attempt to scare your trolls by stating they will go to hell. Some of your trolls do not believe in hell, what do you have to say to them?"
To which Chris responded:
“
Firstly, it is NOT a "scare tactic", IT IS FACT. And second, I say "Well, Believe it or not. You are Not Dead Yet".
”
In Mailbag 55, a fan asked Chris the following.[3]
We all know that you are very religious, but I have a question to ask you. What do you think that Heaven and Hell are like? Do you think that in Heaven people wear flowing robe and fly around all day? Do you think that Hell is fiery and everyone there is being poked in the rear by Satan. I would just really love to hear your thoughts.
To which Chris replied that that's exactly what he thinks Heaven and Hell are like.
Further complicating Chris's ideas of the afterlife, he believes in ghosts, going so far as to claim that he might have seen one.[4]
In 2013, Chris commented that he had considered suicide, but "The only reasons I don't do it are my mother and my dogs, and that premature death leaves one in Limbo."[5] In reality, Limbo is, in some Roman Catholic views, a state that unbaptised infants were supposed to enter into when they died: happy, but excluded from God due to their original sin. Christian views on suicide and the fate of suicides in the afterlife is highly varied. His belief that suicide leads one to Limbo may stem from the South Park episode "Death", in which it is found that the grandfather of a minor character is spending eternity in limbo for having his grandson euthanize him.
In the eulogy Chris made for Patti, he wrote that "[Patti] has departed from our world here on earth to a doggy heaven [...] she will run free and play with all the other dogs who are already having fun up [in doggy heaven]."[6] This suggests that Chris believes that animals (or at least dogs) have an afterlife.
Post-Idea Guys
Under the Idea Guys's lingering influence, Chris believes that departed souls go to C-197, the fictional universe that includes CWCville, other misbegotten OCs and various media franchises' universes, which he believes objectively exist. He teaches that, upon death, one may merge with one's Sonichu counterpart there. Among those who have been depicted in their Sonichu form on the other side include disastrous German chancellor Adolf Hitler, serial killer and rapist Ted Bundy and Chris's late father, Bob Chandler. Only the truly wicked, such as Liquid Chris, are denied this in the hereafter: Satan instead burns their bodies in 'hell's lava pool', purges them of their memories and sends their oblivious souls to be reincarnated.[7]
Since the autumn of 2018, Chris has taught that we are living in the latter days. From a mixture of off-hand comments by comic artists and several weens foddering him with misinformation and dumb inside jokes, Chris thinks that beginning in November 2018, the real world (or 'Dimension 1218', as he calls it) is in the process of combining with C-197, in what he calls the Dimensional Merge. Chris has attributed miscellaneous events past and present, real and fictional, ranging from tragedies like the World Trade Centre's destruction to salad recalls,[8] to the impending Merge. Originally projected to be complete before New Year's 2019, Chris maintains still that the Merge is just about the corner. Chris foretells massive destruction heralding the Merge that will result in the deaths of about half the world's population, as well as half of the fictional characters from C-197. Naturally, Chris, being the goddess in charge of managing this brouhaha, will be spared: everyone else must take their chances. Survivors will be able to enjoy the company of their favorite cartoon characters in the flesh, as well as their deceased relatives transformed into Electric Hedgehog Pokémon.
Dimension C-197 as Chris's version of Heaven
Following the Idea Guys saga, which affirmed to Chris his dimension beliefs, Chris began to think of alternate dimension C-197 as Heaven. He stated that he believes his deceased pets have reincarnated as characters[9] and that his father is "alive again".[10] He also stated that Marvel writer Stan Lee's soul had merged with his C-197 counterpart.[11]
So sure was Chris in this that he even tried to console a woman whose father passed away by telling her that her father's soul had likely gone to C-197.[12]
Reincarnation
When you're a headmaster, the possibilities are endless
Chris has said that he's open to the idea of reincarnation, common in Hinduism and other Eastern religions. In 2009 he stated flatly that he believed in the concept,[13] but in 2014 he seemed more uncertain, writing “It is possible, but I'm not sure.”[4]. He has yet to offer any criteria for what might cause someone to be reincarnated. While reincarnation was and to some extent is still embraced by a few Christian sects, Chris has nothing to do with them and seems to have lifted the notion from somewhere else.
Chris has suggested that he is himself a reincarnation of various people. In Sonichu, Chris's fictional counterpart is the reincarnation of the ancient leader of the Cherokee Clan, though he does not appear to believe this about himself in real life. However, during the epilogue of Sonichu Episode 26, Chris mentions a real-world dream in which he discovered he had been a (true and honest) lesbian hippie who attended Woodstock in a recent past life. He credits this dream with his realization that he is a "female soul" and decision to identify as a transsexual as opposed to a cross-dresser, further calling the psychological validity of his gender identity into question. Besides his own reincarnation, Chris's explanation of what happened to Liquid Chris in the Sonichu canon mentions Liquid's soul being cleared of all memory of previous incarnations before being reincarnated, as what Chris considers an ironic punishment for someone who dared impersonate him.
Chris believes that in other dimensions, people have the innate ability to swap bodies with others, even inanimate robots.
In a jail letter direct to Eels and the Eggman, Chris claims that as the Messiah, he can reincarnate or "Respawn" infinitely many times, and retain memory of all prior lives. He states in another letter that only a few people besides him have an inate ability to reincarnate.
