Otaku King spotted Chris at Walmart and had a conversation with him, and began white-knighting for Chris soon after. Chris slowly began returning to the internet, starting with playing Pokemon GO and games on his PlayStation, notably changing his PSN description on the latter. He then began liking tweets on Twitter, some even addressing his return. His activity peaked when he uploaded a series of artworks to DeviantART, including ones about his return and belief that he's Jesus Christ reincarnated. Other art included pages for Sonichu 15, which has been renamed to Sonichu 0 HD. His review also took place, with his incest case file being updated to state that the charge has been "Dismissed".[3].
