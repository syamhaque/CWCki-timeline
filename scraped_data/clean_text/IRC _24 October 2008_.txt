[06:58] <@ChrisChanSonichu> nothing really.
[06:58] <Viral> i c
[06:58] <@ChrisChanSonichu> at the moment, that rumor is incorrect.
[06:58] <Viral> that's good, actually
[06:58] <@ChrisChanSonichu> and I did not care for that game's portrayl of Sonichu; it made him look fat.
[06:59] <Spankety> I think he looks cute ^_^
[06:59] <Haihai> Hm you're right I see it too now
[06:59] <peenpouncin> haha
[06:59] <peenpouncin> he does kinda look fat
[06:59] <Richter> and why is there some black guy with a jetpack
[06:59] <Haihai> That appears to be a jetpack jerkop
[06:59] <peenpouncin> ahh
[06:59] <Richter> Ahh
[06:59] <@ChrisChanSonichu> that is the correct assumption.
[06:59] <peenpouncin> what ar eyou doing up at 7am chris?
[07:00] <@ChrisChanSonichu> I had a lot of sleep beforehand.

[07:02] * Niski (~Niski@Rizon-3D0AA07D.elisa-laajakaista.fi) has joined #sonichu
[07:04] <Haihai> There have been rumors of a new hedgehog pokémon going to arrive in the next comic, do you want to share anything about that with us?
[07:04] <Spankety> do you ever fart on your feet? the bubbly ones feel really good on it
[07:05] <@ChrisChanSonichu> I think you are referring to Silvana Rosechu.
[07:05] <@ChrisChanSonichu> and no, I do not, Spankety; that's gross.
[07:07] <Spankety> are you going to do any updates soon?
[07:07] <peenpouncin> any new videos?
[07:07] <@ChrisChanSonichu> not at the moment, but maybe in the near future.
[07:07] * Guest (~Guest@Rizon-78AD0665.midco.net) has joined #sonichu
[07:07] * Guest is now known as Guest1
[07:07] * Guest1 is now known as TheTengu
[07:08] <Spankety> ...from SL?
[07:08] <TheTengu> I just beat Dead Space.
[07:08] <@ChrisChanSonichu> it depends on my IRL events.
[07:08] <@ChrisChanSonichu> Congratuations.
[07:08] <@ChrisChanSonichu> I have Resistance 2 Beta now.
[07:08] <TheTengu> How is it?
[07:08] <peenpouncin> did you play mother 3 chris?
[07:08] <Viral> is it good?
[07:08] <Spankety> Tengu are you from Second Life?... lol
[07:09] <TheTengu> lol nah
[07:09] <@PandaHalo> christian, i was thinking maybe, as part of the fan site, we could run a sonichu contest, where people can submit custom characters, and winner is randomly chosen and gets a guest spot in a comic? it would generate a lot of sonichu hype and stuff
[07:09] <@ChrisChanSonichu> I have not had a chance to play the Beta game yet.
[07:09] <@ChrisChanSonichu> that's an idea, Cassie.
[07:09] <Haihai> Yeah Sonichu could really use some more hype right now, so people will see who the true original creator is
[07:10] <Viral> come to think of, you participate in a lot of betas
[07:10] <Viral> must be the perks of being sponsored by sony, right?
[07:10] <Spankety> have you seen the latest screen shots of Jimmy Hill's new anime? Thoughts?
[07:10] <Haihai> I think Chris just has good connections :)
[07:10] <@ChrisChanSonichu> How About this, and I would be willing to approve it; Custom Chracters, Full Fan Comics (5 Pages Minimum), and general Fanart.
[07:10] <Richter> Who would watch anything from Jimmy Hill....seriously
[07:10] * ClanTog (~KeaneSixt@Rizon-77E9CB31.phlapa.east.verizon.net) Quit (Quit: [17:37] <+Melon_Ninja> for your own good, use only 1 hand to do the kneading, otherwise you'll just make an insane mess [17:37] <+Melon_Ninja> and yes, do)
[07:11] <@ChrisChanSonichu> and the Prize for the TOP 5, from MY hands only, a Sonichu Medal for each of the Top 5.
[07:11] <peenpouncin> :o
[07:11] <Haihai> Well most of your fans are young kids and they may not have the motivation to make a full fan comic... I don't know. But you're in charge ofcourse
[07:11] <Spankety> Chris I must thank you personally for saving my life from boredom
[07:12] <TheTengu> Jimmy Hill's still at it eh? (I've been gone for a week or so)
[07:12] <@ChrisChanSonichu> just ignore that Wabbit-Thief.
[07:12] <Viral> i bet jimmy will steal the contest idea too
[07:12] <Viral> he soooooo lacks creativity
[07:13] <Haihai> Like he does with everything :S
[07:13] <@PandaHalo> i hope somebody cuts off his penis
[07:13] <Viral> then he'd steal someone elses
[07:13] <Viral> gross
[07:13] <peenpouncin> Lol
[07:13] <Spankety> haha
[07:13] <TheTengu> lol
[07:13] <@PandaHalo> lol
[07:13] <@ChrisChanSonichu> I have not made any official announcements about the contest yet, but should it go into effect, I will post it on Sonichu.net, and on the Fan Site.
[07:13] <@ChrisChanSonichu> Me too, Cassie.
[07:14] <TheTengu> What's the status of the comic? Haven't heard much since the preview came out.
[07:14] <@ChrisChanSonichu> I hope he loses his duck.
[07:14] <Haihai> It's fun when you come in here Chris, and it's fun to be one of the first to know about new Sonichu news
[07:14] <@PandaHalo> its one of the perks of being true sonichu fans :)
[07:14] <@ChrisChanSonichu> I'm still working on the comic.
[07:14] <@ChrisChanSonichu> yep. :)
[07:14] <@PandaHalo> ChrisChanSonichu: we also have a bot in the channel now.. ^_^ will kick anyone from chat automagically if they write the word pickle or nigger or type in all caps
[07:15] <Haihai> That should keep those trolls out
[07:15] <@PandaHalo> if you have ops though (the @ next to your name) it wont kick you though
[07:15] <@ChrisChanSonichu> yep.
[07:15] <@ChrisChanSonichu> that's good.
[07:16] <Viral> let's hope those ED-trolls don't find a way to bypass this protection
[07:16] <Viral> that would be hell
[07:16] <@ChrisChanSonichu> I hear that.
[07:16] <Spankety> they aren't smart enough
[07:17] <Haihai> They get kicked and they'll think they got disconnected or something and wil just give up I think
[07:17] <@ChrisChanSonichu> let's change the subject; who here has enjoyed the Classic PSP TV ads with the pencil-drawn characters?
[07:17] <Spankety> the squirrels?
[07:17] <Viral> gotta check them on youtube, those never aired around here
[07:17] <@ChrisChanSonichu> The Squirrels, the one with the Mice and Dustball.
[07:17] <TheTengu> The squirrels were win
[07:17] <@ChrisChanSonichu> I'd Hit That!
[07:17] <Haihai> wat
[07:18] <peenpouncin> :o
[07:18] <@ChrisChanSonichu> "Daxter on PSP, I'd Hit That."
[07:18] <Spankety> the ghetto squirrels lol
[07:18] <Viral> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHB-92kSkCk those?
[07:18] <@ChrisChanSonichu> also, "Come out and Play." "I can't; I'm playing nut." "But there's Portable Nut." "WWWHHHHAAAAAAT?!" "Yeah, it's a nut you can play with outside!" "PSP, it's like a nut, you can play with outside."
[07:19] <Viral> lol
[07:19] <Richter> Ok I didn't know what you were talking about, but now I do
[07:19] <@ChrisChanSonichu> I've downloaded the classic Pencil-Character commercials from the PSP-ONLY website.
[07:19] <Richter> Those commercials are funny
[07:19] <@ChrisChanSonichu> of the US.
[07:19] <peenpouncin> good advertising, who doesn't want to play with nuts outside?
[07:19] <TheTengu> I saw them on tv a few times back when I had cable.
[07:19] <Spankety> I love nuts
[07:19] <@ChrisChanSonichu> hey, how about the "Mr. Goose" commercial featuring Dustball?
[07:20] <Spankety> especially jiggling them in my hand
[07:20] <@ChrisChanSonichu> "Mr. Goose, what's happening?" "SQUAK!"
[07:20] <Spankety> feels soooo gooood
[07:20] <TheTengu> Lol geese are an evil lot
[07:20] <@ChrisChanSonichu> Whatch it, Spankey Pig.
[07:20] <Viral> they sure are
[07:20] <@ChrisChanSonichu> I don't know about geese being evil.
[07:20] <TheTengu> You ever been chased by a goose Chris?
[07:20] <TheTengu> An angry one at that?
[07:20] <@ChrisChanSonichu> my family and I had pet geese.
[07:21] <TheTengu> My grandpa had a guard goose.

[07:21] * Guest is now known as Guest1
[07:21] <peenpouncin> lol
[07:21] <@ChrisChanSonichu> one of them was infatuated with my father.
[07:21] * PandaHalo was kicked by [^_^] (Requested (PandaHalo))
[07:21] <Viral> some geese can get mad for no reason
[07:21] <peenpouncin> o.o
[07:21] * PandaHalo (~Canda@Rizon-E22D879B.ip.adam.com.au) has joined #sonichu
[07:21] * [^_^] sets mode: +o PandaHalo
[07:21] <@ChrisChanSonichu> we ended up giving the geese away.
[07:21] <Viral> that's kinda scary when you're still a small kid and you just wanted to feed them
[07:21] <@ChrisChanSonichu> we had a total of 4
[07:21] <TheTengu> lol no geese dinner?
[07:21] <@ChrisChanSonichu> NO
[07:22] <Spankety> U
[07:23] <Haihai> I you could transform into Chris-chan in real life, and kick some 'behind' without anyone finding out it was you, would you do it?
[07:23] <Spankety> hellz yeah
[07:23] <@ChrisChanSonichu> I'd definitely go kick RickyRicardo123's teeth in.
[07:23] <Viral> that would be totally awesome
[07:23] <TheTengu> What would be the process? I imagine you wouldn't just go into a phone booth like Superman
[07:23] <@ChrisChanSonichu> as well as Jimmy Hill.
[07:24] <@ChrisChanSonichu> don't you read the comics?
[07:24] <@PandaHalo> he'd touch his medallion!
[07:24] <Haihai> I don't get it how you have so many enemies :S
[07:24] <@ChrisChanSonichu> the Transformation happens as drawn.
[07:24] <TheTengu> Ah right. Bit sleep deprived x.x
[07:24] <Viral> must be the jealousy
[07:25] <Viral> or boredom in some cases
[07:25] <@ChrisChanSonichu> actually, if you'd read the Comic 10 preview pages, it changes from the Medal to my High School Ring; the Power has been in there THE WHOLE TIME since March 17, 2000.
[07:25] <Haihai> So that ancient guy was wrong?
[07:25] <@ChrisChanSonichu> not really.
[07:25] <peenpouncin> i still wear my high school ring :S
[07:25] <@ChrisChanSonichu> It took the event to awaken the power.
[07:25] <peenpouncin> i wish it had powers
[07:25] <Haihai> Ohh... that makes sense
[07:25] <@ChrisChanSonichu> well, mine is the ONLY ring of its kind.
[07:25] <peenpouncin> 8(
[07:26] <Viral> ;___;
[07:26] <@ChrisChanSonichu> it has my initials engraved inside it.
[07:26] <TheTengu> The One Ring..
[07:26] <TheTengu> To Transform Chris-Chan?
[07:26] <peenpouncin> mine has my first name written on the inside^^
[07:26] <@ChrisChanSonichu> and it has my birthstone in it.
[07:26] <peenpouncin> same with mine, but we probably have different stones.

[07:35] <Viral> meh we don't even have those
[07:35] <peenpouncin> or mcflurry rather
[07:35] <@ChrisChanSonichu> I prefer M&Ms
[07:36] <TheTengu> Are you dressin up for Halloween this year Chris?
[07:36] <Spankety> I don't think they have m&ms at the one in my area
[07:36] <Viral> we have kitkat, smarties or cornetto
[07:36] <TheTengu> I'm going to a zombie walk this weekend, so I'm just using stuff from that :P
[07:36] <@ChrisChanSonichu> it gives of a Rainbow Swirl color in the ice cream, and it's still very good. :)
[07:36] <Spankety> the kitkat ones are fucking gross
[07:36] <TheTengu> For a costume.
[07:36] <@ChrisChanSonichu> no.
[07:36] <TheTengu> Smarties sounds bad.
[07:36] <Viral> i always take smarties
[07:36] <Spankety> nah the smarties are good
[07:36] <@ChrisChanSonichu> I like smarties.
[07:36] <Haihai> I hear they make you smart ;)
[07:36] <Viral> sometimes they mess them up real bad though
[07:36] <@ChrisChanSonichu> lol
[07:37] <Spankety> the kitkat ones don't even taste like kitkat
[07:37] <TheTengu> I could see that. I don't mind smarties, kind of like pringles.
[07:37] <TheTengu> Just not in a mcflurry sort of thing
[07:37] <Viral> and the cornetto one is just silly
[07:37] <@ChrisChanSonichu> potato chips in ice cream? I don't think so.
[07:37] <Richter> lol
[07:37] <Spankety> lmao
[07:37] <TheTengu> lol I've seen weirder things from japanese stores
[07:37] <Viral> an icecream cone mixed into a mcflurry?
[07:38] <@ChrisChanSonichu> that's a great idea.
[07:38] <Viral> what were they thinking?
[07:38] <TheTengu> anchovie chips comes to mind
[07:38] <@ChrisChanSonichu> ugh
[07:38] <Richter> ugh indeed

[20:38] <@PandaHalo> maybe you could do it tomorrow suring the day?
[20:38] <BrianClough> Chris have you ever thought about using a vector-graphics programme to make your comic
[20:38] <BrianClough> like FireWorks or illustrator
[20:38] <sneeze> As a gay person who enjoys Sonichu, who also has had multiple boyfriends and girlfriends, where does this put me on the moral scale for CWC productions?
[20:38] * Rosey (cgiirc@Rizon-174CDCC0.cfl.res.rr.com) has joined #sonichu
[20:38] <BrianClough> it makes it a lot easier to color in etc
[20:38] <sneeze> And cleaner, crisper lines
[20:38] <Maxwell_House> Chris, I drew up some fanart, I emailed it to you, did you get it?
[20:39] <@SonichuGal> Please people, one at a time.
[20:39] <Spankety> burn the gays
[20:39] <BrianClough> and also if you want to change anything all of the parts can be moved about
[20:39] <sneeze> Spankety: yeah because being gay is entirely a choice durrhurr
[20:39] <EXKeine> It is a choice
[20:39] <Spankety> yes
[20:39] <Maxwell_House> well, yesh; it is
[20:39] <@ChrisChanSonichu> I've never heard of Vector Graphics; sneeze, you are on thin ice, watch your step; which fan art was that, Maxwell_House?
[20:40] <sneeze> Chris: Are you just jealous that I've been intimate with a girl before though?
[20:40] * Mofo_P sets mode: +b *!*@984FF181.E3477AC7.6DD738B1.IP
[20:40] <Rosey> Chris, would you ever consider switching from markers to crayons for your comics?
[20:40] <BrianClough> well imagine something like ms paint but every shape that you draw can me moved around or resized
[20:40] <Orca> I've also drawn some fanart and sent it to ya Chris.
[20:40] * sneeze was kicked by SonichuGal (Don't diss Chris.�)
[20:40] <Sonichu_Fan> Chris, have you ever thought about using Flash to make Sonichu animations?
[20:40] <@ChrisChanSonichu> lol.
[20:40] <Maxwell_House> just a simple line drawing of you pointing to sonichu as he leaps into action
[20:40] <Orca> Dunno if you received it though...
[20:41] <Rosey> I just think crayons would look nicer.
[20:41] <BrianClough> flash is the next step up from something like Fireworks
[20:41] <Maxwell_House> I could just link you to the image
[20:41] <@ChrisChanSonichu> I prefer markers; better, more reliable tips, and they're more bold than crayons.
[20:41] <Rosey> True.
[20:41] <Bluecheese> but it looks kind of bad
[20:41] <@ChrisChanSonichu> plus, marker ink looks more professional than crayons.
[20:41] <Bluecheese> and takes a loooong time to color with
[20:41] <EXKeine> What about colored pencils? The colors blend better and you can get a finer tip with sharpening
[20:41] <Rosey> Yeah!
[20:41] <Bluecheese> good colored pencils look classy
[20:41] <@ChrisChanSonichu> IDK.
[20:42] <Stalyn> ChrisChanSonichu, i think what others are asking would you ever consider using a computer to draw/color your comics?
[20:42] <BrianClough> you could make them much more quickly and the computer takes care of things like shading
[20:42] <Bluecheese> it would really speed things up and just not be so exhausting on yourself
[20:42] <Maxwell_House> pastel crayons would allow you to have more blending power
[20:42] <@SonichuGal> I was thinking pastel crayons. I remember using those in art class and they were pretty neat.
[20:42] <@ChrisChanSonichu> I hand-draw the individual pages, then I retype the text in photoshop and fix some of the images, or add images in that program.
[20:42] <EXKeine> Pastels are a bit hard to use right.
[20:43] <Bluecheese> well you have photoshop
[20:43] <Bluecheese> its very powerful
[20:43] <Maxwell_House> they take some practice
[20:43] <Bluecheese> and actually easy as all get out
[20:43] <@ChrisChanSonichu> yep; so is LittleBiGPlanet. :D
[20:43] <BrianClough> photoshop isnt good for vector stuff though
[20:43] <Spankety> penis cheeks
[20:43] <EXKeine> It's good for drawing, but so is OpenCanvas
[20:43] <Bluecheese> no need for vector stuff in a web comic though
[20:44] <Stalyn> ChrisChanSonichu, do you read any webcomics? and if so what are your favorites?
[20:44] * PandaHalo sets mode: +b *!*@Rizon-681DE572.eastlink.ca
[20:44] <Maxwell_House> Actually, if you make the line art on paper, and scan it into paint as pure black&white, you can use the bucket tool to color it
[20:44] * Spankety was kicked by PandaHalo (i told you no more faggotry�)
[20:45] <EXKeine> Yeah, that's what I do.
[20:45] <EXKeine> Or did
[20:45] <DOUKNOUKEM> Oh hey ChrisChanSonichu
[20:45] <DOUKNOUKEM> how are you
[20:45] <@ChrisChanSonichu> I am well, thank you.
[20:45] <DOUKNOUKEM> did you make any little big planet levels yet
[20:45] <EXKeine> Except I never used Photoshop and used the GIMP because it was free
[20:45] <DOUKNOUKEM> this game with mgs4 really make me think of getting a ps3
[20:45] <@Mofo_P> ChrisChanSonichu: I remember seeing in your subcomics about a Sonichu Scrapbook, does this have the history of Sonichu in it?
[20:46] <@ChrisChanSonichu> if I did the line art then scan and paint, there would be A LOT of holes to patch up digitally.
[20:46] <DOUKNOUKEM> and i'd like to play your little big planet levels if i eventually get a ps3
[20:46] <@ChrisChanSonichu> so paint doesn't spill outside.
[20:46] <Sonichu_Fan> If I may ask, do you use mechanical pencils for any of your drawings?
[20:46] <Bluecheese> you can actually color it in like a coloring book
[20:46] <@ChrisChanSonichu> no
[20:46] <Bluecheese> make the paint brush as big as you want
[20:46] <BrianClough> what you can do is use the "magic wand" tool and set the tolerance higher
[20:46] <Bluecheese> no no no
[20:46] <Bluecheese> layers
[20:46] <BrianClough> so you dont get any gaps
[20:46] <Bluecheese> a multiply layer is all you need
[20:47] <Bluecheese> no magic wand, not white spaces
[20:47] <Bluecheese> you just just color over it like a coloring book
[20:47] <Bluecheese> and you can erase the color without messing up your lines
[20:47] <@ChrisChanSonichu> I feel better hand-coloring the drawings.
[20:48] <BrianClough> what ever's best for you tbh
[20:48] <Bluecheese> well thats whats important
[20:48] <@Mofo_P> ChrisChanSonichu: I remember seeing in your subcomics about a Sonichu Scrapbook, does this have the history of Sonichu in it?
[20:48] <Sonichu_Fan> You should. Mechcanical pencils are a lot more efficient than ordinary ones if you know how to use them.
[20:48] <@ChrisChanSonichu> basically, yes
[20:48] <Maxwell_House> Are we going back to the sonichu balls story arch, or are we focusing on the dude that stole the medallion?
[20:48] <@ChrisChanSonichu> I prefer pen.

[20:48] <@SonichuGal> Nice choice.
[20:48] <@SonichuGal> Pentel makes a fine pen.
[20:48] <@ChrisChanSonichu> yes; two CADD degrees.
[20:49] <@Mofo_P> ChrisChanSonichu: COuld you consider uploading it? I'd like to see the development of Sonichu and Bionic and all the other characters from a young age
[20:49] <BrianClough> two? wow
[20:49] <@ChrisChanSonichu> IDK; THAT'S A LOT OF ART TO MEMORIZE ONLINE in my FTP
[20:49] <BrianClough> I bet you could design a car engine
[20:49] <@Mofo_P> We don't know much about how you actually came up with them, it'll be very informative IMO
[20:49] <EXKeine> Other than CADD, what kinds of classes did you take in school?
[20:50] <@PandaHalo> i would also like to see your sonichu scrap book
[20:50] <@SonichuGal> As would I. I'd like to see the evolution of your artistic style.
[20:50] <@PandaHalo> maybe you could mail it to me and i could send it back to you after i've had a look?
[20:50] <Maxwell_House> I would like to take a look at the book
[20:50] <@ChrisChanSonichu> a varitey; math, english, science, ART, 2-years of Spanish, HTML, P.E. and more.

[20:55] <@Mofo_P> ChrisChanSonichu: COuld you give a definition of "Anchuent Powers"? Are they like ancient powers?
[20:55] <Bluecheese> its not selling out to be succesfull
[20:55] <@ChrisChanSonichu> then, I would be a man-slut. lol

[20:55] <@PandaHalo> ChrisChanSonichu.. have you ever considered polygamy?

[20:59] <EXKeine> I have logs but I'd have to go through and cut out the Q&A parts.
[20:59] <@Mofo_P> I'd like to suggest posting previous chatlogs to the Q&A section of the new fansite
