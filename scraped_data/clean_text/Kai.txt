“
Yes, Kai is a bit of a dumbass, but he is a good kind of dumbass, and his powers and abilities have been personally confirmed, witnessed and experienced by me.

Chris on Kai[1]
Chris's drawing of Kai as a Sonichu.
Kevin Fairchild, also known as Kai, is one of the players in a Dungeons and Dragons group Chris joined in 2020. He has influenced Chris's fantasy beliefs.[2] Chris was a member of his Discord server 'Kaiyosh's Server'.
On 22 May 2020, Chris wrote Sonichu Journal Pages, six pages of handwritten notes for Kai going over Chris's lore. Chris also sent messages about Kai, though the context is unclear. In the messages, Chris mentioned that he has shared lore on Jacob Sockness, such as Kidasuna, with Kai.[3]
In an undated text, Chris mentioned that Kai had some concerns with a rewritten spell Chris had written, but that Kai went through it himself.[4]
In August 2020, Chris named Kai as a beneficiary in his Last Will and Testament. In that month, during the 2020 Discord leaks, Naught posted scans of the Sonichu Journal Pages in the Official CWCki Server. When Chris entered the server, he was dismayed to find the pages there, and he complained in The Place server that the pages had only been meant for Kai to read. Val claimed that Kai had posted the scans in his Discord server. Kyle called Kai a dumbass, which Chris partially agreed with.[1]

I've been seeing many portals and dimensional breaks in and out of the dreams lately as well.
Sure, I'll call you around then.
For me, please, see if you can speak up and enunciate during the call.
Thank you.
Kai
Will do.

I believe I either intercepted or was directly sent a message from an evil entity.
He mentioned the destruction of a world (not sure which one.) And used the word "slave".
Oh also he looked like a Draconian
What should I do 2 prepare?

Are there such things.
I was trying 2 text are there such things as Archangel Sonichu?
I had a dream you texted me and showed me a picture of 3 of them.
I think they might be my guardians or something.
Can you text me back about my previous text messages when you get a chance?
Chris (as Sonichu)
