Title: My apologies

================================================================================

My apologies is a Flipnote Chris uploaded on 1 July 2010. The Flipnote contains no drawings, no music and, most importantly, no remorse.
In a rare moment of self-awareness, Chris not only disabled comments on this Flipnote, but for the ones that remain as well. (He then reenabled comments the next day.) The Flipnote was promptly deleted because of Chris's signature. He doesn't understand that his insatiable urge to brand everything he makes with his own name is the cause of his mod troubles.
On 2 July, Chris re-uploaded some of his previously removed flipnotes, including his sex dream, and subsequently got the permanent banhammer. This remained the last Flipnote made by our autistic friend for almost a year, until the 3DS Flipnote was uploaded.

My apologies for deleting and dis-abling the Comments on my FlipNotes, but I am doing this to clear the slanderings from the Trolls (ALL of Whom are being ignored, and are not/will not be getting ANY attent-ion at all) and to teach them that they all Need to Stop their harassments and Reevaluate their lives for their benefit. No harm will be done; THEY Need to understand that Useless Pranks at other people's expense and such misdemeanors are just that, USELESS. It Is Not Funny. Peace, Christian W. Chandler.
