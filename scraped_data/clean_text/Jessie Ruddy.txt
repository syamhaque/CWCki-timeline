Holy fucking shit, Crumpet was right.

Jessica "Jessie" Ruddy is an obscure troll persona made by Crumpet, a member of the Encyclopedia Dramatica forums. Jessie contacted Chris on Skype from September to October of 2008, right in the middle of the Blanca Saga, acting as a 19-year old boyfriend-free girl to possibly become Chris's heartsweet.
After revealing himself, Crumpet posted these chatlogs on the ED forums, but due to the lack of proof and the absurdity of Chris's messages, most believed these to be fake chats. Crumpet was also known for spreading misinformation regarding Chloe, leading to him being generally untrusted by members of ED.
Jessie remained forgotten for almost an year, until 25 July 2009, where Chris was coerced by Jack Thaddeus into making CWC "Boyfriend", a music video depicting several women in Chris's life. The third woman showcased is Jessie Ruddy herself, which most who didn't know Jessie were confused by. CWCki admin Champthom, who had seen the ED post an year ago, dug up the chatlogs and posted them on a CWCki talk page

Summary
Chris greets Jessie, and they start engaging in friendly conversation. They start talking about Seinfield, and their favorite characters from the show. Jessie says her favorite show is Scrubs, which Chris says he doesn't watch, leading to Jessie rambling about it for a bit. Eventually the conversation turns to 17 sexy pictures that Chris plans to send Jessie for her to mass debate to. Jessie asks Chris if he has a car, which he says he does, and mentions a crash that he got into one day, which gave him a 'manly emotional scar'. Chris also asks Jessie to change her Skype avatar, comparing looking at it 'getting a toothache after eating too much sugary candy'. Chris mentions feeling tired, and says that he's going to rest a bit before sending Jessie the 'teasing, pleasing pics' for her. It is unknown if these were ever sent.

The Betrayal
Summary
This chat takes place after Crumpet reveals himself as a troll. Chris tries to outsmart him by saying that he could also be a troll, impersonating himself. After Crumpet refuses to believe this, Chris makes bizarre statements like 'BA DERP A DERP A TEEDILY DUM-DUM, YOU TROLLING DUMM-DUMM.'. After Crumpet tells him that Blanca was a troll, Chris says that he knows, a stark contrast to his videos, where he still believes she's real. Chris also says he doesnt care that Blanca destroyed his medallion, and that his real powers are stored in his Amnyfest Ring. Crumpet reverts to the classic trolling strategy, and starts calling Chris gay, referencing the pictures of him in bra and panties. Chris says that a lot of people 'try on underwear of their opposites'. Crumpet continues, saying that Chris likes pickles up his asshole, which makes Chris even more angry. He demonstrates his straightness by typing 'I WANT VAGINA ON MY NOSE', 'I WANT BREASTS ON MY ASS' and 'I HAVE WOMAN'S TOUNGE IN MY MOUTH.' along with other absurd phrases. Eventually, Crumpet calls Chris the n word and leaves the chat.
