Chris and Idea Guys
The most well-known member of the Chaotic Combo. He is an omnipotent Sonichu with infinite magical powers. Of course, with Chris' current stance on all things occult and supernatural, it was only a matter of time before trolls and weens alike would use this character to exploit his psyche. In mid-2017, by the time Chris became infatuated with the character, the Idea Guys knew this was the perfect opportunity to turn this against him. By this time, they've been making up all kinds of stories of the character in such situations as an incestuous homosexual marriage. Afterward, Chris has finally declared his Love Quest over, having been married to both his creation, as well as to Mewtwo.
