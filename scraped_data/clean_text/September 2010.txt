================================================================================

On 16 September 2010, Chris once again proved that he will always find a new low.
Chris on 25 September 2010, while sinking Lars' boat.
September was the ninth month of 2010. It got off to a slightly slow start, especially considering it came in the aftermath of yet another sequence of bizarre behavior by Chris, including an attempt to organize his 10-year class reunion and the violent destruction of his PS3 in exchange for over $9,000.
However, things picked back up in amazing style come the first half of the month. After proclaiming that he wouldn't let the trolls bother him and he was taking back control of his life, Chris uploaded two videos, both involving a mysterious girl named Jackie, presumably the same one who dealt with him back in April. Things also got interesting when Jackie's ex-boyfriend Lars came back into the picture.
Aside from his dealings with Jackie, Chris quickly turned out to be unable to handle the lack of video games, and used his tugboat to buy a new PS3, much to Jackie's dismay.
