Soda Awawawawa Puccho Candy Response is a video Chris uploaded on July 14, 2017. This is one of the few videos during the Financhu Crisis that wasn't made for the sole purpose of getting cash from weens. It's a bit difficult to hear Chris talk through all of the rats and insects living in his house, but if you listen closely near the end, you can hear Snorlax's glorious war cry.
