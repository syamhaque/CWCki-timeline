HE'S BAAAACK.
"15 October 2009" (officially "10152009") is a video where Ian Brandon Anderson acknowledges the return of the TRUE and HONEST Chris. He also continues to "call out" Clyde Cash/Gregg Mays.
The introduction "Captain's Log" is absent in this video, as with some recent videos, to the relief of Star Trek fans everywhere.

FROM: the True C.W.C with Birth Name Christopher.
Liquid describes his heroic survival as he was kidnapped, force fed tobacky, then brutally assaulted and raped in the ass. Liquid found himself in the middle of the Sahara where he journeyed for miles, seeking water, and as he was about to die from thirst, some "friendly Aladdin people" came to his rescue and helped him return to his home of Ruckersville.

Captain’s log, Stardate October fi-fifteenth, 2009. [stress sigh]
Hello my loyal fanbase. As-a-alot has happened to me, uh this past month and a half. I shall tell you first and foremost that uh I am safe, as- and straight, and I would like to note to a note there that uh what- what uh happened- what happened to me there and why you have not heard from me for so long. Oh, and my- and my Sonichu medallion, I do not have it at the moment because it was stolen from me.
I was ready for my bus to Redmond, but-uh-just-at the bus stop there, all of a sudden I felt someone touching me on my... yeah. So I turned around, because you know, I am TAKEN by my sweetest Kaceeyyyy, and it was none other than the impostor Christian Weston Chandler himself, or as he is better known, Ian Brandon Anderson! I called him out and I said, “Hey you Ian An-“, I said, “Hhh-hey you Ian Brandon Anderson” he st-he started screaming and covering his ears and then he knocked me out with a Chun-Li kick. And so, I woke up at a meat- in a meat packing factory. I knew it was a meat packing factory because there was- [pauses and swallows awkwardly] there was alotttt of pictures of uh...... [pauses in disgust] ducks… hanging around. Yeah, he made me uh- get on camera and then he force fed me a lots of uh… D-R-U-G-S. I-I didn’t even know there were so many kinds of them, but I passed out before I could even find ou- uh- before I could even tell, and the next thing you know eh- I’M WAKING UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SAHARA DESERT, AND MY ANUS IS BLEEDING! I’M BLEEDING OUT OF MY- t’yeah, so… yeah.
So just suh- so just all y’all so you know by now, that impostor is a homosexual. I had to get an OPERATION! So I called thru- I- [pauses, licks lips, stress sighs and shakes head back and forth] I crawled through the desert on my stomach for like a whooole month and until some really nice guys from Aladdin picked me up and they let me stay with them in their tent, and they took me to a city and where I found out that I had been kidnapped and taken to Africa! And so- but- and- [stress sigh] So ‘bout a week ago I called my sweetest Kacey, and she was so happy- [clutches chest and speaks with concern and heartache] she was so happy to see me, and I- I had been talking to her about getting our engagement re-r-reinfor-reinstated. [video cuts to a slightly different angle and position]
And I ask you Kasey, will you please- will you please marry me again? [mimics opening an engagement ring box using his hands]
[Moves engagement ring box closer to his chest and reopens it] Opening to my heart. [video cuts back to original angle]
And a very upcoming date... yeah and uh- yeah and on an’urr note ‘der, I am going back to Redmond to my own office with my own secretary to take up- to take up my rightful job as the owner of the Sonichu franchise, and just so y’all know, that Project Needlemouse game, that Sega was working on, that was uh- that was gonna be the Sonichu game, but when I got kidnapped they had to- they had to act like it was just another Sonic title. So now I am gonna- I am gonna- I am going back to work that up and put a jump start in the comics and- and the game, and as for that impostor, I want to see his head on a pike! [video cuts]
Peace. [holds up peace sign] And have a good d-

Solid responded the same day with a rebuttal to Liquid's video, saying the events that he described were neither true or honest. Midway through, he suddenly launches into his own advertisement for The Cleveland Show.

October 15th, 2009.
Yes I have uh, reseen the, uh...return of the impostor in the blipe--in the brown stripes. [stress sigh] He dares call me by that stupid Ian name? [grunts and shakes head] Stupid. Everybody know that is fa--that that name is fake.
Anyway, the on--I will only respond to him this one time because he is a lowly troll, and I just do not give a dang about him. I mean, come on, his story, I mean like, you know, being put in a meat factory, Sahara Desert, Aladdin people?! Huh. And also, he coulda easily put, he could have easily taken the drugs himself, even to make his own ass bleed. I mean, that story, it's just about as incredibly fabricated as [looks left of camera as if to read a script] Donna Tubb's time over at when she had to borrow R. Kelly's bathroom, or Roberta when she fought off 6 Al-Qaedas, one by one! The Cleveland Show, new episodes Sun--every Sunday on F--on Fox, and episodes downloadable on PlayStation Network, and iTunes. Cleveland Show! [laughs retardedly]
Ah, anyway, the main concern here is that defintly--uh, definitely me drawing the comic pages which I am still doing...and, takin' down, the Billy Mays/Clyde Cash whoever the hell he is. Do not beli--and continue to not believe...that...his name may be Christian Weston Chandler, but everybody knows that he is not the original guy, I am. The guy was born in Ruckersville, Virginia, his birth name was Christopher.
So there.....and I'm still here. I'm still waitin' for ya, Gregg Mays. I know where you are. You are...within this state of Virginia. And I am still waiting for you...to accept my challenge.
Anyway, aside from that, expect a few more pages this weekend on the CWCipedia: the official Sonichu and Rosechu site. Thank you and have a good day.
