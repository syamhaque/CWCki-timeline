================================================================================

100 2270 is the third of three videos Chris uploaded on 7 October 2010. In it, he does a painful impression of Alec Benson Leary in a strange, nasal voice in an attempt to mock him. Half the time his insults are unintelligible and his Eric Cartman-like accent makes the problem even worse.
Chris appears to randomly switch impersonations to one of Liquid Chris about midway through the video without changing his voice at all. He also proceeds to beat the dead horse about not only how Alec put homosexual imagery in Asperchu, but about how violent Asperchu can be. After all, we all know that Sonichu doesn't have gore, violence and needless killing of characters, right?
Chris continues the trend of using construction paper props, making a facsimile of Liquid Chris's brown-striped shirt. The Asperchu Medallion makes a reappearance in this video.
A few months over half a year shy of one decade since this video's release, on March 8, 2020, Chris rewatched this video during a viewing of the 31st episode of Chris-Chan: A Comprehensive History, and commented on the episode's upload that he found the video funny, and predicted that people would make a meme out of his complete butchering of the word "homosexual" into "yamosexual".

Transcript
[Chris's face is partially obscured by darkness due to the lighting in his room. A large piece of cardboard with horizontal orange and grey stripes covers most of his chest. The Asperchu medallion is visible around his neck.]
[Odd voice] 'Ello, web! This is Christian Weston Chandler 'ere! But I'm no- I'm not really Christian Weston Chandler, and I'm not the creator of Sonichu, because I live, in Philadelphia! I was born in Philadelphia! At least as far as I know. [switches to an obnoxiously higher-pitched voice] I don't have any originality, or idea points, because I never put up a page of myself... in real life, and still I only mock the real Christian Weston Chandler in Virginia! And now, I am mocking, Alec Benson Leary! [grabs Asperchu medallion] I am pretending to be Alec Benson Leary! Oh, look at me, I'm Alec! I draw teeeerrribly, [mimes drawing] I draw everything in squares, I put yamosexual images in the background, I kill everybody, I put gore all over the floor, blood all over the place! [flails arms and shifts from foot to foot] I killed the real Christian Weston Chandler, I even killed the orig- I even killed the second dude who pretended to be the original!
[pauses for breath]
Anyway, I'm Christian Chandler, I live in Philadelphia, I also have girlfriend! Her name is Kacey, [more arm-flailing] except we're married now! And she coulda had the real Christian Weston Chandler, who lives in Virginia, except I'm just a Christian Chandler who lives in Philadelphia! Now, I'm sorry, I didn't mean Philadelphia, I meant to say Pennsylvania! Pennsylvania! Where I pretended to be the original Christian Weston Chandler and rent movies from... Blockbuster in Pennsylvaniaaa! And the phone call was sent to the real deal, the real man in Virginia.
Yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yaddblahblahblahyahbahblahyablahlalalalalah!
[Pause]
Hey baby, hit me one more time! I done it from my head! [pause] Bye now!
