Title: Manchester High Leaks

Categories: Education, Historical Documents, High School Saga
================================================================================

Photo of the "obtained" folders.
In June 2014, CWCki Forums user SkyRaider91 (also known as Cousin Al), began leaking scans of several documents from Chris's junior year (1998-99) of high school.[1] Many of the pages appear to be charred and/or water-damaged, likely as a result of the January 2014 fire and subsequent events at 14 Branchland Court. It was revealed in November 2014 that these had been obtained by trolls sifting through the trash at the burnt-out house, which, although not illegal, still lends credence to the view that the trolling of Chris is going too far.
It is very apparent from these leaks that many of Chris's teachers gave him very high grades which he indisputably did not deserve. Whether they did this out of misguided pity, a fear of being seen to play Kick the Autistic or simply being incompetent themselves, giving Chris - who had perfectly adequate mental faculties for the work - undeserved extra credit would have contributed to his ego and general laziness. Even within this small core sample of his work, it's apparent that Chris frequently left out sections he didn't want to complete, wrote "essays" in a first-person subjective tone and even wrote parts of his work in the wrong language and still got good or even perfect scores. The teachers who enabled this abysmal workmanship probably had the best intentions and/or incompetence, but even though they may have made Chris, Bob, and Barb happy they certainly did Chris no favours in the long run. Thankfully, at least a few of his markers had the sense to treat his work like they'd treat anyone else's, and he has them to thank for only being able to get into the local community college.

Parenting Interview
Presumably Chris interviewed Barb and/or Bob for this assignment, and most of the answers are short and vague to the point of not making much sense; it's unclear whether Barb/Bob were giving apathetic answers, or whether Chris was just too lazy to record their full responses. Humorously, the interviewee(s) says that "the hardest part of being a parent" has been "dealing w. public school sys", and that they chose to have children simply because "It's nice to have kids." They also make mention of "laughter from 4 kids and 3 situations". This idiosyncratic expression has been interpreted as referring to the social stigma that Bob and Barb endured as a result of their respective previous relationships and children. It is likely to be just an obscure, antiquated idiomatic formation not to be taken literally, referring to the various wacky happenings stemmed from raising one single very special boy.

DESCRIBING DEVELOPMENT
DIRECTIONS: Identify the characteristic of development described in each situation. Remember that the characteristics of development are as follows:
Development is similar for everyone.
Development builds on earlier learning.
Development proceeds at an individual rate.
The different areas of development are interrelated.
Development is continuous throughout life.
1. Jessica is an active three-year-old who enjoys dressing herself. Lately, she has started choosing her clothes each morning. Her parents are amazed at her constart eagerness to learn new things. It seems she never stops wanting to learn.
Characteristic of development development is continuous throughout life.
2. Michael always had trouble in school. He did poorly on tests and was seldom able to answer when the teacher called on him. Some of the other children teased Michael on the playground and called him "dummy". As a result, Michael was very shy and had little self-confidence. Since he has started wearing glasses, however, he has been doing better in school. Now Michael feels good about himself and has been able to make friends more easily.
Characteristic of development development builds it on earlier learning.
[corrected in red pen: "interrelated"]
3. Joshua and Nicole are cousins born two months apart. Although Joshua is older, Nicole began to sit and stand about the same time Joshua did. This has been slightly puzzling to Joshua's parents. They are worried about Joshua's apparently slow rate of development.
Characteristic of development development proceeds at an individual rate.
4. Jim is babysitting his neighbor's son Albert. To Jim, it seems as if it was only yesterday that Albert was crawling on the carpet in the living room. He remembers that Albert then learned to walk and is now running and jumping in the yard.
Characteristic of development different areas of development are interrelated.

noticed that Amy and Cindy are able to do about the same things. This has been true throughout the two years Ron has lived next door to Cindy's family.

6. Maria is helping her younger sister Joanie learn the alphabet. She seems to be catching on quickly. Yesterday, Joanie could even pick some of the letters out of written words in one of her books. Maria knows that soon Joanie will be able to point out a few simple words. Later, she will be able to read short phrases and sound out words.
Characteristic of development developmentis continous throughout life.
[corrected in red pen: "builds"]
7. Rachel, Martha, and Juan are all four-year-olds attending the same child care center. Martha is slightly shorter than the other two children. She is very good at playing with others. Rachel is the tallest of the three and the most coordinated. Juan is somewhere between the two girls in size and likes to play quietly by himself in the sandbox.
Characteristic of development development proceeds at an individual rate.
8. Mark is a senior at his local high school. He has just received a scholarship for his literary achievement. Right now, Mark is looking forward to spring because he plans to run track and hopes to improve his speed from last year. Recently, his Uncle Joseph offered Mark a part-time job at the grocery store he manages. Mark plans to take the job and work until he starts college in the fall.
Characteristic of development development is continous throughout life.
9. Diane and her family spent a month last summer visiting relatives in Canada. Diane spent most of the month playing with her brother Brad and cousin Timothy, both two years old. She found that both boys could run fairly well, stand on one foot, and climb stairs. By the end of the visit, Diane could see that the two children did many things alike. She thought this was surprising since Brad was born in the United States and Timothy was born in Canada, and the two had never met before.
Characteristic of development development is similar for everyone.
10. At playschool one day, four-year-old Terry suddenly burst into tears. He had been given a worksheet to complete, which required him to cut out a simple picture with blunt scissors, paste it to another picture, and color it. Terry knew exactly were to paste the picture, and pasting was an activity he enjoyed. He also liked coloring and had already chosen two colors he would use. But Terry could not complete his picture becase he could not make the scissors work.

1. Carolyn is excited about the birth of her first child. However, some of the changes coming up will be hard to get used to. For example, she plans to quit smoking soon after the baby is born since she thinks it might be harmful to the child. In the meantime, Carolyn and John look on the pregnancy as their "last fling" before they become parents. Every weekend they attend parties where lots of beer is served. ["Every weekend they" is underlined in red pen]
smoking causes the baby to have a less [illegible] slow mind less birth weight; alcohol causes the baby to have less birth wei a slow mind.

2. Earlier this week, Sandra woke up with a terrible cold. Since she is preparing for maternity leave, she doesn't want to miss any days at the office. ["miss any days at the office" is underlined in red pen] Sandra decided to increase her intake of vitamins to boost her energy level. She found some nose drops in the medicine cabinet and has been taking those along with several aspirin each day.
some medical drugs cause the baby to have less body weight, and have slow minds.
[teacher wrote "take needed time" in red pen]
3. Elaine's second child is due in five months. She is busy getting ready for the new arrival. Since pregnancy has been going so well, Elaine decided not to cut down on her favorite foods – chocolate, coffee, and soft drinks. Elaine's X rays at her dental appointment last week revealed no tooth decay. She really does feel good. However, since several neighborhood children have had rubella recently, she has decided to ask her doctor for the vaccine on her next visit.
chocolate, coffie, and soft drinks (caffine), cause the baby to not have not get all the nutrients it needs. be very hyperactive.
[teacher wrote "caffeine", "-3", and "No Xrays [or] vaccines because        " in red pen]
4. Marti has a fear of gaining too much weight while she is pregnant. A few years ago, her doctor prescribed amphetamines for a weight loss program. Marti had some of the pills left over, so she is using them to curb her appetitu, In addition, she skips breakfast and lunch and eats only a small dinner.
skipping meals and only taking medication will cause the baby to not get the nutrients it needs.

For this worksheet about child development, Chris seems to have regurgitated sentences from a textbook, which makes it a boring read. Of note is that he gave "television" as an example of a child's "enviroment" [sic], possibly shedding some light on Barb's parenting techniques.

This worksheet seems to be more regurgitated textbook material, but Chris found subtle ways to screw it up, like using mathematical inequalities (see also: using Spanish in his English homework) and failing to cross a couple Ts. He also doesn't seem to understand the concept of adoption, referring to it as "a right to raise a child who is biologically their own."

CHAPTER 5 STUDY GUIDE
DIRECTIONS: As you read the chapter, answer the following questions. Later, you can use this guide to study the chapter information.
Prenatal Development
1. Prenatal development is
development of baby during period before birth.
Conception
2. Define:
Ovum
female cell or egg.
Uterus
organ in woman's body in which a baby develops during pregnancy.
Sperm
male cell.
Conception
union, or joining, of 1 egg and 1 sperm, resulting in beginning of pregnancy.
Zygote
fertilized egg.
Period of the Zygote
3. The first stage in the development of a baby is the zygote period and lasts 2 weeks. The zygote attaches to the uterus and is the size of a pinhead at the end of two weeks.
Period of the Embryo
4. The second stage of the pregnancy is the embryo period and lasts from the 3rd week to the 8th week of pregnancy. During this time, the placenta, which attaches the sacs around the embryo to the uterus, and the umbilical cord, the tube that connects the placenta to the embryo, develop. The tube carries nourishment and oxygen from the mother's blood stream to the baby and takes waste products from the baby. The amnotic fluid surrounds the
embryo and acts as a cushion to protect it. At three weeks after conception, the heart is the largest organ, and it has already started beating.
Period of the Fetus
5. The last stage of pregnancy is the fetus period and begins about the 8th or 9th week and lasts until birth. In the early part of this period, the baby has the beginnings of all organs and body parts. By the fourth of fifth month of development, the kicking and moving of the baby can be felt by the mother, which is called quickening. By the 7th month, with a great deal of medical help, the fetus is capable of living outside the uterus. During the final month, the fetus gains weight rapidly and adds fat to help maintain body heat after birth. In the last few weeks, the fetus stores nutrients and builds immunity to disease and infection. During the ninth month of pregnancy, the fetus drops into the birth canal, which is called lightening, to prepare for labor. After about 40 weeks of preparation, the baby is ready to be born.
The Genetic Package
6. What is heredity? Name there characteristics that can be hereditary.
passing of natural characterics from past generations; hair texture and color, skin color, and color/shape of eyes.
7. Explain the relationship between chromosomes and genes.
each chromosome contains thousands of genes.
14. What are the five options for infertile couples? Briefly describe each.
OptionsDescriptions
adoption
legally providing a home for 1 or more children who don't have a home.
artificial insemination
injection of male's sperm into a woman's uterus, with a special needle during the woman's fertile period.
in vitro fertilization
a doctor removes an egg from a woman, puts it in a glass dish with a special solution, adds husband's sperm, and implants zygote back in woman's uterus.
ovum transfer
[illegible] same as in vitro fertilization, but the egg comes from an egg donor, not the mother.
surrogate
when a zygote is transferred from a future mother, to substitute [illegible] woman, who carries the zygote until birth.
Empathy Belly essay

How it was like to wear the Empathy Belly:
Having a belly like a pregnant woman was really an awkward experience. While I wore the belly, I was walking like as if my legs were out of balance. Also, when I tried to get my pencil bag out of my backpack, the belly held me back by putting pressure on my left leg. Luckily my arms were long, but if they were any shorter, I would have had a real problem to reach the pencil bag. And when I laid on the floor and tried to get up, the gravity made the belly put pressure on me, and it made me fall on my right side. Finally, while I was sitting in my chair, the belly made it uncomfortable for me to cross my legs, and while my legs were separated, it put pressure on my private part, which gave me a strange, weird feeling. So, it was quite an experience while I had a belly like a pregnant woman.

Amendment Timeline
Timeline of US Amendments 1-17
Timeline of US Amendments 18-23
Timeline of US Amendments 24-27
An illustrated timeline briefly describing the 27 amendments to the U.S. Constitution. As is to be expected, Chris used multiple differing conventions for writing out dates, and made numerous prominent factual, spelling, and grammatical errors, which are preserved in the transcription.
Notably, Chris seems to have read the antiquated language used in the older amendments at completely literal face value with no sense of interpretation, leading him to getting many facts and details wrong. For example, while most every true American patriot knows the 13th Amendment as the amendment that ended slavery, it also contains a parenthetical stating that involuntary servitude as conviction for a crime would continue to exist in the United States. Chris seems to have focused on this minor detail about crime punishment, rather than the momentous occasion of freeing the slaves, as the entire purpose of the amendment and even included an illustration implying that the 13th Amendment created slavery for criminals. While the 23rd Amendment actually gave voting rights to citizens of Washington, D.C., Chris seems to have confused "District of Columbia" for referring to Columbia, South Carolina, and drew a picture of the state pleased that it can now vote for president (this may have something to do with South Carolina not adopting a popular vote for president until 1868, making it by far the last state to do so, although this is probably giving Chris too much credit). In actuality, the 24th amendment abolishes poll taxes, while Chris makes it seem like it suddenly requires them. Additionally, the 26th amendment doesn't apply exclusively to men; it gives suffrage to all Americans 18 and older, regardless of sex.
His interpretation of the 11th Amendment, that "People of other countries can't blame U.S. for their troubles", is completely inexplicable.
Chris glosses over most of the Bill of Rights amendments (including the First Amendment that allows him to behave the way he does over the Internet), claiming the whole thing simply means "innocent until proven guilty."

The Strategic Defense Initiative was a system Reagan proposed in 1983. It was never actually implemented, at least not even close to how Reagan proposed it (in terms of technology and scale), and certainly not during his presidency. Despite that, Chris vomited up this four-sentence "essay" on how the "system of zappers and mirrors in space" defended "against Evil Empire," granted, the assignment asked for him to defend against the evil empire but he still didn't follow most of the instructions. He still got yet another perfect grade. Note that the teacher misspelled the names of several terms/people in the heading, and that the debt increase Chris gave for SDI is comically low – Reagan increased the defense budget by tens of billions of dollars, not millions.[2][3] All evidence seems to suggest his teacher should not have been hired.

Election worksheet
This worksheet deals with various aspects of elections, such as voting, political campaigns, etc. As in several other documents for non-Spanish subjects, Chris used broken Spanish for some of his answers here, although he provided English translations for most of it, and explained in the margin that he was "practicing [his] spanish". Despite the irrelevant, incorrect use of Spanish and the extremely simple answers, this worksheet again received a perfect grade.

Canterbury Tales Essay
An essay on The Nun's Priest's Tale from Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, with two drafts, a planning/inventory sheet, and a grade sheet. The rough draft looks to be peer-reviewed, while the second draft was most likely reviewed by the teacher. The first draft of the "essay" is just the narrative of the story the essay was supposed to be about, and Chris uses extremely basic punctuation (mainly commas) incorrectly, as well as making up words. The second draft is the same thing minus the fictitious words (but plus numerous tense errors) and with an awfully written conclusion tacked onto the end. Chris earned a 69% grade from a very generous or very stupid marker.
“
And that's how the fox goes overboard w. his pride, and how his crime didn't go into his favor.
”
Chris's eloquent conclusion in the rough draft, which his teacher didn't even notice was the conclusion
“

Canterbury essay. (rough draft)
The Cat Canterbury Tales gives us an excellent portrait of life in Middle-ages. Back in the mid-ages, the knights, peasents, and the royalty, lived in The 30 pilgrims are on a journey to the shrine of Thomas-á Becket. On the way to Canterbury; the pilgrims have a contest involving story telling. So, each story each pilgrim told, was a frame story in the story of Canterbury Tales. In the Nun's Priest's Tale [editor crossed out the underline and wrote "Don't underline" in margin], by Geoffrey Chaucer, the deadly sinesin, Pride was committed.
[editor wrote "Say something about Chanticlers dream?" in margin and an arrow pointing to this paragraph] In this tale tale/fable, the rooster, Chanticleer expresses too much pride, and it got him into trouble. One day, Chanticleer was sitting on a fencepost, when in the bushes nearby, a sneaky, sly fox was hiding there. The fox came out and told Chanticleer how his father, supposedly, crowed magnificently, the way he had his chest out, head back, eyes closed then he crowed his great crow. Then, Chanticleer's pride rose; so he [illegible] put his chest out, head back, and closed his eyes and just before he crowed, the fox pounced, and clasped his jaws on the poor, prideful rooster. And that's how Chanticleer's pride got him into trouble.
Also in this tale, the fox also expresses too much pride. As the fox carries the Chanticleer in his mouth, Chanticleer flatters the fox by telling him how clever the fox was in capturing Chanticleer. He also mentioned that flattering the chicken and capturing him off guard was "pure genius." When the fox opens his mouth to reply, proudfully, the chicken jumps out and runs away from him, up the tree and back to the farm. And that's how the fox goes overboard w. his pride, and how his crime didn't go into his favor.
Need a conclusion.

Canterbury essay
[Chris drew a star in the margin to the left of each line. The editor crossed out the entire row of stars on the first page.]
The Canterbury Tales [editor underlined the title for Chris] gives us an excellent portrait of life in the Middle ages. [editor circled the "a" in "ages", presumably because it should have been capitalized] The 30 pilgrims are on a journey to the shrine of Thomas-á-Bechet. On the way to Canterbury, the pilgrims have a contest involving story telling. So, each story that each pilgrim told, [editor wrote "T" above "told", presumably for tense] was a frame story in the story of Canterbury Tales. In The "Nun's Priest's Tale," by Geoffry Chaucer, the deadly sin, Pride, was committed
In this tale/fable, the rooster, Chanticleer, has a dream in which told was [editor circled "which told was" and wrote "?" above it] going to happen later in the tale. In his dream, Chanticleer...
→
[editor wrote "one side only" at top of this page; evidently this essay was supposed to be single-sided]
was attacked by a beast with a "blend of yellow and red." The beast tried to seize him, in his mouth with a "small smout." [editor wrote "sp" above "smout"] Then his wife, Pertelote, woke him up as he was "groaning and lurching," in the "real world." But, Pertelote proclaimed that he was a coward, because he was afraid of his dream.
Now, later in the tale, Chanticleer, and the fox, expresses too much pride, and it got both of them into trouble. One day, Chanticleer was sitting on a fence post, then comes the fox. The fox caught Chanticleer by telling him ...
about how his father, probably, crowed [editor wrote "Rv" (?) in the margin, possibly meaning "revise"] magnificently, the way he had his chest out, head back, and eyes closed, then he would give a great, magnificent crow. So, Chanticleer [editor wrote "Rv" (?) in the margin, possibly meaning "revise"] expressed too much pride by doing all that, but, just before he crowed, the fox snatched him in his jaws, and ran with the rooster in his mouth. Then, as the fox carries the rooster into the forest, the rooster tells the fox about how clever he was in capturing Chanticleer, and that the fox should shout out how sly and sneaky he was. So, the fox now expressed his pride by...
opening his mouth to shout it out, but as he did, the rooster jump out and ran up a tree. And that's [editor circled "t's" and wrote "No contractions" in the margin] how pride got Chanticleer and the fox into trouble.
Now, to conclude this essay, [editor circled "to conclude this essay" and struck it out] Chaucer's Canterbury Tales gives us a great picture of life in the Middle ages. In the "Nun's Priest's Tale," Chanticleer had a dream that showed what was going to happen. And that the Rooster's and the Fox's pride got each other into trouble. And, the rooster and the fox learned that from the mistakes they have made.    Well, that's it for the essay. [editor struck out this last sentence, as well as circling the "t's" in "that's"]

Japan War Essay
A wandering, factually inaccurate essay purported to be about Japan and the United States in World War II, which Chris sagaciously describes as "a very tragic event with guns, insults, and... yuck!". Most of the content is directly cited from other works, several of which are actually about World War I. What little content Chris came up with himself is highly subjective, informally and terribly written (the final draft begins with "this essay is about") and frequently racist. The thesis, if it can so be called, is extremely vague. There is an outline and two drafts of the essay. What mark he received for it can only be guessed at.
Of note is that despite this essay being for his English class, and being corrected on it in the rough draft, Chris wrote parts of the headings in Spanish, including writing his name as Ricardo, on the final draft.

So, the war was started only because the privacy of US was invaded... So, the US and Japan really wanted to get it on.

Japan, 1912-1949.
This essay is about the second World
War, where the US went against Germany
and Japan. The war was a very tragic
event with guns, insults, and... yuck! Now
we will see how Japan was involved, how
the past before it affected it, and how the war
was started.
Like all fights, the war did not start big, but,
"Just a litt [Chris almost forgot to skip a line, but corrected himself]
"Just a little skirmish between Japanese troops
on night maneuvers and Chinese troops guarding
the Marco Polo bridge." (Going to war with Japan, P.3). So the war was started only
because of privacy invasion for U.S. But, even
before that "skirmish," "The Japanese and Americans
had been glowering at each other like boxers from... →

...opposite corners of a 5,000-mile ring, waiting
for their bout to begin." (War Against Japan,
P.7). So, US and Japan really wanted to
get it on.
During the wait for the start of the war,
the Japanese were, "Cloistered on their remote islands,
with little contact beyond the sea, they deemed
themselves as a superior race and the rest of the
world as barbarians." (War Against Japan, P.8).
But [illegible] But the real "barbarians," were the
Japanese themselves. The US thought the same
way, and, "When Japan marched into Manchuria in
1931, the US denounce the action and said they
would never recognize Japan's conquest." (Going to war with Japan, P.4). Right then, the
US wanted to prove themselves more superior. →
P.3.
As the war went on, both sides saw
that it was unwinnable. "Wartime in Japan was
viewed as sinister.",and fanatical soldiers [illegible] (Forum).
At near the end of the war, "President Woodrow
Wilson tried to get Japan to withdraw from Shandong."
(Going to War with Japan,) P.4). Even the President
of US tried to put and an end to the nasty
war.
SoAnd so, after the war finally ended,
US and Japan came into peace, and somemost people from both sides were happy. Now we saw how the war started, and how much Japan was involved.

Best President Essay
A typically brief essay for Social Studies class in which Chris explains why John F. Kennedy was the best modern president. Both a rough draft and a final draft are included. While the teacher corrected the final draft, all the notations on the rough draft are in Chris's handwriting. Both drafts are typed. The marking can only be described as generous; Chris constantly changes tense incorrectly, all the paragraphs are terse and uninformative, and Chris even manages to misquote the famous line from Kennedy's inaugural address. Chris received a final grade of 43/50, plus an additional ten points because it was typed. Note that the English teacher who gave him this mark made multiple false corrections, crossed out the same mistake the second time it appeared but not the first time, and did not know how to spell "integrity", and yet she still got hired as a teacher.

"Who was our best President" essay:
The best President from Franklin Roosevelt to Bill Clinton is, [teacher circled this and the word "had" in next two paragraphs and wrote "const. tense" in margin, the tense is actually correct in this case] John F. Kennedy. Kennedy is the best because he gave the role of Presidency new heights. Three good qualities of Kennedy are that he had [teacher crossed this out and wrote "possessed"] moral integrity, leadership, and intellect.
Kennedy had integrity [teacher circled this and wrote "sp." Chris's spelling is not incorrect] when he was President. For one thing, he was honest about his qualities for president. He was a democrat, 42-years old when he ran, he was a congressman and a senator, had a wealthy, catholic family, and he was a hero in World War II. Even though those were his drawbacks, he used them as an advantage in his television debut. [teacher wrote "weak support" in margin]
Kennedy had leadership when he was a President. His leadership was expressed when he did two things: when he gave his famous speech, "Ask not what your country can do for you, but ask what you could do for your country." And when he ended the Cuban Missile Strike by putting the country under "quarantine."
And [teacher crossed this out] Kennedy had intellect when he was a President. It was obvious; to put $9 billion towards space programs, he probably would have known a possible way to put a man on the moon before he put the money towards it.[teacher wrote, "another example????"]
To sum it up [teacher crossed this out], John F. Kennedy was the best President; he had moral integrity, leadership, and intellect. Compared to the other Presidents from Franklin Roosevelt to Bill Clinton, they could not have said a better speech, or put the money to a better use.

"Who was our best President?" essay (RD): [Rough Draft]
The best President from Franklin Roosevelt to Bill Clinton is, John F. Kennedy. Kennedy is the best, [Chris crossed out this comma] because he gave the role of Presidency new heights. 3 [Chris crossed this out and wrote, "three"] good qualities of Kennedy are that he was honest, a great leader, and pretty smart. [Chris crossed out "was" and replaced these words with "had moral integrety, leadership, and intellect."]
Kennedy was an honest[Here he drew lines to the above handwritten phrase. The paper is cluttered with many other lines meant to incorporate the new phrasing throughout the essay.] president. For one thing, he was honest about his qualities for president. He was a democrat, 42-years old when he ran, he was a congressman and a senator, had a wealthy, catholic family, and a hero in World War II. Even though those were his drawbacks, he used them as an advantage in his television debut.
Kennedy was a great leader. His leadership was expressed when he did two things: when he gave his famous speech, "Ask not what your country can do for you, but ask what you could do for your country." And when he ended the Cuban Missile Strike by putting the country under "quarantine."
And Kennedy was a very smart man. It was obvious; to put money towards space programs, he probably would have known a possible way to put a man on the moon before he put the money towards it. [Here Chris wrote, "$9,000,000,000.00"]
To sum it up, John F. Kennedy was the best President; he was honest, a good leader, and pretty smart. Compared to the other Presidents from Franklin Roosevelt to Bill Clintion, they could not have said a better speech, or put the money to a better use.
Warm Fuzzies
A page in which Chris's classmates wrote positive things about him, presumably as a teacher-mandated attempt to bring each other "Warm Fuzzies" and promote acceptance among the class. Most of his classmates clearly stuck by the adage "If you don't have anything nice to say, give a light, generic compliment instead." The things they wrote suggest that Chris's random-access humor was in abundant use by this stage.

A planning sheet and rough draft of an essay about how high school students' jobs affect their school performance (not a problem for Chris, of course). Chris inexplicably drew a star at the beginning of each line. An editor (transcribed below in bold; hopefully a peer, but unfortunately probably the teacher) has made numerous false corrections of things that were not incorrect, as well as making grievous spelling and grammar errors in their written comments.

To conclude this essay, I would reccomend that for those students who are interested in a job, to maybe only work on weekends, and wait till the summer to work on weekdays. In fact, according to the survey, if working students had a choice, to quit work or school, 73% said, work is out, school is in.

Chris suggests in this Standards of Learning (SOL) essay that his high school's "seinor" class should fund the construction of an indoor swimming pool in the gym as their class gift, exhibiting that he has no notion of how much that would cost. He alludes to gym teachers having "wet-wild" times with the students in the prospective pool; it's unclear whether this is an attempt at innuendo or that Chris genuinely didn't realize how it sounded.

S. O. L. Test, 2
S.O.L. Test:
Every year, the Seinor/Graduating class presents a gift for the school. The money for their gift is taken out of the Seinor fund. Usually, each gift is great for the future students, and the school. My idea for a class gift, would be to have an indoor swimming pool built in the gym area.
With the addittion of the swimming pool, it could do great things for the studnets, and the school, and P.E. classes. Since the students have to wait until next summer to cool off, and exercise in a pool, they could keep those legs and arms "seaworthy" with the pool in the gym. It would also be a great option for P.E. classes, besides basketball, jogging, and weight-lifting, the (PE) teachers could have a "wet-wild" time with the students. And the school would have a swim-team, and compete with other "pool-filled" schools.
An indoor pool would be a great benefit for the students, school, and P.E. teachers/classes. That is why I think an indoor-swimming pool would be a great graduation gift for the school.
13 Lucky Writing Tips
Main article: 13 Lucky Writing Tips
This document is perhaps the single most baffling example of Chris's writing currently on record, which is no mean feat. The 13 Lucky Writing Tips are a list of notes Chris took which were most likely suggestions and recommendations (duly ignored) from a textbook that were read off by a teacher.
Directly contradicting the very first item on the list, Chris switches from English to Spanish mid-sentence about a third of the way through the list.
Spanish
Adjectives worksheet
This work is dated 8/2/99, most likely referring to 8 February 1999 using the Spanish date format. Chris used pop culture figures (Pokémon, Sonic, The Powerpuff Girls) to illustrate vocabulary words. Chris's class seems to have watched the Spanish dub of The Powerpuff Girls in class[4], so for once he had an excuse for shoving fictional characters into his schoolwork. His Pokémon are revealing: he describes Christian the Charmeleon as muy delgado ("very thin"), Ricardo the Raichu as muy divertido ("very funny"), and Cole the Beedrill as muy feo ("very ugly").
This appears to be Chris's earliest reference to Pokemon. It had been introduced in North America four months earlier.

Las Profesiones worksheet
This ungraded worksheet deals with labeling various people with job titles, and then stating whether they are bueno o malo ("good or bad" – at their work, presumably). Chris refers to Ricardo as a bombero ("firefighter"), and to Bob as an ingeniero técnico ("technical engineer"). Demonstrating his mastery of Spanish, Chris described every single person on the worksheet as bueno, and wrote de ("of") instead of es ("is") for a few rows, resulting in nonsensical phrases like April de reportera de TV bueno. ("April of good TV reporter.").

Las profesiones y nacionalidad
Hm, yeah... Looks about right.
A worksheet which required pictures of six different professions and six different flags, with one profession and flag combination per page, and sentences describing each page (e.g. El es un médico cubano, or "He is a Cuban doctor"). Chris opted to hand-draw each page with Crayola Magic Markers, using Lego minifigures and/or Lego catalog photos as models. Note that the United States flag (complete with 25 pentagrams and 15 stripes) is depicted waving in the breeze, while the flags of all other nations are shown flat.

Mock Job Interview
This section is still yet to be completed due to stress. We get a lot of stressful torture in our lives that makes us crash into slumber. Given that inspiration is a big variable, and we may have been lacking of it, this section will be completed as soon as possible, at our own pace... HONEST!
A hypothetical résumé Chris created for a chemistry-related job, plus a score sheet for a mock job interview for such a role. Despite being marked as meeting all of the objectives to an acceptable standard (and some even to a high standard), Chris's employment record turned out to be less than stellar.
