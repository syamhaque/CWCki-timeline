Where did you very first discover Chris? Was it on /v/ or /b/? Also, what was the first move you made to troll Chris? I know Medic takes alot of the credit for the early days of CWC trolling, did he really have a big effect or was most of it handed to him? Nigroid 17:25, 10 February 2011 (PST)

Is the PVCC kind of boring? Barachulove 23:17, 11 February 2011 (PST)
if you're looking for chris shit, super boringo. there's like one user who keeps annoying everyone about chris shit and everyone's like shut up we're talking about donkey kong country returns now and he's like but wait can't we and we're like SHUT THE FUCK UP CHRIST and we lock his topics because that's how we fucking roll seriously it's like a stupid generic message board now the only reason we couldn't want to let people in is because it is a small tight knit community or smoething and really if you wanted to join you'd have been in #sonichu and we chillin with us and we'd let you in because that's the type of person we'd want in that community who shares the same interests and feelings you know because we got that same type of emotional connection but not in a gay way dude but like friendship like in that game mortal kombat you know -- Clyde 15:30, 12 February 2011 (PST)

Is it true that there have been several people who have used the moniker "Clyde Cash" throughout the trolling of Chris, and you are in fact the third such person to do so? Nigroid 14:02, 18 February 2011 (PST)

Do you have any plans for Chris' birthday? Not you-know-who...I mean you in particular. I was thinking about buying a shitty toy gun and shooting at a dartboard with a picture of his face taped to it. Totally wholesome. --EdtheHedgehog1894 12:46, 22 February 2011 (PST)
