HairDifference are two videos Chris uploaded on 30 October 2010. The first video shows Chris's hair which hasn't been washed in a "few days", and the second video shows the hair after it has been washed with some "good Axe... shampoo, conditioner with anti-dandruff". To the surprise of no one, his plateaued hair, when washed, looks just as horrendous as it does unwashed.

Well it's been a while after my shuts— it's been a while after my shower. My hair— some time to dry. Now look at it now. Not oily and much more fuller. Not so stringy either.
And I used…
[Chris pulls out a bottle of shampoo.]
…Axe Armor! Anti-dandruff shampoo and conditioner!
[Chris puts down the bottle.]
Use it to put a shine on your hairy head! Make all the jokes you want. I won't care.
[Chris puts on his glasses with the blue modeling clay on it.]
And I've lost my nose piece recently. Had to fabricate a new one out of model magic.
