Title: Keep Sonic Original

Categories: Category, Facebook
================================================================================

Keep Sonic Original was a Facebook page constructed by Chris's friends for his benefit in his holy crusade to force Sega to reverse their decision to give a blue tint to the arms of Sonic the Hedgehog in the new game/TV show Sonic Boom. It had a short lifespan but saw considerable participation by Chris, most of it angry and hostile.

The Page is Formed
Chris was on a mission to destroy all images of the blue-armed bandit in the known universe. This was a multifaceted protest, involving shouting in public, vandalizing stores, spamming websites, and macing GameStop employees. It also involved Facebook. Originally, Chris used his own Facebook page, CwcvilleGuardian, to proselytize, but eventually saw the wisdom of a separate topical public group where outraged fans could gather and do what Chris commanded. The page was founded on 13 November 2014. The manager was Kenneth Engelhardt.
About
The purpose of this group is to express our concerns to Sega about the the changes that have been made to Sonic the Hedgehog. The old adage: "If something isn't broken, don't fix it" is especially valid in the case of recent changes to Sonic the Hedgehog. This group feels that the recent changes to Sonic's arms (i.e. changing the color to blue) is detrimental to the quality of the character.
Images
Chris posted these images without comment on 13 November:

Gameplay doesn't matter
14 November 2014
I Do Not Care about the gameplay, stories, or that it is Fucking Cannon or Not! The Blue Arms on the Blue Hedgehog are Totally a Major SENSORY OVERLOAD TO ME!!!
Sensory overload
14 November 2014
In response to Ryan's post on this page, I totally agree with him on the total colour balance on Sonic, and having blue arms with blue everywhere else on there REALLY IS TOO DAMN MUCH.
Seriously, when I see the blue arms on the blue everywhere, I get a sensory overload so bad, that it drives me crazy. I have literally lost a bunch of sleep and peace of mind over the Arm Colour change. And that is more than reflected in my posts and comments between near Every Image of Sonic With the Blue Arms on the official Sonic the Hedgehog Facebook page.
Sonic's Arm Colour MUST BE CHANGED BACK NOW!!!
If you ever loved me, you'll do it
In response to an utterly offensive cartoon, Chris responded:
14 November 2014
Remove This Image, PLEASE!!!
Not funny
Another typical male troll posted another unacceptable image, prompting Chris to comment:
15 November 2014
I Disapprove of this image.
Please remove it.
Stop trolling
Administrator Kenneth proclaimed:
15 November 2014
For the record, this group was specifically set up to rally for a specific cause (i.e. Sonic's arms). I don't mind a certain amount discussion in other areas, but if you come in here and bring your trolling crap with inflammatory posts, I'm going to delete them and if you continue with this sort of thing I'm going to show you the door. If there is some kind of an issue you have please message me privately.
Chris replied:
Good Call, Ken
Sonic not dead
15 November 2014
Sonic the Hedgehog is NOT Dead. And any reference in text or image towards such an outlandish statement shall be immediately removed by my associate running the group.
Not everyone listened to Chris
16 November 2014
Remove this Post!
Retail store managers are not exempt
16 November 2014
If you look closely, you can see his reflection. He's wearing his Parappa hat.
Now THIS REALLY DISAPPOINTS ME! At the local Target in CVille, they are nearly sold out of the damn Games as well.
Not only that, but I ended up in a dispute with Blue Arm Promoters there; the "Security" Janekop, and the Manajerk, Jamie. We ended up in a heated discussion over the Sensory Overloading of the Blue Arms, and that they should NOT have stocked the shit games as well. The discussion ended peacefully, but with disgruntled disagreements among us.
I encourage everyone in this VA area to look up either of them, and encourage them to SEND THE GAMES BACK TO THE COMPANY, AND BUY BACK THE ONES THEY SOLD AND SHIP THEM BACK AS WELL!
Do That EVERYWHERE ELSE that is selling the Damn Games as well!
No spoilers
16 November 2014
New Note: Any Spoilers, or such, of the content in the Sonic Boom Games and TV Show, are not allowed on the group timeline is not permitted, until when SEGA finally wises up, Recall EVERYTHING of them, and change the game Inserts, Data, and Cartoon Content, to reflect Sonic with his Original Color Arms. I am BOYCOTTING the TV Show altogether, as well as ANYTHING of the show and game on YouTube. Also, leaving NEGATIVE FEEDBACK, REVIEWS, DISLIKES AND THUMBS DOWN ON EVERYTHING [cut off - incomplete]
Send polite messages to CN
16 November 2014
SONIC'S ARMS ARE NOT BLUE, AND THEY SERIOUSLY CAUSE SENSORY OVERLOADS IN ME!!! PLEASE ENCOURAGE CN TO REMOVE ALL OF THEIR SONIC BOOM IMAGES, VIDEOS, AND THE TV SHOW ALTOGETHER FROM THEIR FACEBOOK, FROM THEIR CN WEBSITE, AND FROM THEIR CHANNEL IMMEDIATELY!!!
I hate this joke
A site member posted a Reddit comment about an autistic child who hated Sonic Boom, along with the note, "Apparently Sonic Boom is so bad playing it can cure autism! LOL!" Chris replied:
16 November 2014
NOT APPROVED! This is a damn lie! Please Remove this image and comment! I Hate This Joke! >:(
NOT JOKING
17 November 2014
I Feel I need to Remind Everyone that I AM SERIOUS, and I HAVE BEEN SERIOUS ABOUT THIS FOR MONTHS!
This is NOT a Joke, Parody or Spoof. I am sick of all of the Terrible Posts that have more recently been made.
The Fake Takashi
Later, a ween pretending to be Takashi Iizuka (the head of Sonic Team) asked Chris to give Sonic Boom a chance. This is when Chris made a post showing him to be actually learning thanks to his Facebook friend Anna:
17 November 2014
The "Takashi" on here is a FAKE! I have just checked his profile, and visually confirmed it!
Your Profile is JUST MADE, it is very short, and LACKS A LOT OF CONTENT. By the rules backed up by my friend, Anna, You Are Nothing But a Damn Imposterous Troll.
Sign the petition
Chris linked to www.ipetitions.com and wrote:
17 November 2014
Petition Keep Sonic Original
RIGHT! Sign this Petition, Please!
Cannonade
A site member correctly pointed out:
Guys, do you realise this game isn't canon of the original sonic? the 'Sonic' in Sonic boom is a descendant of original Sonic in the distant future.
Chris lashed out:
20 November 2014
That does Not Matter with the freaking issue! Did I not make it clear that I DO NOT CARE RATHER OR NOT IT IS FREAKING CANNON OR NOT?!
OMG!!! I soo fucking hate that word, Cannon, in the definition of Matching or Related!!! I have Hated it since that definition of the word Confused Me from after its introduction to me while I was drawing my comics years ago! Which led to me losing my inspiration to draw more among other troll and bully abusive reasons! >:(
Later he realized that there was a second issue he had with the post:
DID I NOT MAKE IT CLEAR NOT TO POST ANYTHING ABOUT THE GAMES OR TV SHOWS THAT ARE SPOILER-ALERT-WORTHY? STOP IT!!!
Do what I say
On 26 November, Chris left a series of irate messages, rejecting any hint of compromise. His fury made him even less coherent than usual.
26 November 2014
WE ALL MUST COMPLAIN DIRECTLY AND LOUDLY UNTIL WE ARE ALL BLUE IN THE MOUTH TO GET WHAT WE WANT SEGA TO DO FOR THE SONIC BOOM DONE AND DONE RIGHT!!!
(To quote from the Parrot Sketch as well, and it stands valid here)
I will NEVER Accept the Monsterous Change EVER!!!
26 November 2014
Has everyone one [sic] here forgotten how important the PROTEST of the Blue Arms is to not only me, but to the number of other people who feel the same way?!
They have been Pissing Me Off for MONTHS Since the E3 TV Show Trailer before the E3 expo happened!!! >:(
And Software Updates and Add-On Content are Not Enough At All!!! the TV Show, Initial Disc and Card Software and PAPER INSERTS; ALL IF THOSE DIGITAL AND PRINTED IMAGES NEED TO BE RECALLED AND FIXED IMMEDIATELY!!! I do not give a crap about the stories and shit! I NEED AND WANT THOSE ARMS CHANGED BACK TO FLESH COLOUR IMMEDIATELY!!! So, Ger [sic] SEGA On That NOW!!! >:(
26 November 2014
I WANT To Directly Speak to the People at SEGA, In Person, Right Here in Virginia, at my House, and sort this out directly and give them the big piece of my mind!!! >:(
Responding to hints from Kenneth that the group was temporary and would soon be closed, Chris replied:
26 November 2014
Hell No!!! This Group Is PERMANENT, ONLY to be closed AFTER the Disc and Card Software, Game Inserts, TV SHOW CARTOONS, Toys, AN EVEN Clothes of Sonic Boom Are Fixed To Arm Colour Perfection!!!
I AM SPEAKING, AND I HAVE SPOKEN!!!
Billy earns a gold star sticker
The same day, Chris had a heated exchange with site member William Waterman over revealing spoilers.
26 November 2014
Billy!!! DID I NOT MAKE IT CLEAR NOT TO POST ANYTHING ABOUT THE GAMES OR TV SHOWS THAT ARE SPOILER-ALERT-WORTHY? STOP IT!!!
Waterman replied:
Woah, sorry.
I thought it was a minor thing that wasn't spoilerific.
How do I edit it to remove spoilers?
Chris replied:
Do you not have common sense? If you do not have the option, get Kenneth to delete it for you.
Waterman:
I deleted it, but I wanna try to post it in a way that doesn't reveal anything, just my opinions.
like what if I said "this certain element they're trying to use, i don't like."
forget it. I won't post it again.
Chris:
Thank you for understanding my point.
Waterman:
So is that your problem with people posting screenshots and videos of it?
Chris:
Let me elaborate a bit:...
Something you REALLY DETEST, gets made into a REAL VIDEO GAME AND A TV SERIES AND A TOY LINE. From such, it makes it as Official as The Adventurs of Sonic the Hedgehog when IT originally aired.
And when you do not want to hear a damn thing about that which you detest while you are protesting it, YOU WOULD NOT WANT ANYONE TELLING YOU ANYTHING ABOUT ITS STORY, CONTENT, or SHIT!
And having such Revealing Content on the Page AGAINST the thing you hate while you are RALLYING YOUR SUPPORT TROOPS TO DISPELL IT, would Jeopardize your operation! Because if the story arcs and content should SPARK INTERSET in your ranks, and your TROOPS LEAVE THE GROUP, the success of your protest FALLS!
Now, do you understand, Billy Witch Doctor Dot Com?
Waterman:
Oh. For a minute I thought you didn't want to be spoiled because you wanted to get it from a bargain bin or second hand someday so you wouldn't be giving sega the money.
You really have no interest in the story at all? Just afraid others might get interested in it if they see it. Okay.
Chris:
You have earned a Gold Star sticker right there.
Spergweb is suspicious
Chris voiced his opinion about another supposed Chris-Chan fan site:
26 November 2014
I do not like Spergweb, especially after clicking a link in another comment. Looks Trollish and Suspicious.
Chris is kicked out
On 29 November 2014, Chris went too far, and promoted violence and death threats while raging at Sega.
29 November 2014
Another thing of interest from what Billy figured out, I AM NOT IN IT AT ALL FOR BUYING THE BLUE ARMED GAME FOR QUICK REDUCED VALUE EITHER! And On That, if we continue to take it Slow, the software WILL be reduced, and the TV Show will run its Course, and Everything will have been done to death!
NO!!! WE NEED TO KILL SEGA INTO RECALLING EVERYTHING NOW!!! EVEN IF WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING LIKE PUT KNIVES AND BOMBS TO THEIR TROATS[sic]!!! AND WE MUST MAKE ALL THE STORES SEND ALL THINGS SONIC BOOM BACK TO SEGA IN THE NAME OF RECALL, AND FORCE CARTOON NETWORK TO PULL THE SHOW, AND FORCE SEGA TO FIX THE ARMS IN EVERY FREAKING EPISODE THERE AS WELL NOW!!!
Even his friends felt this was going too far. Kenneth wisely kicked him out of the group:
29 November 2014
Anyone making bomb or knife threats is out and will only be let back in by special permission.
For some reason, the ban was temporary, but Chris was on his way out anyhow. On the same day as the ban, Chris advertised his new group, FIX SONIC'S ARMS IMMEDIATELY, SEGA!!!. A few days later he concluded:
3 December 2014
I'm sorry, but since this old group has been hacked and is now under Trolling Stupid Control: I am leaving this old group and moving forward with My new group.
While Kenneth then intended to delete the group, it was seized by weens and persisted into the new year.
