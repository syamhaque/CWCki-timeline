Hurricane Harvey and SLGBT
4 September
@KisakaToriama
This weekend we raised money for Hurricane Harvey victims during stream & here's what we donated!
So proud of everyone ♡ Thank you!!
Congratulation! I've donated $20 to the Red Cross, and I just donated $20 to UMCOR at my church yesterday, for the same Harvey cause. 🤘😊💖
Considering your logo there, Texas will be feeling more love from the SLGBTQ community; give us props and Love, Lone Star State.
@Aspergercorn
It's LGBTQ, no S.
The "S" is for Straight/Cisgender people, so they do not feel left out of the community.
@RaeIsConfused
Adding the S literally destroys the entire meaning of LGBT...
Chris is spending money on things that aren't bills

On painkillers and tea
4 September
@ArachnidMafia
I love painkillers. Especially when they don't work.
@LadyOfTheCosmo
That urks me when that happens, would you like a spot of tea with that?
@ArachnidMafia
Fuck good idea Imma go make tea
Chris butted in:
I take a Non-Aspirin (CVS store brand) for my pain-killer; take two, and the pain and discomfort usually fades away. For tea, I like making an Arnold Palmer. I've found the best combination is at McD: one part Lite M.M. Lemonade and three parts sweet tea. 🍋
@JohnTakeDrugsI:
Its better with alcohol, Dont yo think.
In the tea, it's okay. But not so much with the non-aspirin.

LOL!
And now I'm recalling more anime! Nana was awesome! Trigun, Outlaw Star, Kill La Kill, Carried By the Wind-Tsukikage Ran, and Panty&Stocking

No, but I can see what's new through Crunchyroll, Hulu or Netflix.

And that's a bad thing? Nah!
not according to Doopie and the hundreds of other people youve creeped on and harassed
How many? You underestimate how many haters follow me. LOL 🤣🤣🤣
"Never leave people alone" or "Never shut the f*** up"? I like to think and talk, and I'm happy to have everyone to talk with and listen to.

Personally, I like the Minis better than the dolls. Less hair fuss, easier to customize, and they can stand on the stands from Shopkins.
Chris attempts to mediate
6 September
In response to @Vinyl_Star1 ranting at @Jimmy_naTor
You're alright. But every person is as cool as they are to themselves; it is a deep level that is not often seen by those visibly as cool.
And, regardless, you two share a collection hobby; no need to dispute over differences. Friendship bonds are mightier than that.

Chris thinks trolls are envious of him
14 September
The hateful trolls are just jealous that SONICHU and my life has entertained more people than they could ever entertain in their lives.
@Romanian_Snow
I don't think you entertain people in the way you think you do.
Does that matter?
Well, I don't know, does it? I'm not trying to get at you, I'm saying there is a difference between people laughing at you and people laughing with you
As long as people are laughing I'm happy.
@WillIsMaster
Then why are the trolls an issue if they're laughing at you?

WTF?
LOL!
WHAT
@Wappaishanimate
have you not been enlightened to the legend of grand dad? Or perhaps you are unaware of the odyssey reveal
I am very aware of 7 Grand Dad, as I was educated about it by @BehindTheMeme on his YouTube channel. I also can cite Biggie's order.
"I'll have 2 # 9s, a # 9 large, a # 6 with extra dip, a # 7, two # 45s, one with cheese, and a large soda." Funny memes. 😊👍🌸

Well, I'm helping y'all on Patreon, Gooby, and my offer for the Sonichu/PD crossover book remains on the table. Hell, even in the Tooniverse, shall we call it neutrally, Sonichu and the gang (minus Wild Sonichu and his family), have already visited Planet Dolan, and enjoyed hanging out with them. Blake sure caused a fistful of hell in Hellbent's underground hell. Good times. Just saying.

First item right now: Here is the FULL Night Star Image I had created for my alt-Twitter account.
You can tell it's mine, because of my favorite E.U.P. in the background: Octavia, Vinyl Scratch, and Derpy/Muffins, just being there.
I made the Night Star image with other images in combinations; Photoshop. Y'all would not have thought I was that smart to make it Pro.

Following in your CMC friends' footsteps? That is a Big step for you. Definitely consider what you can offer everyone for their pledges. 🍀
I can tell your family has already been a big help for you; keep them very close in your loop.
Corelett later made a separate tweet.
Awesome!

Someone was very punful and jolly yesterday. 😊
Chris is fat and stupid
21 September
Want to naturally grow larger breasts? I eat 12 Prunes a day, and I put soy sauce on Non-Sweets; this Really Works for me!
Jessica Quinn:
Can't wait to see the results. Good luck! 😉 Those French fries look amazing by the way.
Kengle, on Twitter:
Just FYI, Soy Sauce is made with brine, which means your diet is loaded with Sodium and your body is retaining fluid. And if you are sprinkling that "reduced sodium" soy sauce on everything that is non-sweet, you're defeating its purpose.
By the way, there was no salt on these chips/fries. No purpose defeated. And can you imagine the taste of soy sauce on a cupcake? 😣
On Facebook, Kim Wilson and Chris argued:
Phytoestrogens (like in soy and prunes) don't increase estrogen in the body.
Soy=estrogen is a false meme going around the transgender community.
The soy sauce will seriously increase sodium levels though. Prunes will make you poop alot.
Soy and prunes aren't a recipe for bigger busts or feminization. They're a recipe for salty poops.
Big price; big difference.

Oh god, yeah I've seen crap like this before.
It's really sad, but lots of girls fall for pseudoscience like this.
See, they prey off of women's insecurities about their bodies to make a quick buck.
The first website you linked is a great example of this sort of immoral exploitation. They list a bunch of foods and then they keep pointing out "but there's no evidence this works LOL!"
It's horribly misogynistic.
It reminds me of those pro-anorexia websites, although not quite as bad.
why can't you say something Supportive or positive for once here?
Though I think most women in America know better than to fall for these tricks.
I'm sure you know better. You've been tricked by internet trolls so many times, I'm sure you won't fall for this.
You're not that dumb lol. I know you, you're smart.
I'm supportive. But I don't support false hope. I don't want to see you tricked again.
I have common sense and judgment; I figured it was worth a try. And I found these links under My own choice and decision, and I started under My own idea.
Breast enhancement is very similar to penis enlargement. Your most effective options are surgery, or to gain/lose weight.
Gain weight and some of it might go to your chest. Lose weight, and you get more length on your penis.
Good Grief!
Yes, it's unfortunate, but that's how it is. In nature, mankind doesn't actually make big use of penises and boobs.
Muscles and fat are very important in nature, so they can change dramatically. Storing fat for winter. Building up muscle for hunting and gathering. Both important things to humans in the wild.
But there's no biological reason for genitalia to dramatically change size. So it doesn't happen in nature.
Jessica Quinn:
Kim dear, you need to lighten up. There's no harm being done here. If it doesn't work I'm sure she'll try a different avenue. Surgery is extremely expensive so I doubt that route is even an option at this point in time. It's not that bizarre, people eat all sorts of stuff way stranger that soy sauce on fries 😛
No trying to be a pain, but she's a big girl and can make these decisions on her own.
Chris attempts to reassure someone, begins talking about self instead
21 September
In response to @JaJamesa92
Hi, Elizabeth. I want to tell you that you Are a beautiful soul. You are you, and we support you. I, too, had similar troubles as I hear about you. I was, for a very long time, depressed; I felt lost, I even felt isolated. I was unable to tell kind people from the haters, and I ended up closing myself off. Because of that, I was really missing out on the things that I truly enjoyed and cared about. I was unable to create new pages for my comic book pages, as the world I had created, and my family of electric-hedgehog Pokémon, continued to grow and expand from Every Little and Big thing I had put into it all beforehand. Because of the overwhelming amount of trolling, bullying and hatred I had to endure, just really killed my mood and emotional buzz. I even had thoughts of suicide, but I never acted upon that at all; I always realized right after that impulse thought that I was still here, and there was at least a small reason for me being here.
Then I did my own deep self-soul searching, and I found myself, and I came out as the lesbian transwoman that I am and always have been without knowing. I opened up to my newfound communities in the SLGBTQ, and I was met with a Lot of genuine kindness. And I was met with a Lot More Kindness from a number of my Sonichu and Rosechu fans at #BronyCon2017 as well as a lot of other caring people aside from that. It was really welcoming, and I had found a new love for myself as I was able to accept with all of my heart and soul who I am. And I like to create, and expand my worlds, and I like to share smiles, love, kindness and support to others. And thanks to @tarastrong , I found I was needed here at this time.
Elizabeth, you are a beautiful soul and person; if you haven't yet, look deep into yourself to learn more and better grasp at who you are, accept yourself, love yourself. You do not have to be depressed; let your inner light shine; you have a lot of awesome inner beauty. Take good care of yourself; block out the hatred, and let the kindness and support from others and yourself fill your heart and soul. 🌸🌸🌸
In response to another tweet from @JaJamesa92
I'm happy to help. Keep loving yourself, Elizabeth. 😊
@JaJamesa2 responded, presumably to weens warning her about Chris's utter inability to interact with women in a platonic manner:
It's ok you guy's she's sharing her story and I don't mind reading it she's not hitting on me lol.
That's right. Thank you for getting that.
GODDAMN Chris stop! You are a taken man!
Taken Woman, and I was not hitting on anyone here.
Firstly, I am a Woman. 2nd, I do not hit on Anyone; People, please, Stop assuming I hit on Anyone. That was Never my intent in talking, OK?!
Chris continues to rage

Photo of Sorbet

In response to a tweet from @JaJamesa92
Looks like my cat, Sorbet. He likes to be cuddly too.
@S4evee, responding to @Eclair_Pearl and @JaJamesa92 ignoring the photo of Sorbet
Are you two just dancing around the fact that Chris's cat has an infected eye and nobody's going to do anything about it!
It one thing to be blindly supportive of someone, but this poor poor cat is in a world of pain and needs help.
@JaJamesa92
I looked into it I really don't know her that well but I've mentioned that Sorbet needs to go to the vet.
The ulcer in Sorbet's eye is all healed up.
What remains in his eye, unfortunately, seems to be permanent, but he very healthy and well.
@JaJamesa92
How do you know for a fact that Sorbet isn't already going to the vet infections heal physical damage can be forever.
He was
@JaJamesa92
Is it possible Sorbet has already been to the vet or does something about his eye show an existing infection?
The photo was from a couple of months ago
@JaJamesa92
I've been looking into it and though most people seem to be trolling Sorbet does need to go to the vet his eye isn't supposed to stay cloudy
The eye has become a Lot less cloudy.
Chris hunts for the artist of fanart he plagarized
23 September
I've been searching to learn the artist's name who drew this fan comic; I have been searching DeviantArt. Ah. Please, tell me, who drew it?
I want to cite him/her in a subtle joke between pages 80 and 81 of Sonichu 12. Also, Thank You; it did help in the story.
You copied entire segments from it.Nothing suble about it.
No, Not entire segments
Chris has begun the hunt for his next victim.
No
One, two. Chris Chan's looking for you.

Chris misinterprets advice he will never follow
24 September
Note: Nowaking still has Chris blocked on Twitter.
@Nowacking makes a true and awesome point. I got started when I felt the urge; no later. My drawing style has improved over the years.
I agree with her; if I had not started on my character creation on that March 17, 2000, there would not have been very much Sonichu now. 🌸

I listened a bit and they talked about Wieners too much for my tastes. I can Transcript it for you to read and leave out any naughty parts!
Nah, I have already heard it.

That is the difference between Trans Gender and Vestites: ID as the other sex, and just dressing like it, respectively.

Chris attempts to justify stealing from fanartists
29 September
In response to @IvonneM2555061 accusing him of stealing stealing fanart for his Patreon banner.
Banner?
The banner in your patreon page, it's from a fancomic
It’s a lovely piece of art, I am not stealing it, I am using it in full appreciation of the artist that drew it, as much as possible.
And, it doesn’t matter: it has Sonichu and Rosechu; they both, all the others and the city of Cwcville, are mine, regardless.
