================================================================================

ClydeGoingOnGregg1 is the first of Chris's many planned threats against Clyde Cash/Gregg Mays, where he threatens to blackmail Clyde by revealing aspects of his personal life on 27 October 2009. The only evidence in this first video is a low-res picture of a man's head. Note that Chris seriously believes he's playing with fire, and thinks that trolls will instantly turn upon their Glorious Leader simply by seeing an undecipherable picture of his head shopped onto a Calvin and Hobbes parody.
Description
Clyde's FIRST ATTEMPT WAS SHORT, LAME and NOT SATISFACTORY. HE WORE A PAPER MASK; HE spoke too fast to comprehend.
HE IS WEAK AND FEEBLE.

[Image of low res-head of some white guy, shopped onto the famous image of Calvin (of Calvin and Hobbes) peeing is held up to the camera.]
Trolls of the internet. Remember this, as this is the face of your supposed leader: Clyde Cash. Now this is just a small foretaste of the beginning of his downfall. There is more to this though... Photoshopped picture, than meets the eye. For every day he does not upload a good satisfactory video, with the pro- with the promise, and his o- tell-all details, I will reveal more and more of this. And the- more and more of the background. Until it is fully com- until it is fully exposed.
So there. Clyde, you have another 12... 24 hours.
