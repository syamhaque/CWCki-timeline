JCWCSP Sings So Need a Cute Girl, 2025 is a video uploaded to Chris's YouTube channel on 10 October 2025. In it, Chris sings the 2016 remake of his signature song "So Need a Cute Girl" with altered lyrics, dedicating it to the incel community.
This is probably the closest Chris has come to acknowledging his relationship with Flutter, saying to incels, "I was like one of you. The situation was not in my favor once upon a time... but then, I still perspired [sic] and now I'm definitely in a much better place than I was a couple of decades ago or so."

Description
I am singing the (updated) "So Need a Cute Girl" Song, personally.
This one goes out to all of the incels of the world. Have Faith, head out, and follow the Light Powered Path from within you, even YOU can find your own partner, rather it be Straight, Gay, Lesbian, even yourself, whatever identity. Because, in order to find love and peace for yourself involves caring about your self, so you can attract those who will authentically care about and love you as well. Spiritual, Soul Attraction is, indeed, real. If you open up to the energies and vibes, you will find your way to the one who will be with you in the longest run, period. Prayer, Sorting yourself out, Setting your Priorities, knowing what you are looking for in your life partner; they are valid to do in your own Soul Searching, Deeper Thoughts and Meditaitons.
Follow that which IS good and Light Powered, and you will be guided, respectively.
Music is "I Want It That Way", Instrumental, by Backstreet Boys.

Hey everybody, Jesus Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu Prime here once again... and, well, this one goes out to all of the incels out there. I wanted to give y'all a personal message, even though for a while I'll admit I was like- I was like one of you. [sigh] The situation was not in my favor once upon a time... but then, I still perspired and now I'm definitely in a much better place than I was a couple of decades ago or so. So, this one goes out to you humbly and gratefully, and I pray that this will inspire you to at least try to overcome your shyness and everything, so you can actually go out there. Cuz if you pray, if you follow that which is good and Light Powered, you will be able to find your love for yourself. Whether it's your- whether it's the love of yourself, or whether it be a gay love, or lesbian love, or of course even... [sigh] But whatever orientation- straight, that was the word I was looking for. Even a straight love. [sigh] Either way, when you find a love for yourself and with your partner, it will work out well... and prayfully, you will find your partners. Just take that good faith and hope and everything... and have faith and pray, for it is right and it is good. [inhale and exhale] Thank you. Alright...
Hey, look at me
I stood here sad and lonely
Without a fire,
But a desire
To not hear you say,
"I'm already taken!"
As I saw da ladies walking
Along one by one,
I never wanted to hear,
"I'm already taken!"
Tell me why
I was a virgin with rage!
Tell me why
I needed a cute girl my age!
Tell me why
I ain't ever wanted to hear,
"I'm already taken!"
And I have no fire,
But a desire
Not to hear you say that,
"I was already taken!"
Tell me why
I was a virgin with rage!
Tell me why
I need a cute girl my age!
Tell me why
I never wanted to hear,
"I'm already taken!"
Why did all of the jerks
Get all the pretty ones? (Yeah)
You may not know this,
But you found out
That I was a lonesome heart!
And I had no fire,
But a desire
To not, to not, to not
Heeeaaar…
DIDN'T WANNA HEAR IT!
Stuck as a virgin with rage!
Needed a cute girl my age!
I never wanted to hear,
"I'm already taken!"
Tell me why
I was a virgin with rage!
(Tell me why)
I needed a cute girl my age!
Tell me why
I never wanted to hear,
"I'm already taken!"
Tell me why
I was a virgin with rage!
I needed a cute girl my age!
Tell me why
I never wanted to hear,
"I'm already taken!"
But now I'm in a better place
And I am very grateful for that.
