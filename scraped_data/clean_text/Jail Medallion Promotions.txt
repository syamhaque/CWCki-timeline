Sometime prior to 4 May 2022, Chris made three recorded speeches from Central Virginia Regional Jail (presumably over the telephone) endorsing medallions sold by Praetor. The recordings were uploaded to Praetor's Google Drive on 4 May, the day after his return from Western State Hospital. The recordings were probably made on 3 May or 4 May, although it is possible that they were recorded before his transfer to the mental hospital in February and subsequently shelved.
Interestingly, Chris pronounces the "Jesus" in his name as "Jesús", like the Spanish name. He previously called himself "Jesus Christ Chan Sonichu" in Jail Call - 13 January 2022, using the regular English pronunciation of the name.

Greetings, everyone. This is Jesús Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu, and this offering I present to you medallions I have personally crafted and signed, but these are even more aware ‘cause these each have a megastone in them. Similar to a Sonichipe or a Rosechipe, but these are more like aurasphere quartzes, but I have personally blessed and programmed each and every one of them with my aura and everything, so these are the most powerful and most potent of the medallions. So, not only do you buy these t- to wear and enjoy, you’re gonna really feel the spiritual aura and charge and vibrations within yourself. And, of course, each purchase does continue to help me as well. So, thank you all so much and enjoy the vibrations that come from me directly as I bless each and every one of you.
