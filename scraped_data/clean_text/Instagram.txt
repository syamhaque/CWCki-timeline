This article, like Chris's pickle, is a bit small. You can help CWCki by expanding it.
This article is still yet to be completed due to stress. We get a lot of stressful torture in our lives that makes us crash into slumber. Given that inspiration is a big variable, and we may have been lacking of it, this article will be completed as soon as possible, at our own pace... HONEST!
Instagram is a social media website owned by Facebook that allows users to share photos and videos with captions and/or various effects. It is one of the biggest social media websites in the world; with such a big platform, it comes as no surprise that Chris would have an account on there.
History of the account
The account was first made in 2018, under the name "christinewestonchandler", and since then has gained over 2000 followers. However, he didn't start posting until early 2021. It's unclear whether or not there were posts before then or not, possibly some lost to time. However, most of Chris's posts consist of things related to magical thinking and Pokemon, along with his daily life as well.
Notable Posts
Some of Chris's most notable posts are about magic, including things about crystals, and chakra tea.
Other than those posts, Chris mainly posts Pokemon cards he makes, with a majority of his Instagram posts are exactly that.
