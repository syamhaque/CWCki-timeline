Hello. Good day once again to all my people on the internet. Christine Chandler coming to you live from house. Yep. And as I just posted and shared on my Facebook, it is literally up to my knees out there with snow; it was even taken past the street into the mailbox. It's gonna be quite longer before anyone gets the car out. So, might not be till the end of the week till I'm able to ship the recent orders out, but the patience will be rewarded. And I appreciate everybody's continued support and patience, and patience, as well as any new orders that come in.
And then we have another...on that note, I would like to present a poem from uh, from a fan who has, uh, made a request unto me, and this is an unpaid solicitation. So, anyways, uh, she writes:
"Dear Christine,
You've brought smiles to my face over the years,
I've felt so much joy at your triumphs,
And pain over your tears,
I first found you online only when I was fifteen,
And found you the most fun online [pauses] person that I've ever seen,
I know you haven't had...haven't had it easy,
So often life has been tough,
But you stayed true to yourself,
And that's the thing I love,
So stay happy Christine,
Appreciate the good, ignore the rest,
There's still a true fan like me out there,
Who always thinks you're the best."
That...that's very nice and lovely. Thank you.
Anyway, so, that's about it for today. I'm continuing work on the orders and everything, I'll have as much as I can shipped out, right after I get out of the house by about the end of the week. Y'all have a great, safe day. Thank you.
