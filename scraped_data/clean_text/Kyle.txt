They've also talked of racism, and Nazi type things. Kyle and MKR; Kyle is definitely worse; talks soo damn much, boasting his smart-talk, interrogating my intentions and present mentalities. Damn, he's seriously tiring.

Kyle, also known as Nova[2] and "BullKyle"[note 1], was a Watchmen higher-up, being Naught's second-in-command. He also became the owner of The Place Discord server after Naught transferred ownership to him after Chris's confrontation of them following Crystalgate.[3] Chris often tried to consult with Kyle for scientific answers related to the Dimensional Merge.
Chris had mixed feelings on Kyle. Chris complimented Kyle as an intelligent and awesome person.[4] However, in a 26 June 2021 text to Null, Chris said that Kyle "talks soo damn much, boasting his smart-talk, interrogating my intentions and present mentalities. Damn, he's seriously tiring."[5] Chris cut contact with Kyle in June 2021, citing him as being among the toxic trio.

Interactions with Chris
Kyle was a frequent chatter in The Place Discord server. He was also present in voice calls such as the Google Hangout chats and Taser Discussion. Kyle was also the inspiration for Chris's Kylechu OC.
On 29-30 September 2019, when discussing the carpetbagger Ben Saint's potential monetization of Chris's content, Kyle pressured Chris to confront Ben by claiming that if Ben developed his version of Chris's Night Star character enough, then Chris could potentially lose legal control of the character.[6]
In December 2019, Kyle had an idea to make a dating sim game, which he and some Watchmen members pitched to Chris. Kyle claimed that the project could make $100,000 in revenue, however Chris lost interest in the project and plans fizzled out.[7]
On 28 August 2020, Chris told Kyle he might have a role to play in helping teleport Chris into CWCville. Chris wanted Kyle to link to the Kyle of dimension 1214. According to Chris, 1214 Kyle had figured out the math and logic to build a dimensional portal device, and Chris wanted Kyle to learn from it.[8]
In chats from December 2020, Kyle brought up the concept of "empty dimensions" to Chris, pondering over how those would function. Chris later contemplated it further and added the concept to his beliefs on dimensions.[4] Later that month, Chris continued trying to convince Kyle to converse with alternate universe Kyles (including Kylechu and a scientist chronicler), to prepare a defense of Earth from dimensional foes.[9]
On 13 February 2021, Naught transferred ownership of The Place Discord server to Kyle.[3]
Chris considered Kyle the most toxic of the "toxic trio", citing him as "the worst and least enlightened".[10]
Taser Discussion
Kyle was one of the first people that Chris had told his plans of shocking his crystals with electricity to, believing that he could help explain piezoelectricity to him, while citing a click-baity article about using the phenomenon to open up portals. Kyle would, however, attempt to reason with Chris regarding this, questioning his findings, to which Chris acted flustered.
Kyle was one of the Watchmen to confront Caden Peck when Chris announced plans to using a taser, believing that he wanted Chris to use one on himself.
