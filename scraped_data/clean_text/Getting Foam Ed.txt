The original image Chris spent over 9000 hours editing in MS Paint.
Getting Foam Ed is the fourth video Chris made in the attempt to blackmail Clyde Cash, uploaded on 31 October 2009. Chris shows us his ability of copying (poorly) the style of South Park and his skills for editing pictures. For some reason, after desecrating Monty Python once more, he issued the claim that he's going to do "a bunch of good pushups." We can safely expect that he did not consult his physician before engaging in this regimen of exercises.
