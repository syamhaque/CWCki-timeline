================================================================================

"REAL Protest against the FAKE" is a video uploaded in July 2009 by Solid Chris (Ian Brandon Anderson) in protest of the True and Honest CWC, CChanSonichuCWC (Liquid Chris). Even in real life, Ian appears to be stuck in the Time Void, because he still thinks it's June. This is the same mistake that he made in his last Captain's Log video.
The video description is a notable display of Ian in rage mode not seen since the days of Jimmy Hill:
DO NOT BUY from the Impostor, "CWCCChanSonichuCWC". HE IS CRAPPY, and his Nasal Voice is JUST DOWNRIGHT AWFUL.
Also, if I wanted to buy PAPER, I'd go to Wal-Mart and buy 500 FULL 8.5 X 11 Sheets for about 5 dollars!
HIS CHURCH? HE MUST LIVE IN FRICKIN' OHIO with "Julie"; NEVER DRIVES GREATER THAN 7 Hours JUST TO EVEN VISIT Wesley Memorial in VIRGINIA.
F*** HIM TO HELL!
Ian led this reactionary protest movement gloriously from victory to victory for about an hour or so, after which the video was deleted. The wrath, it seems, was more than he could bear.
Ian returned the video to YouTube on 23 July. His reasons for taking it down only to upload it again a day later remain a mystery.

Background
On 21 July 2009, Liquid Chris uploaded a video on how he set up a vendor booth at the popular Otakon anime convention and made a fortune off OFFICIAL and ORIGINAL Sonichu merchandise. It was revealed in the Jack Thaddeus E-mails that Jack, (who was currently holding Ian's PSN hostage) informed Ian about Chris's massive success.

Greetings to my fans on YouTube! I am sorrowfully sorry that I—uh haven't posted a video for awhile. But, uh, I have been very busy, making er—making th—rollin' in the dolla bills! [flashes fat wad] Um, uh, I'll tell you what, and—er—this past weekend, I went to
Otakon, which if y'all—if you all don't know what that—if y'all don't that, uh, the Ota—[noticeable jump cut]—convention... for some anime and video games and, uh, Japanese cu.... Yeah.
So, anyway, I took my original and official Sonichu merch—ah, merch—merchandise, uh, over there, and what was...—it was, uh, replica medallions. [holds medallion up to camera] Uh, and, uh, my—my—my comic... and I baked some myself, some chocky-chip cookies, uh, in the shape of Sonichu's head. So I actually sold all my merchandise by the afternoon time, and uh—made uh—lots of money! [flashes cash] Uh, here it is, there.
So, uh, this time I'm going to, uh, spend it on my church congregation and buy my pastor, Elizabeth, a copy of LittleBigPlanet. I—I, uh—I hope she has a PS3. [big smile]
Now, because I, uh—sold all my stuff, I can't show you any of it because, uh, it's not here. But, uh, I am—uh, I am replenishing my, uh, my stock. So, my official stock there. So, uh, if—if you want to all buy straight from the source, I am, uh—I will be working to set—to set up a original webpage to sell it on. So, uh, be looking forward to that. Uh, to that, uh, I'll tell you what. Anyway, um, peace. Have a good day.
YouTube comments from Ian
Ian quickly got wind of this and was furious at the idea of someone slandering his good name by being thin, successful, and self motivated.
First comment
"GIVE IT UP, Dumbass. YOU are Not Me, the Real CWC, and you Wish you Were. I Challenge you to Sow yourself in my Real Life Presence, O I can really give you a piece of my mind.
No Peace,
Christian C."
Second comment
"Hey, DUMBASS! YOU WISH YOU WERE ME! I would say YOU are Stuck... IN MINUS-SECOND-GEAR!
I am Calling YOU OUT!
14 Branchland Ct. Ruckersville, VA
BEFORE August 2, 2009.
If you really WANT to be me, then Come Face Me.
oh, BTW, YOUR NASAL VOICE IS MORE GRATING THAN THE WORD "NAIVE", and METAL NAILS ON THE CHALKBOARD.
But "Naive" is even WORSE than NAILS.
You are a Nerd and a Whimp!
Have a good day.
Christopher Christian Weston Chandler"

Captain's Log, June 22nd: 200—no, I'm sorry—July 22nd, 2009.
As you all may have heard about the quote/unquote "Christian Weston Chandler" that went to the Otakon in the past weekend and actually uploaded a video of himself in a stupid, BROWN-striped shirt with a [voice breaks] paper thin medal replica—paper thin. If you want the official merchandise, the medallion is made...from... clay. Clay! C-L-A-Y.
And, not only that, [voice cracks again] remember my face? My face! And I'm nowadays wearing a vest and improving my image.
Do not buy anymore from this
CRAPPY
impostor; do not give him anymore money.
[voice hits even higher pitch than before] AND HE SAYS he's gonna give it to quote/unquote "his" congregation with my Elizabeth Foss—it's MY congregation, not his! [voice breaks even higher] WHO THIS impostor think he is!?
DOWN
with him! [mimics the Undertaker]
BURN IN HELL.
And worst of all: that nasally voice of his, to think it—they can get away with as mine. [tries to flip the bird, but points instead, then corrects self] He's got another thing coming.
As for the rest of you that have been—that are good and true... peace to all of you. Have a pleasant day.
