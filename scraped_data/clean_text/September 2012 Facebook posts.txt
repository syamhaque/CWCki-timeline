Status Updates
Possible troll
Chris provides screenshots of a potential eHarmony sweetheart and asks for advice.
5 September 2012
I have just received an icebreaker from a recently matched person on eHarmony; I feel quite suspicious, because according to her profile, she sounds too good to be true.
I smell possible Troll here; the common interests are too much like mine, and the parts, "I like Comic Books", "Littlebigplanet 2 is the best", quoting Twilight Sparkle as most influential person, "can't live without comic books, Doritos tacos and Adult Swim", "random sense of humor", likes "Fifty Shades of Grey"?
I do not want to establish communication, even with this one, unless I know for sure She is Real (someone please verify this person), and that my eHarmony page is NOT easily accessible by any non eHarmony member, especially through a search engine.
Please help me here Thank you, and God bless.
Anna responded by agreeing with Chris's intuition:
Not only does it sound like a troll, it sounds like it was written by a man with a very small penis and a desperate craving for peer approval.
Kim, on the other hand, thought that there was a chance that the potential sweetheart was genuine:
Well, your profile can't be found through a search engine. I can't say if it's a troll or not. It just looks like a normal person to me.
Anna:
Says the troll.
Kim:
I apologize for trying to give him a little bit of hope after all that he's been through. :( But you're entitled to your opinion and I respect that.
Anna:
I consider trolls and people who make fake Facebook profiles to communicate with Christian one and the same.
Kim:
And like I said, that's your opinion and I respect that.
Anna:
I invite you to prove me wrong.
Kim:
The burden of proof is on you.
But either way, it's not like we're friends so I have nothing to prove to a complete stranger.
Anna:
It's as good as proven. You came out of nowhere, have a fake Facebook profile, and give Christian false hope about an obvious troll. Don't think that I don't know how to spot them after all these years.
Kim:
Actually, Chris and I have been friends for years now. But if you truly doubt me, then discuss this with him.
Anna:
It's useless and you know it. Just stop.
Kim:
I didn't know helping a friend was useless. Its okay, I'll let you have the last word because my friendship with Chris is more important than a petty fight with somebody I've never met.
Feeling more retarded
8 September 2012
The old' grey matter ain't what it used to be; I have been feeling more retarded lately, I seriously feel and sense it in my head.... My stress from the unabridged chaos in my life is taking its toll.
I have felt this mental slowness also in my early adult years, but it was mild then, and from that retardness is a huge reason why I have not been able to talk to most other people in public for the past decade or so since I moved back to Lame Ruckersville. I even felt it only sometimes and more mildly during my High School Years.
Maybe I should add that for consideration on my eH profile, "Caution: often slow in thinking with off and on long pauses in thought.". It is no wonder why I fell for the trolls' tricks and thefts in the past five years.
Same ol'
11 September 2012
How am I today? It's same-ol', same-ol'.
It has been over a year now since my father passed away: hard to believe. I have felt more and more stress since I have had to take on more duties around the house and all. The stress is killing me with loud belches that just sound unnatural, and mental griefs.
And still NO woman will even reply to me on freaking eHarmony. Damn trolls giving me a horrible name and blame... And What the F***?! Am I ugly with no alibi or something? :(
September 11
11 September 2012
Yep, Eleven after Eleven; Quad Towers for Twin Towers. But what happened that day is not funny. That day, at that time, I was out shopping with my mom; we were at a Dollar Tree, and I bought a pack of Team Rocket Pokemon cards; a Dark Arbok was the rare card of that pack.
Anyhoo, a good movie to watch today, "Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close"; rent or buy from iTunes at least. I have it on Blu-Ray combo.
Profile photo
14 September 2012
I have heard on Z95.1 this morning about a few rules on a good Facebook profile photo. The announcer inclined towards a full-body photograph, yet she agreed with me on a current headshot photo being good when I called the station after the segment. Which do you think is a better profile photo; a current full-body photo, or a current headshot?
I Require Friends
15 September 2012
I do not understand a lot of things in life. But most important that I feel I Really need to learn and understand is how to maintain good friendships, hanging out, having some real fun, yet in order to do all of that, I Require Friends who are Not Freaking Busy with work or whatever to Invite me, or for me to invite.
Everybody else gets to go out for a fun and good time; I am stuck care-giving my mother and our dogs, and it is Very Stressful on me.

I have my own Zac character now, exactly like the one from Stonebreaker's videos. I had the exact pieces.
Reaching out to an old enemy
23 September 2012
I texted a message of renewing friendship to [The Wallflower] Wednesday; I have not received a reply.
Yes, I have a texting subscription now; between phone numbers works good.
Open question: I get an error when I try to text from my iPhone to a five-digit number, such as the Cash Word to 77000. The number comes up with a dash three digits down after entering it, and after hitting send, it does not go, and I get a red exclamation mark next to the entry. Can anyone help me resolve the issue, please?
