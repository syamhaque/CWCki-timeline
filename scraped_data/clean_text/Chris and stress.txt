Stress is the bane of Christian Weston Chandler's existence.
After high school, Chris soon learned he couldn't blame his shortcomings on his high-functioning autism. Rather than take matters into his own hands and improve himself, he began to use "stress" as an excuse. However, it's assumed that Chris is probably confusing "stress" with depression or anxiety, refusing to admit that he is, in fact, unhappy with his current situation. Given the intensely sheltered lifestyle his parents provided for him well into his twenties, it is highly unlikely Chris ever experienced any form of intense anxiety or pressure that would give him severe psychological and physical effects, apart from his consistent paranoia over getting trolled and, in recent years, the Financhu Crisis. He is, however, prescribed medicine for this "stress". Since Chris tends to exaggerate everything, anything that makes him feel remotely uncomfortable is classified to him as a stressor.
When under the effects of "stress", Chris typically posted videos without his glasses and talked in a more meek voice. It is during these periods that Chris will opt to remove himself from the Internet for about a week or so, and then come back feeling refreshed, rejuvenated and given a new resolve to finish the Love Quest. This is most likely due to his autistic regenerative abilities that make sure that his heart never goes below 0% and into the negatives. Chris often cites stress as the reason why he isn't inspired to work on the comics; precisely why inspiration is needed to make Sonic recolors have sex with each other and kill Chris's enemies is not apparent.
In August 2013, Chris indicated through Facebook that his stress is beginning to take a toll on his health. Given his rather unhealthy lifestyle, it's not unlikely.

Stress sigh
The stress sigh is Chris's usual reaction to stress. Initially an unconscious coping mechanism, Chris has made habit of directing attention to it in an effort to gain sympathy. Chris has used it in conversation to discourage further unwanted scrutiny, or to express disapproval at having his desires deferred. The places where Chris would sigh while speaking in person are noted in all of his written communication with "*sigh*." He has also written it using italics - sigh.[19]
The term "stress sigh" is presumed to originate from PVCC, due to the strong connection in Chris between sighing and stress. Chris refers to the stress sigh as only a "sigh," suggesting that to him the link between sighing and stress is implicit.
Chris sometimes makes a comparable noise, a short, chirpy "hmph," to express contentment and self-satisfaction, usually of a smug variety.
