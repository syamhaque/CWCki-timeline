Chris writing letters
On 1 August 2021, Chris was arrested on a charge of incest against his mother Barbara, marking the first fully offline saga of Christory since his high school years.
Almost all knowledge of what Chris and Barbara have been up to since his arrest has come from communications from jail – letters and phone calls – while he awaits his hearings.
Chris's jail communications were suspended for a few months. Following his transfer from Central Virginia Regional Jail to Western State Hospital in February 2022, all mail sent to Chris at the jail was returned to the sender unread; Chris returned to the jail in May 2022 and resumed mail communications. Chris stopped communicating after that, and was released in March 2023.
This page catalogues Chris's written letters. Drawings which Chris has mailed out from jail are featured on the Jail Art page.
