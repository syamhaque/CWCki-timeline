Telling It To The Executives

"Now, Listen! We Know your game, your greedy Corporate Executives." Nightstar says. "Your little game of showing us crap work to delay the extension of G4 is crap. You think you can just buy and bide your time for money You Are Wrong and Messed Up." I chime in, "That is right. Even I Know of the Mane Six all becoming Alicorns for the Round Table of Friendship, and I Know that idea was streaming around your creative teams and all the offices for a long time now.
And I Know Your Secrets; We All Do. So, cut the bulls*** and just make the announcement NOW about My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic getting Five More Seansons." And the next day, after they agreed, a TV Announcment was publicly aired many, many times on Discover Family.
