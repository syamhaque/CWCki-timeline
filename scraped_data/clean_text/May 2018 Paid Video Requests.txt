Shout out to school shooters
This article is rated M for Honest Content
It may contain content deemed not safe for work. Reader discretion is advised.
Barb stars in these two videos, each shouting out to a school shooter. The first one wishes Nikolas Cruz, the perpetrator of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting a happy birthday and the second is a shout-out towards Adam Lanza, the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooter. These were requested by the same ween who requested a video of Barb dancing.
Chris appears to have been unaware of their true identities at the time of the two videos being made.
Happy Birthday, Nick
