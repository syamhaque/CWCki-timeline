Chris Chan Bible
3 October 2020
An enabler proposes writing a Chris themed Bible, encouraging Chris's messiah complex by comparing him to religious figure Jesus.
Chris posted the exchange in the Watchmen Discord server The Place.[1]
Chris (as Sonichu)
Yes, please tell me via text.
Enabler
So right now the trolls own the majority of the narrative of your story, with ED and Kiwi Farms. They have persecuted you like Jesus. Your life mirrors that of his. The vision I had was that we need to write a bible based on your existence, your laws, and your prophecies. When this dimensional merge happens a scripture needs to be available to people to understand who you are, and the message you and Sonichu have for the world. Does that make sense?
The scripture can tell your story, lay down laws for the people for when the dimensional merge happens (like the 10 commandments), and prophecies for things to come (like revelations. You are the prophet, therefore you need your own scripture.
In my vision I saw great chaos when the dimensional merge first happens. Many people will have a hard time understanding and coping with such a drastic change. They'll need YOU to show them the way, the Holy Book of Chris Chan Sonichu will be their guide.
Not only am I your soldier I am also your apostle and I will help you write this text if you'd like. I understand you're busy preparing for the merge and having Sonichu manifest in your body, I could write parts of the scripture for you at your direction.
What are your thoughts on this?
Chris (as Sonichu)
Well, on this Bible, you are literally the third individual in this dimension who have suggested it be written. It will be done soon enough, by Mama, [cutoff]
