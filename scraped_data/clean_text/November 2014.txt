DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!
Chris vents his rage through his art. Unfortunately it is not sufficient.
No one wants Chris's navy.
November was the eleventh month of 2014. This was a very rocky month for Chris, as he continued to protest against Sonic Boom, made a complete tool out of himself while raging over a brushfire, accidentally revealed his new address, got his un-clit infected, got into a fight at Target over Sonic Boom, was denied acceptance to a sperm bank, and was booted from his Keep Sonic Original group on Facebook.
Events
November - Sometime this month, Chris creates a playlist called "My Levels" for his LittleBigPlanet profile.
4 November
Election Day. Chris posts an excerpt of "Step in Time" from Mary Poppins and announces he's off to vote for "LGBTQ-Friendly Politicians". Seeing as how it was the lowest voter turnout since the 1940's, it's at least admirable that Chris had apparently voted for left-leaning candidates, let alone voted at all.

11 November
Someone on the Reddit subreddit r/cwc leaks a bunch of flirty photos that Chris apparently sent to Catherine.
EVEN MORE Sonic Boom boycott appeals, and in a truly disgusting display, Chris begs his Facebook friends to vandalize store property. They respond by telling him that he is horribly overreacting and that he should just make a petition.

16 November - Chris visits the Charlottesville branch of Target, where he gets into an argument with a Janekop and a Manajerk, demanding that they not stock Sonic Boom. Chris fails to win them over, though at least manages not to earn himself yet another ban.

30 November
On his new public group, Chris rejects Kenneth's suggestions of picketing and a bake sale, claiming he's too busy.
