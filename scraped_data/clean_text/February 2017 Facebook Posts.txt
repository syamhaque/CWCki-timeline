Butterbeer
1 February at 9:58 pm
I made some Butterbeer for the first time.
Chris linked to the recipe.
Native American Zodiac
2 February at 5:12 am
Chris shared a zodiac image featuring animals from Native American myths.
I'm a wolf. LOL
Eau de skunk
2 February at 5:17 am
Random Thought:
If you are a user of perfumes and/or colognes, then you are used to the smell of a skunk.
I just caught a whiff of a skunk, lurking outside, while laying down in my bed, Inside my house; it didn't offend me as much as it used to, I realized, because essence of skunks are often used in the fragrant products.
Have a good day.
Go, Joe!
2 February at 3:37 pm
Chris commented on an Americans Against Trump post about Joe Biden's career plans.
Yes! Go, Joe!

#DressLikeAWoman
3 February at 3:26 pm
Chris commented on a Lizzy the Lezzy post.
I #DressLikeAWoman, as I am a woman who dresses as I like to, just like all other women dress as they each like to themselves.
Made a smoothie
3 February at 7:36 pm
I just made a yummy mango-pineapple smoothie with the following recipe, Plus Ten ice cubes in the blender. I even peeled and chopped the mango personally, after learning how with WikiHow.
Song of the LGBTQAI
5 February at 7:57 pm
I heard this song on the radio earlier while I was dreaming; I was trying to remember the artist's name and thought this was a song iconic of the LGBTQAI community. As far as I know while awake, it might not, it still resonates and should be one of our iconic tracks, as we Stand By Each Other during such troubling times and whenever, because we are a good group of people, the LGBTQAI. And Love is always Love.
He linked to Rachel Platten's Stand By You.
Charlie Brown and the football
5 February at 8:16 pm
I just had another **Random Thought**.
I wonder if Charles Schulz ever thought of having Anyone other than Lucy Van Pelt hold the football for Charlie Brown to kick. I mean, seriously, the failed kicks were funny now and then, but at least give us one decent football kick (aside from the ironic kick to Lucy's arm as shown in "A Charlie Brown Celebration"). I bet Peppermint Patty would have offered the best opportunity for Charlie to "kick that football clear to the moon". Sorry, Chuck, ol' boy.
Thanks to Ivanka and Jared
5 February at 8:19 pm
Chris commented on a Lizzy the Lezzy post.
Thank You, Ivanka and Jared! It is so great to hear that there Are kinder hearts away from the center of the Trump family that can Really help us out. Thank You Both. <3<3
Trump, get your ass the hell out
5 February at 8:58 pm
Huh. I wished Trump would abdicate the position, take Pence with him, and let Hillary and Kaine take office. And apparently he was a sore winner in this situation.
Hey, #DonaldTrump. I understand you want to prove Hillary winning the election, but, Dude, come on. Why Wait? Just let it all go and let Hillary Clinton be President and do the job. Being President is Not just praise from everyone, and not everyone praised the past presidents, each, either. The job is Serious, and with that Great Power comes the Great Responsibility. There is no shame in admitting being unable to do the job right; there is honor in being humble about yourself. But I digress. In short and blunt, for you, sir: "Get your ass the hell out, and let the people do the job right."
He linked to an article.
Chris's gay anthem
5 February at 9;17 pm
Chris commented on a LGBTQ Nation post.
I like to take Taylor Swift's "Love Story" and swap "Romeo" for a second "Juliet".
What the song lyrics probably look like
We were both young when I first saw you.
I close my eyes and the flashback starts:
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air.
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns.
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello."
Little did I know...
That you were lesbian Juliet, you were throwing pebbles,
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet."
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go."
And I said...
lesbian Juliet, take me somewhere we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess,
It's a love story, baby, just say "Yes".
So I sneak out to the garden to see you.
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes,
Escape this town for a little while.
Oh, oh.
'Cause you were lesbian Juliet, I was a scarlet letter,
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet."
But you were everything to me,
I was begging you, "Please don't go."
And I said...
lesbian Juliet, take me somewhere we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.
It's a love story, baby, just say "Yes".
lesbian Juliet, save me. They're trying to tell me how to feel.
This love is difficult but it's real.
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess.
It's a love story, baby, just say "Yes".
Oh, oh, oh.
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around.
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town.
And I said...
lesbian Juliet, save me. I've been feeling so alone.
I keep waiting for you, but you never come.
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think.
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said...
Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone.
I love you, and that's all I really know.
I talked to your dad – go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say "Yes".
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you
Petition for new election
5 February at 9:27 pm
Donald Trump IS definitely unfit to be our president; I saw his personality mistraits from a mile away even before watching all three debates. He Needs to Get Out of office.
He linked to a petition, which he signed under his former name: "Christian Weston Chandler."
Aroused by Sailor Moon music
5 February at 11:46 pm
I had just finished checking out the history of the copy pasta meme of helicopter identity (support for those who actually do identify as such; continue being yourselves). Anyhow, I recalled that I tend to get a fuzzy feeling (actually being turned on fully in that sense; that is not confirmed to me at the moment; I really do not know, when listening to certain songs. I have a few of them; three of which come to mind from the Sailor Moon universe. I get the fuzzies from the Sailor Stars theme song, Watashi Ni Naretakute, and more recently during the WatchMojo top Ten of 90's anime songs, the original Sailor Moon theme song struck me (had not heard that song in a while).
There is a term for the thing of people getting turned on by music, Auralism (although defined a bit differently; Google it). I really do like listening to music and getting swept away by the tunes and beats. I might explore this for myself further for self-confirmation soon.
LOVE the Watashi song!!
He linked to a Youtube video.
He later commented on the post:
To clarify, in case some people are misreading this post.
I do not identify myself as a helicopter.
This post is of what I thought could be a fetish of mine, music. I only posted that copypasta video because I thought of the music fetish shortly after.
CWCville is a sanctuary city
7 February at 2:37 pm
**Cwcville is noted well as a Sanctuary City.**
In the city of Cwcville, VA, after the Trump set his executive orders, most wrongful, the residents and our Soup Hotels, and local businesses, have been welcoming the Muslims and immigrants with open hearts. As well, our LGBTQ communities here offer their support in all of this, and those who are fearing those tiny hands of maljustice, have been offered the same open heart kindness. As for the Sanctuary City "hammer down", our heroic Sonichus and Rosechus are offering their defensive actions for keeping the Swat teams and whatnot who seek to sort out the troubled to do away with them. Magi-Chan Sonichu and the Alakazam team have been most helpful in the mind-reading and future-telling of said bad people's intentions, in their efforts to keep our city a safe sanctuary. Even the disguised Secret Services, and tin foil hatted, are not immune of our mentally strong defenses. Our mayor, Miss Allison Amber, and the creator, Miss Christine Weston Chandler, continue to refuse any of the executive orders within our boundaries and areas, and helping overturn and stop any anti-LGBTQ and anti-immigrant laws from corrupting the state of Virginia.

Quinn
So you're reading people's thoughts with the psychic equivalent of the NSA?
I get what you're trying to get across but that's all sorts of wrong when you think about it...
Random thought though - it would be AMAZING to see a special comic where the forces of CWCville fought against Trump in a revolution. It'd be a good read
Chris
Maybe, eventually. I would not be surprised if Gotham City was a Sanctuary City too; defended by Batman and crew. Even Harley would beat up the Secret Services sent by Trump.
Attending Love is Love event
7 February at 3:46 pm
Chris is planning to attend the Love is Love event at the UVA LGBTQ Center.
He posted a question to the event's page:
Just a quick question: during the event on Friday, will there be sheets with the lyrics to the song we'll be singing?
The response:
It'll be the Good Old Song, to the tune of Auld Lang Syne http://www3.alumni.virginia.edu/student/traditions/song.aspx
Mourning for Bob

Yeah. I Wish I had known about this event a lot sooner.
Watching new Lego movies
8 February at 8:21 pm
Huh. I'll be watching the Lego Batman Movie on Friday, and we have the trailer for the Lego Ninjago Movie already. Cool.
One of Chris's real-life friends mentioned plans about going to see the movie with him (link redacted).
Alexa P.:
Hey Everyone, not [REDACTED] related but Christine Weston Chandler and I are going to see the Lego Batman movie tonight at 7:15 at the Regal Stonefield. Let us know if you want to join us!
Trump's D

If he meant the "D" as in "Decision", what kind of decision is it?

I would not be where I am without my education, and more importantly, all of the people and friends I used to know. They treated me well to good back then. A handful out of which turned on me.
I REALLY Miss the good times of those days.
#JoshuaMartinez, #TiffanyGowen, #SarahBevelIngram, #KellieAndes
The ONLY Way I will ever let their more recent deeds be forgiven is if they all genuinely want to be friends me again; at the least to take a few minutes out of their lives to apologize.
Shared post on MLK's daughter and Trump

Chris shared a news article.
I know about the CWCki Club
9 February at 2:35 am
Just going ahead and putting this out there: I know about your new little talk "club". Go ahead and talk it up there; just keep the Hate amongst yourselves and off of Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and so forth. Good Night.
Dispelling rumors in advance
9 February at 10:34 pm
HEADS UP, EVERYONE!!!! I was just informed that in addition to Porno Videos, and photos, there is a new hack on Facebook. It appears comments coming from you includes dirty, hurtful phrases. You cannot see it, but your friends do. This situation can create many misunderstandings. I would like to say to all my contacts that if something shocking appears, it absolutely is NOT coming from me and I would be grateful if you let me know.
Thank you very much!

That is a true and good quote; it's too bad Lincoln never said that. What a misquote.

That's pretty awesome that you and Megan are friends again~!
Chris (he tagged Megan's profile when he typed her name)
Not quite; I just gone through my past and recent sent friend requests, found Megan Schroeder, and I liked her cover photo; it's cute. She has a few cute dogs too. At least, she's doing okay; as far as I can tell.
I have empathy
13 February at 12:01 am
This is a great example of empathy. It is touch to comprehend for some to a Lot of people, but I have empathy; I've had it for a long time. I am down with each of my friends and their struggles, because I have had my share of difficult and tough times too.
Chris linked to an article.
Waterman and Kim Wilson both called him out on his claim.
Waterman:
Eh... whenever I tell you about something in my life, you kind of have this tendency to tell me what I feel and give me consolations that don't really apply at all.
I think this one could be interesting for you to learn from.
He linked to a video titled The Psychology of Narcissism.
Kim:
Christine Weston Chandler You don't seem to understand the difference between sympathy and empathy. You misunderstood the article you linked. What you're describing right now is only sympathy. Due to brain problems, you have trouble experiencing empathy. Without targeted lessons, autists don't experience empathy.
A huge example of this is your Sonichu comics. Every villain in the Sonichu comics is a result of your lack of empathy. People with healthy empathetic responses aren't entertained by those kinds of stock villain characters, because they're unrealistic and boring.
Those characters only occur in media aimed at small children or other people without the ability to feel empathy. It's a hallmark of autism.

Lecture on empathy
14 February at 6:36 pm
I have some sound wisdom to share that I feel and believe could be relatable and helpful for a lot of people.
Has your friend(s) or lover had to space themselves from you for a time?
People have empathy, rather they know about empathy or not; women feel empathy more often than men. A lot of times, a certain situation might feel alright for some, it might not feel right for the rest. Or even if the situation that happens to a person, like a really bad accident that hurts them deep and maybe physical, there are people who might not understand how that feels, because they haven't experienced that kind of event and feelings. And when said event is talked about with someone of who it is New to that person, he/she will likely feel overwhelmed in trying to comprehend, and might get scared or frustrated that this has happened to their friend, and he/she doesn't know how to relate or get down with that. They might have to really distance themselves from the person and/or situation to try to comprehend it in their individual perspective.
Hmm. Thinking it further, that may explain why trolls, haters and bullies respond the way they do when someone has a certain trait, aspect or situation. They do not understand, nor have any information about that, for themselves, and they respond with the primal instinct of Laughing at them, or hating them (if hatred is the feeling they are exposed to more often than love). And those people, having been forced, or volunteered, to see people in those situations and with those traits, are trying to comprehend it themselves. If in public, they may feel the need to respond to the live event immediately, so they either do nothing and play dumb if introverted and not used to expressing, or they may fall to the default emotion they are more often exposed and used to. It's not the victim's fault; it's the loss of the troll or bully, because they don't understand and they are unable to get down with the person/victim.
Anyhow, to break it down for you in an example: let's pretend the topic was you having a cancer, albeit breast, lung, heart, etc. Your ex-friend just learned of the cancer in you. He/she might have not had cancer, not known of anyone with cancer before, or not have learned of this type of cancer before either. He/she feels overwhelmed, and more frightened from the lack of what it is or how to help. And in lack of better judgment, perspective or thought, he/she felt need to distance him/herself from you to not talk about the cancer, so the impulsive word-choice there was break-up, or something else related. He/she had never thought of you as a bad person or worse; he/she felt need to run away, since it was all he/she could do at the moment.
He/she tried to empathize after hearing you had cancer, and was unable to; not even able to find a silver lining to sympathize, because he/she did not know what it was, and felt so scared to close him/herself off from other people.
But as for me, I am down with the cancer, as I have been exposed to family and other people who have had one or another, and I have been educated of what it is, and I have a general perspective of it and how to cope and relate with the people nearby who have it. And I am able to stay and try what I can to offer support and perspective to help you feel better by sharing my feelings of it and my experiences. To try to help better your perspective and clear away fears that stemmed from lack of better knowledge and experiences.
But I digress. I do pray my two cents here helps any of y'all who have experienced such a break-up issue.
Butterbeer for Valentine's Day
14 February at 7:33 pm
What to share or just enjoy on Valentines Day? I can offer an easy and yummy solution; Chocolate Butterbeer. Rather you're a Pottermore fan, or a fan of chocolate (or vanilla); this is a perfection in a mug.
-4 scoops, or one pint of, chocolate ice cream
-2 cups, or one pint, cream soda
-1/8 cup of butterscotch spread
-5 ice cubes
-optional whipped cream on top
Put all but the whipped cream in a blender on 10 for about 10 seconds, and viola! Enough for sharing between a couple, or more than enough for one. It is still a delightful way to enjoy your ice cream.
Feeling sick
15 February at 4:30 pm
I feel like a cold virus is hitting me down. Scratchy throat and coughs with mild chest pain. Not to mention the dizzy feeling from a leveled-up vertigo spell. I have soup and Tussim DM; I'll recover soon. Thank you.

Visiting a playground, then begging for money
16 February at 9:31 pm
On the positive note: who remembers playing at Kid's Castle as a child in Harrisonburg, VA? It was fun for me.
On the sad: my mother and I need money; Please Help via PayPal to my phone number.

Claiming hospital staff killed Bob
16 February at 9:34 pm
I wish I could go back to September 5, 2011 and stop the staff from making the Loud Noise that killed my father with stressful surprise. I had more freedom when he was alive.
Chris posted that message on the profile of one of his Facebook friends (the discussion he commented on was about time zones and Mad Men and has nothing to do with what he said).
