Chris in January 2016
January was the first month of 2016. With a court case finally resolved, Chris decided to refocus his attention to his Love Quest and his Etsy hustle. Chris also decided to upload several videos advertising a supposed "lesbian sleepover" which would be hosted at his house this month, before getting mad at Jeff/Francine in a video after they claimed they were supposedly hosting their own sleepover. Aside from that, Chris was also interviewed by CatKnight, and ended off the month by uploading a rant video about people sending mail to him addressed to PewDiePie.
