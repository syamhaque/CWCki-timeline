Cogsdev (also known as WikiSysop) is the creator of the CWCki, CWCipedia, #sonichu and PVCC. She created the CWCki due to the belief that the ED page was not big enough to cover Chris's extensive history. Cogs is also notable for being a part of multiple IRC chats.
After Chris's incredibly long wikipedia profile was deleted by Wikipedia moderators, Cogs decided to create a new Wikipedia-style website that only Chris could edit, so he could ramble about things to his hearts content. The site became known as the CWCipedia.
On 19 November 2009, Cogs created a new page on the CWCipedia called the Mailbag, where Chris could publicly respond to fanmail. It was an instant success, with 62 whole pages on the CWCipedia of fanmail and Chris's responses, along with another page for Common Questions. At Mailbag 59, Chris stopped answering questions due to laziness. Despite this, Cogs kept making more pages of fanmail for Chris to answer, though he stopped at 62.
During the Tito Saga, The Wallflower reached out to Cogsdev asking for her name to be removed from the CWCki. Cogsdev complied with this, and all mentions of her personal life are gone from the CWCki, and she is now referred to by the pseudonym "The Wallflower."
At some point, Cogsdev lost control of the CWCki to Marvin. When asked in 2024 about how this went down, Marvin replied: "I don't remember. we were on a free plan for some host somewhere and when the costs started going up and we needed to collect money for it, I took over".[2]
After Bob's death, Cogs slowly became more disliked among the community, demanding that Marvin shut down the CWCki,[3] and banning almost everyone from PVCC except people that she wanted to talk to and had similar opinions to her.[4] After this, more things started to get exposed about her, such as her being a communist,[5] a NEET,[6] transgender,[7] and faking multiple personalities to get out of uncomfortable situations.[8] Today, most people have a negative opinion of Cogsdev.
