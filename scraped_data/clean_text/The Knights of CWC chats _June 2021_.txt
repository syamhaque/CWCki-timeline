The WCT is Banned from the Place & Chris Leaves, The Fool Messes With the Watchmen, WCT Gloats
27-28 June 2021
Summary: WCT announces in the second layer that he has been banned from the Place, and Chris leaves shortly thereafter. The Fool decides to play dumb and mess with the Watchmen, posting screenshots of their interactions. WCT comments on them, self-aggrandizing and gloating about the Watchmen's failure and his success. Several times in this discussion, he recaps what had happened (to the Fool and I, people who already knew the full situation) and emphasizes his superior moral position when considering the Watchmen's previous actions. He also expresses an interest in inviting Null into the server, something which the Fool and I both discourage on the grounds that Null is not the most sympathetic towards enablers. MKR attempts to contact WCT for answers, but he chooses to ignore her.

The WCT 01:39 AM
And I've been banned from the place.
The Fool 01:41 AM
how'd they find out?
The WCT 01:41 AM
[Replying to "how'd they find out?"]
they were probably notified.
The Fool 01:41 AM
by who?
The WCT 01:42 AM
probably Naught.
The Fool 01:42 AM
how would he know?
The WCT 01:42 AM
[Replying to "how would he know?"]
because he's a cow man.
if you're still there, make sure to take screenshots.
The Fool 01:43 AM
I am yeah
no new messages got posted since that last screenshot you took
The WCT 01:44 AM
i'm not as mad as I was before.
I expected it.
in fact, I'm glad I got banned.
this provides me closure of some sorts. (edited)
The Fool 01:46 AM
read that book I sent you
[File attachment "The_Courage_to_be_Disliked_How_to_Change_Your_Life_and_Achieve_Real_Happiness_by_Ichiro_Kishimi_Fumi.epub"]
The WCT 01:58 AM
is "CWC and Friends" an ok name for this server?
The Fool 01:58 AM
since the discord acronym was "CaF" that made me think "CWCville Cafe"
if that isn't too dreadfully autistic
The WCT 01:59 AM
since I found an icon for the server, I guess its fine now.
The Fool 01:59 AM
but yeah name is hardly an issue if you're gonna be secret about it
use whatever chris would like if he even cares
The WCT 02:00 AM
he seems fine with it, so I guess this will do.
The Fool 02:00 AM
it's good
The WCT 02:00 AM
and if I were Kyle and Meghan right now, I'd be very careful what they say in the place.
The Fool 02:00 AM
I'll eagerly keep an eye out
since I'm here for fun
The WCT 02:00 AM
they should probably take it to DMs if I were them.
they're probably seething.
The Fool 02:01 AM
make sure chris leaks any DMs
The WCT 02:01 AM
So far, Chris is on our side.
and knowing the core of people in here, the choice is clear.
Little do Kyle and Meghan know...I have these in my hard drive.
[Screenshot of Discord archive files of the Place.]
thanks for buying me time. 😄
The WCT 02:15 AM
Naught's thread on Lolcow.org has 1.5k views and growing.
The Fool 02:16 AM
I wonder if it got attention on KF
The WCT 02:17 AM
[Replying to "I wonder if it got attention on KF"]
probably.
btw, reliable sources are telling me that Naught is aware of said thread and has changed the invite to his secret discord server. (edited)
The Fool 02:19 AM
people noticed his invite was invalidated on the first page
which would obviously mean he knows about it
so
⏰
The WCT 02:20 AM
yeah
The WCT 03:32 AM
@The Fool
[Screenshot of a message from NovaKyle reading "Wrong."]
The Fool 01:39 PM
[Audio attachment]
what's "wrong"?
The Fool 03:01 PM
[Quoting "And Catherine is put off by me due to how I feel about topless men? Uh... I don't know what to think or say in response to that. She means the world to me, but then I feel strongly towards the cause."]
just so many hidden gems in stuff chris said in the past that I forgot about
girlfriend... or male breasts... hmm 🤔
The WCT 03:03 PM
lel
The WCT 03:31 PM
[Screenshot of Chris's private messages with the WCT, stating that he had left the Place.][footnote 1]
The Fool 03:32 PM
I think this might have been the closest chris ever got to finally trolling his trolls back
no new messages yet, I'll let you know if they say anything
The WCT 03:33 PM
Top 10 based Chris moments.
The WCT 03:33 PM
[Replying to "no new messages yet, I'll let you know if they say anything"]
[REDACTED] told me in DMs that they've been quiet in the place.
they must've learned they've been compromised and they're seething about me in DMs.
The Fool 03:33 PM
yeah I assume they're doing that too
I imagine the place is going to be totally flatlined now
it has no purpose anymore
The WCT 03:34 PM
If they fail to manipulate Chris as they did in the past, its over.
The Watchmen have fallen.
As of right now, I'd say the Coup has been a success.
The Fool 03:35 PM
is [REDACTED] going to update this on their cwcki page or do you want the public optics to think they're active to help hide this place?
The WCT 03:35 PM
Lainchu wants the group to be like a scarecrow.
The Fool 03:35 PM
nice
good plan
The WCT 03:35 PM
In reality, its broken up and dissolved. But publicly it still exists.
The Fool 03:36 PM
just like me
The WCT 03:36 PM
tbh though, the Watchmen aren't dead because this is technically the successor group.
I might still call it the Watchmen.
The Fool 03:36 PM
have chris name it
The WCT 03:37 PM
[Screenshot of the edited "Watchmen" movie poster with the CWC Watchmen OCs on it, with every character crossed out except for WCT and Lainchu.]
the way I see it, there are two watchmen.
The Neko/Lainchu faction and the Meghan/Nova faction.
the group that has Chris so far is mine so we are the legitimate one.
The Fool 03:43 PM
should I play dumb and go like "where'd chris go???" in the place or is that too on-the-nose
I'm so tempted to tease them
yeah fuck it I'm gonna do it, I don't know if they know my role or not but I'm gonna play dumb just to see if it's funny
The WCT 03:51 PM
[Replying to "yeah fuck it I'm gonna do it, I don't know if they know my role or not but I'm gonna play dumb just to see if it's funny"]
lol
if they ban you it would be hilarious.
The Fool 03:51 PM
The WCT 03:51 PM
let's see if that triggers them.
screenshot as much as you can.
The Fool 03:52 PM
oh nooo please don't ban me from the dead server please please please i'll send you nudes if you don't
The WCT 03:52 PM
and once you feel satisfied, go ahead and post it in the thread.
The Fool 03:52 PM
you post it if you want, I'm a neutral party
The WCT 03:53 PM
if they talk shit about me in there, it only further confirms they doxed me. lol
The Fool 03:53 PM
just say you got the screencaps from someone else
The WCT 03:53 PM
[Replying to "just say you got the screencaps from someone else"]
yes.
hey @Marvin will you be available to VC on Monday?
The Fool 04:55 PM
The WCT 05:06 PM
[Replying to "Click to see attachment 🖼️"]
BTFO'd.
Meghan and Nova really hated Praetor and if anything, they're winning this thing as well.
The WCT 06:50 PM
https://twitter.com/CPU_CWCSonichu/status/1409282907714330632
The WCT 09:16 PM
@here if the drama ends along with me getting out alive, this place will become a chill place to talk Chris and anything that you want to talk about as well. (I wouldn't recommend politics though. lol)
The Fool 10:17 PM
guess I gotta reel a little more
I just want to know if they know that I know you included me in this lol
The WCT 10:26 PM
[Replying to "I just want to know if they know that I know you included me in this lol"]
Meghan and Kyle?
The Fool 10:27 PM
yes
The WCT 10:27 PM
they don't from what i know.
but if they kick you out, that's a signal that they do know.
The Fool 10:27 PM
yea so I wanna maintain that
so I can watch as much funny as possible
The WCT 10:28 PM
oh, and I brought in Para.
The Fool 10:28 PM
yea I saw
The WCT 10:28 PM
we basically got all the good people here except for [REDACTED].
(he told me he'll remain in the place until all is certain)
The Fool 10:29 PM
smart, that's what I'm doing
baited and ready
The WCT 10:31 PM
the time has come.
execute order 66.
The Fool 10:33 PM
[Image of the "Unlimited Bait Works" meme.]
The WCT 10:33 PM
I wonder what their theories will be.
Me and Praetor collaborating to bring down the Watchmen?
Me and Anaxis convincing Chris that they're evil?
I'm sure they got a lot in mind. But this is what happens when you fuck with me.
The Fool 10:35 PM
In truth, it was I, The Fool! Mastermind behind the entire operation!
[1 ✅ reaction]
The WCT 10:35 PM
[Replying to "In truth, it was I, The Fool! Mastermind behind the entire operation!"]
based
If they begin interrogating you, say that it was Naught that brought you in there. 😄
and if more shit comes out, that's their fault. (edited)

The WCT 10:59 PM
HAHAHAHA!!
The Fool 11:00 PM
[GIF of a dancing/shrugging man in black, with a Jack-O-Lantern over his head.]
The WCT 11:00 PM
Like Josh will listen to you. LOL
First of all: Bait?
bullshit, you doxed me.
(or you at least helped out Naught)
The Fool 11:02 PM
you called it
The WCT 11:02 PM
[Replying to "Click to see attachment 🖼️"]
LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Lainchu (Anaxis) 11:03 PM
They really believe that this still has to do with Praetor, don't they?
They need to create better theories
The WCT 11:03 PM
And of course he talked about me being in control. LOL
they know this is a coup.
The WCT 11:04 PM
[Replying to "They really believe that this still has to do with Praetor, don't they?"]
here's the reality:
Me and APC have been collaborating for a while on this.
And Praetor had zero involvement with the whole plot.
If anything, they just saw this as an excuse to leave the place so there.
And in a way, Yes I am going to take control.
But I'm not going to abuse my powers.
Lainchu, [REDACTED], Marvin, and anybody else in here will have an equal say. (edited)
and me? work with Praetor? lol.
The Fool 11:07 PM
The WCT 11:07 PM
I don't fucking care.
The WCT 11:07 PM
[Replying to "Click to see attachment 🖼️"]
COPE
Lainchu (Anaxis) 11:08 PM
Well, they did think that I was working with Praetor
It's their default boogeyman
The WCT 11:08 PM
[Replying to "Well, they did think that I was working with Praetor"]
I remember that. lol
I love how he says he's going to talk to Josh.
Because Josh himself knows about what happened.
and in fact, Chris showed me some screenshots that are not good news for the Watchmen.
The Fool 11:09 PM
yeah?
what'd josh say?
The WCT 11:09 PM
[Screenshot taken by Chris of a portion of his conversation with Null about the Watchmen.][footnote 2]
shhhhhhh
keep this in here.
The Fool 11:10 PM
hahahahahahah
yeah of course
that's hilarious
The WCT 11:10 PM
Josh is on my side. They're fucked.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 11:10 PM
I wouldn't rely too much on Josh seeing the good in our cause. Just because he doesn't like Naught and the others doesn't mean he does like us.
To him, we're just a different set of retards to the last one
The WCT 11:11 PM
Josh would probably not care.
mostly.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 11:11 PM
Best not to give him a reason to care
The Fool 11:11 PM
don't vote me out don't vote me out i'm not sus I'M NOT SUS
The WCT 11:11 PM
uh oh.
he's gonna ban you too. lol (edited)
@Lainchu When Marvin and [REDACTED] are online, I could maybe have either of them talk to Josh about what happened to me.
and from there, Josh will probably ignore Kyle. (edited)
Lainchu (Anaxis) 11:13 PM
I just wouldn't involve Josh at all unless it's absolutely necessary
Ask Marvin or [REDACTED] for advice, sure, but I don't think it's a good idea to get them to speak to him on our behalf
Because I don't think he's gonna be sympathetic
The Fool 11:14 PM
yeah he's not very trustworthy
The WCT 11:14 PM
the best case scenario is for Josh not to care.
I love how Kyle also predicts this server will also collapse because of how APC is "using me". lol
The Fool 11:15 PM
he only cares is chris is getting fucked and I'm sure chris is telling him all he needs to hear
The WCT 11:16 PM
I do honestly wish Josh was still on Discord so he could join this server.
i'd be willing to show him everything if he wishes to know.
Here's the reality:
I'm not here to make Chris my pet lolcow.
I'm not going to monopolize my power over everybody in this server.
and I'm only doing this because its right.
funny how Kyle claims I'm trying to take power when in reality he's the one who has more lust for it.
The Fool 11:18 PM
The WCT 11:18 PM
the amount of bullshit in this is hilarious.
The Fool 11:19 PM
but who bullshits the bullshitters
I shouldn't say I'm a Buddhist on the internet because I'm too efficient at lying
The WCT 11:20 PM
"as per what Chris said last".
I did nothing. I was literally doxed and this is payback for everything I've endured for the past 2 years. They deserve to lose Chris.
The Fool 11:21 PM
yeah you know the "I found the toxic people in my life, there will be fighting amonst the groups" or whatever
The WCT 11:21 PM
And why would this whole thing collapse?
we will have disagreements.
But we're not an echo chamber.
The Fool 11:22 PM
bruh don't take it so seriously, we're using a tranny grooming chat service to play make believe with an autistic 40 year old man who thinks cartoons are having sex with him
The WCT 11:22 PM
pardon me but the amount of BS coming out of Kyle's mouth is total cringe.
And do they believe for some reason that Naught is still innocent of doxing me?
The Fool 11:24 PM
I doubt it's a matter of belief, I think they just ride naught's dick out of friendship regardless of who's right
The WCT 11:24 PM
Nova also gave out some important info about Naught hiding.
that speaks volumes.
The Fool 11:37 PM
definitely right about the seething part they were probably doing
The WCT 11:37 PM
[Audio attachment]
The WCT 11:38 PM
[Replying to "Click to see attachment 🖼️"]
Kyle needs to understand that Chris doesn't like him. And this was the last straw.
I literally gave the guy one more chance to redeem himself by recognizing Naught's betrayal. And he failed.
Kyle has nobody but to blame himself for not thinking for himself. And for not considering all the evidence I had presented on lolcow.org.
Did I manipulate Chris? maybe. But I did it because I had to.
I had no other choice.
The Fool 11:40 PM
manipulating someone with facts is called telling the truth
The WCT 11:40 PM
exactly.
If they want to make amends, they need to admit that Naught lied all along and that he did dox me.
The Fool 11:41 PM
I would just forget about them
you know what they're like
The WCT 11:41 PM
that's the best case scenario.
If I get the chance to talk to Chris again, I'll warn him that Meghan and Kyle will try to fuck with his head.
The Fool 11:42 PM
I've lost friends before, and I'm a better person because of it
yeah
The WCT 11:42 PM
if you talked to Chris, its obvious how he feels about me.
we're pretty damn close emotionally.
And if I was upset or something, he'd know.
fact is: they're never getting Chris back and its best that he'd distance himself away from them.
The Fool 11:44 PM
That's good
just don't let your guard down
The WCT 11:45 PM
oh I won't.
I know how that trio plays.
@Lainchu if I get the chance to talk to Caden, I'll apologize to him.
for all the trouble my group caused him.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 11:48 PM
Praetor? I don't talk to them.
Almost did, though. I friended them but never sent a message. They assumed I was one of their golden medallion customers.
The WCT 11:48 PM
I'll speak to Chris letting him know that I want to speak with Caden privately.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 11:49 PM
If you want, although idk what that will accomplish.
The WCT 11:49 PM
its out of guilt.
The Fool 11:49 PM
what is this cute shit? "I never wanted to lie to Chris"? He a-logs him behind his back for every single tweet he makes
The WCT 11:49 PM
[Replying to "what is this cute shit? "I never wanted to lie to Chris"? He a-logs him behind his back for every single tweet he makes"]
BULLSHIT.
The WCT 11:49 PM
[Replying to "its out of guilt."]
I was on the side of Kyle and Meghan at the time when the whole Praetor thing was going down.
I want to apologize to Caden because I feel like I further enabled those two. (edited)
I also love he talks about not letting another "idea guy" happen.
He's literally trying to be an Idea Guy himself.
total hypocrisy.
The Fool 11:52 PM
didn't praetor try to get chris to taze himself?
The WCT 11:52 PM
[Replying to "didn't praetor try to get chris to taze himself?"]
looking back now? idk.
maybe they did, maybe it was for something else? idk.
i'm conflicted in that regard.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 11:53 PM
Releasing that clip out of context was what caused the public to believe that Praetor was gonna go through with it.
The Fool 11:53 PM
yeah I was going to ask if that was just like, propaganda
The WCT 11:53 PM
Meghan just DM'd me.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 11:53 PM
It certainly framed Praetor as the bad guys.
The WCT 11:54 PM
[Replying to "Meghan just DM'd me."]
"Wth is going on?".
The Fool 11:54 PM
but either way I'd be careful of other groups, like, don't risk chris because you feel guilty or spited
Lainchu (Anaxis) 11:54 PM
Agreed
Lainchu (Anaxis) 11:55 PM
[Replying to ""Wth is going on?"."]
You gonna answer her?
The WCT 11:55 PM
i'm very conflicted.
Should I bother or nah?
Lainchu (Anaxis) 11:56 PM
I wouldn't
Nothing will be accomplished
The WCT 11:56 PM
they're not banned yet in the other server I own.
The Fool 11:57 PM
act innocent, silence only criminalizes you, knowledge is power
do something funny
The WCT 11:58 PM
she believes the lie.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 11:58 PM
Of course she does
I mean, play dumb if you want, just don't let slip any info she could make use of
The WCT 11:59 PM
I could easily try explaining to her that this is because Naught doxed me, but even then she'll think I'm bullshitting. (edited)
Lainchu (Anaxis) 11:59 PM
Yeah, she will. That's why I think it's a fruitless effort.
Unless you're doing it for the LULZ
28 June 2021
The WCT 12:00 AM
I'm not looking for any lulz. I'm taking Chris away from them and thats that.
they can fuck off.
The Fool 12:00 AM
if you only answer in questions, it'll destroy any logic system. keep asking her why she believes various things until she breaks down and blocks you lol
Lainchu (Anaxis) 12:00 AM
Up to you. I've stated my opinion, what happens next is your choice.
The WCT 12:01 AM
i'm not going to bother replying.
she should've known why I did this.
Literally 2-3 days late!
The Fool 12:03 AM
many such cases!
The WCT 12:03 AM
if you want, you can link her the thread.
The WCT Continues Self-Aggrandizing
28 June 2021
Summary: A former Watchman still in the Place reports a reaction that Nova has to a recent Chris tweet hinting at the fall of the Watchmen, and WCT responds to this with more gloating and self-aggrandizing, going over (again) the reasons why he did what he did.
#cwc-general (Second Layer)

The WCT 09:47 AM
https://twitter.com/cpu_cwcsonichu/status/1409507965623750672?s=21
They’re going to seethe so hard at this. lol
[REDACTED] 12:17 PM
Nova linked to that tweet in 2nd layer but didn't comment on it.
The WCT 12:18 PM
[Replying to "Nova linked to that tweet in 2nd layer but didn't comment on it."]
he should just take the L and walk away.
my opinion of course.

The WCT 01:16 PM
[Replying to "[Broken image attachment]"]
[YouTube link to "Mace Windu "You have lost!"" by ainsley harriot]
in all seriousness, why can't they understand by now why I actually did it?
Its literally simple why I went through with this:
1. Naught doxed me.
2. Meghan and Kyle are both bullies.
and 3. They talk shit behind Chris's back.
If they still believe that Naught is innocent despite all the concrete evidence being provided in the lolcow.org thread, I can't help them.
They can cry to Josh all they want, but even he will call them out for their BS.
Silvia Arrives, The WCT Continues Talking About Naught, Para Complains About Chris Discourse
28 June 2021
Summary: Silvia arrives in the server, and WCT welcomes her in. He then continues to rant about Naught, claiming that he will never recover from his lolcow.org thread. Silvia responds positively to this. The Fool joins the conversation and he and Silvia make their introductions, and WCT corrects her when she mistakenly refers to the Fool as Lainchu. Para jumps into the conversation and begins complaining about discourse around Chris and the way he's talked about behind the scenes, pointing out the hypocrisy in WCT's complaints about Nova and MKR's treatment of him. This sparks a brief debate, as Para (somewhat confrontationally) introduces herself to Silvia.

hey.

Howdy hey!
The WCT 05:05 PM
Safe to say that the Watchmen has been cleansed of its negative energy. (edited)
Silvia 05:05 PM
Thats amazing.
I’m catching up in this channel.
The WCT 05:05 PM
they literally believe that I collaborated with Praetor to take them down.

@silvia/emily ^
its this one. lol
Silvia 05:06 PM
Oh nuuu your reign is over
She’s so mean
The WCT 05:07 PM
Kyle and Meghan literally believe that I collaborated with Praetor. lol
but everybody in this server knows the real reason why I pulled off the coup.
Kyle seems to have read the thread on Naught, but he sounds confused af.
@silvia/emily here's the view count:
[Cropped screenshot of the Naught thread's stats, reading 84 replies and 3K views.]
3k.
Silvia 05:11 PM
That’s amazing I’m so relieved that the revelation as I call it has been revealed
The WCT 05:12 PM
[Replying to "That’s amazing I’m so relieved that the revelation as I call it has been revealed"]
they're so loyal to Naught that they believe that he didn't dox me.
And you know, its like what he once jokingly told me in the past: "dox yourself to take power."
yeah...
that didn't age well.
Silvia 05:13 PM
Haha. So I’m guessing that everything is slowly rotting away
The WCT 05:13 PM
Naught will never recover from that thread.
and besides, the group that he's been terrified of has been hunting down his dox.
and I've been told privately by anonymous sources that they're getting close.
If he does get doxed, he's finished.
Silvia 05:15 PM
Jesus. The fox has been cornered
The WCT 05:16 PM
I mean, who cares honestly.
if he gets doxed, too bad.
It doesn't matter at this point, Chris hates them now and they'll never get his trust back.
Silvia 05:22 PM
That’s a relief.
As long as ppl are safe. Especially Christine
The WCT 05:23 PM
ngl, I wish Naught can just DM me to admit his defeat. (edited)
Silvia 05:24 PM
Fair
The WCT 05:25 PM
in a way, I think my doxing is a blessing in disguise.
The Fool 05:25 PM
everything is interconnected, everything bad leads to good and all good leads to bad
Silvia 05:26 PM
Yes true buddist words
The WCT 05:26 PM
I don't know how long this server will last, but I'll make sure it will go on for as long as it can.
and knowing the people in here, I'm confident that Chris will feel comfortable.

I hope so. I want people to be comfortable
The Fool 05:33 PM
just keep on top of what you need at the time and the safest/most efficient way to acquire it

unlike the place, the people here are free to disagree without the fear of being banned.

Chris is a human being like everybody else here.

@The Fool Naught can't DFE everything.
The Fool 06:06 PM
that was a joke referring to terry
The WCT 06:07 PM
I'm sure you're aware, but Naught is unable to delete his account because of XenForo requiring the user to request their deletion to the admins.
and if Naught were to make such a request, he will likely be featured in thread again.
so he will be unable to delete his shit.

saying that nova and mkr talked shit about chris behind his back
dude everyone talks shit behind chris's back
there are no good actors here
i feel sad for chris but seriously what good is there to be said about chris
if he is human he is also flawed and open to criticism and ridicule
The Fool 06:14 PM
well, we mean a-logging, of course we're going to criticize chris behind his back but kyle was hanging on to his every tweet saying how retarded he is which gets old quick

Para 06:14 PM
who are you
some furry
am i supposed to know you
i am just pointing out inconsistencies
The Fool 06:15 PM
well at the end of the day this whole thing really is just because kat has a personal vandetta against kyle, mkr and naught
Para 06:16 PM
yeah i am just saying if its because of some higher value
its not
i like kat he's okay
hes not a bad guy
but to say its to treat chris as a human
its not
everyone in that other server talked shit about chris

I’m a former watchmen. Im Silvia or spunky. I left bc mkr and naught bullied me.

I never talked bad about Christine you can ask Kat. But I can understand how you could not believe me.

people think instinctively negative things about chris
The WCT 06:18 PM
I've known Para since Late last year. We used to be hostile towards each other, but since February we've been on good terms.

because he is a very sad guy who gets shit on by retards
constantly

he is a retarded flawed child

it'll never change him
it'll never be a good thing

Why help Chris when its better to let him do his thing?
Silvia 06:19 PM
I don’t think he is. He’s just unique. He has his quirks
Everyone does.
Para 06:19 PM
well it doesn't help chris it just causes micro trauma and excuses and shit
at this point i think people should be nice to chris
dont get me wrong
The Fool 06:19 PM
I'm just interested in psychoanalyzing chris since he's such a psychological tirefire. But yeah there's no helping him and he is fundamentally unlovable.

MKR Tries Provoking WCT & AquaDiamond8 Discussion
29-30 June 2021
Summary: MKR attempts to provoke WCT into messaging her, first trying to guilt him, then attempting to insult him. WCT muses that he could consider allowing MKR into the first layer of the new server if she cuts ties with Nova and Naught, but would not extend the same opportunity to Nova. Silvia and the Fool both argue against this idea, with the latter pointing out that MKR is trying to manipulate WCT. WCT agrees, and the Fool encourages him to move on, though he also (somewhat jokingly) floats inviting her to the server just to bully her, something which Para aggressively responds against.
MKR continues to message WCT, while the Fool and Silvia continue mocking her attempts to manipulate him. Eventually, WCT sends her a link to "Never Gonna Give You Up" by Rick Astley, and a picture of a group of young men with their arms in the air, before blocking her. Later, WCT posts a group of tweets by MKR, where she accuses him of wanting Chris to kill himself in a similar manner to Randy Stair and says that WCT is working with Praetor. Silvia mocks this, and WCT floats the idea of inviting former Watchman AquaDiamond8 to the server, and mentions wanting to get into contact with her.

if you feel a sense of guilt or longing it's because you're making yourself feel it

also mkr is ugly and a lesbian and I would not have sex with her

just be a total dick
I would

WCT's Twitter DMs With Helena Fiorenza
30 June 2021
Summary: WCT shares an exchange he had with enabler Helena Fiorenza over Twitter DMs. He informs her that the Watchmen were "under [his] control now" and that while he thought Helena was cringe, he didn't care what she did so long as she didn't harm Chris. Helena insists that she's aware of being cringe, and WCT goes on to explain that unlike Naught, he was willing to give a chance to anyone who befriends Chris unless it becomes clear that they have bad intentions. She details her plans to create visual novel games with people in the Sonichu fandom, and WCT expresses his doubts but wishes her luck regardless.

Posting the Full Taser Discussion, More Watchmen & Praetor Discussion
30 June 2021
Summary: A member of the server with a CWCki and Kiwi Farms account talks about the best ways to publicize the full Taser Discussion after WCT had leaked it, acknowledging a desire for caution in the wake of MKR's accusations towards WCT about wanting to kill Chris. I offer to post it to the CWCki instead, and WCT helps the other member identify which speaker was which in the Taser Discussion.
While this is happening, WCT talks more about the Watchmen and Praetor, glorifying his own position as superior to that of the former Watchmen members. The Fool continues to mess with Kyle and MKR and shares these interactions, which continues to serve as a launching point for WCT to gloat and demonize them.

I'm thinking I might make an alt account to post the Praetor chat video to KF. If I do it with [REDACTED], The Place will know I've been talking with you.

chris is gone, so, it's totally dead

The Fool 01:22 PM
yeah I know lol. I wouldn't worry, she's obviously losing it and not even chris is falling for her shenanigans anymore, you have way more clout than she ever will
The WCT 01:23 PM
As leader of the Watchmen, I sentence Meghan Kathleen Ringo to the Shadow Realm.
And I pardon Silvia and Lainchu (Anaxis) of treason.
The Fool 01:28 PM
I'm gonna poke the nest lol, since you posted her tweet on LC so I have reason to have seen it
The WCT 01:30 PM

Mad at the Internet

[Replying to "I'm thinking I might make an alt account to post the Praetor chat video to KF. If I do it with [REDACTED], The Place will know I've been talking with you. Or I could ask someone at KF who has no connections to either The Place or you to post, but that would be asking them to take on the risk of being targeted by the Watchmen."]
I could post the call to the cwcki if you'd like. Then it'd be public information and you'd just be acknowledging it.
The Fool 01:43 PM
good idea
The WCT 01:43 PM
[Replying to "I could post the call to the cwcki if you'd like. Then it'd be public information and you'd just be acknowledging it."]
will you guys incorporate parts of the lolcow.org thread?
like the screenshots that prove Naught was the doxer?
The Fool 01:43 PM
I wouldn't, josh is extremely scared of LC and censors even indirect mention to it
Lainchu (Anaxis) 01:44 PM
Idk. Doesn't have a ton to do with chris, it's more personal drama between the two of you.
The WCT 01:44 PM
[Replying to "I wouldn't, josh is extremely scared of LC and censors even indirect mention to it"]
the screenshots, not the posts.
[...]
Lainchu (Anaxis) 01:48 PM
I'm not exactly trying to stay on MKR's good side
I'll post it in a bit
The WCT 01:49 PM
[Replying to "I'm not exactly trying to stay on MKR's good side"]
have you long awaited this moment?
4 months in the making?
Lainchu (Anaxis) 01:50 PM
Haven't really been thinking about it, but I guess it's good that the full recording is being released
The WCT 01:51 PM
[Replying to "Haven't really been thinking about it, but I guess it's good that the full recording is being released"]
not really that, but the fact that you'll finally have real closure with Meghan? (edited)
Lainchu (Anaxis) 01:51 PM
Lol, closure?
I don't think that's what this is, but sure
The WCT 01:52 PM
Lainchu's revenge. lol
The Fool 01:52 PM
made her calm down lol
"come on dude show SOME dignity to this brainless retard"
really does talk like a middleschool bully
The WCT 01:54 PM
he's an asshole.
glad I won't bring him back.
The Fool 01:55 PM
anyway out of a sense of moral obligation I'm telling MKR to calm down and approach chris in a nicer fashion so be aware of that
just make sure chris doesn't fall for it
The WCT 01:56 PM
I'll tell Chris that he can still be friends with Meghan, but she's not welcomed in this server.
but even then, I don't know if he'll even consider that option considering all the terrible things I've shown him.
Not to mention that even Josh gave me additional support.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 02:00 PM
Probably not a good idea to have her continuing to whisper in his ear
The WCT 02:01 PM
[Replying to "Probably not a good idea to have her continuing to whisper in his ear"]
eh...good point.
I forgot that June 21st call exists.
Nova be like: "burden of proof! okay?"
The Fool 02:03 PM
yeah I honestly wouldn't trust her
kyle, mkr and naught are extremely manipulative people
I'm at least trying to get mkr to see how dumb this all is but I'm not optimistic for any of them

The WCT 02:07 PM
[Replying to "I'm at least trying to get mkr to see how dumb this all is but I'm not optimistic for any of them"]
that's because they're lolcows.
lolcows have no optimism.
The Fool 02:09 PM
everyone capable of speech is capable of being taught, it's the teacher's job to find the right words. sometimes it's very very hard, but it's always possible.
The WCT 02:16 PM
LOL THEY TAGGED HIS ACCOUNT.
[Screenshot of Naught's account on lolcow.org, with "Person of Interest" tagged on it.]
The Fool 02:16 PM
finally
The WCT 02:29 PM
So [REDACTED] i'll help you identify each person with the Praetor call. The guy at 0:35 is Kyle, dude at 0:40 is Caden, woman at 2:12 is Meghan, I'm at 7:40, Naught is at 8:53, 10:01 is Val.
but out of respect for Val, I request that he'd be kept Anonymous.
Him and I were talking a lot last night and he asked me privately to withhold his name.
[REDACTED] 02:29 PM
Been skimming the YouTube auto transcript, don't think it looks great for Praetor. Their line about how they want to give Chris the taser to help him experiment with unlocking the Merge is really dumb. At least they didn't want him to tase himself like the Watchmen claimed.
[REDACTED] 02:30 PM

Awesome, thanks.
[REDACTED] 02:30 PM
[Replying to "but out of respect for Val, I request that he'd be kept Anonymous."]
Sure, it can be written as Anonymous in the CWCki.

like I said before, people will stink they're cringe but it will be left at that.
The Fool 02:31 PM
make sure you emphasize that this is not a partnership with praetor
The WCT 02:31 PM
ofc.
The Fool 02:31 PM
you're just letting people know the truth instead of what the autistic illuminati manufactured
[REDACTED] 02:32 PM
Alright if I share the link with another CWCki editor? Maybe he could help write up a summary. I still don't have a chance to listen to the video itself.
The WCT 02:32 PM
sure.
Caden to me was just a numbskull that didn't understand what he was getting himself into.
The WCT 03:13 PM
@The Fool let me take you back in time.
https://kiwifarms.net/threads/orbiter-general-thread.75256/
The Fool 03:14 PM
I always ignored that thread because chris' orbiters are boring lol
The WCT 03:14 PM
This is the thread that drove Smoky Chris out of the CWC Sphere.
that was basically the peak of the Watchmen's reign of terror.
Silvia 03:18 PM
Wheeze I just woke up and oml mkr is having a cow
The WCT 03:19 PM
[Replying to "Wheeze I just woke up and oml mkr is having a cow"]
*being a cow
Silvia 03:20 PM
Either way she’s being cringy as all hell.
The WCT 03:20 PM
[Replying to "Either way she’s being cringy as all hell."]
its only going to get worse.
the CWCki and the Kiwi Farms have now been completely restored.
Silvia 03:21 PM
That’s good. But now I see mkrs true face. The drugs are gone so she’s having a withdrawal. Also how did aqua convo go
The WCT 03:21 PM
[Replying to "That’s good. But now I see mkrs true face. The drugs are gone so she’s having a withdrawal. Also how did aqua convo go"]
I've been unable to contact her.
so far, she still seems to believe the lie.
Silvia 03:22 PM
Damn. Oh well.
Discussing Naught and Lolcow.org
30 June 2021
Summary: The Fool comments on Lolcow.org admin Cjocker replacing a thread of Naught's with his own, and the WCT responds positively to this news, stating that Naught's "legacy" on the site was being erased.
#cwc-general (Second Layer)
NOTE: Chris was not directly involved in this conversation.
The Fool 10:05 PM
hahahaha cjocker replaced naught's OP of the null thread with his own
that was the biggest thread on LC and he doesn't even have that anymore
The WCT 10:20 PM
LOL
Get rekt.
“They’re picking apart my posts!”
The Fool 10:22 PM
I was the one who said they should do that but I didn't really expect them to actually do it
The WCT 10:22 PM
Naught just can’t stop taking Ls.
They’re really erasing his legacy on the whole site. lol
The Fool 10:23 PM
I don't like cancel culture but
it's funny
and if it's funny to me that means it's good
[Screenshot of The Fool praising Cjocker's action on lolcow.org, and Cjocker's reply.]
