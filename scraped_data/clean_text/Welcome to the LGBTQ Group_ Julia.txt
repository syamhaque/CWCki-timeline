I understand you're be- you're coming- ma- you're come, you're transitioning, coming out as a lesbian transwoman. Good for you. Anyway. Yeah. (?) wishes you a good luck on your transition very much. And from me, I say: welcome to the group! Huh? The group. The group! Of us: the LGBTQ! Good luck with that. And have a great and safe day. Julia.
