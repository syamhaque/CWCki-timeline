================================================================================

"CWC is sad" (officially "11112009") is a video uploaded on 10 November 2009 in which Ian Brandon Anderson cries over the marriage of Liquid Chris and Kacey, showing an intense amount of stress. He's also understanding and calm, which is quite strange considering he had just recently drawn a comic explicitly depicting himself shooting his unarmed romantic rival barely days before. This is obviously an attempt at sympathy from Kacey. The effect is somewhat ruined when Ian gets her name wrong at the end, calling her "Katey".
It would seem Ian has done something to fix his PSEye, as the reduced picture quality is more in line with the videos filmed with that camera rather than the one he started using in For Kacey II, and only an occasional skip is heard in the audio. He is also wearing the same shirt that he drew himself wearing in Sonichu Special 4, which was leaked on 8 November 2009. Given Ian's hygiene and the events of the preceding several days, it's not entirely out of the question that he wore that shirt for almost a week.
Note that Ian prefaces this video by saying that Kacey hung up on him before he could tell her any of this. This is in reference to a phone call from Kacey earlier that day. Kacey concluded the call by saying in no uncertain terms that she had chosen to marry Liquid, and that she wanted nothing more to do with Solid.
When it first appeared, many trolls wondered whether this video might be a sign that Ian had finally been "broken." As it turned out, this was not to be the case, for a contrived moment of pure luck was enough to give Ian's shattered heart a speedy recovery, and he popped up on YouTube again just a day later with a copyright certificate for Sonichu, showing no signs that his breakup with Kacey had any lasting effect, exactly as she had predicted.

Transcript
[Solid Chris sighs; his face grim]
Well, Kacey, I... just letcha know... because you hung up when I was, was trying to say it...
[a short intake of breath, 'trying' not to cry]
I'm sorry for hurting you and mistreating you, but, this, is a lot, it's some... lies... mixed it with honest truth... uhh... but, you know, it's fine...
[choking back another theatrical sob]
If you feel that your Chris will make you happy, it's fine. Congratuwations on your wedding. I wish you and Chris all the happiness in the world. [sob] I'll say... I'll say a prayer for you, for a lovely wedding and a safe honeymoon...
[Solid sniffles and sighs repeatedly, the picture of a man breaking down]
At least I... I care about you, Kacey. You mean...a lot to me. [sniffle] For more...more than just a friend. You have every right to be happy.
[another long pause, sniffles, sighs]
I guess I'll see you around, or hear or talk to you again or...... I guess.
[singing softly] "It's another day..."
But anyway, take care of yourself. Stay safe. God bless you. You're a sweet gentle caring person, tender loving care, Katey. I love you.
[Solid looks up and away, and the video ends.]
