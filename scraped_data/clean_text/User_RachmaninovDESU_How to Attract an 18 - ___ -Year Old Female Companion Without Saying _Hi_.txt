The cover.
How to Attract an 18 - ... -Year Old Female Companion Without Saying "Hi" (For the Very Shy Man) is a pamphlet on dating, written by Chris under the pseudonym "Reldnahc Netso' Naitsirhc". As we only have the front page of the pamphlet, it is unsure if the tract really exists. It would be plausible that Chris only made the front, and then became lazy and started playing video-games. According to the cover the work apparently seems to be a brief dissertation, explaining how Chris wanted girls to approach him, while he was engaged in Attraction Time. Chris probably planned to leave a stack of these guides near himself, while he sat around with his sign, and waited for the women to line up. Whether he actually distributed these texts, is unknown.
