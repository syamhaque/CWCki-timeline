================================================================================

Delusion disclosure: This article or section takes place during Chris's phase of role-playing as Sonichu. He may refer to his Christine Chandler personality and physical body in the third person by using terms such as "mama".
December was the 12th and final month of 2020. Chris uploaded more audio clips for the Sonic World mod this month, and confronted the creator of a mod that he had stolen content from. Chris also once again threatened that the Dimensional Merge would start after BABSCon 2021 was canceled due to COVID-19.
