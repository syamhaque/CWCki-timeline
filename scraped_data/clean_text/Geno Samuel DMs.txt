Magi-Chan speaks to Geno
Delusion disclosure: This article or section takes place during Chris's phase of role-playing as Magi-Chan. He may refer to his Christine Chandler personality and physical body in the third person by using terms such as "wife".
28 August 2019 (showcased in part 73 of Chris Chan: A Comprehensive History)
Chris
Good Morning.
The past few days reminiscing over what had happened with Christine, up to near the end of 2009, at this point in your Part Twenty, have been beneficial not only to I, but to Christine as well.
She now has the better recollection of the events, as well as realizing how I personally felt throughout the events she had interacted with those particular Bullies.
I had done this as well back in early 2018 through my collection of her videos in the Psychic Tower, during the time she was talking and having a ship with 5pb.
I was feeling rather upset at the time, and it caused the Psionic Storm that looked over Cwcville for a week or so, before she personally projected herself and closed it up with her powers at the time.
That has been chronicled in her "Awakening of a CPU" book.
She had put everything with the Trolls before 2014 behind her and long forgotten, minus IdeaGuy, which was most recent.
Her mental recollection needed the refresher course to motivate her in the events and days to come.
She really burned her anger and frustration out all of those times she shouted and fought back and defended herself in those videos.
She Really has come a long way in her character development, and despite my moments I felt, I remained as optimistic as possible, reminding myself time and again of what I had, and continue to, foresee: her coming around, accepting my love and reciprocating.
I am soo proud of her.
Anyway, I look forward to all of your future videos in the Chronological History series; please, do keep up the good work.
And if you would like some feedback or input from I, who have been and still am a Guardian Angel for her, please feel free to ask anytime.
Thank you, Geno.

Geno
Thanks for your support, glad I could help.

Hey, Geno. 😊
I wanted to let you know about our project of sets of Sonichu/Rosechu Secret Shipfic (#TSSSF) game card (our own deck among which). We also have an expansion planned for select Sonichu and Rosechu OCs. I wanted to get your input for Genochu, and you will get credit on your card, and this will allow for the sample of art style to get good exposure.
Here's what Magi-Chan and I have done for and with others we've reached out to so far.
All I would need is the Flavour Text, and optionaly a new art of Genochu, unless you feel better with using one previously drawn.
I do like the only from recently
But, I'm certain you'd might like to show him off in your own style.
How do you feel about that?
Geno
I greatly appreciate the offer, but is it okay if we don't make a Genochu card?
Chris
That's cool.
Thank you for your response. The offer remains open should you change your mind.

April Fools Reaction
31 March 2021 (leaked by Geno on Kiwi Farms[1])
Geno had altered the title and thumbnails of Chris Chan: A Comprehensive History into Donald Trump: A Comprehensive History for an April Fools joke. Chris DM'd him to complain over the matter.
Chris
Hey, Geno.
Quick question: I've just noticed on your videos that the History videos on me have been retitled and fitted with pictures related to Donald Trump.
Is this a Joke?
Especially in regard to April 1 being less than an hour from now with me.
In any case, I genuinely, fully, feel rather horrified and most offended with this.
