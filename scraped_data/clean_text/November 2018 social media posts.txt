2 November 2018
Please help my kittens! I will NOT get any of this money the food and medicine will be delivered to me! https://twitter.com/SonichuMerch/status/1058488939659644928
Animal control calls
2 November 2018
Oh, People. Did I Not tell all of you to Not Contact Animal Control? Because we’ve just had a visitor who came to check on us! Good Grief!
Liza adopted
4 November 2018
Also, I would like to add; Captain got me in touch with someone I used to know from The End Games. She adopted The Orange Kitten, Liza, after having tea and good conversation with my mother and I. I hope Her Son enjoys his new kitten!

Chris embracing his inner Amy's Baking Company
They are MY CATS! I am their MOTHER! Why can't you just leave me alone? I love and care for each and every one of Them!
Magi-Chan sayz
And Magi-Chan made those money-requesting Tweets yesterday, on our behalf.
Merge Sperg
Part Four: Post-Merge
And now, what will be After the Dimensional Merge, and everything has settled down? All buildings, objects, and individual people and creatures have been successfully brought together, of those what and who are meant to be, anyway.
DimensionalMerge
Very likely, Everyone will be able to return to their homes. But those whose homes have been altered by one dimension or the other's building, even on the possibility of moving back in with a (super)Hero(es), Anti-Hero, Villain, or yours or someone else's self-counterpart,...
The best and sound thing to do in the meantime is to move back into the one home together, regardless of Government-Regulated occupancies of the building. If need be, you all are more than capable of calmly discussing how y'all can live together better, or to relocate one...
...or the other with the local Government's Assistance and Help in the cost of the new home. And who stays should be determined in extensive thought and common sense of the current circumstances of one or the other; Keep Calm and take your time thinking about it, or seek...
...help from a local impartial third party to hear both sides, and make a fair and reasonably sound final decision on who stays and who leaves.
Another detail is the people who end up staying, while their self-counterparts either merges with them or dies.
REMEMBER, these people have had the MOST Similar or Matching Personality Aspects and Memories, so those of you all who are friends or family with these people are capable of picking up where they left off. Otherwise, if the individual(s) have no memory of you or the situation...
...that led y'all to become family or friends, it is possible to make a fresh start on y'all's relationship, or, if you feel it needed or choose so, to simply let them go and move forward with your life. My deepest condolences to those of you who end up letting them go.
Locations and Local Government: Now, for example, whatever city it was in New Jersey that has now become Gotham City, For Real, your home will have the similar or new address, with the obvious difference being that it's in Gotham City, and possibly the Zip Code.
You will likely need to fill out a change of address form to update that, at your local Post Office, and update anything else with your new address. The Local Government were your are is likely to pick up where it left off and resume work as quickly as possible.
Even the White House in DC will end up taking their time picking things back up and adapting to the Donald Trump of C-197 resuming work as the POTUS of the updated United States. The same will apply to the Nations and Countries with their respective World Leaders.
But, in due time, short or long, after getting everything re-situated, Everyone on the Earth will have become used to being around everyone who they had considered before as "Fictional Characters", and accepting them as the real people, anthropomorphic animals, intelligent...
...beings from other dimensions or planets, and so forth, as y'all had before with everyone else before the #DimensionalMerge. And life and time will continue marching forward and onward.
Another topic: us Creators/Artists/Authors and any and all Future Creations and Edits; will those Creations take place and happen on our Earth then, and our OCs being born here as well? That outcome is likely, so unless y'all had Previously, Specifically Drawn/Written...
...your OCs and their events in an alternate timeline, location, planet, dimension, galaxy, or so forth: EXERCISE CAUTION as this will not only affect the local area and space around your own Self-Counterpart, but Yourself, as well. Thinking it is one thing; Bringing it to...
...confirmed fruition is another, Especially if you take pen to page. Because, once you've completed that story, or even a word in a sentence with that ending punctuation at the end; moreover completing it by Signing Your Name on the completed piece; you will have set a...
...chain of events that will make that happen at least around your OC, or yourself.
Either that, OR a new Dimension for all that to happen outside of our combined Earth could be opened/created in all of this. Personally, I Want to Encourage Staying Creative and Creating, anyway.
SOO Much is still yet to be Final and Determined sound and well by the Cosmos and Fate of events. We will be able to figure this part out better later on after the #DimensionalMerge.
PHEW! That is a whole Meta Mind-Blower, right there. My sequence of thoughts have ended there, so I do believe that should be just about everything covered for The Merge Survival Guide. Any questions, please leave and comment to @SonichuMerch,...
...and the most Frequently Asked Questions will be relayed to me, and I, or Magi-Chan, will personally answer them. Also, you all can clear your thoughts and take deep breaths in a short meditate to ask your question in your mind and the wisdom of the Cosmos will respond.
Thank You All for heeding our warnings and information on the #DimensionalMerge. All of you, Stay Safe, Well and Creative, and Remember to THINK and Keep COMMON SENSE in your minds and hearts.

The best outcome in the #DimensionalMerge is 59% of 1218’s Earth Surviving and, not counting the OCs, 11.25% of C-197’s Earth Surviving. I am not at liberty to give the math answer, but it is sufficient to state that the division can be equal between both Earths, making room...

To clarify the earlier Tweets, the Ratio of those Surviving/Dying and the Margin of Error applies to Both Earths of 1218 and C-197, with the ratio being applied to each of them. So, in C-197’s Earth, OCs aside, the remaining population, 61.25%, is Equal to 1218’s Earth Population

...with the likely and best outcome of up to 59% of 1218’s Earth surviving, and 51% of the non-OC people of C-197’s Earth surviving.
See for yourselves, out of the percentages, how it equals out, with the chance of cost equal between both Earths, yet possibly moreso in C-197’s.

As I have stated earlier, Every Original Character Begins in our Sister Dimension, C-197, and stays there, unless that OC is specified to Mainly Exist in an alternate dimension or timeline aside from C-197.
Summary: Every OC Exists and Co-Exists, alive and well, starting there.

I’ve just heard: Stan Lee died from this world earlier today, 11/12/2018. Fortunately, his counterpart in C-197 lives on, and the two souls have merged together, and we will see him again after the #DimensionalMerge.Chris Chan Sonichu/CPU Blue Heart added,

I saw that; I like it, and so does Patti; she adopted that outfit for herself after seeing it. 😊Chris Chan Sonichu/CPU Blue Heart added,
A Big Fat Bear.

Friends:
A veteran with a paraplegic wife lost his dad this week.
The family can not afford to get to the funeral. This comes from a Navy Master Chief I know personally and trust.
Can you help get this family home for the funeral tomorrow?

But, on the Positive Note, for the first time in a long while, without requiring a Melatonin, I actually fell asleep in less than an hour’s time, and stayed asleep for up to five hours, before waking to Sylvia resting on my head again. 😸

I also heard about what happened in California; such a crime and shame. This is one reason why I encourage everyone to Think and practice Common Sense. At least the people made it out. I pray the fires get doused ASAP.

Also, Sylvia is doing a lot better now; her eye is clearing up. She should become a grown-up cat very soon.

If you live in the United States and are eligible, you should vote Tuesday.
Afterward, consider this idea: Be polite about it, no matter the outcome. Change the dialogue. Make it about leading, not winning.
