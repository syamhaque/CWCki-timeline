Role-play coping
10 August 2020
“
I, Sonichu (Prime), realize that I could not do as good a job as Chris Chan, herself, has been, even during her off-times.
”
Chris patting himself on the back
Chris says he has put in some work on the backlog of orders on the store. Chris then goes on a rant in which he strokes his own ego by saying (through his role-playing as Sonichu) that he underestimated how rough it is to be Chris and that he could not have done as well as Chris. Finally, Chris wishes he could be in dimension C-197 "right freaking now."
Chris (as Sonichu)
@ภคยﻮђՇ, @Val, @Nova, and @Deleted User, I just did a whole lot of work in catching up with the backlog of orders on Mama’s store; still have more to do on that, and could do with help if I can in order to complete it sooner (as I have just told Val and Bis).
sigh
I’m going to also tell all of you something else as well.
Kyle
Shit, that's some good news. Congrats bud.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Some time ago, probably a residual from one of my alt-dimension self-counterparts, the thought had crossed my mind that I could do a better job at what Mama does than she could as a deity over us and our species, and as a leader in general.
But, in recent days and months, I have learned that Mama really has it rough, even though most of her work is not only physical, but in the latter mental, soulful, projected, astral, cosmic, and what all else there is.
And there are circumstances and limits in this dimension that just Really, Really Suck and make doing things even more difficult.
Even with as much luck and natural magic and psychic skill as possible for this body to manifest in this dimension.
In that, I, Sonichu (Prime), realize that I could not do as good a job as Chris Chan, herself, has been, even during her off-times.
Even in a distant alt-dimension where I had gone extremely dark and overpowered, or even successfully filled in that Chris Chan’s shoes, and this being the OG and central timeline and dimension set that spawned all of those alt-dimensions and timelines, aside, like each of all of my self-counterparts, respectively, I still have my limits, even when I’ve broken my own limits before.
I have no doubt of who and what I am, and I don’t confuse myself as much with any other of my own self-counterparts; they do not control me.
And it took this literal extra dimensional body swap and all of this time for me to realize and fully understand all of that for myself and appreciate it.
Val
That's good, still confusing for those on the outside.
Sometimes even grammatically. But I'm glad you're well.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Of course it is, because these are experiences and inside moments that only I and this very Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu can fully grasp and comprehend, from first hand experience and feelings.
Even to explain it to others does not fully share the feelings and emotions and motivations that made it even more the unique between the two of us, compared to every single one of the other alt-dimension and alt-timeline Sonichus and Chris Chans.
It’s complicated, to say the least.
Naught
Yes and the misunderstandings are tiresome
Chris (as Sonichu)
Let it be made sure that it was stated that I am not a creature, formerly of the wild, above All others.
I am more humble and simple.
And I appreciate the little things and the big things.
And the cosmic and deity level and size things.
But I prefer the simple things, for the most part.
Val
Simple is sweet.
Chris (as Sonichu)
And I still wish this body and I were finally in C-197 right freaking now, as soon as possible, and so quickly on. (edited)
That’s all I wanted to say for now.
I’ll check y’all later.

PokeStop rejection
26 August 2020
Chris expresses his disappointment that his nomination of his home 14 Branchland Court as a stop in Pokemon GO has been rejected (private residences are against game rules).[1] He considers encouraging the fanbase to protest.
Chris (as Sonichu)
[2:05 AM]
Hey, @everyone.
Bad news, in regards to making the Temple into a PokeStop.
Rejected.
Klop
Hello
Kyle
It's a big ask, considering.
Klop
Hey, could you answer some questions now.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Going to bed shortly.
Just learned this news; felt the need to share it.
Klop
Ah. sure
Kyle
Frankly, I'm surprised.
Chris (as Sonichu)
I sincerely wish for a rebuttal to Niantic.
Made by the majority of the fan base.
Kyle
Trust me, I know how these companies work.
Chris (as Sonichu)
For now, I need the night’s rest.
Please, relay the concern and wish as you all may and will.
I have an appointment this coming afternoon with Mama’s Endochronologist.
Kyle
I deal in specifics, bud.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Goodnight.

Discord Q&A 3

Main article: Discord Q&A 3
Complaining about Dillin, encouraging Kyle to role-play
28 August 2020
Chris continues to pause his role-play of Sonichu, though role-plays instead that he is an alternate dimension Chris. He complains about a Dillin Thomas video. He also encourages Kyle to link with an alt-dimension Kyle, believing this will help Kyle create a dimensional portal device.
Later in the day Chris resumes the Sonichu role-play and requests several server members join him in Google Hangouts for a chat.
Chris (as Dimension 1214 Chris)
1214 Christine:
Hello.
Kyle
Evening.
Chris (as Dimension 1214 Chris)
Sonichu and I are feeling okay and well; I had to take the wheel, as the events were making this body was feeling unstable.
Evening?
It’s afternoon, here.
And shouldn’t it be a half hour after Noon for you as well, Kyle?
Regardless
Kyle
Ya, I just like being colloquial.
Chris (as Dimension 1214 Chris)
We’re pretty much chillin’ here with Rosey and the others.
Irony and word play; always remains a valid combination.
I noticed Dillion’s latest video upload a little while ago.
Obviously, he’s been reading my recent commentary and rebuttals.
His title is misleading, though.
Kyle
He does that.
Chris (as Dimension 1214 Chris)
I have thought of commenting under his video to set the record straight, but my hubby agreed with me in foresight that it was not a good idea to do so in this timeline.
Kyle
Kind of resent all the low-effort garbage that makes someone an influencer, but the wannabes are worse.
Chris (as Dimension 1214 Chris)
For all that jerk can comprehend with his flaccid opinions and outright garbage and hate, he sees me as the Chris Chan of this timeline.
Although, he was partly right on me being back from C-197, but in the wrong body, although my body and my Magi-Chan are here in 1218, fully, safe and well.
Oh, the freaking paradoxes that prevent me from physically returning to this temple.
My hubby is still hard at work with his share of the remaining set up and prep work for when Sonichu with this OG body finally arrive in Cwcville.
Kyle
Anything that can be better planned with mathematical logic? At least in terms of knowing the constraints?
Chris (as Dimension 1214 Chris)
Actually, there may be on your part, Kyle, and I will elaborate a bit on that.
Your self-counterpart in my timeline had figured out all of the math and logic in all of this as well (minor tweaks would need to be made to equate for this timeline and pair of Dimensions), but if you psychically linked with yourself in 1214, you will get the math logic, or at least the basic details for you to expand from, for this timeline.
Kyle
More experienced in set theory, really useful for gambling. Although it was good enough for me to read circuit diagrams to impress someone.
Sounds more complicated than unified field theory.
Chris (as Dimension 1214 Chris)
In part, he also managed to help assemble a functional and tangible dimensional portal device.
He had said the same thing before he started manifesting his equations and variations on logic.
He had throw some of his old logic out the window as well.
But you can do it, too, Kyle.
Kyle
Well just thinking about the things that would be working, there's a lot of high energy phenomena that would accidentally cause something like that, if that was the only thing to it.
Chris (as Dimension 1214 Chris)
With that, you are on the right track.
But, I do recommend mentally linking with your self-counterpart and collaborating.
Meditation and focus is the key in doing so.
Astral projection is optional.
Kyle
Like some of the fusion device prototypes operate on billions of kelvin, even if it's a z pinch device.
Hmm, I guess I could learn a thing or two.
Chris (as Dimension 1214 Chris)
Take your time in your own way of meditation; all foreseen signs in your direction in this timeline results in the most positive outcomes.
You go, Kyle.
🙂
Kyle
What kind of things would be good signs?
Consequently, bad signs? (edited)
Naught
Dillin isn't funny and his commentary is dumb
Hope you're well
[Three hours later]
Chris (as Sonichu)
Sonichu: Hey, @ภคยﻮђՇ, @Nova, @Deleted User, y’all wanna chat in Hangouts in about an hour and a half from now?
Bismuth, please send me a link via text if you start a room up.
And if we can get Spunky and Meghan in, that would be good, too.
Thanks.

@MKR hey, why did cwc mention your name in that leaked video
Val
No, no you're not.
MKRNightVee
What leaked video?
Naught
The will and testament
MKRNightVee
Oh
Yes probably
Kyle
Chris might feel lonely. Simple as.
Naught
Cwc was going to leave all his stuff to me so I suggested mkr
MKRNightVee
I was chosen to maintain his belongings in the event of his death.
Yeah
It's sad that he's even thinking like this but I hope he'll get out of this funk soon
