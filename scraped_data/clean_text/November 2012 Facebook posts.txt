Mi Sangre by Juanes?
2 November 2012
I am feeling lonely, again, and crestfallen. eHarmony is not working out as I had hoped it would months ago. I have tried locating my matches in Facebook, but without a last name, and too many photos in the results, it makes my head spin.
Socializing Online is not for me. I am too shy, paranoid, and the missing links and damage in my head, seriously hinder socializing in Person. I am mostly trapped at home. I go out, and I am oblivious and overlooking to nearly everything around me. Very few people will approach and talk to me. I lack total understanding of a lot of things. I am a constant blank in my mind. Stress in life, past and present, wears me down more quickly.
*sigh*...

Hey, check me out.
-I am always "on time".
-I am wearing myself out.
-It is Me-O-Clock.
-It's a quarter past me.
Feel free to comment with your own fun puns.

Feeling Down
26 November 2012
Feeling down again. Miss my dad. I wish I could go back to 1999 and change my future. Hating the male population for taking ALL of the women, leaving me lost, confused and with absolutely NO women to choose from. |:.'(
I feel like I want to Bully every young adult male I pass by shouting at them, "HEY! Quit Stealing Women!"
Blank
27 November 2012
I thought I would sleep off my emotions last night, but now I am crying all over again. I really miss my father, and I wish I could go back to 1999. And I want to go back home, in Midlothian...
