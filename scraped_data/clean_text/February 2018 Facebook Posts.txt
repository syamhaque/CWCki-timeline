Drawing at The End Games
1 February
Hey, y’all. Check me out with my easel and canvas; I’m drawing while I’m standing. 😊📝
A fan commented:
Is it easier to draw upright? I never thought to try it.
Jessica Quinn quipped:
It's basically the equivalent of an intense workout for him. I wouldn't try it unless you're in adequate physical condition.
Lulu opened to public again
9 February
**Announcement!**
My "Sonichu" Book Series is now back up on Lulu.com. I do pray we will no longer have any complications from anyone with that.
Also, TO NOTE: In regards to my Patreon, the Books of the Month shall continue, but the Big Difference is my personally Autographing the books, as well as getting the next available book(s) of the series a month or two before that book is listed alongside the others. And, of course, the Page Previews. I pray y'all will continue supporting me very well through Patreon as well.
Thank You All for your continued Support and Kindness! :)

Christian Love Day
24 February
❤️**Special Announcement**❤️
Everyone, please listen. I would like to personally talk about Christian Love Day, as it is not only my own Birthday, it is not a day of loving Christians, though they are people who derserves as much kindness and love as everyone else respectively and individually does. And side-note, it is also Mexico’s Flag Day.
But what Christian Love Day Truly Means to me, and I feel should be encouraged for everyone else to follow in suit on every February 24, if you would please: it is a day to extend your Love and Kindness to Everyone, Period, and do it with as much gusto and sincerity as you like. May they be Family, Sweetheart, Friend, Ally, Workmate, Creature, Plant, an individual who is a fantasy character in this world of ours, and, of course, even a stranger, or someone you do not know yet.
Share The Love Moreover! Let your Friendship and Family Circles Grow! Do Not Be Shy! The more genuine Love and Kindness you give, the more you Do get from them and everyone else. Give a Hug! Give a Smile! Say “Hey There”!
For Christian Love Day is the Special Day we give Love and Kindness to Everyone!
Thank You All Soo Much!
Love,
Miss Christine Weston Chandler
