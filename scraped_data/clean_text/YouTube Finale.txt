Transcript
Clyde, you are a liar...[removes glasses dramatically] and a vicious son of a female dog! [sighs]
Anyway, nothing you do will stop me finding my true love. And I swear from hand of God that you will see justice. I am going to turn you in to the police, and if you and I should ever meet in public--even at the police station--I swear to God I will...beat you up. I will punch [mimes throwing a punch] your lights out.
This'll be the last video I upload to YouTube, but my...inspiration shall continue. My, to my loyal fans: thank you for your patience. They will continue to be rewarded. As for those who despise me? [claw of fail] Justice will be served.
Peace. [makes a peace sign, realizes that his hand is facing the wrong way and quickly flips it around]
