This article is still yet to be completed due to stress. We get a lot of stressful torture in our lives that makes us crash into slumber. Given that inspiration is a big variable, and we may have been lacking of it, this article will be completed as soon as possible, at our own pace... HONEST! This article is missing the following:
• Finish the "In the Comics" section
Precognition is the purported ability to know or, as Chris puts it, "foresee"/"foreknow" future events.[1]
Though there is no scientific evidence for this alleged phenomenon, Chris claims to innately have this ability whenever something works in his favor, or tries to perpetuate a rumor that he wants to be true. For that reason, combined with his known propensity to lie, and some of the other outrageous things he claims to genuinely believe in, whether he truly believes in the phenomenon, or just sees it as a convenient way lie, or even a bit of both, is unclear.

List of Things That Chris "foresaw"
In a chat towards members of the Teen Troon Squad, Chris claimed that he "foresaw" that he'd be upset at Barb losing the Classic.[2]
When Chris had a dream about a golden disc, he claimed this was a solution to finally breaking down the iron curtain. He made his prediction that the Dimensional Merge would occur on 22 or 23 October 2020, and made a sermon about it later with the help of Praetor.
In a call with Cory Allison, Chris claimed that he predicted that he'd wind up in jail.[3]
A rather memetic example of this occurred in a 30 November 2021 jail letter from the fan Celestia. There, Chris drew his Chris Chan Sonichu avatar saying that he "foresaw [her] letter long ago". The drawing became a meme amongst the CWCsphere.
Chris has stated several times that he "predicted" Bella's supposed plan for him to commit suicide, that Bella had convinced him to have sex with Barb, and/or her plan to blackmail him with a sex tape between him and Fiona.[4][5] All of these were prevalent rumors and/or conspiracy theories about Bella that had spread around the CWCSphere after bits of the Incest Call had leaked, and Bella's identity was uncovered. This is despite the fact that he openly admitted to having this affair prior to the call, and that Chris would try and make incest permissible in his religion according to the Goddess Log.[6]
Chris claims that he predicted how the relationship between Dillin Thomas and his girlfriend would go.[5]
Chris claims to have predicted that Saberspark would watch Scott Pilgrim, even though he also claims that it was because Chris awaited for him to give his opinion on it.[7]
Chris tends to claim that he "foresaw" how bad a TV Show or movie was going to be after he saw it, or when he hears the public opinion of it otherwise, which only begs the question on why he'd waste his time consuming something he knew, without any doubt, he wouldn't like.[8][9][10]
Third eye
“
I had quite a night. Firstly, for what felt like an hour, my third eye was wide open and working in receiving goodness from the Cosmos, and my tiara flowed off of my crown chakra for about as long. My head felt Super Lively near the end, with the feeling of superpower-type and large with infinite wisdoms and knowledge. Wow!
And eventually, I fell asleep and dreamed a while. Woke up with “Twist of Fate" playing. My third eye jumped to life again shortly after, and it is still awake and active.
”
Chris[11]
The third eye is a concept from New Age spirituality tied to meditation that is associated with mental visions and precognition. Chris latched onto it as well around summer 2017,[12] using the concept to describe his daydreams of his imaginary friends, believing that he was really communicating with them.[13]
In the comics
Magi-Chan has the ability to see into the future.
