Chris's header
On August 15, 2017, Chris made a Tumblr account, possibly as a new social media platform to reach out to his fans. The bulk of his posts consist of reblogs of Patreon updates, along with many Facebook and Twitter statuses. However, occasional twitter screenshots will also make an appearance from time to time.

Intro
Hello, tumblr folks!
I am Miss Christine Chandler, creator of Sonichu, Rosechu and the city of Cwcville, VA.
I have been working for more than a decade, and still going well and stronger.
This is an expansion in my online network.
And, as I am just getting started here, please also check me out on my Twitter @CWCSonichu, my Patreon, patreon.com/user?u=4525122, and facebook.com/CwcvilleGuardian.
Thank you for your patience as I will share content on here as well.
Interactions with other Users
Chris left several comments on the fancomic, Rosechu's Story, which he liked so much that he ripped it off for Sonichu 15.
On a reference to the manner in which his medallions were crafted:[1]
In that regard, the Cwcville Gym Badges manufactured in Cwcville are actually made of metal, like that of an actual pin or gym badge. Here, in this reality, I don’t possess the skill set to make custom metal pins. But, eventually, the Cwcville Badge pins will be available for purchase.
When the strip pointed out Rosechu's superfluity as a character:[2]
I was never a chauvinist. Regardless of my feelings about women, both genders are equally able to things the other can (not counting the default child-birthing under normal circumstances). Also, having one be wild, and the other previously trained, was just how it happened.
Inquiring about the identity of the song For You, I Will by Monica:[3]
What song is that?
Not getting a reference to his multiple acts of plagiarism:[4]
Uh-oh! Lol!
