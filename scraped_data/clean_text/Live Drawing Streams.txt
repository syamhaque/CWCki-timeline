Chris spends 39 minutes drawing line work for one page of Sonichu 11, the first new page created 561 days after he quit working on the comic in 2015. And in a move rivaling that of the Brutal Legend video, Chris's voice is not heard throughout the live stream, though the Playroom theme continues to drone on. Clearly it was too much of a hassle to do a simple mic check before starting the stream, showing that old habits die hard when it comes to Chris.

Chris remembers to use the mic this time. He films himself using Photoshop on a laptop for an hour and a half, putting together a collage of photos of himself and his parents mixed with drawings of the Sonichu klan.

[Chris stands in the middle of his room]--ve fro--from home once again, with another live drawing... special. But except this time, we have already done the drawings, and scanned them into the computer... of which we are going to put... these pictures... onto to the pre... taken... photographs... for my--for the eleventh book. So, right now, I'll be transferring you live to my laptop. (ugh) And I gotta switch the input, well, wait, no I dont- yes I do. Cause I want my Britney Spears to... [Unintelligable] I want my Britney Spears...
Alright so yeah; y´all get to see my laptop for once. Okay so right I have my flashdrive with the photographs for these special portions of the special pannels for these pages... For this- for this video were gonna- were gonna put together the group photo in front of the house.
So anyways im on my external flashdrive... Find the photo...Okay so thats the first photo, and we need to resize it, [ugh] not only for the resolution, but for the width of the page- pannel. And we gotta have the resolutions match, uh so anyways as for to match with what I have so far for a previous idea, I got out me and my mom and my dad I have the picture so I gotta find the file with these cropped out portions that ive already made. I printed these out for my s- for my referance. I may have to do a little erasing on the pictres itself as I put em´ in and of course they´ll be resized, they´ll individually resized to match. Aight so- so thats me, and im bringing in my mom, and the reason her legs look green is because this was a photo taken were she was standing in the garden. But for the sake- but fortunatley these two pictures of my dad and my mom were from the same photograph, except for the sweater, and I had to give her her house coat and I had to give him his sweater cause it was- cause in the book here it was December 2008.
Oh by the way any time during this video... please, please, /please/ donate to the link below in the description of this livestream. I´m only gonna ask that once for right now while I work on this.
Anyways I gotta get it all sized to match so we´re gonna- so we´re [unintelligable] gonna take care of that first and take it- my polygon and zoom in on me first cause I´m in the center of the thing, and were just gonna crop me out...
uhm and this is a recent photo sure but you did know that this shirt still did exist back in 2008,
and this is part of the story where I ended up cause I- cause this verion of myself has seen me in the future, which is the present, and I´m gettin´ a head start in 2008 essentiallly so just ignore the braclet on my arm. Just pretend this picture is part of a 2008 group photo.
Doo doo doot [extended silence with pop music in the backround]. Alright [sigh], click, uh oh! Am I in the right layer? Aw shoot. Alright, now I got-- Okay here's the layer. Alright, get rid of this thing. [Chris deletes the previous layer and sighs again] Get rid of this- cardboard cutout. And, kinda, resizing myself in reference to- the doorframe, im holding the shift button so it all stays constrained and proportioned- bout' that tall per say in relation to the door- and we're gonna put me about there. [Chris moves a shitty cutout of himself next to a group of trashcans] Or abouts, over there, and in reference to the photo I end up being a little larger cuz im closer to the foreground, so im going with the photo reference where my head goes a little bit above the window- there[??? the fuck does any of this mean]. Hmmm... [something] go about... hmmm... hmmm... I need about one more bar up there-- Okay press enter to accept that for now. Now.. my mom, jus' gonna do the same thing here.. [Chris drags a photo of a younger barb in a garden on screen]
crop around the photo. At least this time I can go in a little bit cuz..... [long pause] The house coat was part- was- this part was actually from another photo..... But because I didnt- Because I didnt have the full... house coat... I had to make do with a buncha white. A whooole lot of...... White- To make the appearance of- the remaining house colt- house coat. While having the rest of my mother por...trayed here but, as she was, in this separate photo where she's kneeling in the garden. [8:15]

Live from home, and...I just heard that Planet Dolan's doing a drawing competition. So, with what I started as just a cover, I'm gonna do as an entry for the contest--I see it as a [something]-ful opportunity. So without further ado, let's get y'all down to my drawing level.
[Chris aims the camera at the desk. The camera begins wobbling.]
I'm going to put this on my other...
[Chris push a button on a remote, chortles, and adjusts the camera.]
(mumbling) Yeah, make sure... Mm... Uhn... Don't, nowait-- I mean it's down there, not up here.
Anyway, so, in the meantime, I'm puttin' this on my PC so we can enjoy...the music...that I like to listen to.
[Music starts.]
This is music from uh, Ashleigh Ball's new album, Love is Gold. It is very good, seven tracks. My favorite song of it is Shining Colors but all her songs are catchy. So with her music being included, uh, I give credit to her regardless... Uh, this video will not be monetized.
But anyway, um... So with that, what I'm going to do is... I'm making three section, as in what I had in my idea for...amongst the story arcs of my Sonichu / Planet Dolan crossover special. It'd just be kinda like a preview, like a trailer kinda thing. So, it'd be like... One story arc section there [points at top panel], then another one here [points at middle panel], and then a third one there [points at bottom panel]. And this one-page trailer, "trailer" using quotes, will be my entry into the--into this competition. So without further ado, here's a live art drawing stream.
[2:03]
all right takes me what I think you let's put the top section to two halves to make for the first section of which let's do this sont you and roast you meet Dolan a newbie so let's get sawed you start over here [Music] that's a angling his nice how where he's looking gonna be looking at plant doll at danger dolan right in front of him red cheek their one-year other ear suit [Music] so it's when they're going to shake hands instead of fist bump because the fist bump happened on the coverage so control science shoes right arm in hand and I got is one thing I do when I take it off hand gestures or similar it's like I played out in my mind at least through my hand figure it out for myself see how it looks so okay this is my right hand when it's the gesture so let's see ideally Dolan would have his right hand out like that I think yeah I'd say thumb goes over his fingers go over so yeah thumb over fingers under right all right so let's cut Sonichu's thumb right there and his fingers downward like so leave the flat last one blank so it can make room for Dolan's fingers right up there don't thump right there and we'll draw the fourth finger on subtities pinky and so we'll just extend that arm out come back to Dolan a little bit first I'm going to finish drawing Sasha over here so we're going to get his in his chest and start on his left arm hello scamper I'm busy mice can't buy cats camper just entered I'll give him some petting later all right so Sasha yes then it's in that up gonna finish that skin that skin belly cause brown stripes plus the spikes on its back here's his tail [Music] hmm gonna play like down stand legs let's say like that the suck my shoe I say part of the shoe it's better to me tree or so okay we got Hachi almost done and uh hmm just some simple like that so he's guys left hand down like shaking Dolan's hand with his right with the reference of Dalton over here hmm we'll draw a circle for the head hmm can you even the drawn one eye and then the other [Music] okay so we're going to draw a stick eyebrows it must smile the darn old duck hat [Music] we have put Dolan's arm down as well just cuz he has three fingers let's deal with that give you four fingers I mean resume reason why they gave Mickey Mouse and all the others three fingers was because it was less expensive to draw that compared to torn that fourth finger Garn this so I'm going to get miss foot there and foot there we go nice there's Sonichu and Dolan let's give them a gentle general hey nice to meet you and say hi guys how you doing say hey are you doing okay come he's here stop it [Music] and all in nice to meet you [Music] yeah all right so that going on and then well I guess I won't be able to get roast you and goobie in the picture in the drawing now it's so small yeah but look I get Don say likewise how's it going like mice how's it going [Music] well all right so we got that speech balloon going on hmm where I got a background to definitely show because know we love details hmm but then again the backgrounds on the plant going videos or so minuscule like that so I'm gonna say for the mama we'll just do a simple city background they're standing nearby where the city is on one side of the road the traffic could be going we don't know what plan but doens planet looks like or all the little cows we're gonna add the street lines because it's divided you want cars going one way in the other and we gotta say the outside is like a park they're hanging out there meeting at park across the street from somewhere in the city so we'll get dropped few small buildings across we're outside walk make sure that sidewalks visible some nice room it's barely visible there but anyway so I guess I walk there and make sure the same draw window another window there's a simple door door knobs on the wrong side but who cares I mean nobody knows what these places are right now it's just so alright so this one's a lot this one to be a wine store we're going to put door over here just then this bottom part make it look like make it more obvious that it is a door everything will be coated later and behind the buildings we can add a little bit of roof top there and there's more buildings and we're just few skyscrapers looming over so that's basically simple now let's see for next panel for this two-part preview [Music] can I sell its side that simple idea we're just going to draw their faces I'm just going to zoom in on their faces so we start with his head are still looking each other like that facing each other and so mm-hmm sweet I mean where's my spiel of all up I hope that goes through your low to short wait that's a simple fits hmm actually Paul you did great job on this album and someone let's my gosh a little bit about that hey wait I'm so sorry took his hand back and I'm gonna say his arms his arms still down so there's that Bailey top part with his back spike it's a phone up and then circle for Dolan's head mm-hmm it's just his arms down so this other one because they're just talking and nice thick eyebrows so yeah what one was I personally called ahead me Christine Chandler over in the quick build dimension yeah so I call it ahead I set up this little meet greet and tour of flat Dolan well I'll go ahead and color go ahead Mike and I packed that piece of the hat alright so let's see sine she says [Music] I've been looking for I've have been looking forward to this tour since since Christine since Miss Christine I know how to differentiate that from me and his daughter is bisexual daughter anyway I have been looking for I've I want to try to save room for on the letters [Music] actually you know what nice and some more nice I've been looking forward to this tour my kids and Christine there you go our fans of yours [Music] this tour hmm my family and Christine özil family [Music] or faint our fans of yours [Music] all right so we just melt down off and then let's say simply put four darling we'll say awesome well we got a lot on plate doing let's start with the animation building alright so [Music] you've a lot on plant Dolan let's check out the animation department check out the nomination hmm let's check out the shelf at the building where the show is made where the shows are made hmm let's check out the studio there it is studio Oh something like make sure why don't you hey they have tons in them let's check out the studio so make that speech balloon and trying to separate that promise I choose balloon at the city background my window window not go bill see as much of the doors I can see more of the door of the building with the wide window right visit door knob I'm going to add a window step building and they're good and skyscrapers all right so that's one story arc because we're taking it we're all here except for wildin Simona because they stayed behind in quick fill because they promised to take sandy and subpoena to Busch Gardens a told Santi and his family died and I believe Sarah Sarah rose who she comments to what she says to wild and his family she says hey when their fathers as fast as not as fast as ours are and you got to spit and you got the foot speed that we did it's nearly the same as his you don't need a ball coaster ride you go on your own but obviously wild similar don't run as fast as our main sign chain nose - all right so part two this one idea I had so I'm going to try I'm going to try this in three I'm going to put this into three panels it's more tall than wide it's we're going to do there alright so another idea had so we got hell bent and Blake so the first blanks kind of mmm young essays neutral about it's up he's nutri about the trip so he's not angry yet so and drop Blake with us his eyes so yeah I mean comparing how they would be taught in like their so he's gonna be you know he's looking up yeah it's kind of neutral so it's good make his eyebrows kind of just making horizontal right he's drawing his head of course his head is black so we'll obviously color in the red later alright so what do I want to do with his arm since this is hell-bent coming along he just had hey he just said hey and I how's it going just say oh okay just here on the tour with just on tour with my family and friends and help and just look at the pic and art picking argument son side comment my father always like to pick an argument with me now and then I never was really fond of that it just would piss me off when he tried to pick an argument so let's see and I'm just here hanging on I guess some we can have him with his arms crossed so hmm say so I'm gonna put his hand going over there crossing arms difficult to draw so yeah it's kind of works cool that's good on crossing and it's so his legs bottom strike by mmm this little bit of a little tail good so he'll pack his head will be up here I'm a good goat I mean I look for everybody and plant darling on Twitter and also googled their characters to get their drawing references I know how to draw them yeah so a little easier you know education never knows where cheering cuz we're meeting nollie Shima but doopy ladybot and Ramona are there too hmm mommy well Seema yeah she's the party cast we did not like the male voice after in that last animated video if you can't get Shima but the actual Seema backup for a female voice actor with a kind of a similar deep tone voice what I'm saying anyway richer inform anyway that's for me that I'm personally cheering for hapc do P and ladybot that's me Dukey and ladybot but their words I'd see them all together anyway but - it's about to help it hmm start with join the bottom of his head have a flat shape and as a goatee he has kind of an elf ear just along with devil horns well why not have them both so so here is one horn here's the other so we're just going to write so here's his mouth right there hmm he's not angry yet because he's about to pick the fight with Blake here so leave his eyes kind of top flat and his eyebrows horizontal right so just going on from the eyes and then his hairstyle is purple hair and in the Google result in the Google image I got and I think also on his Twitter the hair his hair is purple don't ask me I thought his head was I thought here was black and hellbent if your hair is actually black that was just the image that just the one image or two then I apologize but in this sample comic we're giving you purple hair anyway so drawn to Nick there's a the colors of his the collars of his jacket hmm let's see what else ain't in here collar of his shirt underneath his jacket didn't miss me buckles hmm I think there's three by guy's hand covered up anyway on this so let's see who all right let's say he has his right in his right arm and hand despite we'll give him a lit cigarette helps us a few puffs of smoke coming from it and I'll gotta say he's pointing this left hand directing to Blake [Music] because he's got a few things say few things to make just four complaints about towards the side to Brandon some of the problems we've had really that's part of his belt mmm say legs there you go all right so giving this thumb this index finger and then the other two on this hand and not long enough there we go all right so it helped us mean the filmmaker so let's see [Music] yes oh yeah he said well I've heard you've got copyright troubles and your books in your creators realm dimension [Music] copyright problems in Christine's real dimension [Music] real life dimension [Music] hmm giving this speech balloon and then like counters he says well we've got all that sorted up it's a silent agreement [Music] all that I can write small but sometimes the long but when you got a word in with a longer words it's just not enough room [Music] and I don't have enough word no ferment me mmm I think I'll skip the typing when I submit this I'll know I want to give this thing full effort but I mean still just not fit words and difficulty proposed speech of speech balloons alright so in a later part stop my knocking help and drags Blake down into his hellhole which literally is hell that's let's say right now there's still above ground [Music] let's give them a Cygnus give them a city background - for now so building and camera angles and put right doorknob the window there Ausmus skyscrapers scraper lines alright that's panel one beginning of that argument [Music] and I forgot one thing I don't have room for he's got a little bit more hair coming down the side of his head over here shoot no I can't think I everything you've once got try anyway all right so all right so right now we're going to zoom in on their heads like we did up there mm mm aw hell pants head and maybe night so I'll give his little little bit ear there here's this goatee make his mouth bigger cuz he's really when yours is frown you really wants to start trouble now [Music] he's really close to his shoulder out that's when we're getting that there all right now we can get back his hair that we forgot to draw there [Music] and then we'll draw a close-up of like just [Music] [Music] okay now like is starting to get his frown on normally he doesn't like to start and I'd like to start an argument or pick white especially since he's been reformed by bubbles but at this point he's like he'll defend his family and friends and creator of course that's me and everything about the water quick bill so he slashed his shoulder for - all right so we got he'll been saying I really Bizet's me all the orders making comment combination of a hedgehog and a mouse [Music] the [Music] and Yuri [Music] you date a combination you taint a combo of it dogs and mice [Music] young two exclamation marks for that trollish piece of hate and now it likes defense his quip is like [Music] I don't like to take arguments [Music] but that's my family you're talking about [Music] that's my family you're hating at [Music] hey net 12 give three exclamation marks blood boiling blood boarding and just you gotta rotate this love and like love like you know give each other they hate I so much was between but a combination the flames and electricity between the halves of them and there's Lehman a thorough the moment [Music] really really angered bring such movies I do [Music] toss some lightning bolts because they're coming I was red cheek now [Music] he's really really angry [Music] in a fist raised [Music] yeah here goes out but this my rage [Music] it'll need fire in his eyes cuz he's got the flames of hell behind him who Shh [Music] we'll turn the flame the hell behind him in on my went as soon as I get his heron whatever else I can fit into this panel done here's the foreground characters come first you want to make sure you can put your background behind everybody [Music] [Music] there's this first [Music] I'll take it loosen up buckle their swimming sure that's there [Music] you gonna knuckle there that's for sure nice isn't it I'm and I hope I didn't just accidentally press the wrong button from that from knocking my controller down we're still on their wrists on there you ever saw on the air alright I've got to music so mmm kind of a mash of opposing as you got it hiding behind am [Music] then here comes the flames behind hell-bent for and that's me of that story our tremor and then I did take a brief moment to cool down if I may [Applause] [Music] [Music] I never want to think I will I mean I was trying to figure out what I wanted to do for the third story our trailer on yeah yeah I wanted to do like kind of a verbal debate between magic Chan and Nitz iam magic ten Silvana stays behind by magic chant he teleports everybody from quick Virginia to plant Dolan jokingly actually located on the other side of the United States that's the joke the actual headquarters being over there so I think for oh yeah and just goes toast just watching them debate he's not putting input at all as they're talking all right so let's just I went to draw close-up of magic Chan and that time copy and paste what I have you pasted this stuff like it'll work [Music] as you see with the idea being since nityam is the Lord of the Dead and magic chant is psychic they would be able to have kind of a meaningful discussion about life death and maybe museums goals as or the dead still up for debate what NIT cm would say because that's commenting on how magic an appropriately responds yes so those right arm cause he's in a meditate seat same position [Music] now his hand on one leg [Music] and on the other leg hmm still trying to still point down from and pathetically raising my anger [Music] eight minutes oh shoot yes the lake is crossing his legs of course those let's past Vince's suck and we need to give them this tail [Music] and then withdraw Mitsy I'm over here placing match in hmm it's gone I've got kind of an oddly shaped head from the image I found especially with this hairstyle to go with it so we'll start there's ice and his bushy eyebrows his nose down there and I guess its tongue would be gray that's my guess I don't I can't say off top of my memory because it comes to top 10 videos when I do paper I do watch the aunt wants the animations and whatnot I miss a detail sometimes honey I should like clip miss pay attention to the details some pay attention to the script it's somewhat important right so drawers hairdos guys put down hmm and see give him his neck I'd give him a bit more hair behind him from the collar of his armor gel coat whatever is that shoulder pad on both sides ah Joon too close no I will just his arm to his side for the moment there so withdraw his other arm the guy give him is unrequited unnecessary pectoral images and he needs his ears [Music] right so like I remember what not I remember oh and those toast just speculating [Music] hi son waiter both way up in the sky net they're both high up in the sky so we so when I get to the back when I could draw a few clouds all right sorry way speculate saw being dead is awesome and he agrees with him to a point but then I mean like I remember when my magic chance points because he made a good point I just came member I said there ah [Music] I think I'm starting to get a memory considering you are Lord of the Dead do you can see yourself lord over their souls [Music] see [Music] Lord of their souls the way I see it [Music] you write you reign over the deceased bodies [Music] [Music] and you conserve those at your command [Music] all those bodies without their souls [Music] [Music] [Music] and I'm just going to speculate on what how knits ium would reply to a question like that get their side of the page here let's see I think I imagined he would respond [Music] well you see well I do command the dead bodies [Music] [Music] hmm and those bodies are without their souls [Music] [Music] [Music] hmm then he thinks for a moment hmm now their souls I'm all of the dead bodies but their souls are up long have long left those bodies when I come to claim those bodies [Music] Peter reincarnated up in heaven our Hale I'm just going to the dead bodies hmm [Music] all right so he's thinking all this and his name his mind while he's processing this questioning of him being totally Lord of the Dead all right so we put a little space for his moot group room for thought his thinking [Music] and a hint in initially and response' you prove Rebecca you prove of great points [Music] you prove a great point as the souls and spirits are still alive [Music] and we'll just leave at that and I'm going to draw cloud there mmm the clout there and now we can do background because we just give them one portion because here this is one portion of their debate show discussion now we can now I'm just going to come back to the ps4 and put for a moment I just want to make sure we're still on the air we'll color this in we're still on the air oops all right let me get my markers and we'll color everybody in I like to color the characters in first and foremost and I like to try using going through these in the same color where it is respectively throughout until when I have exhausted the need for that one color so we're starting with the flesh tone put-down starting on the first sides your drawing here and Saatchi and Dolan has no flesh on eyes no push tone on him so we'll move on then it's turn down to the next size shoe and like yes he has at that color on his mouth area and his arms as well so we'll take care of all that hmm we'll take this small bits and get to him over here and of course my dad chin [Music] all right pick another color we'll go with the basic yellow but because it's a minor detail all detail but one that should not be missed regardless magic Chan's eyes are yellow so we go ahead take care of that and then we'll talk Oh in sideshow in this panel [Music] and by the way in case you and just to put into a kind of a perspective this is essentially a normal thought process of a go through as I drawn right each actual page in my book so if you ever wonder for yourselves how long it takes for me to draw and color a page you can start the timer when I started drawing this page and up to when I made the last hand contact point in the bottom there say that's the time and then to separate you can mark the time when I pulled out my markers and I started the coloring process you combine those two times that would be a nest a rough estimate how long it takes me to color to draw right and color a full page in my books I say we're going to do green for the eyes I know it's a tedious it's kind of a it's a long process considering but when you consider all the details throughout and the folk and the final product being finished event soon enough it's worth it love colors did it the day yeah we got the red so we're going to hmm coloring going to give help in his reddish glow Oh his eyes are yellow too I see this is a thing this is an earth thing but I got a do character I'm doing a new character and I'm not familiar not have it drawn that character as often as often as my main characters it's a whole new thing for me to add to my get used to list that's one I do want to work around and get used to anyhow say wait to continue coloring room help at his reddish glow [Music] kamesh tongue [Music] we'll get to the roof of the colors of the roof of their mouth later by bringing that one darker shade of red like using for that particular in Santa one miss a piggy tail so that's his bottom stripe and that's the end of his mince and it was tail and then I realize I should draw on his tail going upward now well in aspect you could say his tail is going straight out [Music] it's like an open interpretation right there anyway mmm oh but also I try so when coloring or drawing with my pen well moreover on the coloring aspect I tried to go from left to right as I am right-handed oh so I don't accidentally get the ink on my hand [Music] take notes my nerdlings cuz these are valuable assets of knowledge that you can take I can you can attribute for yourself in your own drawing skills that you learn throughout your lifetime not taking a lot of our classes throughout my lifetime and that's written regardless of my final abilities being considerably childlike it's still a skill that I own especially with the markers and whatnot and you couple that with the autism and attention to details yada-yada-yada attention deficit disorder it kind of bounces out really [Music] but again that's their own interpretation to make as you will versus what I have in my noggin for my own perception [Music] don't have to color in there Mouse here cuz is there he's just showing your teeth [Music] Oh just scowling that stares to where the day right there scowling [Music] not the a it's a word of the day if you don't know that word then they go it's your word of the day scowling let me lead at the bottom of his eyes on color because their foot there and flamed with the orange colored because he's that angry [Music] we'll get that little bit and so thinking about then I take the darker shade of red and I take the orange oh I missed a spot yeah pay attention to the script it's somewhat important you never got to come and magic chance tongue - this is why you pay attention to the script if you don't want to miss a detail hi Mike oh right mouth coloring so dark a sheet of red on inside of mouth and now the orange for to accentuate the flames the bang of upset and anger and Blake's eyes there yeah yeah when it comes to selecting the color I go with the colors of the first thing I'm going to color in and then I just relate that now on so that step I'm going to go with my very charged blue and get that out of the way because I like doing the make sure I got all the brighter colors either way before I do anything the black or brown is if I code if I did the reverse I could accidentally get brown on the lighter color I don't think we have any this shade of blue on match and so we're good to go or do the brown next for the stripes on this soon is back his tail right there this one right here does anybody else need the brown go south needs brown but it's a lighter shade because he's not burnt to a crisp that's so I am complete I say plaque for the very last color throughout regardless because that's the darkest color of all you don't want to get that anywhere on any of your other marker colors so with that we'll go with a dark shade of blue as that it's not only a color of certain portion a Magi-Chan but also Dolan's hat [Music] hey does anybody see my hat I can't go out anywhere without my hat then I just look like Zahra gamba put our beard if you shave this year but we both look alike could you be able to tell us apart yeah he's washed down oh yeah there you go free imitation of Dolan free vocal imitation at Dolan [Music] mmm anybody else checking hell-bent as well let miss spot there mmm I guess I got everybody with the shade of blue all right so ever got next I say black the last hmm I'd say we go with the boil purple he also kind of has the yo reddish color there um let's see I think that was either I think that was this shade or I can't forget which one I use it's probably this one or yeah that does not look like the wine it's kind of more like the shade of purple hmm I'm just going to sneak that in and see how it looks it see it looks sing huh I guess I remember correctly that is the shade that is the correct color for hellbent shirt because when did I draw this I do this on the 30th which was a week in the day ago drew and colored that same day yeah we want to just go ahead and color and tell bents shirt guys his colors black ah off its it later because black supersedes all other colors as it being the darkest and you put black over any color why does it changed - it just all goes directly to black do not pass go do not collect $200 three cents or but the donuts alright so now doing the world purple this is the color we're using for help it's hair as that was the original shipment was yes is the darkest shade of purple I have so propo or black this close and again if it is black guy if this here your hair is black help it I sincerely apologize you can collect me later [Music] I just felt that office I felt like I needed to fix that then the side side way view panel now if I actually had this head Malone horizontally I had done this without having to rotate the page that's neither here nor there right now because it's already done [Music] also the situation as to why we have these pre-drawn four lines to make the rectangle of this particular piece of paper is actually a neutral well upgrade will recently to be reminiscent of mmm DPR of pixels 1325 by 2050 that is the rector is the usage for that of when I upload the pages to my publishers website that is the page size for those book those comic book pages and so since we got the purple ending on magic Chan we're going to swap to the lavender and finish coloring magic Chan over here so anyway with these all free with the lines pre-drawn all round and foot and foot a copy in that sense [Music] versus if I use the whole sheet of paper when scanning the page into the computer it would cut off from the edges anyway so it's just easier to have the lines they are already then it's more accurate to the page and verses the original size I have let's actually this one on the back this originally was about that's how you see it's wider almost as tall and as you can see in books 0 through 10 and up to the new up to episode 23 Simon shoe and banana funcle' in book eleven after that's published yeah the previous the past pages will been like originally widescreen but then smushed horizontally so from here on so from 23 on outs to since we got that page size page dimensions set then they don't end up looking so horizontally smushed that's the idea [Music] and I'm going to go ahead coloring ghost toast with the lightest shade of brown I have which is this coffee it comes out looking like coffee so I call my coffee my coffee brown go there you go toasty bud all right finishing hell-bent jackets need some new gray mm his cuffs are gray and we dunk we can't see his belt buckle so it's not a karma thing hmm I like using the pen for shading for coloring in the pupils of the eyes versus using a marker to color that in as in it reflects more emotionally out of from the eyes using the pen in that sense and it's seen its ium has lots of gray on him even to use a darker even to use darker shade teens up using both my shades of gray so we'll go ahead and color him in now he's going with the lighter shade they go respectively his head is all this light shade but surely is inside of his mouth is a darker shade put my shade on where to go on his battle suit whatever he wants to call it on his ears are this light grey too [Music] my color around his bushy eyebrows in the edge of his head shape oops we'll finish coloring mitzi on with the kind of forest green but will gain the darker gray areas first now there's a mouth now go ahead get your other shoulder and then the rest of his [Music] [Music] okay that's all the gray now to get in his green highlights to finish calling Kim in all together [Music] alright then just giving out our look over will finish calling the characters now with the block we cut we got all the other color aspects in so now we're ready to use the black when we go in the ears nose Dolan's hat rim and his thing that's going to get that give me layered on my and yes help add to this and his eyebrows and his jacket and belt [Music] [Music] you won't be able to see his puffs of smoke from here on out but if you're watching this video before actually seeing this image is drawing after it skinned out and his shirt-collar then you have definitely appreciate the fact that those puffs of smoke were there and that's what happens when you color over pen ink with black marker that's at your own risk one minor detail but one thing we can do to accentuate that that is a cigarette we can emphasize the ash Hado spot of light grade take care of that [Music] super tips available from Crayola [Music] they'll be a while before I get those scented markers super tip markers back or nurse said those bring back the super spring right the scented super tips Crayola because those were good especially in the shade and actually match with what I was using previously versus but you repackaged more recently oh I missed a spot with a blush color a sorbet I'm busy right now baby I give you some petting culling later not right now it's definitely still too early to feed you I feed you I fed you less a couple hours ago all right so I'll calm down I'll give you some more love later cuz I'm busy right now ring definitely tied to stick sex uh a steady hand as possible and skill to get in all these little tiny stage [Music] the concentration helps to don't make this a cat video sorbet you stay off my desk side boy shit boy shitty boy forever ever ever let my family are talking about [Music] thank you [Music] and after we get all these blacks colored in we'll color in the background parts because like I said it's important to having all your characters colored first cuz you know how to do them and you gotta stretch your mind a little bit to remember what you have going on in the background so you know what to color them when you get to that point anyway that's part of my process and there's another one there's another spot a nest yeah well yeah help put up on this just might be true it's that little thing yeah Blake's on to you are ya up black but the shades of black if not darker [Music] and that's why the salad arm shades of grey' versus react because gray is brighter than black you can add more you can AB I make sure it's a black can you have before it just looks like smoke with sunshine Bart gleaming through it from a fire somewhere and even then it could still look great also [Music] [Music] ah Sam has no black required so we just color in the black on magic chin find a once-over on the page and then yeah that's all the characters now we can color in the background telling the background let's start by calling in the windows of the clip more close buildings but this shade of blue because it's daytime if it was nighttime I'd be painting them yellow cause the lights will be on on the inside of the building [Music] men is this building over here your dish we know hmm I'm gonna leave the background of this panel blank because it's been in between the normal back information know what we have without any emotion going on and then followed by heated with emotion we'll just for a moment for a while with the doors we'll get them all these dandelion colored doorknobs where we can find the doorknobs and they will all be red wood this is a reddish round we have here and this is what the scented markers this one is a Cynthia shade is cinnamon scented so that's their term for this reddish brown cinnamon it's all about in the color wheel and all them very ingredients you see when you select your shade you want in any artistic program hmm and then what else do you wanna do now I have the laser lemon I like using this because I like using this sometimes force and the brightest shade of sand because after this shade gets scanned in it becomes a sand look so we're going to use this for the color of sidewalk here [Music] you know this is Partizan walk you know we're behind like and hell-bent and give that a laser lemon to and for the program for the fact that becomes sand like at once at one point so what so many years ago I wear pants on I love Kurtz aren't you with leis and lemon well obviously that did not work out so well like that so that's one went with one shade up to better to a little berry yellow and so we're going to leave the median line white and just paint the room and just cleared the road the darker gray ya realize my mistake nice end of standing over on the first part so I gotta make it all consistent and I don't want to say for the sake of the background with all the varying buildings therein make them all darker gray because I supposed to be daytime so for the buildings in the background who use the lighter gray and after that I'll decide one want to paint the buildings in the foreground because when you're talking about all the varying buildings in the farther background I slept up to your interpretation just like the people you don't know exactly who or what they each are aside from being men women or however address to identify you mostly go neutral with that just like it go with the buildings behind you I'll make the mark on neutral as well as they more or less look similar to the distant few points [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and one thing that I ended up do end up doing sometimes when I'm drawing and coming for a while I get in the mental zone and I just zoned out for a little bit it's good that's just one thing while right along for when you're drawing or coloring that specific part you know what you're doing you're going with the flow it's good it's very good good for you if you're at that time that perspective you're blocking out all other things outside of you when you're in that mindset you're in the zone I'm going to go ahead and color in the grass here to dull in science you're standing on I'm going to take the lightest shade of green I have and colored that in because once again it's daytime [Music] now for the buildings up front here hmm design decisions decisions what color do I want to make these particular buildings that are in the middle ground between the four and the farthest background so many decisions but in this one I think I'm going to go with the dark shade of red to make the ones on the left and the right brick light and here we'll do it up a little bit I'm going to make the middle building kind of gray and the roof from the roofs of these buildings will make them recover the darker gray [Music] during this one building - it totally up to you your city your building unless it's a specific building that you're going further into developing like a museum then just leave it as whatever you like just make it look differing or whatever so good [Music] I'm gonna go ahead and color in these rooftops [Music] it definitely differentiates the foreground buildings versus the tall skyscrapers behind them all how they work are in the middle building we're gonna help and there are detail we looked I go back and fits this one and just for hell that will cover both those buildings the light shade of gray [Applause] [Music] [Music] little bit behind yell bass book [Music] alright done all that done now we start on this complex background behind help ends in flake mixture of fire and lightning what we're going to do is start with the brightest color which that would be the yellow for all the lightning bolts we're just going to fill those in the ones are emanating from Blake's cheeks as well as these obvious ones right here [Music] yeah I think I'll do good mmm let's see make it look like menacing Thunder to thunderstorm coming about so yes we'll make the remainder of the background a midnight blue so being careful is to go around the outline with these new lightning bolts thunderstorms are coming lake is really really angry [Music] I'm sure they'll come up much more cleared at least after scan the difference between the black and the midnight blue I could see it right off that's directly an aspect of autism that apparently autistic people can see the colors more brightly more vividly than the neurotypical person could but again that's wasn't the video information was in the video I saw recently I will not come I will not confirm or deny it I don't know all the details that's an aspect that needs to that could be experimented list between an average a number of set number of people with autism and a set number of neurotypical people [Music] maybe I can be something the Mythbusters could get on the new generation of Mythbusters [Music] hee hee [Music] okay that takes care of Blake's half now with hell-bent because we're talking about fire in the background we'll go with the bowl shape the two shades of orange I have hmm yeah and plus the bright shade of red so we'll go ahead use the red for the bottom because that's where the flames are started and that's darkest and that's source the flames and we'll go up to the darker range floor up to a certain point going up the flames and concern since it's since red blends well with orange because orange is a mixture of yellow and red that's okay to mix with the red since Red's darker but you definitely don't want to mix it with yellow and that would just make her neck bunch of yellow orange more darker you don't want to do that especially if you want reference difference between lightning and fire yes I think I'm going to leave it there and then we'll go with our brightest orange and filling the remainder of this background this one smells like orange oranges all right we're almost done with this piece all we have left is to color the sky behind magic Chan and knit Siong so we'll take the brightest shade of blue I have here between where it goes start being more blue and where it becomes blue green or turquoise sky blue [Music] it's kind of a straightforward process from here it's sunk because to avoid the clouds that remain white it's one cup it's one singular color and it is good [Music] you can lose yourself while your don't buy your coloring in the bulk color of a background and once again being in the zone there it is good [Music] in [Music] [Music] I'm done with this one piece you doopy doopy doopy doopy tada and then since this is a not official comic page but more like a trailer and it is a piece I put my name on it no idea baby and I did it and there you go and this right here is what I will be submitting to plant darling for the little contest and I'll just go back to the PlayStation make sure we're still on here all right good and I believe that would be that will do it for now so thank you everyone for watching this live stream and I look forward to five dull in reviewing this for dares for their submission everyone else have a great safe night day whatever it is time zone
