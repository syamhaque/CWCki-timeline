================================================================================

"If You Were a Woman and I Was a Man" is the third track from SPARKLE like you mean it: ROBEE'S BALLAD by Robee Sonee and the Tomgirls. It is a cover of the song "If You Were a Woman (And I Was a Man)" by Bonnie Tyler, and Chris's second Bonnie Tyler cover.
Considering Chris's rampant homophobia, it's interesting that Chris, being (formerly) a "straight male," is singing to someone "If [he] were a woman."

Lyrics
Wo, wooo, woooo, wo …
[Late start] -‘s it feel to be a woman,
How’s it feel to be a man,
Are we really that different,
Tell me where you stand
I look at ‘chu, you look away.
Why do you say “we’re night and day”
I’d like to try another way.
Oh baby, we’re-w-we’re just one day.
If you were a woman, and I was a man,
Would it be so hard to understand?
That a hearts a heart, and we do what we can.
If you were a woman, and I was a man.
… If you were a woman, and I was a man!
How’s it feel to be the hunter.
How’s it feel to be the prey.
Is there really a reason for this game we play?
I look at ‘chu, you look away,
Why do you say, “we’re night and day”.
I’d like to try another day,
(sudden stop) … Oh darlin’… just one more day.
If you were a woman, and I was a man
Would it be so hard to understand?
Cause-cause there-theres a heart, and we do what we can.
If you were a woman, and I was a man.
… If you were a woman, and I was a man.
Hey … we’re just two people tryin’ to love.
But how … how can we love.
… with this wall between us, holding us back!
If you were a woman, and I was a man
Would it be so hard to understand?
That a hearts a heart, and we do what we can.
If you were a woman, and I was a man.
If you were a woman, and I was a man!
If you were a woman, and I was a man!
… you were a woman, and I was a man!
It-It be so hard to understand?
That a hearts a heart, and we do what we can.
If you were a woman, and I was a man.
If you were a woman, and I was a man.
(Sings a few notes of the last instrumental)
Dun, dun dun dunnn …
