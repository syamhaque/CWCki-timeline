================================================================================

CPU Goddesses are the god-like OCs in Chris's fantasy world.
As a group, these anime fembots from a video game series were made the object of Chris's adulation under the Idea Guys' influence in late 2017, and together with Chris's own OCs form the nucleus of this mixed bag of a pantheon. More lore surrounding the CPU Goddesses was later introduced to Chris through the Arbitarch CWC Alliance, with its most front-facing member MKRNightVee roleplaying as the CPU Goddess CPU Magenta Heart, as well as being the main brainchild behind the creation of many of of the prominent CPU Goddesses. The politics surrounding the earlier interactions as the Goddesses also occurred in MKR's Son of the Miscreants Discord server.
Following conflicts between Owls and Naught, along with several other members of the Arbitarch Alliance, Owls was taken down as the group's leader, Naught took over for the formation of the Watchmen, and many of the people that stayed abandoned the practice of roleplaying as CPU Goddesses with Chris.
Noteable examples found on this list include Scarlet the Commodore Goddess, and Battery-Charge Heart.
