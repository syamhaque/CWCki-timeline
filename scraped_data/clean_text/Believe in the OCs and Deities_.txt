Believe in the OCs and Deities! is a video uploaded by Chris to YouTube on 13 June 2019. Our CPU Goddess provides us with our first update on the Dimensional Merge's status since being visited by an anonymous milkman in April. Chris informs us that the merge is nearly complete, but would proceed much more quickly if more were to adhere to his idiosyncratic beliefs. He appeals to his viewers to pray to fictional characters, and to believe that they themselves are also OCs. He also whines that he has been hard at work managing the transition into a world full of cartoon characters. As his source for this video's contents, Chris names none other than Jesus Christ; he is no longer apathetic towards God, as he had been since the Idea Guys persuaded him anime fembots would be a better object of his adulation, but has instead syncretised Christianity with his own unusual thoughts and troll influences. Like the video before it, Chris has disabled anyone from commenting on what to make of this latest revelation.

The real Lord Jesus Christ sacrificed himself for real, here, he's an OC! I'm an OC. And think, between you and your self-counterparts, yeah, every one of you is an OC as well.

Transcript
[Chris is seated atop his bed, his back against the headboard.]
Hello everybody, this is Christine Chandler coming to you live from home once again. And, right now, we have a bit of a situation. Turns out that we do have a good number of believers in the OCs, CPUs, deities and... Everyone, between our sister dimension of C-197 a-and their surrounding dimensions, and right here in Dimension 1218, we could do a whole lot better in the believers. Even Jesus Christ himself came to me earlier today, told me so. Asked me to relay the message.
Everybody, believe in the OCs, and everybody, the dimension merge is happening.
[Chris pauses, licks his lips and wipes his nose.]
And we could definitely make the dimension merge happen a whole lot faster and over with, definitely for the better benefit of everybody, [screeching] EVERYBODY....
[He pauses to stare creepily at the camera for a second.]
In both our dimensions, in the combined dimensions.
So, simply put, have faith in all the OCs, in all the deities, especially those OCs that you have created, and the OCs that you are plan- that you are a fan of - just every OC that you genuinely love, support and kindness and everything. And, definitely not, and, not necessarily those that are, well, [pause] just leave it at that. Anyway, faith in all the OCs. Undiscriminately, just... do it, please.
Heh, j-just give 'em a thought, give your OCs a thought. Any of them. whether they be branded, not branded, your creations, someone else's creations and so forth. Sonichu, Rosechu, the CPUs, uh, anime characters.... [He clasps his hands as though in prayer, and twiddles his thumbs.] Everybody. Alright? Ah, hell.
Meemo Bright. [He points to an amiibo
at the edge of his headboard.] And Magi-Chan, if you can see him right now, he's clearly sitting right here.
[He points at the empty space beside him on the bed, glances over and gestures off camera at the air.]
Anyway, we need to increase our believers in all the OCs between here and C-197, all of our surrounding s-
related dimensions and timelines. Jesus Christ himself and our god Emannuelle: they're OCs, too. Though they literally are those that have worked here, like, you know, the real Lord Jesus Christ sacrificed himself for real, here, [screeching] he's an OC! I'm an OC. And think, between you and your self-counterparts, yeah, every one of you is an OC as well, so, if anything, you believe in everyone else, you believe in yourselves, as well. Alright?
So believe in all the OCs, okay? And believe in us, the CPUs, and all the other deities all around and everywhere. Say a prayer. Have faith! [He clutches his medallion.] Give us some heart sure with us, a heart warm, heartfelt sincere thought, kindness, so forth.... And more importantly, don't hate, alright? We don't need any hate any more Haterade, especially the... frickin' Sarah boys and bad Internet trolls.
But, listen, aside from that, I made the big, major point: believe in the OCs! Believe in your OCs! Believe in yourself as an OC! Believe in Jesus Christ, Emannuelle, who's Emannuelle, by the way? God IS a WOMAN! And I have personally met them face to face. And if you don't believe me in that, I've literally touched Jesus's hands. I cry every time I- feel, that, psss, psss, scar in his hands,
the cross when he did that, but still....
But anyway, as a goddess myself, I am unable to worship Jesus or any of the other deities, but, I have friends with Jesus and- all of the other deities, including the CPUs, so the least I could do is support them. And be a friend. That's what I do to the best of my abilities. Everywhere. My soul, brain, my body, literally, working, around the clock, EVERYWHERE! And I'm flying by the seat of my pants by each thing that comes in, so I can relay it out to you via my Twitter, or whatever, and whatever media I just feel impulsively need to do or whatever.
So... that's it. And I do believe in this world of 1218, we could do a whole lot better. Out of the seven billion plus people in this world, this dimension, we could make more than half of them, that's 3,5 billion people, believers. Make them all aware of the OCs, and the fact that they are an OCs in themselves, and we all do exist and co-exist. And the sooner we do this, the sooner we get and band together, and become a belief and faith system, not a religion! Not a cult or anything like that. Certainly not a frickin' delusion, imagination or whatever... adjective like that. This is all REAL. So you listen to me good, and heed my words.
Any even if you, even if you pray to Jesus Christ, Buddha or any other of your known- well-known deities of this world, they're going to tell you the same thing pretty much. And right now, we need EVERYONE to believe in the OCs. Of and around C-197, that includes Equestria. And us, the deities, as I am the CPU Blue Heart, of the Commodore consoles and the Nations of Comma and CWCville. And I'm literally half-Sonichu, so I can transform into my Sonichu form.
I know it seems hard to believe right now, but you're going to see soon enough. But in the meantime, BELIEVE! Believe in all those OCs, and everything, and in the Dimensional Merge! It's happening! We're approaching our endgame, and we are destined and fated to win. So, follow my- motivational speech, please, and follow our lead. We will complete this merge. We will all be existent and co-existent with each other. And we will be able to hang out fully with our own creations! I'm very serious about that. It's happening! It's happening! BELIEVE!
Thank you, have a good day!
