Building a relationship
31 July 2015
Chris draws his self-insert flirting with a lesbian, forming a relationship with her, and lastly preparing to have sex.
In the panel, Chris (who by this time has identified as transgender and lesbian) goes to a party where he meets a lesbian (Jessie Pie). In a sub-panel labelled "interest in each other", Chris introduces himself as an "artist with a great amount of fame" and Jessie says that she works at a horse ranch so Chris can draw her riding a horse. In another sub-panel labelled "building rapport", Chris complains about his trolls and says he isn't perfect; Jessie says she isn't perfect either due to being impulsive. Over a month later, the two are in their underwear on a bed, about to have sex. Jessie tells Chris she's feeling it in her soul and asks if he does. Chris answers that he cares and loves her and that "we're not half-assing it now!" The final sub-panel is labelled "intimacy" and shows them holding their hands.
Years later, in April 2018, the drawing was put on eBay as part of a lot of pornographic artwork, which collectively sold for $1,000.[1]
Night Star and Pinkie Pie
3 June 2017
Chris draws his OC Night Star breaking the fourth wall with My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic character Pinkie Pie. Other Friendship is Magic characters Discord and Fluttershy observe, with Discord noting, "CWC Sense; Pinkie Sense; we are breaking a lot of fourth walls, aren't we, ladies?" Chris and Andrea Libman (the voice actress for both Pinkie Pie and Fluttershy) watch; Libman comments, "Ooh! Fun!"
Chris tweeted the drawing to Andrea Libman the same day.[2]
Namgge
24 June 2018
In June 2018, Chris attended a TooManyGames convention panel which featured voice actors for Sonic the Hedgehog character Doctor Robotnik and Super Mario Bros. character Bowser. During the Q&A, Chris wanted to role-play an insult to Robotnik, as Sonic would do in the cartoon. As the insult, Chris used his backwards-spelling "wordplay" to note that Robitnik's alternate name Eggman sounds like "Nah, I'm gay" backwards. The audience cringed at Chris's comments, while Robotnik's voice actor improvised an answer which received applause from the audience - "Well, I believe William Shakespeare said it best when he said, 'What's in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.'” Chris mistook the applause as being for him.[3]
The following day, Chris drew a comic panel re-enacting the insult, using Chris-chan Sonichu, Doctor Robotnik and Bowser. In the panel, Bowser finds Chris's joke funny and taunts Robotnik as well, who seethes and mutters that he is actually asexual.
Genette
26 September 2018
Chris draws a genderbent version of Super Mario Bros. character Geno for a Newgrounds contest.
In the panel, Genette remarks, "Wow, I'm sexy! Best upgrade ever!"
Negligee
4 May 2021
Chris illustrates his Chris Chan Sonichu fursona form wearing negligee. He posted it to Twitter in response to a prompt to post a picture as both a romanceable NPC and final boss. Chris remarked, "Well, Christorians, here’s another one for the “Chris Chan Sexy” Google Results, and dare I say your next Body Pillow Daki? Go ahead. 😉⚡️💙⚡️"[4]
In the panel, Chris Chan Sonichu strikes a "sexy" pose and says, "I am ever so sorry for keeping you waiting. But I have addressed and cleared the doubts away. Shall we dance?"
