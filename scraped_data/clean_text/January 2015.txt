================================================================================

On 7 January 2015, Chris tells his ex-friend Renee to die in a fire.
On 9 January 2015, Chris's complaints about how "[Meme Run] is Chaotic, Sensory Overloading, Loud and Annoying" become backhanded.
On 10 January 2015, the trolls just won't stop taunting Chris, no matter how noble and honest he is.
On 23 January 2015, Chris draws a striking self-portrait.
January was the 1st month of 2015. Chris stated that he would move back to 14 Branchland Court in January. However, this month notably kicked off with some fallout from the infamous 26 December 2014 incident. Mere days after being released from jail, Chris wound up causing a ruckus at a Walmart he was previously banned from, by threatening the manajerks with pepper spray if they didn't leave him alone. It's unknown whether Chris realizes that he's a repeat offender on bail or simply refuses to acknowledge it altogether at this point, but either way it certainly didn't help his testimony in February, postponing or not.
Throughout the month, Chris showed both worry over his upcoming court case, and, as usual, hatred of Sonic Boom, to the point where he raged at one of his white knights for daring to own a comic with a sneak peek of the "blue-armed bandit" on the inside. At the very end of the month, this escalated into Chris sending envelopes loaded with glitter to Sega HQ.
Events of January 2015
1 January
This is the day when Chris's break from eBay was supposed to end, but nothing happened. He would not return to eBay until the following month.
An article by Wii U Daily about 26 December 2014 is linked to the subreddit "r/rage" on Reddit.
2 January - On Facebook, Chris compares trying to move from the Rental House to 14 Branchland Court to a tired horse named Charlie that is running around a track (probably a very mangled take on the phrase "charley horse").
3 January - An e-mail leaks onto the CWCki Forums, revealing that Chris caused a scene at Walmart and had his pepper spray from the GameStop incident on hand as well - nearly five days after he bailed out of jail. The police scanner audio of the incident is eventually leaked onto YouTube.
4 January - The e-mail is confirmed to be real, and a text conversation between Chris and Renee leaks, revealing that Chris indeed caused commotion at the store.
5 January
Chris notes that the only internet he has had access to while moving is the 3G on his iPhone, and whines about how people don't like him, especially after the GameStop incident.
Chris informs his fellow protesters on his public Facebook group, FIX SONIC'S ARMS IMMEDIATELY, SEGA!!!, that they should tell Sega about his troubles.
6 January - Another set of e-mails leaks, regarding Barb's dental health.
7 January
Renee tells Chris she doesn't want a relationship with him. In response, Chris tells her he hopes her house burns down while she and her boyfriend were still inside.
A tree branch disrupts Chris's electric power.
8 January - Chris blames Sega for the GameStop incident. Once again, none of his white knights are willing to defend him.
9 January
Chris makes a suggestion about the game Duck Hunt' on the Miiverse.
Chris makes a Littlest Pet Shop image macro, and rages over the TLC series My Husband's Not Gay. In the same post, Chris writes "I am a (Female Soul) Transwoman (no operation yet)," and confesses that he hates being born with
"the Damn Male Parts."

21 January - A new voicemail greeting is leaked onto YouTube.
23 January - Chris posts his latest masterpiece on Facebook, "My Mind is a Blank." He rages at the CWCki, Encyclopedia Dramatica, and stress all in the same post.

24 January - Chris uploads an Imgur file of his new drawing.
25 January - Chris begins begging his white knights to purchase the Lego "Grand Emporium" set for him, a shopping mall set. One (unintentionally) snarky comment from William Elliott Waterman, who notes he has none of the parts, gains over 80 likes.
