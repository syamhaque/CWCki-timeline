Pokemon Cards
On 13 July 2016, prompted by the Financhu Crisis, Chris began listing Pokemon cards for sale to raise money.
Typically for Chris, he didn't bother researching the prices on the cards, instead choosing arbitrarily high numbers for his minimum prices.

Price: $500
I, Christine Weston Chandler, past name, Christian Weston Chandler, Creator of Sonichu and Rosechu, was personally one of the lucky winners to be the first to receive a US Promo #24 ______'s Pikachu holographic card, in my mailbox on January 29, 2001, as personally written in the back of the Winner slip received with the card (viewable in the photo). This auction is for not only the card, itself, but also the History, with the Winner slip, as well as my personally written cards. Two card sleeves (one of which with taped slips with my name, birthdate, and a star), and a hard plastic card case, as shown in the photos.
A Real Collectible not only for the Pokemon card game, but also a Memorabilia of myself, Sonichu and Rosechu's Creator. The value of this card And documents kept together will surely rise in value in Years later to come.
It will all be shipped together in a bubble envelope after successful payment receipt.
Thank you.

Aladdin VHS Black Diamond The Classics
You can either buy Chris's copy for $3,000, or buy a different one for a much lower price.
Chris fell for the common Internet rumor that Black Diamond VHS editions of Disney movies are incredibly valuable, because the newer digital editions contain modern edits and so the only way to get the "original" is to buy up old tapes. In reality, these are not at all rare and demand is limited to a few obsessive collectors, so the tapes are only worth $5-$10.[1][2] Used copies of said tape on Amazon can be as low as 44 cents, and many other Disney movies on VHS can even cost just a penny (plus shipping, but still).
