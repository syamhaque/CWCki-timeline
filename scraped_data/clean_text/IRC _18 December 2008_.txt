00:01 <@CVDierten> hello
00:01 <@cogsdev> Hi Chris!
00:02 <@ChrisChanSonichu> Peace. questions?
00:02 <@cogsdev> OK
00:02 <@cogsdev> First: What are your thoughts on transgender people (male-to-female transsexuals, female-to-male transsexuals, and those in-between)?

00:02 -!- mode/#sonichu [+o DannyMothman] by [^_^]
00:02 <@vivitheg> Well, we do have two fans who are of that type, they are very interested.
00:02 -!- Guest_ [~Guest@Rizon-2C4631.hsd1.ma.comcast.net] has quit []
00:02 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I'm willing to acquaint with them, but none would feel like Sweetheart Material with me.
00:02 -!- mode/#sonichu [-o DannyMothman] by cogsdev
00:03 <@cogsdev> OK, next one: Chris, do you think we could see you dance some time in a video on your youtube? A viewer has a school dance coming up and wants to learn some cool moves.
00:03 -!- clydeC [~clydethel@Rizon-8189FBA3.hsd1.ca.comcast.net] has left #sonichu []
00:03 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I have few dance moves, but none of cool variety; I recommend finding a Local Dance.
00:04 <@cogsdev> BlueSpike asks: Chris, do you think you could do a Let's Play on Youtube? As in you record yourself playing a game and add your commentary? I could give you a wonderful recording software. If not could you do a review on a game?
00:04 <@ChrisChanSonichu> *and taking their pre-dance courses.
00:04 <@ChrisChanSonichu> maybe, but not right now.
00:04 <@cogsdev> that's okay we know you're busy with the comics
00:04 <@cogsdev> Next one: When/where did you learn to draw?
00:04 -!- Guest [~Guest@Rizon-2C4631.hsd1.ma.comcast.net] has joined #sonichu
00:05 -!- Guest is now known as Guest29233
00:05 <@ChrisChanSonichu> various times and various places; too many to recall or list.
00:05 <@ChrisChanSonichu> it may have been natural.
00:05 <@ChrisChanSonichu> *and various books too.
00:05 <@cogsdev> What do you think about having a large female fanbase?
00:06 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I'D LOVE IT! :D Especially if they're within my 20-mile radius.
00:06 <@ChrisChanSonichu> or in Charlottesville, VA.
00:06 <@vivitheg> well chris, you do have a large female fanbase, they're mostly shy though
00:06 <@vivitheg> but most of them aren't within 20 miles.
00:06 <@ChrisChanSonichu> they do not need to be shy.
00:06 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I am a gentleman.
00:07 <@cogsdev> Chris, what is your stance on BBWs, or "big beautiful women"? Do you like them, and if not, what is the cutoff point?
00:07 <@ChrisChanSonichu> the mileage is just a rough estimate off-the-bat.
00:07 <@ChrisChanSonichu> it depends, how big or beautiful are we talking?
00:08 <@cogsdev> Well, if the weight starts with a 2, is that a problem?
00:09 -!- Guest [~Guest@Rizon-13DCDDC0.hsd1.co.comcast.net] has joined #sonichu
00:09 <@ChrisChanSonichu> oh, weight... yeah, I'd feel better with someone less than 200
00:09 <@cogsdev> okay
00:09 <@ChrisChanSonichu> other than that, they're cool to hang with.
00:09 <@cogsdev> What did you think of Barack Obama getting elected?
00:09 -!- Guest is now known as Guest18866
00:09 <@ChrisChanSonichu> brb
00:11 <@ChrisChanSonichu> back.
00:11 <@cogsdev> ok
00:12 <@cogsdev> What did you think of Barack Obama getting elected?
00:12 <@ChrisChanSonichu> it's cool; I saw more of myself in Obama when I watched his A&E Biography, than in McCain's A&E Biography; both downloaded from the Playstation Store.
00:13 <@vivitheg> Do you plan to write a novel or a short story other than a comic book or Sonichu sometime in your life?
00:13 <@ChrisChanSonichu> who would you vote for; a war hero that you couldn't feel that much for, or the guy who you feel like is similar to you in social dilemnas?
00:13 <@ChrisChanSonichu> IDK.
00:13 <@ChrisChanSonichu> maybe.
00:14 -!- tunzi [~tunzi@Rizon-1BA7BBFC.hsd1.md.comcast.net] has joined #sonichu
00:14 <@cogsdev> What would you do if your girlfriend did not like videogames and did not want you to play them so much, or if she wanted you to get rid of any of your My Little Pony or other items?
00:14 <@ChrisChanSonichu> hmm...
00:17 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I'd inform her that she should accept me for who I am, and let me hold on to my things; besides which, they could be saved for my future daughter/children. then if she still couldn't accept me then, I'd feel uncomfortable, then tell her that maybe this relationship wasn't meant to be.
00:17 <@ChrisChanSonichu> *I'd tell her
00:17 <@cogsdev'> okay
00:18 <@cogsdev> What do you think about Yahtzee's insulting review of Sonic Unleashed?
00:18 <@ChrisChanSonichu> if it's against Sonic, I would not read it at all.
00:18 <@CVDierten> aye
00:19 <@vivitheg> You have to accept criticism, it'll just make you better!
00:19 <@vivitheg> You gotta learn from your mistakes!
00:19
* CVDierten nods
00:19 <@cogsdev> followup to an earlier question: What if she tried to make a compromise with you, such as one hour of video games a day?
00:19 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I have learned from my mistakes.
00:19 <@ChrisChanSonichu> IDK.
00:20 <@cogsdev> Do you plan to write a novel or a short story other than a comic book or Sonichu sometime in your life?
00:21 <@ChrisChanSonichu> yeah, it's either accept me for who I am, or it wasn't meant to be. it's similar to if she wouldn't stay, because the guy farted, and she couldn't take it with a grain of salt, or if she hangs her panties and bras in the bathroom and the guy couldn't stand her for that.
00:21 -!- Guest18866 [~Guest@Rizon-13DCDDC0.hsd1.co.comcast.net] has quit [Quit: Guest18866]
00:21 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I've already answered that question.
00:21 <@cogsdev> oh yeah
00:22 <@cogsdev> OK, here's a followup to one of your answers: You say you've learned from your mistakes. Can you give an example of a bad moment bettering you in the long run?
00:22 <@ChrisChanSonichu> picking one out of thousands to millions...
00:23 <@vivitheg> well you can tell as many stories as you like, you have many younger fans who should learn about these types of experiences!
00:23 <@ChrisChanSonichu> when it was spelled out for me that a sign by my side made me look slow-minded, when clearly I am not.
00:23 <@ChrisChanSonichu> it's a LOT to recall at once.
00:23 <@vivitheg> Just maybe two or three then?
00:24 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I've done that in my comics; some of the expierences with me, actually happened IRL.
00:24 <@vivitheg> we've all read those
00:24 <@ChrisChanSonichu> yeah.
00:24 <@vivitheg> We're your fans afterall
00:25 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I've still learned from all of them one at a time, and keep the lessons to heart for future reference.
00:25 <@cogsdev> well, i'd really like it if you could maybe write out the story of some of those and put them on your site for us to read :)
00:25 <@vivitheg> Yeah, you can use your site for so much more!
00:26 <@cogsdev> but moving on now: Where did you get your main inspiration for Sonichu?
00:27 <@ChrisChanSonichu> yeah; he first popped to mind in my High School Computer Graphics class; had to design a CD cover and insert; wanted Sonic and Pikachu among others, but copyrighted individuals were prohibited. merge, create story, shaboosh!
00:27 <@cogsdev> thanks for telling us, chris, last question on the list: What is it you find in Sonic The Hedgehog that makes you like him as a video game character?
00:29 <@ChrisChanSonichu> basically, a care-free, self-confident attitude that I'd like to have. And the running speed.
00:29 <@vivitheg> Chris, have you officially copyrighted Sonichu yet?
00:29 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I have.
00:29 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I paid 35 bucks for it too.
00:29 <@vivitheg> When did you do this? Some of us missed this.
00:30 <@vivitheg> Can you explain how you did this?
00:30 <@ChrisChanSonichu> years ago, on the Library of Congress website.
00:30 <@vivitheg> Can you show us the official entry on the copyright?
00:31 <@ChrisChanSonichu> it's digital, and I am unable to print it; they won't let me.
00:31 <@ChrisChanSonichu> it's unlinkable too.
00:32 <@CVDierten> Not even a Library of Congress ID to help us find it?
00:33 <@CVDierten> nevermind about that one, chris
00:33 <@CVDierten'> here's a questiion from another fan...
00:33 <@CVDierten> If you finally met your One True Sweetheart, married and impregnated her, only to find out that during the pregnancy she had been smoking tobacco and drinking alcohol...
00:33 <@CVDierten> What would you do?
00:34 <@ChrisChanSonichu> 1-92843711
00:34 <@vivitheg> thanks!
00:35 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I'd keep her from doing such things during pregnancy, PLUS Smoke-Free and Non-Alcoholic are priority preferences in my Sweetheart.
00:36 <@ChrisChanSonichu> as in they would honest say "Never" on their MySpace or Facebook pages.
00:36 <@ChrisChanSonichu> *on either.
00:36 <@vivitheg> When you marry your future wife, what will your day-to-day life be like?
00:36 <@vivitheg> A few of your more vocal female fans want to know.
00:37 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I would always remain honest and very loyal to my wife, and I would do my best to keep her happy as much as humanly possible.
00:37 <@ChrisChanSonichu> *humanly and emotionaly.
00:37 <@vivitheg> But more day to day details, like work and taking care of your child
00:37 <@vivitheg> Who would cook?
00:38 <@CVDierten> Who would clean, etc.?
00:38 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I'm the house-husband; me and me.
00:38 <@vivitheg> You can cook Chris?
00:38 <@ChrisChanSonichu> yes
00:38 <@vivitheg> Wow! What kind of things can you cook? I love cooking!
00:39 <@CVDierten> any fave recipies u'd care to share sometime?
00:39 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I've taken two home-ec classes in High School; I have cook books, and my fahter cooks too.
00:39 <@cogsdev> you should make a cwcville cookbook :)
00:39 <@ChrisChanSonichu> none off the top of my head right now.
00:39 <@ChrisChanSonichu> next question, please.
00:40 <@CVDierten> Why did you start making bears, and where do you buy the materials at?
00:41 <@ChrisChanSonichu> as in my teddy bear? I won a gift certificate from the radio to create one from create-a-critter a couple of years ago.
00:41 <@cogsdev> who would you say is the inspiration behind the characters of count graduon and reldnahc?
00:42 <@ChrisChanSonichu> basic evil wizards, and evil twins from various tv shows, movies and anime.
00:42 <@ChrisChanSonichu> and book stories.
00:43 <@cogsdev> brb
00:43 <@ChrisChanSonichu> ok
00:43 <@CVDierten> Why Sonic and Pokemon as influences for Sonichu?
00:43 <@ChrisChanSonichu> why not? :)
00:43 <@vivitheg> What is the most original thing you have done (besides Sonichu)? :D
00:44 <@ChrisChanSonichu> a clay coil-pot in the shape of a star, painted red, blue, yellow and green in an art class.
00:45 <@CVDierten> Can you give us a ballpark number on how many contests you've won over your lifetime?
00:45 <@CVDierten> Name specific ones if possible.
00:45 <@ChrisChanSonichu> 3
00:46 <@ChrisChanSonichu> the Sonic the Hedgehog Watch-and-Win, the Parappa Video Contest and Guitar Hero Be-A-Star.
00:46 <@CVDierten> cool
00:47 <@CVDierten> So, what is your view on gambling? Have you ever played any lottery tickets?
00:48 <@ChrisChanSonichu> my father plays the lotto every wed and sat; I've scratched a few scratch and win tickets in my life. gambling in general is okay, but I would not go so far as to lose my house and all; that's stupid.
00:49 <@CVDierten> ahhh very cool
00:49 <@CVDierten> here's another: do you still keep in contact with any of your old friends from high school or PVCC?
00:50 <@ChrisChanSonichu> not so much. I have had MORE FRIENDS in High School than in PVCC; socail-wise, PVCC sucked.
00:51 <@CVDierten> i'm sorry to hear that about PVCC
00:51 <@CVDierten> here's one from a boyfriend-free girl: Ask him what his ideal place to take a girl on a date would be
00:54 <@ChrisChanSonichu> first date: McDonalds, Burger King, Arby's, etc; it would be a mutual choice between the two of us. Second Date; CiCi's Pizza, Golden Corral, etc. and a movie and/or a walk in the park. Third Date: mutual choice restraunt, mutual choice shopping, movie, walk or other, and hopefully, if she wanted to, snuggle and beyond.
00:55 <@CVDierten> that would be an awesome three dates, yo
00:55 <@CVDierten> got a ? from a reader here: Aside from RL Stine, what's the most recent book you've read, and what did you think of it?
00:57 <@ChrisChanSonichu> Pamela Anderson's "Star" is a must-read for the adult; Simply Great Story.
00:58 <@CVDierten> aye... pamela is a goddess
00:58 <@ChrisChanSonichu> yep
00:59 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I'll take one more question, then I gtg.
00:59 <@CVDierten> cool
00:59 <@CVDierten> here it is
01:00 <@CVDierten> What is better and why: Japanese anime or American anime?
01:01 <@CVDierten> err... American animation
01:01 <@ChrisChanSonichu> Japan, hands-down; espeially when roughly-translated with subtitles; accidentally saying a curse-word in japanese is funny.
01:01 <@vivitheg> Chris, just to let you know. There is a Sonichu fan who recently commited suicide after hearing that there would be no more Sonichu comics. We would just like to let you know.
01:01 <@ChrisChanSonichu> *especially.
01:01 <@ChrisChanSonichu> :(
01:01 <@ChrisChanSonichu> that's sad.
01:01 <@ChrisChanSonichu> it's terrible.
01:01 <@CVDierten> brutal... he was really hoping for that spring break comic, too
01:02 <@vivitheg> His name is Ryan Cash, he just didn't take the news very well.
01:02 <@cogsdev> we should make a memorial in the Home clubhouse
01:02 <@CVDierten> aye
01:03 <@ChrisChanSonichu> on a ligher note, be sure to do a search on PS3's Home for the "Sonichu Home Club" House; socialize with fellow PSN Sonichu & Rosechu fans, scheduled meetings or discussions.
01:03 <@vivitheg> Do you have a message for the family?
01:03 <@ChrisChanSonichu> If it's possible, I'll make a memorial.
01:03 <@cogsdev> you should make a message for them on youtube
01:04 <@CVDierten> aye
01:04 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I will consider it. :( damn.
01:04 <@ChrisChanSonichu> sad...
01:04 <@CVDierten> it would be the right thing to do, chris
01:04 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I hear ya.
01:04 <@ChrisChanSonichu> Peace.
01:04 <@cogsdev> peace
