YOUR TAX DOLLARS AT WORK!The contents of this page have been bought with taxpayer money!
This article is still yet to be completed due to stress. We get a lot of stressful torture in our lives that makes us crash into slumber. Given that inspiration is a big variable, and we may have been lacking of it, this article will be completed as soon as possible, at our own pace... HONEST!
Chris has purchased items on eBay ever since joining the website in 2001. This page is an attempt to archive what he has purchased from the website, or attempted to bid on, through documents shared by Chris or obtained by trolls.
Note that this list is not at all comprehensive. While Chris's spending habits past 2008 have been well-documented over the years, due to both of Chris's main eBay accounts having either been suspended and/or removed (potential sockpuppets notwithstanding) as well as his e-mail archives likely being lost to time, a full archive of his purchases, let alone those made from 2001 to 2008, is basically impossible. Nevertheless, it's pretty easy to assume the kinds of things Chris has used eBay for. A majority of Chris's purchases are toys, video games, and other stuff of that ilk.
While Chris first joined all the way back in 2001, he started heavily using it during his relationship with Megan Schroeder, with her frequently requesting him to buy her various items. The prices of these items and bids are unknown, though knowing Chris only GodBear knows how much of his monthly tugboat he used on them.
