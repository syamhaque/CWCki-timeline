This article is still yet to be completed due to stress. We get a lot of stressful torture in our lives that makes us crash into slumber. Given that inspiration is a big variable, and we may have been lacking of it, this article will be completed as soon as possible, at our own pace... HONEST! This article is missing the following:
• This page still needs information about Chris's other pets, Chris's relationship with fictional animals such as Sonic the Hedgehog and The American Rabbit. A section on Chris's views on animal ethics would also be appropriate.
Animals are defined as eukaryotic life forms of the kingdom Animalia.[1] In common speech, humans are not considered animals even though they do meet this definition. Non-human animals can be broadly divided into domesticated animals which are kept and raised by humans, and wild animals which exist independently from humans. For better or worse, Chris has owned countless animals such as dogs and cats throughout his life.

Notable animals in the Chandlers' life
Patti Chandler
Patti, blissfully unaware of who her owner really is
Patti was a dog of mixed breed, being part beagle and part spitz and member of the Chandler household from 1988 to 2006 named for Saint Patrick's Day on which she was born. Chris was apparently very fond of Patti, claiming that he spent a lot of time with her when she was alive, citing her death as a source of trauma comparable to losing a family member in 9/11, and making her the very first being to live on in C-197 after passing away in the real world. Despite this, when she was put down, Chris was not too distressed to draw
Sonichu on the paper for Patti's euthanasia.
In Chris's fantasy universe, Patti joined Chris's Electric-Hedgehogs and other "heroes" as Patti-Chan, and would appear in several of the
Sonichu comics.
Patti lived in a doghouse that weighed approximately
5 to 10 tons, according to Chris.
Clover and Snoopy
Clover was Chris's dog from March 2012 up until he was arrested in August 2021 and is confirmed to be alive under the care of Barb as of March 2024. Snoopy was her brother and Barb's dog until his death in July 2021. Ironically, Chris lost custody of Clover on the 9th anniversary of the dogs' being revealed to the public in a photograph he submitted into a local radio contest that was later uploaded to the CWCki Forums. Both beagles, they were named for a My Little Pony Tales character and the famous Peanuts star respectively.
Unlike Patti, the beagles lived inside the Chandler house alongside Barb's hoard. The dogs liked to play on a "mountain of clothes" that Snoopy fell from as a puppy, permanently damaging his leg in the process.[2]
Neighbor's dog
According to LoveYouLongTime, Barbara and Chris once tried to steal a neighbor's dog which had been wandering loose. They eventually gave it back when its owner showed up at their door.[3]
I don't think I have emails regarding that, but if anyone needs the rundown...a neighbor's dog slipped out of their collar while tied up outside and went wandering around the neighborhood. I'm assuming it was more Barb's idea, but she decided she wanted to keep it so instead of doing the right thing and asking around first. They bought it a collar and a couple of other supplies. Lo and behold, the neighbor goes looking for their dog and winds up at the Chandler's. From what I remember, they put up a fight to keep the dog and blamed the neighbor for being irresponsible. Basically, finders keepers. Neighbor still got their dog back. But Chris couldn't comprehend why it was wrong for them to try and keep the dog. I wonder if this is (part) of the reason they keep their own dogs locked up inside, a fear of repercussion from trying to steal someone else's dog.
Fictional animals in Chris's life
The American Rabbit
The American Rabbit (actually named Robert Rabbit) is the lagomorph protagonist of the obscure 1986 animated movie The Adventures of the American Rabbit, which Chris was unironically a fan of during his childhood, even once declaring the filmmakers "REALLY SHOULD HAVE MADE A TV SERIES of him".[4]
He was also the first fictional character that Chris claimed to have looked up to as a hero, and evidently seems to have influenced Chris (or was at least one of his first influences,
given his TV diet at the time) to profess beliefs in being True and Honest (whilst otherwise failing to practice what he preaches in real life) as well as triumphing over anyone he would perceive to be villainous just for going against his ideals. This position as role model would eventually be passed on to...
Sonic the Hedgehog
Chris, side-by-side with the (fictional) animal he cared about most
Sonic the Hedgehog is the lead character of a multimedia franchise created by Sega that has been ongoing since his first outing on the Sega Genesis in 1991. Chris was introduced to him through playing a demo of this particular game in a Sega Genesis display at the Charlottesville Fashion Square's Sears store that year[5] but what would truly solidify Sonic's place in his heart was his victory in the Watch & Win Sweepstakes in 1993.
Sonic went on to become arguably one of the biggest fixated interests Chris ever had in his life (next to Pokémon), culminating in the creation of Sonichu, both the character and comic for which he has since attained infamy as an online celebrity of sorts.
Chris has also expressed more loyalty to this fictional character than anyone should, admitting to Jackie that he used to be distraught whenever bullies claimed Sonic was dead[6] and even being infuriated by a non-canons spinoff altering Sonic's arm color to the point of vandalism in stores and narrowly avoiding imprisonment for assaulting a game store's assistant manager in the process of attempting to do so.
