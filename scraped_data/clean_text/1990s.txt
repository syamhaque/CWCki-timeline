Chris and Mrs. Sanford.
WTF niggo.
“
Raise with Tender Loving Care, let your child make friends, and Most Importantly, MAINSTREAM; let your child be free to communicate and associate with the Normal Society. Special Education is okay, but that will not do in the longest run.
”
Chris gives advice on how to raise an autistic child, unaware that it was exactly this obsession with "MAINSTREAM" that caused his arrested development in the 1990s.[1]
The 1990s was where Chris spent an abundance of his childhood. It notably saw the beginning of his obsession with Sonic the Hedgehog and Pokémon, which would eventually lead to the abomination we know as Sonichu. Chris was aged between 7 and 17.
