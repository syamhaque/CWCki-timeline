A page from Sonichu 15
4 December
Sonichu 15, Page 1
Because the details have been divulged, I felt the best way to share them was in Page One of the book Two from now.
Read and weep: Sonichu and Rosechu; they were both born as Pichus in the year 1992.
She’s older than him by a few months.
And Station Square’s Chaotic destruction?
SEGA Predicted It happening in the game released in 1998.
They Never dated the event, because they wanted no one to prevent it happening.
Super Sonic and Sonichu Took Out Perfect Chaos On February 1, 2003.
Enjoy the Facts.
On Facebook, Waterman inquired:
Why did we shoot two books ahead?
Chris was confused:
I do not understand your question.
Waterman clarified:
Sonichu 15?
Chris answered:
William Elliott Waterman, Like I Said, there are More Details in the Genesis of Sonichu and Rosechu that I did not have initial access to waaay back in 2004. Plus, that was my earlier days in drawing skills, and I have improved very well over the years. And after reading “Rosechu’s Story”, falling in love itch Sonichu and Rosey all over again and feeling inspired, I had decided to do an Expansion of Book 0, with LOTS MORE AND ACCURATE DETAILS. Definitely a Silver Anniversary at 15 Books, especially after getting back out of the hiatus.
Oh! I just realized your question.
We’re only drawing One one of two books ahead, because I Just got these Date Details, and I wanted to Visually Share Them. I am still mainly focusing on Book 12-9.
This was just a side-impulse.
So, William Elliott Waterman, take it at face value for now and Enjoy the New Trivia of Sonichu and Rosechu’s Birthdates, and When Perfect Chaos Actually Happened.
