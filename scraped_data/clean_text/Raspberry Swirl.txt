Lyrics
[loud microphone movement]
I'm not your señorita, I am not from your tryyybe.
Indaagarden I did no crime!
I am not your señorita, I am not from you tryyybe.
If you want inside her well, boy you better make a raspberry swirl.
Things are getting din-din desperate.
When all the boys can't be men.
Evve'body knows I'm her friend.
Everybody knows I'm her maaan.
mm—DESperate.
When all the boys can't be men.
Everybody knows I'm her friend.
Everybody knows I'm her MAN.
I am not your señ-orita.
I don't aim so higgh.
In my heart I did no crime—aime.
If you want inside her well, boy you better make a raspberry swirl.
Things are getting desperate
…aaate
And boys can't be men.
...getting desperate when all the boys can't be men.
Everybody knows I'm her friend.
Everybody knows I'm her man.
Things are getting desperate.
when I … ?
Everybody knows I'm her friend.
Everybody knows everybody knows I'm her man.
and I…
Raspberry swirl!
raca (?) raspberry swirl
