Troll disclosure: This persona was created, appropriated, or otherwise used by trolls to manipulate Chris. Though this identity is contrived, the CWCki may treat it as if it were a real identity because it was to Chris. (It's also funnier that way.)

Catherine
Colin is the wealthy, handsome, and fit black man who found himself forming the hypotenuse in the Christian-Catherine-Colin love triangle. Chris immediately developed a hatred of him wrought primarily of his financial success. Born into a wealthy family and a successful businessman of his own right, Colin was the easy choice for Catherine when she was dismayed with Chris's poor financial potential. This came to a forefront when it was revealed inadvertently that Catherine had elected to go on a sailing trip with Colin in New York, making Chris extremely jealous. On several occasions (perhaps unintentionally) Chris misspelled Colin as "Colon".
His jealousy was extended by Colin's "offensive" male physique (i.e., having pecs instead of manboobs) that seemed to rile Chris's self-loathing and hatred for his homosexual inclinations up. Chris blocked Colin's e-mail the moment he suggested that his homophobia and disgust toward males (as seen in his Brassieres For Males Facebook page) were results of Chris's latent homosexuality.
Chats between the two of them show Chris to have a vast inferiority complex toward Colin.
