Chris in January 2019
January was the first month of 2019. This month, Chris announced that the Dimensional Merge had been once again pushed back, this time to an indeterminate date, and uploaded a video reading his own Twitter rant about the haters and weens. As a result of being blocked by multiple members of the TF2 Analysis on Twitter, Chris made a video in which he angrily screams at his phone, and another video where he demanded them to unblock him.
