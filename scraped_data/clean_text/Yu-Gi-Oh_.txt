A TRUE and HONEST CWC-themed Monster Card.
"I am STRAIGHT! STRAIGHT! Get it through your damn, dirty, immature skulls! ...and here's a drawing of me dressed as Dark Magician Girl :3"
Yu-Gi-Oh! is a Japanese manga about a boy named Yugi who, after solving an ancient artifact called the Millennium Puzzle, inherits a spirit named Yami in his body, and goes around playing a trading card game called Duel Monsters. The manga has spun off into an entire multimedia franchise, including several anime series co-produced by NAS and Studio Gallop, and an actual version of the TCG featured in the stories (produced by Konami, who sponsored the anime), which emphasize trusting in "the heart of the cards" as a key skill.
Chris is a fan of the Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG, and has incorporated the use of its "spell cards" into Sonichu. Much like his custom Pokémon cards, Chris has created dozens of homemade Yu-Gi-Oh! cards about himself and his characters.
Though his interest in the franchise has subsided in recent years, Yu-Gi-Oh! will always be noteworthy in the story of Chris's life due to him meeting Megan Schroeder during a TCG match at The GAMe PLACe in 2005.

In Sonichu
Chris employs Yu-Gi-Oh! references early on in the Sonichu series, usually when portraying himself himself battling Wes Iseli. His Yu-Gi-Oh! influence peaks in Episode 12, where Chris uses his deck of cards to prevent Wes from ruining the wedding of Sarah Hammer and William Spicer. Spicer himself is depicted as Jack's Knight, one of the characters in the cards, either because Chris couldn't draw him or didn't know what he looked like.
A side plot in Sonichu #5 involves Chris beaming about his new friendship with Megan Schroeder, who probably sparked his unusual fixation on the game. Though the ability to turn trading cards into real effects seemed to be effective at taking down Chris's foes, he evidently lost interest in the franchise not long after, and the cards vanished from that point onward without explanation.
Chris has also drawn himself as Dark Magician Girl, a female Yu-Gi-Oh! character complete with hairy legs and Sonichu medallion. Whether this is an example of random-access humor or an allusion to Chris's eventual gender issues remains unknown.
Custom Yu-Gi-Oh! Cards
Chris created many custom Yu-Gi-Oh! cards from August to September 2004, and a single one in May 2006. Some of his custom cards have effects relying on monsters being male or female, such as "Virgin With Rage", "A Jerk" and "Girlfriend Attraction". This comes despite gender having no effect in official cards, rarely even being specified.

Let's Play
In March 2016, Arthur Spatchcock challenged Chris to a game of Yu-Gi-Oh! over the PS4. Spatchcock wanted to introduce Chris to the idea of doing Let's Plays to boost his online activity and help him gain some money through YouTube's monetization program.[1][2] The plan fell apart after Let's Plays of Destiny and Uncharted, since by that point, Chris was too lazy to play video games for money, and he simply wanted to beg from his audience instead.
Chris did not comment during the video, because he was "not in the mood", even though his mic was on and his TV audible in the background. Spatchcock tried to converse with him, but Chris ignored him.[3]

Spatchcock was not impressed with Chris's game strategy.[4]
Chris was using a pre-built deck by the looks of it; it uses some weird ass summoning system where you can pretty much just keep summoning and fusing monsters over and over. Chris was doing it just to do it. No strategy, no planning, just randomly doing shit because the game prompted him to do so. Out of the found rounds we played I trounced him the first two easily...I had to dial back and let him win once I heard the stress sighing. The third round was pretty much given to him but the fourth round he actually seemed to finally have it down on how to use his cards.
This is mentioned in the fourth call but I can share it here without Chris feeling 'betrayed' but I actually bought Chris the game because I set up a wager with him. We're going to play a 2 out of 3 match; if I win Chris is supposed to draw new sonichu pages and if he wins I get him a new PS4 game. He was bragging about how he still has his old cards including Dark Magician Girl. I assume before out big match he's going to build his own deck and I can't wait to see what he comes up with.

In the February 2024 livestream Christ Chan Live Stream: Legos, Games and Media, Chris showed off his old deck. Below are the cards listed in order of appearance:

Many of these cards are severely outdated and largely irrelevant, with some being outright banned, such as Premature Burial. Like with the other card games, Chris seems to have either grown out of card collecting, is too lazy to do so or doesn't want to spend money on them anymore.
