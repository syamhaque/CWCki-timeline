Description
With the help of the other Sonichus and Rosechus, we expand our social circles and defensive forces. We also have a lovely party together.
Sonichu, Rosey, and the other found Specials, are not alone in the worlds, as there are many other Sonichus and Rosechus who have their own lives and their own stories to share in our worlds and Dimensions, as well as help us and work with each other. It does astound and please us to have them all with us, together, to be friends, allies, and warriors alike.
The number of these Sonichu and Rosechu OCs that have been made and discovered by their respective Creators, Artists and Authors shows how much love, kindkess and support Sonichu, Rosey, everyone else and I are humbled by and appreciate. The ones featured in this pack are but a small fraction of the vast number. This compilation is one way to show my appreciation to eveyone.
Thank You All.
<3 Chris Chan Sonichu.
