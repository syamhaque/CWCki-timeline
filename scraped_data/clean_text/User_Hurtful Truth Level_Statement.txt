I'm writing this statement to address why I haven't been active much recently. It's a long story. Short version is a mix of drama involving the Watchmen group, being name-dropped out-of-context by a Watchmen member who's come under scrutiny, and feeling bewildered over the incest news.
First some context about the Watchmen drama.
The Watchmen
I was invited into the Watchmen Discord group last year in August 2020. It was basically a group that chatted with Chris and aimed to protect him from people they deemed malicious. I was a lurker, occasionally chatted about CWC updates with them.
This is what the Watchmen Discord server looked like, it's called The Place:
The first layer of channels is for Chris to ramble in, the second layer is hidden to allow for discussing him.
In June 2021, there was a conflict between members The WCT and Naught, which resulted in WCT and Chris exiting The Place. WCT set up his own Discord server which resembled the old Watchmen server. This is what it looked like, it's called "The Knights of CWC":
He also invited several people from The Place Watchmen server, a mix of current and former - seven accepted the invite, and he planned to invite more as time went on. He didn't extend the invite to Naught and at least two others who had sided with Naught - MKR and Kyle. WCT also said he wanted the server to not be public info, and he also avoided calling his group by the Watchmen name, which has led to some confusion.
So essentially, the Watchmen group survived its breakup, just with a shift in members.
The new Watchmen group tried to assist Chris with Everfree convention planning, namely how to avoid Sockness, who was making claims to attend as well. (Neko = WCT)
Halfway through July, Chris brought up Bella to WCT and told him she would be going with him to Everfree and could help against Sockness, as seen in the leaked WCT-Chris DMs.[1]
On July 19th, Chris invited two people into the Knights group - the Suitress and Bella. They discussed Everfree plans in the server.
WCT discusses with other Watchmen in the hidden discussion channel about Bella coming in.
The Suitress enters.
Bella enters.
Fast forward to July 30th - the incest news broke and Bella was named by Null as a person involved. WCT tried asking Bella what was going on:

He then created a group Discord chat with some of the other Watchmen to ask Bella more questions. I didn't enter the chat, but one of the Watchmen who did confirmed that it is the "Group - Regarding Chris." chat leaked in this post. So the context of that chat is it's the Watchmen trying to get info and Bella giving disinfo.
Why I haven't been around much
I was a lurker in the The Place and Knights Watchmen servers but not actively. I’d generally peer in when Chris posted in the 1st layer which was easy to tell because he’d @ everyone. Sometimes I’d look at the 2nd hidden layer to see what they were discussing, and most of it seemed boring to me - commentary about CWC Twitter updates, his weens, personal talk, off-topic posting, etc.
I’ve also never paid much attention to people around Chris. It’s not something that interests me. I’m just here to watch the CWC show.
So as far as I could tell, the Watchmen people were keeping him company with chit-chat and movie nights and stuff, and white-knighted/shooed away weens sometimes. I was never interested to look into what the Watchmen did outside of the servers and rarely talked to them.
In late June, there was some drama with the Watchmen. WCT told me Naught had doxed him on Kiwi Farms, and I didn’t know enough about either of them, so my response was along the lines of, “Sorry to hear you were doxed. It looks bad but maybe he has an alibi or explanation.” He had reached out to me because he wanted me to ask KF admins to check whether the alt that he believed to be Naught was really him; I declined and suggested he talk to them himself. Later both Chris and WCT were gone from The Place (Watchmen Discord server). WCT gave me an invite to his new Knights of CWC Discord server group. It served the same function and had the same atmosphere as The Place. Again, as with The Place, I just looked in from time to time and wasn’t interested in the daily conversations.
On July 30th the incest news broke. I thought it couldn’t possibly be real. Thought for a while maybe some troll paid Chris to read a script, or maybe he was fantasizing about alternate dimension Barb. The news kinda messed with my head - on July 29th the talk was about how he’d be going to Everfree and goofing off there, and 24 hours later, he’s a sicko who had sex with his own mother. Normally I try to give Chris the benefit of the doubt in things, like with his transgender identity or his pets, and that he could take advantage of his own mother like that had me questioning whether I was totally wrong about him the whole time.
So I wanted to take a break from reading about Chris. Over the next couple weeks I pretty much just visited KF to help with moderation and help out a bit on the CWCki, and avoided reading too much about the incest stuff.
At one point during the avalanche of incest updates, WCT messaged me and linked to his KF post with the (now proven fake) BDSM text and asked me if I could help him authenticate it by talking to Bella. I refused to talk to her, didn’t want to get involved. I left the Knights server to avoid being contacted.
I was also out of the loop about how exactly WCT had the BDSM text. I was never in the Regarding Chris chat where Bella handed it to him. So when he posted that to KF and then acted really sketchy about it, I didn’t know what to think. Someone asked me why WCT tagged me in his KF post to one of Bella's friends.[2] It wasn't until I got around to reading the leaked Regarding Chris chat[3] that I realized he had wanted me to talk to them to verify it and confirm it to the public because he felt the community would trust me more than him. Which is not an idea I would've agreed to.
"Hedgehog" is a reference to my Kiwi Farms username.
After a couple weeks following the incest news, during which I wasn't paying much attention to CWC stuff, I wanted to get a better understanding of the drama around WCT / Watchmen as I was confused by it. So I read through a bunch of chatlogs - logs from The Place and Knights servers and the leaked WCT messages. Took a bit of time to read through the info. Then I was hesitant to post my findings as it was already very late in the game, and wasn't sure if the extra context would just be superfluous, or if stepping forward would be a good idea since tensions are high, etc. Early on I made an alt CWCki account (Carboncoffee99) to test the waters, but abandoned the idea after a few edits. Eventually I reached out to someone for advice, who pointed out that my silence seemed suspicious.
So that brings me to writing up this statement to publicly address the matter. I'll probably still be less active overall as the incest news is still disturbing to me.
