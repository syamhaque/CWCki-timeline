================================================================================

In Sonichu Issue 8, Chris generously put in a set of pages of the 'pop-star debut performance' of Jiggliami and her song 'War of Love', apparently written by then sweetheart and obvious troll, Blanca Weiss. According to the pathetically drawn creation, it was dedicated to her 'ol pikachu boyfriend' who randomly disappeared from Jiggliami's 'home field'. Whether or not this pikachu was an anthropomorphic hellish creature like Jiggliami or was a normal Pokemon is never explained. If this Pikachu was the original Sonichu or not is also not explained, even though it is hinted at. Since this plot point is never mentioned or seen again, no one cares.
Lyrics
I can't hide this feeling any more
Don't you notice the fever of love
Dark clouds were hanging low.
A busy city had lost its colors.
Sunshine hiding away,
Twilight fading out,
And shadows nearing me now.
The world is not
How it used to be
I don't know if
Love has changed
But do I still want you?
What could I do?
What should I do?
Baka dana watashi! (馬鹿だな私 "What a fool I am!")
It's the War of Love!
I can't give you up
I hate to see
You smile to every girl
Except for me.
I want you so bad.
Too heavy and too deep.
Please focus on me.
I will show you how much
You love me.
I screamed out to you with a
Megaphone, to find it broken.
I try to reach up as high as I can.
But your eyes are never on me
Now I look up to the sky.
I find it has been cleared.
But it has not been done for me.
I can't stop these feelings.
They're getting out of hand.
Oh, what could I do?
What should I do?
I swear in this love,
I'll never give you up.
Dai-suki! (第すき "I love you")
It's the War of Love.
Creation
It is interesting to note that this song 'written' by Blanca is actually a near-copy of the song "Love is War", a Supercell song using Miku Hatsune for vocals. Whether or not Chris is aware of the plagiarism, did not care, or was genuinely convinced that Blanca had written a song that looked like it was taken directly from Google Translate but was totally original is not known.
A quick Google search states that the Love is War song was uploaded to YouTube in February 2008, while the comic says that the song was written in August 2008.
A small yet funny thing to note, 'baka dana watashi', a random piece of Japanese placed in the middle of the song apparently translates to be 'what a fool I am', a funny thing to consider when you remember that Blanca was just a troll that managed to get 'her' work into Chris's comic.
