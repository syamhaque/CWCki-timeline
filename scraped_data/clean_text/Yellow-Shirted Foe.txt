Occupation
Assistant Manajerk, GameStop
The Yellow-Shirted Foe (real name unknown), previously known as the Ass-Manager, was an innocent GameStop employee doing his job on the fateful day of December 26th 2014.
Likely tired after hours of communicating to bargain-hunting customers on Boxing Day and looking forward to returning home to his loved ones to enjoy another day of the festive season, his day took a turn for the worse when a cross-dressing manchild, previously banned from the store he worked a shift at for acts of vandalism, sprayed him with pepper spray for no valid reason, causing immense pain and eye irritation. He was the sole victim of Chris's campaign against Sonic's blue arms.
After Chris was taken to court and found guilty, his Yellow-Shirted Foe would come under scrutiny once more on November 29th 2015 where it would be revealed that Chris blames him for his various bans and has decided to add him to his list of enemies. In spite of this, he has not factored into Chris's life in any way since then.

On arguably the busiest shopping day of the year besides Black Friday, the Yellow-Shirted Foe happened to be working the Boxing Day Shift at a GameStop in Charlottesville Fashion Square, where Chris was trespassing. Considering he had been banned for vandalizing store displays in the past, his Yellow-Shirted Foe was one of the employees to confront him and ordered him to leave.
When Chris put up argument, his Yellow-Shirted Foe left to fetch security and Chris retaliated by yelling out "DON'T CALL ANYBODY!" and macing him as he passed by on his way out. Some who have reviewed the footage of the incident in great detail have noticed that the employee then mouthed out a bewildered expletive in response to the unprovoked attack.
The Yellow-Shirted Foe would press charges and over the course of nearly a year, Chris attended various court hearings until October 15th when Chris would be found guilty.

Chris accuses his Yellow-Shirted Foe of holding a vendetta against him and has encouraged his various bans.
Revealing a long-winded typical Chris-Chan Apology in which he at one point attempts to blackmail his Yellow-Shirted Foe by making a baseless accusation that he is working several jobs and threatens to report him to the Better Business Bureau, Chris tells us the apology was ignored which ignites his wrath.
Chris goes further to accuse him of being bigoted towards the LGBT and Autistic community in spite of no evidence to support it, simply for committing the crime of slighting Chris. Content with his assumption, he urges his fans to boycott GameStop and various affiliates in protest against his Yellow-Shirted Foe's alleged discrimination. Chris never once considered that the Foe could be on the autism spectrum himself, or that he could be a member of the LGBT+ community. He could even be a closeted trans woman or transitioned trans man!
Chris expects his apology to be accepted simply because he made the effort to make one at all... Disregarding that his Yellow-Shirted Foe lost working time and money due to the incident, which placed him under a substantial amount of stress.
