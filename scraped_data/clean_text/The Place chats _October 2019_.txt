Birthdays
1-2 October 2019
Kyle
Hows it going?
@Sonichu982 Doing anything for Barbara's birthday?
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
A simple lovely lunch outing at Wood Grill Buffet.
I filled this body up with a large salad with lots of vegetables, potatoes, mac&cheese and a bit of non-spicy beef. Also, ice cream in a cone
I am working on the cards at the moment.
Naught
What a lovely sentiment. I hope you have a good time.
Kyle
Neat
MKRNightVee
I hope you both have a wonderful time and that Barb has a very happy birthday
Kyle
Does magi-chan have a birthday?
Naught
Will magi chan escort Barbara or will CwC? Yes I forget. When was magi-chan born?
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
I was born on November 14, 1948.
And I have time-traveled a lot, so I am even older than that.
Kyle
Any issues of mortality?
Deleted User
That’s awesome magi Chan! You should remind us when your birthday comes up. When is Christine coming back?
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
I have mastered full reincarnation, and I can leave my body when needed if I feel the moment is inescapable. My DNA follows my soul as well, so I can be regenerated/reborn without a moment lost.
A few days
Kyle
Or any other birthdays of relevant figures
Naught
Where is CwC currently?
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
She’s working with my body here at home, readjusting the frequency in it as well.
My original birth date is the one we count.
Kyle
Most of my favorite shows are medical dramas, probably what inspired me a lot
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
You need not worry about counting my age; just a few candles on my cake will be sufficient.

Night Star, personality tests
7 October 2019
MKRNightVee complains about a panel in Ben Saint's comic which depicts the origins of Night Star's heterochromia. Chris clarifies the lore behind it. As Chris is currently role-playing that he is being possessed by Magi-Chan while Magi-Chan's body in C-197 is being possessed by Chris, he claims he will swap spirits back with Chris when Chris successfully brings Magi-Chan's body into dimension 1218 (also known as the real world). Kyle then posts a link to a personality test site, and several server members, including Chris, take the test. Chris takes the personality test as both Magi-Chan and as Chris, by role-playing that Chris temporarily re-possessed his body to take the test.

@Sonichu982
Are you really ok with this? Saying slime caused the hetrochromia? Last I checked Nightstar was born with it.
Kyle
Gotta keep the canon intact
Deleted User
Pesky retcons.
MKRNightVee
Looks to me like he's taking too many liberties. This is not ok.
Deleted User
[posts a panel of Night Star playing with Lego]
Is that supposed to be a jab at autism? By making the Legos that color?
MKRNightVee
I think so
[2:40 AM]
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
Good Evening, everyone.
Firstly, to set the record straight:
Nightstar was born with both eyes Blue.
She had a mishap in science class one time that turned her right eye green.
It was not the smooze or slime that did it.
All the smooze sample shown in Benjamin’s strips did was reveal the evens happening in Arizona of C-197.
Although, I will admit his most recent strip upload is adding a question of possible retcon, after PH and SM end up in the sewers, and still being as they are.
BUT I foresee Benjamin putting both heads back on their respective necks, SM getting his hand reattached, too.
And the both of them ending up topside once again.
PH gets a replacement Yang2020 shirt.
This will take a few days to wrap this horrific arc around in the time it takes for him to draw.
Also, Again: I will switch back with Christine after she gets my body into 1218, fully, once again.
It is proving more difficult this time around, but she and I have faith in her success in the next day or two.
Kyle
Could getting stuck be a risk?
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
Not at all likely.
Kyle

Just a curiosity 😉
INTJ all the way
Deleted User
I'm intj
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
Very well.
Since I am up.
MKRNightVee
[posts a screenshot of her result, which reads: "Mediator" and "INFP-T"]
I got this one
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
I, Magi-Chan Sonichu, am a Protagonist.
Quite appropriate.
Christine is up as well, so I shall give her a turn.

Chris (as Chris)
Christine- Hey.
I’m a Protag Too!
😃
See how I differ from my hubby, even slightly.
Kyle
Neat, so no troubles coming back?
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
Magi-Chan- I allowed her to temporarily possess the body; she went back to my body shortly after.
It is a part of the Astral projection skill set.
I swear, this digital keypad is not a fully good substitute for a traditional keyboard.
Kyle
Neat
I miss phones with keyboards
😦
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
Also, you will note: she is less judging than I, and she is more turbulent.
Deleted User
I wonder if I can plug a keyboard into a USB port?
Kyle
Oh ya, with micro usb to usb
MKRNightVee
Arnt those wireless now too 🤔
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
Yes, there are wireless keyboards available.
Kyle
Maybe bluetooth would work 🙂
Deleted User
😊
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
Yes

Maladaptive daydreaming
14 October 2019 (partially leaked during the 2020 Discord leaks)
Kyle
@Sonichu982 What's up with you? Haven't heard anything in a few days.
Deleted User
[posts a YouTube video]
Chris
My bad.
I have been super preoccupied with my work on the Shipfic Cards.
But, MOREOVER, I have literally have been All Over Everywhere!
I’m force-astral-projected to many, many places.
Even today, I was force-projected Three Times, and worked hard at where I was at those times, while I was awake.
And I get projected even while my body is Asleep.
I can hardly get much good quality rest, even though my body is asleep and Dreaming.
I’m working on Goddess Mode.
Last Saturday, I was sent to Japan to help protect everyone against the Hurricane.
Next thing I know, my body will literally be force-teleported and summoned into C-197 for active duty.
Deleted User
Christine have you thought of taking things slow and just chilling out
Chris
I have, yes
Kyle
My family likes to say "The rapture can wait"
Chris
I have tried, but I can’t get that luxury to these days.
Deleted User
If you want. We could from time to time just listen to some music in a Voice Channel
Kyle
There are a hundred conditions exacerbated or caused by stress
Chris
When duty calls me, I am summoned.
Kyle
So, helpless?
Even the Grecian heroes could always say no
What is there to lose by leaving things as they lie?
MKRNightVee
Try to take it easy when you can.
Kyle
Was that what the supplement was for?
Chris
To me, I literally don’t get that luxury, because I am needed in situations that others can’t do without me there.
It took My psychic skills to help get into the mind of and tame a Bugbear in Equestria; it needed a new home, and we called for the good changelings to help make a home for it.
I helped foiled Eggman in a way only I could do.
AND I had to take out Dark IdeaGuy as he and Shadow Elijah were terrorizing New Comma, and the CPUs of Gamindustri weren’t enough to take out the shadowy giant.
THAT I what I ended up doing late this morning/early this afternoon while Awake.
I had to crash back to sleep for a couple of hours; SLEEPING IN AGAIN.
And I get force-projected even while the body sleeps and rests for such great calls and answering prayers.
Kyle
Even batman gets a day-off
Chris
Hell.
I even was forced-projected into Equestria on Sunday Morning, and right in front of Celestía and Twilight, in my Alicorn form, I freaking fainted and had to rest in Celestia’s bed for a few hours then.
It’s like a card game and your card is played and you are immediately summoned onto the field.
And the player is set to attack with you, and you already had a really rough day.
And this player keeps playing game after game after game.
Except, it is Not a game
It is Real Battles and Events.
And I’m still learning, developing and gaining my own abundance of Experience from EVERYTHING.
Kyle
So what if it doesn't stop?
Chris
So I can end up being Tough Enough for it all to be a breeze for me.
Eventually, I will catch a break and get better rest
Kyle
Can you lift a 10 lb weight?
Chris
But now, I just take what I can get.
I can lift a pair of 25 lb Wights.
Kyle
Nobody can lift a 10 ton weight, there are limits
Chris
You meant “Ton”; you first said “lb”.
Kyle
I meant as 2 separate examples
Sorry
Chris
I know my limits; I am no Mary Sue; I Know That.
Everything is building up within me.
I will very soon finally be fully, physically in my Sonichu Form, and then the fun Really can Progress.
Leaving now; really sleepy.
Goodnight

TSSSF cards
17 October 2019 (leaked as part of the 2020 Discord leaks)
Subject tssf cards
.Or making a Series 2 for TSSSF.
I’m adding this onto the game as a large contribution and a way to give more to the fandom with this bit of actual merchandise.
I’m working and listening to SNT’s live art stream.
2.5” X 3.5” (poker-size) cards.
Metal Gear Sonichu
23 October 2019 (partially leaked as part of the 2020 Discord leaks)
Kyle
Anything up with anyone?
@Sonichu982 I like the MGS drawing
Deleted User
Is that snake?
Kyle
Soni-snake
Chris
Actually, it’s Sonichu in bulletproof military garb to make the alt-version, created in LittleBiGPlanet many, many years ago with the good old DLC costume on a Sonichu Sackboy.
Kyle
Always liked the kind of spy suit design, especially in V
Deleted User
😃 well done
Kyle
And carrying like 20 guns, and 20 other items
Chris
Anyway, he was originally this:
But wearing this
(Minus the headgear)
And the body paint
Now he gets a better look for his Secret Shipfic card
The MGSonichu is from an alt-timeline.
Kyle
Have they not made any more LBP games?
Chris
Recollection leads to recall the last full game was LBP3, and there's the Mobile game, "Run, Sackboy, Run".
