“
Rape yourselves with your own Damn Darth Maul Dual LightSabre

Chris to Clyde Cash and Surfshack Tito[1]
Remember Chris, the autism will be with you – always.
Coincidence? I think not!
Star Wars is a film and media franchise created by George Lucas and produced his company Lucasfilm. It begun with 1977's Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, which was released to critical and commercial acclaim and is now considered to be one of the best movies of all-time. The popularity of the first installment lead to two more sequels, 1980's Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, and 1983's Episode VI: Return of the Jedi. The franchise is now a cultural icon, and has spawned legions of parodies, and book and television companions, as well as a prequel trilogy, consisting of 1999's Episode I: The Phantom Menace, 2002's Episode II: Attack of the Clones, and 2005's Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, and a sequel trilogy, made up of 2015's Episode VII: The Force Awakens, 2017's Episode VIII: The Last Jedi, and 2019's Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker, as well as a handful of spin-off films and television projects like 2016's Rogue One, 2018's Solo, and 2019's The Mandalorian.
Chris has mentioned on more than one occasion that he likes the franchise, and has taken influence from it on certain occasions. The earliest known references he's made to it are in his Lego Game Boy Camera videos, around the time that The Phantom Menace was being hyped up in 1999 (though the video states it was from 1998). He particularly likes the character Ahsoka Tano, who was first introduced in the 2008 animated series The Clone Wars.

Chris wearing an Ahsoka Tano hat.
Chris' Star Wars self. Zabrak are known for being arrogant and prideful, quite fitting for Chris.
Ditto, but female. Note that Chris's choice of last name for either character implies that he thinks that Lando Calrissian is at least part-Zabrak instead of fully-human.
Luke Skywalker competes in Mario Kart 64 Lego Raceway and fights Darth Maul. In addition, other Star Wars characters like a "Vader Droid", Anakin Skywalker, and R2-D2 show up as well.
In the FUTURE MESSAGE, Chris referred to cigarettes as "death sticks," a childish euphemism borrowed from one of the sillier scenes in Attack of the Clones, specifically the one that spawned the "You don't want to sell me death sticks" meme. Unfortunately, unlike the drug dealer in the movie, Chris would not go home and rethink his life.
In IRC, Chris told trolls "I've enjoyed 5/6 Episodes, and Clone Wars; didn't see EP3 yet[2] and that Episode IV is his favorite film in the series.[3]
Chris once mentioned watching "Blue Harvest", the first part of Family Guy's trilogy of Star Wars parodies (which Lucasfilm themselves approved and had involvement in). He has likely seen the other two episodes as well.
He owns five Star Wars games and several toys.
In Julie Reveals Herself, Max does a Chewbacca impression, which Chris responds to with one of his own, arguably even worse than his Donald Duck impersonation.
When Chris was forced to sing "OK2BGay", he originally sang it in a voice not unlike Yoda. Whether he was intentionally impersonating him or not is unknown, but for his standards it's surprisingly accurate.
Chris downloaded Yoda for Soulcalibur 4.
He used Thorg's love of Star Wars as evidence of his nerdiness[4]
He told Clyde and Surfshack Tito "You both want me to even Beg, you can go point at your own damn snouts and Oink like Eric Cartman, and then Rape yourselves with your own Damn Darth Maul Dual LightSabre."[5]
Wild Sonichu's proposed backstory is an admitted Star Wars ripoff:
“
Wild Sonichu's story is of after he loses his father to some Pok'emon poachers (possibly of Team Rocket and Giovanni), and years later, he hears the call of his father from afar, and he sets forward to find and rescue him. The ending being he finds his Scyther father evolved to a Scizor, and it draws into a plot similar to that in Star Wars between Luke and Vader.
”

In the Sonichu comics, Jason Kendrick Howell's throne appears to bear resemblance to the Emperor's throne in Return of the Jedi.
Ahsoka Tano is shown gossiping with "Zack, the That's-What-She-Said Douchebag" in CWC Lego Manchester High School Oct 18 2013.
In 2021, Chris commemorated the franchise on Twitter on 4 May (dubbed Star Wars Day by fans due to the obvious "May the Fourth be with you" pun, rather than to commemorate the release date of the original film).
At the Animate! Raleigh convention in January 2024, Chris cosplayed as Star Wars character Ahsoka.
