Fiona Cooper[6] (born circa 2002),[7][8][note 8] also known as Snoo, Fifi Vixenhart and "The Suitress", is self-described as Chris's "first real sweetheart."[9] Unlike most of Chris's other gal-pals, who at best were just friends or at worst left him for his unsavory traits, Fiona, seemingly out of some pity towards him,[10] had a genuine, admitted crush on him, so much so to the point of actually wanting to have sex with him,[11] even after the dark secret she'd later come to discover about him.[3]
Fiona was an active member of the CWCsphere, being a well-known member of communities such as the Official CWCki Server.[10] She tried to reach out to Chris via phone on October 2020, telling him about a drawing of Night Star she made. Still, she was warned against the interaction by a mod on the server.[12] However, despite repeated warnings, Fiona persisted and later achieved contact with Chris some time in mid-2021, around the time he made his announcement of going to the Brony convention Everfree Northwest. Fiona, along with Bella, was invited by Chris to attend with him to the convention as a means of protection from Jacob Sockness, who The WCT warned to him would attend in disguise. Fiona had decided that she'd have sex with Chris at the hotel that the trio would be staying at for the convention, and she made arrangements with him. Chris agreed to this request, believing that having sexual intercourse with her would help her "mature" when she meets a long-term boyfriend in college.
On 19 July 2021, Chris invited both Fiona and Bella into The Knights of CWC server. Bella introduced herself to Fiona and the two befriended each other. After Bella had a conversation with Chris about his affair with his "lady friend", she shared a clip of it with Fiona, who then shared an edited version of it to a group of people in another Discord server she was in, leading to the call getting leaked and causing a massive fallout amongst the CWCsphere. When Bella told Fiona about Chris's incestuous affair, and shared the Incest Call and Incest Texts, Fiona then shared a censored version of the Call with the Chris Chan Conservation Collective server, omitting Bella's side of the conversation. When server members doubted the authenticity of the original leak, she posted Bella's voice without her permission.[13] After Chris Chan Conservation Collective member EllDudeRocks leaked the Incest Call to the general public, Fiona leaked the Incest Texts to Reddit, despite Bella having told her not to post them yet.[14]
Though she initially tried to protect Fiona from the Knights following the leaks by claiming that Fiona was a minor, Bella later attempted to frame her as being the voice in the call in her frantic attempts to avoid being doxed. This move backfired on Bella, as it had led to gossipers on Kiwi Farms led by Spooky Bones perceiving Fiona as a victim of her's, giving them more justification to vilify Bella and leading to Fiona getting obfuscated on several platforms. After the ensuing drama, expressing feeling traumatized both by his Chris's crime and his arrest, Fiona distanced herself from Chris before posting more leaks on a throwaway account two weeks later. Despite this, Chris has mentioned a desire to get back in contact with her in jail letters and several videos.

Aliases
Fiona had went under a number of aliases during her time in the CWCSphere.
During her online presence, Fiona was most known under the alias "Snoo", assuming the avatar of Reddit's alien mascot. She used this alias when she was first on the CWCki Discord server.[15] She also had an account on Reddit under the alias "IanBwandonAndOWOson", which she used to post pictures and videos of herself cosplaying as Chris. After being invited to the Knights of CWC server, she went under "ScootalooSister", likely because Chris invited her to Everfree Northwest.
When she began interacting with Chris, Fiona went under the pseudonym "Fifi Vixenhart." After meeting with Fiona, Chris referred to Fiona by this pseudonym when talking with his other associates. [16] Since his arrest, Chris has referred to Fiona as "Fifi" as a sort of pet name.
Suitress Codename
NOTE:
Unlike the Wallflower, Fiona never asked to be censored on the CWCki or anywhere else, and she also never asked for the censorship to be removed. The history behind the Suitress policy can be found here.
For more info, click here.
The codename "The Suitress" (previously "The Everfree Suitress") was created by the CWCki editor and jerkop PsychoNerd054 on 15 August 2021.[17] This was done in response to the stigma surrounding Fiona getting doxed after Bella framed her, which involved Spooky Bones; the leading figure in the investigations of Bella; threatening to dox or otherwise target people who tried to dox Fiona.[18] In some cases, this happened, such as with The WCT, who was manipulated by Bella into framing her, and GiBi, who inadvertently leaked Fiona's phone number in a video showcasing texts Bella gave him. Several CWCki staff, which included Hurtful Truth Level and Marvin, were also subjects of scrutiny due to both of them being in The WCT's Knights of CWC server, which Bella and Fiona also happened to be in. Both Hurtful and Marvin were also criticized for supposedly doing nothing to stop Bella from framing Fiona, despite that fact that neither of them were in the Regarding Chris chats, where the framing took place.
Psycho chose to attempt to censor Fiona on CWCki pages. He also drafted a policy for Fiona censorship, called the Suitress Policy.[19] It took inspiration from the CWCki's Wallflower Policy, however differed from it in that Fiona did not request the censorship.[20] Fiona herself rejected the censorship attempt. On r/ChrisChanSonichu, she posted a selfie to prove her Reddit account; leaked Chris Chan's Good Morning, an audio file in which Chris sang her name; then created an AMA thread titled, "I'm Fiona, A.K.A "The Everfree Suitress" and I genuinely had a crush on Chris Chan. Ask me anything and I'll respond on my own time."[21][22]
The policy was lessened a bit on 27 March 2022 after Hurtful had discussed it with Psycho, concerned about the issues that were arising from the amount of censorship that was being done on Fiona. Both of them agreed to lessen the policy over time before getting rid of it entirely.[23] This change then allowed users to utilize Fiona's other screen names and show her face in videos. In September 2023, Anaxis wrote a case against the Suitress policy, and he and other CWCki editors agreed to overturn it and restore information previously censored after discussing it.[24] However, the codename was kept as a unifying nickname for Fiona.
Chris referenced the Suitress alias at one point in his jail letters, when he wrote that "she is not a suitress".[25]
Psycho began writing the essay "The Blind Observers and a Snoo" on 4 May 2025, as a way to explain both his thoughts on the drama surrounding Fiona and his reasoning behind the policy.[26]
Attraction to Chris

“
I know that my attraction is abnormal. I also know that it is harmless, since we are both adults and that I don't think about harming him in any way.

Fiona, on her crush on Chris.[10]
An old tablet drawing Fiona posted on her IanBwandonAndOwOson Reddit account.
Perhaps the most well-known attribute of Fiona is her "attraction" to Chris, though her true feelings on Chris are fairly complex. According to Fiona, her crush on Chris began as a sort of "disgust" towards him, which then evolved into a "fascination" towards him, until finally culminating into a "crush".[27] Fiona expressed these feelings on platforms such as Reddit, Discord, and Vigyaa.[28][10][29] She claims that she started having "feelings" towards Chris on the September of 2020, which later started evolving into a full-on crush when she listened to the audio regarding Chris's date with Emily in November.[10]
Fiona has overall provided nuanced feelings about Chris. In some instances, she talks about Chris unfavorably, talking about how much better she was than him and deeming him a sort of "anti role-model." Fiona attributed the crush as a sort of "coping mechanism" to her own insecurities during the COVID-19 pandemic. In spite of this, Fiona has also talked about feeling empathic towards Chris, expressing pity towards him. She has stated that she saw parts of herself in him, and viewed him as some sort of "weird amalgamation" of an overgrown man-child, or a little kid in a man's body, that she wants to take care of and nurture.
In a Viggya post and various Discord chats, Fiona details a number of fantasies she's had regarding Chris, giving more insight on the complexities of her infatuation with Chris. In the post, she shares that she prefers Classic Chris over his current self, though she has also stated that Tomgirl Chris has that "spark", too. She also talks about how she saved a number of pictures of Chris from this wiki that she couldn't help but yearn over "again and again." Some of the other fantasies that she mentions in the post is "fingering herself" to For Julie's Eyes Only and wanting to suck Chris's dick after watching him submerge it in snow in the Cwcsicle video. Even the infamous Cakefarts video got her jollies.
Fiona seemed to express shame for having this crush, saying she was "tired of upkeeping this normal girly-girl image of [her]self in public" when talking about it. However, she also stated that it wasn't something she'd entirely change, deeming it a "benign weird." From this, she also expressed this crush more often with people she thought she could trust, such as Bella, trusting her that she wouldn't share the details about it. From these factors alone, it is safe to say that Fiona's self-professed feelings towards Chris were genuine, and not part of some elaborate scheme.
Fiona and Chris flirting in the Fiona Facetime Videos.
However, despite being attracted to her, Chris also didn't perceive having a long-term relationship with Fiona due to her living in Washington, and believed that she would wind up finding a lover when she went to college. Due to this, Chris stressed the importance of "encouraging her" and "boosting her self-confidence" to find a long-term sweetheart at her college, believing himself to be some sort of mentor for her. At various points, Chris mentioned being in an "open-relationship" with Fiona and his "Lady Friend" (Barb).[30][31] Chris also stated in a text that having sex with Fiona would be the right step for her to take for her "mental and emotional development."[32] Despite this, he also had stronger feelings for Bella and already had sex with Barb by this point, indicating that the boundaries of his Love Quest had been widening, even before his incest with Barb was discovered. When Bella brought up the possibility of Fiona graduating from college, growing up into a "beautiful woman", and engaging with Chris again, Chris said that he'd be more willing to engage with Fiona assuming that she hasn't already found her "longterm sweetheart."[31]
Early Relations to Chris
Prior to interacting with Chris, Fiona discovered him by happenstance through several documentaries and video essays that covered him, as many fans her age had. From there, Fiona had seemingly come to relate to Chris in some ways, seeing parts of herself in him, and she later became a well-known and active member of the CWCsphere. This fascination that Fiona had in Chris later developed into a crush towards him, and, according to one of her IRL friends,[33] she had expressed an innate desire to meet him in person. Despite the insistence other people had that she not interact with Chris, she was determined to do so, and was finally able to achieve contact with him by mid-2021.
Discovery
“
I see him as human, albeit a highly broken one.
”
Fiona's thoughts on Chris after "feeling" for him.[10]
According to Fiona, she first became aware of Chris through the YouTuber, Deadwing Dork, who mentioned Chris time and time again. She claimed that she began researching him out of curiosity, first feeling disgusted by him, a feeling that persisted and conflicted with the crush she later developed. Fiona later formed a more serious interest in Christory in the July of 2020, watching Geno's documentary series with a friend, Grant (also known as Physical-Floor or G202), and reading articles from this wiki extensively. Fiona also claimed that she started having "feelings" towards Chris on the September of that year, which later started evolving into a full-on crush when she listened to the audio regarding Chris's date with Emily in November.[10]
During her time in the CWCsphere, where she became relatively well-known, Fiona created a ton of fan content related to Chris. Some of it was tablet sketches, and another portion of it was photo edits and videos. She had also posted photos and videos of herself roleplaying as Chris, with one such case being a video where she records herself dancing to Goodbye Horses by Q Lazzarus.
Early Attempts at Interaction
Anaxis warning Fiona about interacting with Chris
Sometime later, Fiona joined the CWCki Discord server. While she was there, Fiona was noted for her seemingly obsessive attraction to Chris.[12] Fiona had repeatedly tried to call Chris via phone,[34][note 9] with the interactions going as far back as 3 October 2020,[35] sending a drawing she made of Night Star to him via his phone number, though she received no response back from Chris. More than a week later, Fiona, under the YouTube account Awesome Awesomness, had tried to interact with Chris in a livestream to get a response from him with regards to the drawing.[5] Former server mod Anaxis had tried to warn her about this interaction out of concern for her safety, as the Watchmen attempted to dox Fiona after she attempted to do this.[36] Fiona was warned repeatedly not to interact with Chris whenever she stated her desire to do so before getting banned from the Discord server in late October.[37][38][39]
Achieving Contact

Chris giving dating advice to Fiona
Despite all the warnings she had received, Fiona persisted and would officially begin interacting with Chris somewhere between June and July 2021.[40][note 10] According to Grant, Fiona's interactions with Chris started "innocently enough" with her texting Chris about the Dimensional Merge.[34] Afterwards, Chris and Fiona's interactions appeared to have become more imminent.
One of the later interactions involved Chris promising her that he wouldn't freak out at any G5 MLP toys he might come across at Everfree Northwest. Another one of these interactions was Chris singing a song to her. Much of their other interactions involve Chris giving dating advice to her. In the conversation, Fiona also gave Chris her details, something which got some of his other gal-pals doxed.[41] Fiona had also sent a photo of herself to Chris, which Chris later shared with The WCT in a chat introducing her.[16] Chris and Fiona also had interactions over the app Facetime. A handful were recorded by Fiona, which include her and Chris blowing kisses at each other, Chris miming eating an apple as Fiona watches, and Chris twirling his hair.[42] Fiona has also alleged that she once showed herself topless to Chris, which aroused him.[9]
Everfree Northwest

NOTE:
There is no evidence that Bella pushed Chris into a sexual relationship with Fiona at Everfree to blackmail him. This relationship was also entirely consensual: Fiona having sex with Chris was her idea, she was of legal age when she proposed it, and Chris agreed to it.
For more info, click here.
When The WCT informed Chris that Jacob Sockness would attend Everfree Northwest in disguise, Chris decided to bring bodyguards to the convention for protection, an idea that was suggested by The Fool. Fiona and Bella were the two people Chris invited to the convention. Fiona was invited into The WCT's Knights of CWC server on 16 July 2021.[43][16] Later, Bella invited Fiona, The WCT, and Chris to her Chess Group 15 Discord server.[44] Fiona chatted, played some games of chess, and conversed with Bella about their plans for Everfree Northwest. Fiona began to befriend Bella, and in Bella's words, the two of them became "bestiez" [sic].[45] However, Fiona was unaware of crass comments Bella was making about Chris behind her back in the Chess club server, such as claiming to want to date her and sway her away from Chris at the convention.[45]
On 19 July 2021, Chris shared several TSSSF cards that he made to thank Null for the fundraiser to his trip.[46] In the conversation, Fiona shows interest in the cards Chris made and asks how much they'd cost. She also talks more about the arrangements Chris had made with her for the convention, mentioning that she'd be checked into the hotel they'd be staying at at 4:00 PM.[46]
Planned Sexual Intercourse with Chris
“
I had no idea she was THIS involved. I knew Fiona had contact with him, but I gave her the benefit of the doubt. I knew she liked CWC, but I thought it was ultimately platonic.
”
Grant, shocked that Fiona wanted to have sex with Chris.[47]
Seeing how Fiona lived relatively close to where the convention would have taken place, she saw this as the perfect opportunity to have her adolescent dream of fucking her "anti-role model" come true. On 25 July 2021, Chris told Bella in a text that he and Fiona had discussed the idea of sex at the convention and that Chris had told her it would be a one-time event.[32] Chris further clarifies this by stating that Chris's planned sexual intercourse with Fiona wouldn't affect his relationship with Bella.
Just to be direct, yes, I did talk with Fiona earlier today, and we discussed the idea of sex during the weekend. I have went over with her that this will be a one-time event at best, and should she and I end up doing so, it is in the right direction.
But, I do this as mainly a stepping stone for her own mental, emotional, and spiritual development; a boost in her self-confidence and appreciation of figuring out the aura energies and types when on the lookout for her long-term partner she is likely to find on campus later on.
I want you to understand, Bella, this does not affect anything between you and I. I still care about you as an individual, and anything remains possible out of the foreseen outcomes down the road in this timeline.
Days later, during a call in which Chris said he was having sex with his own mother, Bella tried to encourage Chris to pursue a relationship with Fiona instead. Chris said that he was looking forward to the upcoming time with Fiona, noting her alleged sexual history.[48] After the call, Bella and Fiona talked about it. After discovering Chris's affair with his mother, she was shocked at this, but also expressed still wanting to have sex with him in order to "sway him away" from her, seemingly under the belief that Barb groomed him into doing it.[3][49][50]. Bella replied, "I was pushing realllly hard for that bjt he's convinced that you'll fall in love in college or something".[51] Fiona since made comments distancing herself from Chris.[4]
Following the Incest call, Chris talked to Fiona about what kind of music they should play at the convention when they have sex:[52]
I'm just now talking music with Fiona. We're putting together a playlist for our night together. She likes smooth alternative tracks.
Let me share with you her initial choices. One moment, please.
Some of them Are naughty, but not all of them.
Incest Call
On an unspecified date, but likely before 27 July 2021, Bella told Fiona that she thought "something illegal" was going on between Chris and his older lady friend.[53] Fiona suggested the possibility of it being Barb.
On the night of 27 July 2021, the Chris and Bella were in a call on Signal, of which the latter covertly recorded portions, and a set of texts were sent by Chris afterwards. In both of these, Chris bragged about having sex with his mother.[54] Some time after that, Bella shared both files with Fiona. Fiona then edited the call audio to cut out most of Bella's dialogue.
“
Well...I unleashed a moment in Christory for y'all
I don't know how I feel
”
Fiona[55]
Fiona posted the edited call audio onto the Chris Chan Conservation Collective Discord server. When the people in the server doubted the authenticity of the Incest Call leak, Fiona then shared the entire 9-minute clip she was given, which also had Bella's voice on it, on the same server without her permission. Server member EllDudeRocks then leaked the censored clip to the general public on YouTube and Reddit at either the late night of 29 July or the early morning of 30 July.[56] Shortly afterwards, Fiona leaked the Incest Texts to Reddit, crediting the leaks to "the trolls."[57] Fiona at one point asked Bella the full call, however, no evidence exists that Bella recorded the entirety of it (Bella claimed her phone would "record randomly").[9]
Bella was irritated by Fiona's leaking of the call clip which left Bella's voice intact and of the texts which Chris began to accuse Bella of leaking. When Bella mentioned this issue to Fiona, Fiona replied that she would claim to Chris that trolls had been behind the leak. Bella in turn replied that she would set up a group chat in order to setup the troll narrative.[58]
On 1 August, during Chris's arrest, Fiona also expressed hating Chris, seemingly now concluding that Chris fucked his mom by his own volition. She also expresses feeling regret for posting about her aforementioned fantasies about Chris, but decided to keep them up anyway for archival purposes.
This legit sucks now. I regret everything about ever writing this. I never knew Chris was going to turn out this way back then.
I'm absolutely pissed and disgusted at him now. I'm fucking traumatized. Help me.
I HATE CHRIS CHAN I HATE CHRIS CHAN
I HATE CHRIS CHAN I HATE CHRIS CHAN
I HATE CHRIS CHAN I HATE CHRIS CHAN this is how I currently feel now. What I written is outdated and will be up because that was who I was back then.
Additionally, Grant had stated that Fiona had had feelings of revulsion towards Bella due to how she treated both her and Chris. According to Grant, Fiona referred to Bella as a "Kacey-like Bitch", specifically due to her treatment of Chris.[59]
In the wake of chatlogs related to Bella being leaked in summer 2021, misinformation was spread by those speculating over the material, primarily Kiwi Farms users led by user Spooky Bones. As a result of Bella framing her, much of the misinformation surrounding Fiona involved portraying her as a victim of Bella or as a "fall girl" in Bella's supposed plans. One example is misinformation that Bella planned to record Chris and Fiona having sex at Everfree Northwest, then claim Fiona to be a minor to Chris. No proof that Bella had such a plan has been found. Rather, the rumor appears to have originated from a lie Bella had made to some members of the Knights of CWC on 30 July 2021, in which she falsely claimed to the group that Fiona was a minor and that Chris had sexual relations.[60] Bella later claimed to Fiona that this move was to prevent the "watch dogs" from trying to blast her.[61] It is unclear why Bella believed this tactic was necessary.
Throwaway Account
“
I'm Fiona, A.K.A "The Everfree Suitress" and I genuinely had a crush on Chris Chan. Ask me anything and I'll respond on my own time.
”
The first post Fiona made under the throwaway Reddit acount.[62]
A photo Fiona posted of herself promoting her throwaway account.
On 16 August 2021, two weeks after the Incest Call leaked, Fiona created a throwaway account on Reddit, under the username throw_away_weirdgirl.[63][64][65]
On this account, she posted more Chris-related leaks on the r/ChrisChanSonichu subreddit, such as the chats where Chris gave her dating advice. She also shared a few images that Chris seemingly gave to her, as well as the Facetime videos, the animation she made of Chris's promise, and the song he made for her. The most notable of these leaks was a photo Chris took showing a video about the "Top 10 Hottest Anime Moms Ever", a video created by the channel WatchMojo. In one of her comments, Fiona also reiterated that her crush on Chris was no more, writing: "Chris is still on my mind, but not as the crush I used to have, but more of a trauma/you need to be wary of this man way."
Following suggestions from other users to stop using the account, and to leave the Internet altogether, Fiona had done just that, and hasn't been heard from since.
Photos that Fiona leaked
Favor from Chris
“
Okay, THIS Part you may share online in efforts to reach her on my behalf: I still care about Fiona and her future. I had foreknown of my arrest, and the circumstances that would pin her emotions, especially in regard to the “Nasty Plot” Bella would have instigated, as a major casulty has been a great concern of mine. I’ve even warned her verbally, spoiler-free, of the ship between her and I likely not lasting long and there being a risk. I feel for her as well, and in my Goddess duties, during the jailtime of my Body, I have traveled to her state to visit, heal and help her from my astral manifested position. I, or through my Body, do wish to contact her, but I really should have written and memorized the phone numbers on my phone; Caden’s Number as well. Anything else that may happen between her and I, you all just leave that between her and I.
”
Chris[66]
After his arrest, Chris has shown a very favorable opinion towards Fiona, still referring to her by her pet name "Fifi", and even expressing on several occasions to want to reconnect with her, despite her cutting ties with him.
Chris stated in a 30 November 2021 jail letter that even when they can no longer communicate through regular means, he still cares about Fiona, and discussed how he foresaw the events that would "pin her emotions." He has also stated, although he hadn't recorded her phone number, that he was able to communicate with and "heal" her from jail by means of astral projection.[66] In a July 2022 letter, Chris also pointed out how he felt Fiona looked like a "youthful high school sophomore."[67][note 11]
Chris has also reflected his favor towards Fiona in the misinformation he spreads about both her and Bella - while he spreads negative rumors about Bella, he is much more defensive towards Fiona. According to a summary of an unreleased 13 June 2022 jail letter, Chris lied about Bella "cooking up a Pedophile scandal", whilst also claiming that Fiona was not involved with it.[68] A later letter also has Chris stating misinformation that Bella was trying to get him and Fiona in a relationship in order for her to label him as a "pedophile." This statement came from rumors that Bella was trying to coerce Chris into a relationship with Fiona at Everfree, combined with Bella telling Knights of CWC members that Fiona was a minor to protect her.[69] In the same letter, he also denied Fiona ever being attracted to him, instead claiming she was an "innocent bystander."[67]
After being released from Jail, Chris continued to repeat the misinformation about Fiona, such as in in The Chris Chan Interview from January 2024, where he again brought up the pedophile scandal misinformation. Chris has also used his attraction towards Fiona as a sort of shield against his affair with Barb, such as in a tweet from 22 January, Chris also claimed that the older girlfriend he had described to Null in July 2021 was "Fiona, at least in wishful thinking at the time."[70] This lie contradicts statements he had made to Null that his older girlfriend was over 50 (which was true of Barbara Chandler but not of Fiona).[71]

Notes
↑ Following a ban from the CWCki server, she came back under an alt, and expressed no remorse for what got her banned in the first place.
↑ After returning to the Internet for her AMA, she joked about returning from the "psych ward." This was based on people exaggerating her friend stating that she might be put in "inpatient psychiatric care."
↑ When she returned to the CWCki server under an alt account, she joked about how the people there "naturally missed her," noting people saying both positive and negative things about her.
↑ Claimed to Anaxis that she "promised" she wouldn't talk to Chris and claimed to be remorseful of her actions, but did so anyway under a sockpuppet and pseudonym.
↑ Swore that she'd stop sharing private DMs she had with mods to a trolling group she was in. She did this again the following day, only with a mod she had much more personal conversations with.
↑ Intended to tell Chris that "trolls" were behind the leaking of the Incest Call, a claim which Bella assisted in trying to perpetuate.
↑ Though she made her friend Grant aware that she was interacting with Chris, she never told him the full extent at which she would. Grant came to discover this himself when he tried to clear up his minimal role with Chris on Kiwi Farms. Conversely, Fiona shared these imminent details to Bella.
↑ Fiona has told Chris that she was 19 years old. Other evidence, which includes accounts from an IRL friend, points to her being only 18 when she interacted with him.
↑ Confirmed by former CWCki server admin Klop
↑ This accounts for the animation she created for Everfree Northwest, the earliest known interaction with Chris, occurring in July. Therefore, it is very likely she first interacted with Chris beforehand, likely around June when Chris announced his trip to Everfree.
↑ Chris was aware that Fiona wasn't a minor, despite the rather unsettling comment he made.
