“
Really, convincing Chris all this is happening [in real life] isn't as hard as you might expect. In fact, all it takes is one of the free photo editing sites and Audacity to make Cwcville come to life.
”
Joshua Wise.[1]
Red Forest is one of several audio files that Joshua Wise, the original Idea Guy, mixed together during fall 2017 in order to craft role-playing campaigns designed to infiltrate Chris's beliefs. It is the sole audio file leaked; the remaining are lost media.

“
But what really won Chris over was this first-time audio I did to make him think the Neptunia characters were in our world, and this was a battle between them and the mystery Russian Billionaire's forces.
”
Wise.[1]
To convince Chris of his claims of being able to travel to CWCville's dimension, Wise created audio files splicing together lines from various media sources such as the Hyperdimension Neptunia and Payday video game series. In one unreleased audio file, Wise even took audio of Chris, originating from a past interview, and edited it to make it seem like alt-dimension Chris was speaking to people fighting to save CWCville.[1] Chris, desperate for his fantasy world to be validated, fell for Wise's ruse.

PROTIP:
Audio file is poorly mixed and gets very loud at times. Use caution when listening.
“
What got me was the amount of editing mistakes I made, that he never caught onto(IE the guitar at the beginning abruptly cutting off).
”
Wise.[2]
Wise described the storyline that the Red Forest audio file belongs to:
Basically I'm from the Hyperdimension, and we're here hunting in the forests of Chernobyl for a magical artifact(STALKER reference). Me, Nepgear, IF, and Neptune were camping late at night when Akan(the main antagonist of Hardcore Henry, and the original Russian Chris mentioned. I found it funny everyone assumed Putin since Chris forgot to name Akan) sends his mercenaries to attack me and the girls. IF and Neptune get away, but me and Nepgear are wounded and barely make it out before getting attacked by a cloaker(the same enemies from Payday Chris keeps mentioning). Just as I'm beaten down, he turns to Nepgear when Sailor Jupiter saves us both. She flees right as the Medic dozer(another Payday enemy) comes in to save us both.[2]
The "events" portrayed in the Red Forest clip are briefly mentioned in Page 5 of Sonichu #13.
Another thing to note is that, while Wise himself was in the video, he didn't use any of his actual voice. Instead he uses several Voice lines from the video game Spec-Ops: The Line.
