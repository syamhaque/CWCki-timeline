Good Fan Art is a gallery of images created by Chris of "good" fan art (read: fan art that praises him or in the very least doesn't have Rosechu with a pickle) on CWCipedia on 10 August 2009.
Notable fanart includes some of Ivy's renditions of classic Sonichu characters, in addition to fanart from PandaHalo and Blanca. Interestingly, Chris chooses to include less flattering but not outright offensive art, such as Sonichu à la the 360 kid and a picture that crudely depicts Chris's demented mind. He includes these most likely because he can't read between the lines.
