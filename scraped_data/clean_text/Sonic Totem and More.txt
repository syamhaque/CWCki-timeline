Sonic Totem and More is a video Chris uploaded on 7 April 2017 at 4:16 pm. In a rare instance of self-awareness, Chris offers his Sonic Totem for sale. This is actually a surprisingly smart move for Chris, who stood to make a generous profit off an essentially worthless object, by listing it a ludicrous $1,500. Despite this, within four hours, at 8:09 pm, it was purchased.[1] On 21 April, the Totem buyer left positive feedback, concluding the sale and releasing the money to Chris after two weeks; on 22 April, the buyer posted pictures of the newly-received totem on 4chan's /v/ board.
Interestingly, Chris also vowed to re-establish his Captain's Log, promising to release weekly update videos, provided he made enough sales.
