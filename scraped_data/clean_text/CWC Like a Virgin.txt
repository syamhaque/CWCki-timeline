Lyrics
[sung over a live version of Madonna's "Like a Virgin"]
I made it through the wilderness
I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was
Until I found you
I was beat incomplete
I'd been had, I was sad and blue
But you made me feel
Yeah, but you made me feel
Shiny and new
Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats
With your heart beat next to mine
Gonna give you all my love girl
My fear is fading fast
Been saving it all for you
Because only love can last
You're so fine and you're mine
Make me strong, yeah you make me bold
Oh your love thawed out
Yeah, your love thawed out
What was scared and cold
Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heart beat, next to mine
Ooohoooh oooh ooh
Ohh oh oh ohhhhhh
Oh oh oh ohhhhh
Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heart beat next to mine
Woahah ohhh oh ohhhhh
Woahah ohhh oh ohhhhh
Woahah ohhh oh ohhhhh
Feels so good inside
(Muffled from CWC wussing out from karaoke at this point)
And you touch me
When you hold me
Feel so strong inside
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN (Note: Chris doesn't sing this, but it's left at the end)
