Merlin's Deal with Chris

Sally Acorn Dream
2 February 2021
Morning.
I just woke up from a dream that ended up with me almost having sex with Sally Acorn; this body woke up feeling really sexually, ravenously, dazedly hungry.
Take from that what you will.
I tell you all this, as I do feel among friends, here, as well. (edited)
Aside from Rosey, here, Magi-Chan, Chris, and the close others.
Thanks.

Vaughn, HBO Max, and Sockness
11-12 February 2021
Naught talks to Praetor about Larry Vaughn. Naught asks if there is a plan for Vaughn. Praetor considers providing Vaughn's number, though remarks that stirring the pot is silly. Chris instead says he will give Naught the number and that he is done with Vaughn.
Chris changes the subject to the weather, noting the snow and that he must shovel the walk. Chris also talks about the television shows Girls and Sex & the City which have been added to HBO Max. He claims that one of the male characters from Sex & the City was a simp and then married the woman he had simped over. Chris compares himself, saying he used to be a real simp. He exclaims, "Hormones get crazy as Woahly Fuck."
Later, Chris shifts to the Dimensional Merge and inquires about Sockness's neighborhood, as Chris considers it a hotspot for the Merge. Though he brings up Sockness, Chris couches it by prefacing with, "not to beat on a retarded, essentially dead, horse".

Hey @Praetor
this Vaughn guy posted some content you might wanna check out

[12 February, 01:00 PM]
Praetor
@ภคยﻮђՇ We've been watching the thread, we're not worried.
[posts a "Praetor LLC" logo]
Some dude made us this
Naught
noice, do you have a plan for Vaughn, there angle is gae af
Sonic
Classic
Praetor
Best we could do is toss his number out there. People's attention lasts for a short while though, nothing has really come of the leaks.
Naught
Should work for now
Praetor
We'll probably just leave stuff be. We wanna just keep selling, that's what we're here for. Fucking around and pot stirring is silly.
Naught
You can give me the number I'll say I got him from Vaughn
Chris (as Sonichu)
Hey, y’all.
Yeah, we’re long done with Danny Boy Vaughn, there.
Naught
Sup sonichu
Chris (as Sonichu)
I’ll text you Danny’s number shortly, Bis.
Naught
Even if you're don't with them, if like to know why they decided to do this
Ok, cool
Chris (as Sonichu)
He’s doing it, obviously, because of a combination of being scared of his safety, feeling lost after the disconnection, and further dissatisfaction from his present wife and kid.
Naught
nah, i mean in the first place
Chris (as Sonichu)
The dissatisfaction of his wife and kid, and boredom and want to terrorize someone.
And, yes, his want for massive attention. (edited)
Naught

Chris (as Sonichu)
Also, got some more snow yesterday; have some shoveling to do after the meditation hour today.
It’s white like Marnie the Bride in the wedding episode of HBO’s “GIRLS” we watched last night.
Naught
Girl's?
Sounds familiar

Prefer soaps.
This seems unnecessarily meanspirited...
I mean, you did fall for it.
For some reason I'm thinking of fake accents.

Chris (as Sonichu)
Yes.
It’s on HBO Max. (edited)
Also, got the snow shoveled; it was not thick, as I’ve foreseen it to be, so shoveling the walk was Easy, and driving the van out was a level 2 breeze.
The WCT
I bet its freezing over there.
31 degrees. lol
But then again, I was vacationing in Indiana not long ago and it was around that as well.
Chris (as Sonichu)
[quotes The WCT's "31 degrees. lol" remark]
Very close: 32 degrees, said the app.
The WCT
I haven't seen Snow in nearly a decade now.
The only part of Cali that may have it is Tahoe.
or in general, the Mountainous parts of the State.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Here’s a funny: this brain is a mix when remembering names and one out of a number of words in a set, yet it remembers Carrie, Miranda, Samantha and Charlotte as well.
The WCT
I like the name Charlotte.
never had a negative experience with somebody with that name.
Chris (as Sonichu)
“Sex & the City” also on HBO Max.
The WCT
I've heard about that show. (ever since it came out)
Chris (as Sonichu)
Charlotte was the one who got married (not sure if that was before or after Miranda did, though).
She married a guy who was like a simp (if Chris’ memory serves).
The WCT
What?
that's not very common IRL.
The girl marries her simp. lol
Chris (as Sonichu)
The dude started out as a simp, but he improved himself for himself.
The WCT
Character Development is a great thing to witness. (both fiction and non-fiction)
Chris (as Sonichu)
With Hanna, Marnie, Jessa and Shoshana, I feel they match the previous four in that same order of average Protag, the brains, the intelligent (slut type), and the partially flighty.
Chris (as Sonichu)
[quotes The WCT's "Character Development is a great thing to witness. (both fiction and non-fiction)" remark]
Agreed, 100%.
Shame a number of individuals don’t welcome Chris’ zen-like and meditative mind as much.
But there are Lots of open-minded and outside-the-box types in this universe’s Earth, so not disappointed.
The WCT
I feel like when a man gets to know the woman that he's simping for a lot more, he'll grow less worried about the dream of having a girlfriend and treating said woman more family like or maybe just grows to hate them. lol
Chris (as Sonichu)
True.
Kyle
Desperate Housewives has the best worst neighborhood ever, a lot of random deaths in the span of like 20 people.
Chris (as Sonichu)
[quotes The WCT's "I feel like when a man gets to know the woman that he's simping for a lot more, he'll grow less worried about the dream of having a girlfriend and treating said woman more family like or maybe just grows to hate them. lol" remark]
Chris used to be like that, a Real simp, but she was lost and still finding herself and the rest of us.
Kyle
People that destructive have more issues than just being inept.
The WCT
its easy to get drunk with love.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Hormones get crazy as Woahly Fuck.
Kyle
Please never use that excuse in court.
Or, ever.
Chris (as Sonichu)
ALOL

[8:04 pm]
Chris (as Sonichu)
Hey, @everyone, the reality shifts and paradigm fluctuations are becoming more consistent, constant, and tangibly obvious in this universe.
I am more than optimistic that I will be getting this body to Cwcville shortly enough.
@ภคยﻮђՇ, what’s your status, and what are your recent findings in your projections, meditations, and around you here?
Also, not to beat on a retarded, essentially dead, horse, but how is it looking in Sockness’ neighbourhood and the other dimensional and vortex hotspots in California?
Kyle
I got drunk and fell down the stairs, does that count?
Naught
He should be freezing soon.
Kyle
Unless he sets himself on fire during another magic video.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Being serious, here.
What does it feel and look like in the area?
The WCT
Cali?
Kyle
Tenderloin is a shithole.

It's freezing

Chris Calls The Watchmen Out

Chris Inquires About Anaxis's Ban
19 February 2021[1]
Chris (as Sonichu)
What did Lainchu do to be kicked out?
Kyle
I just found them unproductive at times.
If someone can be kept at a distance, as per their function, it would seem more apt to do so.
If you want something out, it'll be out, meantime, I'm personally none too sure.
Chris (as Sonichu)
At this point, especially with Lainchu's role, and compared to how often I type something on this server, being "unproductive at times" is not a valid reason.
Kyle
Sporadically useful, they're a poor researcher and aren't to sure on their own ethical obligations considering.
Chris (as Sonichu)
What were you having them research?
And surely they could research other things as well.
Kyle
General information on keeping abreast of whatever malevolent people were trying.
They were invariably a week behind anything I could prove and about a month behind on what I could hedge against.
Chris (as Sonichu)
They do work very hard on that research, and beyond the abuse upon Chris and I. There is a whole lot of effort that goes into waiting and observing input from others online of them being abused by some Hater or really bad individual.
Cut him a bit of slack, since I have been more focused locally and keeping private lately.
Plus, the freaking pandemic and shit.
Kyle
All the better, his obligation to editorial standards mean that either reporting directly to him, or clearing information for use allows better security.
Chris (as Sonichu)
At the moment, I continue to work on the recovery of this body and brain from the recent realization of lack of cuddling and such, and even further its healing and re-energizing. And I'm fixing to hit the hay for the night (regardless of witching hours affecting this body, which during the time before falling asleep, I meditate).
Please consider letting Lainchu back into the server, Kyle.
Thanks.
Kyle
Consider sure, as close as we can find advisable is a restricted role.
So, knowing what I know, say that.
Also: "Hi."

Is Chris gonna be in this call?
Cause I hope so.
Kyle 12:18 PM
Maybe, want me to ask?
The WCT 12:18 PM
Sure.
KND 12:48 PM
my bants are silent but deadly
Kyle 12:50 PM
I'd have preferred them not having an easy out.
KND 12:51 PM
i wasn't even speaking.
don't know how they thought i was stepping on your toes.
Kyle 12:51 PM
Bingo.
They're really bad liars.
KND 12:51 PM
mhm
Kyle 12:52 PM
They're going to deflect on literally anybody.
They already deflected it on Chris, but that worked because Chris insisted it was his idea.
Basic bitch sociopaths.
KND 12:52 PM
that was my extrapolation as well.
Klop 12:52 PM
trying to create infighting i assume
Kyle 12:54 PM
What a bunch of fucking morons.
The WCT 12:57 PM
Got any early predictions?

For the call?
The WCT 12:57 PM
Yup
KND 12:58 PM
use vpns if you are going to voice chat with praetor
Kyle 12:58 PM
They won't offer any info if asked, and will try to deflect smugness onto me even if someone else asks a question.
KND 12:58 PM
have a bad feeling
praetor is obviously going to record the call
but they might also be snatching voip ips
Anaxis (Lainchu) 01:00 PM
I think you may be overestimating them, although I guess caution is better than carelessness
Kyle 01:04 PM
Discord runs the VoIP through their own servers.
Anaxis (Lainchu) 01:05 PM
Right, I was gonna say, as long as you don't click any suspicious links if they post them, you should be fine
Kyle 01:11 PM
Fuck these losers.
Val 01:13 PM
agreed
KND 01:18 PM
discord admins have given people info before
Anaxis (Lainchu) 01:19 PM
But we're the admins of this server...
And that being said, we don't have each others' information just by virtue of being admins
KND 01:20 PM
i meant discord employees
Kyle 01:21 PM
Its a bad look for them though.
Anaxis (Lainchu) 01:21 PM
Uh...you really think Discord employees would just give away info of users to another user who asks for it?
Praetor aren't the FBI lol

Weird, yes. But I only buy a certain level of paranoia.

anyone record the voice chat?
i guess i missed whatever chat this was.
what chris is talking about in #general
chris is willing to tase himself for these people
you might be causing a rift
Kyle 01:15 AM
Yes.
MKR 01:15 AM
They're already trying to do that on their own

like dumbfuck

Uno...
KND 01:16 AM
sorry
Kyle 01:16 AM
Chris is used to it from me.
KND 01:16 AM
yes they are trying to cause a rift
so repair the hull bucket the water
i don't think we can push them out just yet
The WCT 01:17 AM
it feels like we're getting close to that point.
KND 01:17 AM
it would almost be infinitely better to eject them from this server instead of saying anything (edited)
Kyle 01:19 AM
I just want to dig them a hole before they leave, it's very possible that they're going to be found out for fraudulent practices someday.
The WCT 01:19 AM
oh they will be.
Kyle 01:19 AM
THEIR COMPANY DOESN'T EXIST
KND 01:19 AM
yeah, but you cant prove anything by calling people names
you can only cause chris to choose one side or the other
Kyle 01:19 AM
I did, their registration as an LLC in VA doesn't exist.
KND 01:20 AM
it'll take more fuck ups on praetors side, calm heads, and invisible action.
yeah that doesn't actually matter though
The WCT 01:20 AM
[Replying to "THEIR COMPANY DOESN'T EXIST"]
they aren't called a group of minor enablers with "edgy ween mechanisms" for nothing.
KND 01:20 AM
LLC is just limited liability, you don't need one to operate a business.
they'll wish they had one though if chris is able to sue them for more then they have..
Kyle 01:21 AM
But they aren't registered in any state records I've found.
If APS is an option...
KND 01:22 AM
you don't have to register a business.
as long as you are paying taxes

don't you have a server to janny?

okay i agree in virginia you do have to register it with virginia tax.

Wake up @ภคยﻮђՇ we got a situation here.

according to this we could bring down virginia tax on them
or anyone could for that matter.

They probably still file as dependents idk if they would think about that 😅
The WCT 01:30 AM
sup peachy.
Kyle 01:30 AM
I was thinking about the Etsy angle.
There is no way there are 300 sales.
KND 01:30 AM
i almost bought one
Kyle 01:30 AM
Because that counts...
KND 01:32 AM
can i delete the comment about their entity expiring? @Nova
that would be tipping our hand.
Kyle 01:33 AM
Let them waste some money, it would be admitting guilt.
Do what you want.
KND 01:33 AM
chris updated his comment
Kyle 01:36 AM
The Etsy should be reviewed by staff.
KND 01:36 AM
i don't think etsy will review it
Kyle 01:36 AM
I doubt the 300.
KND 01:37 AM
etsy will protect their business foremost

yeah, I wish I got it but i'm a little too egotistical.
Kyle 03:50 AM
Right.
The WCT 03:51 AM
You also probably made the most sense of every possible candidate. (mostly because you're sane)
Kyle 03:52 AM
Maybe in 30 so years, by your own estimation you'll be fit?

He left?
Probably pissed at what cwc said
The WCT 03:54 AM
sad, but yes he did.
MKR 03:54 AM
I am too, but I wont leave
Lainchu should tho
Anaxis (Lainchu) 03:55 AM
And how do you figure that?
Kyle 03:55 AM
Good timing there.
Go ahead, Kat.
The WCT 03:56 AM
like Nova said, "All that matters is Chris".
we can debate all we want about what went down tonight but we got to move on, with or without Naught.
Peachy 03:57 AM
;-;
MKR 03:58 AM
I guess that makes Nova and I top dogs here
The WCT 03:58 AM
he's definitely lurking in the Shadows like always but I'm sure he'd want us to continue the mission.
[Replying to "I guess that makes Nova and I top dogs here"]
technically, Nova is the Sole owner of this server.
Kyle 03:59 AM
Megs is the provisional XO.
MKR 03:59 AM
XOXO
I'm the tits of the operation >:D
Kyle 04:00 AM
That too.
The WCT 04:00 AM
No Coups please.
he'll be back one day.
[GIF of an anime girl with green visual effects rushing past the screen.]
Kyle 04:03 AM
Obviously, I'd just like to know where everyone stands.
The WCT 04:03 AM
wdym?
in regards to Chris?
MKR 04:03 AM
You know where I stand
Kyle 04:04 AM
Paedovan has a lot of suspicious influence on things.
The WCT 04:04 AM
Protect Chris at all costs.
[1 yay[11] reaction]
MKR 04:05 AM
@Lainchu
how do you feel about paedovan?
The WCT 04:05 AM
he maybe slow in the mind, but he's our friend. And we should never abandon our friend.
Anaxis (Lainchu) 04:05 AM
[Replying to "@Lainchu how do you feel about paedovan?"]
What, now you want my opinion?
MKR 04:05 AM
Don't be a cunt about it. I was asking your opinion, yes.
Kyle 04:06 AM
It would be nice to know where your opinions lie.
Anaxis (Lainchu) 04:06 AM
Well they're a problem obviously, but I don't know if our current methods of dealing with them have been super effective thus far
MKR 04:07 AM
How would you deal with them?
Anaxis (Lainchu) 04:08 AM
I'd leave them be for now. Let Vaughn keep leaking information, let public opinion turn against them. That way, when they inevitably fall, Chris hopefully won't blame us for being so aggressive towards them.
Kyle 04:09 AM
Chris generally doesn't operate like that, we need something.
Anaxis (Lainchu) 04:09 AM
All I know is that the current method of dealing with Praetor is only emboldening them and turning Chris against us
Kyle 04:10 AM
Sooner is better, God knows they might try and get Chris as an "investor" when their ponzi scheme goes tits up.
Paedovan was already as emboldened as they could be when they decided to be the next Idea Guys.
The WCT 04:12 AM
My question is: Will we need Josh to help us out or nah? (edited)
MKR 04:12 AM
He doesn't seem all that interested rn
Probably busy with irl stuff
The WCT 04:12 AM
he's too busy trying to keep the Farms lights on.
Peachy 04:13 AM
[Replying to "Obviously, I'd just like to know where everyone stands."]
I don’t want to distract from this conversation but I just wanted to say where I stand. I’ve been a little absent lately but I’m still dedicated to helping when I’m needed. I want to protect Cwc

Regarding Praetor, options?
Peachy 04:15 AM
I am really not sure what’s best. All I know is that I have info on them if things go really poorly and if it is needed (edited)
The WCT 04:15 AM
I'd say its going down the shitter right now. lol
MKR 04:16 AM
Yup
Kyle 04:16 AM
Sometimes that's all we need, I've been looking far too legit for them.
Peachy 04:17 AM
Just @ me or dm me if you want the info 😰
KND 04:37 AM
does chris even give a shit if people start dumping on praetor?
he does when we do it
but, public opinion of praetor is already pretty low
and chris doesn't seem to be phased.
Kyle 04:38 AM
Usual.
Anaxis (Lainchu) 04:38 AM
I think it's less about what outsiders think and more about what we think
Because Chris wants all of us to be friends
Kyle 04:39 AM
Praetor will fuck Chris over.
KND 04:40 AM
only guessing but i think chris only likes praetor cause caden is in virginia.
ive been saying it this entire time, its part of chris's love quest
get friends to meet girls
The WCT 04:41 AM
Its all a C.O.P.E.
Kyle 04:41 AM
Part of it.
Almost all of it.
The Watchmen Plot to Dismantle Praetor

NOTE: Chris was not directly involved in this conversation.
KND 04:41 AM
what if we got chris a friend in virginia?
The WCT 04:42 AM
[Replying to "get friends to meet girls"]
yup.
KND 04:42 AM
id turn chris into a pothead, hes probably not that bad to hang out with.
wrong side of the states though
id take chris to bars
oh but barb might get second hand covid.
The WCT 04:43 AM
oh no! he's killing Grandma!
KND 04:43 AM
what if we get chris to become afraid of covid...
then he might not fuck about with these punk asses
The WCT 04:43 AM
hmmmm, interesting.
Kyle 04:43 AM
Chris is very literal, and they've already got a hand in the lore.
KND 04:44 AM
everyone in the lore comes and goes.
The WCT 04:44 AM
just like life.
KND 04:44 AM
besides the originals
annirenee looks hot
Peachy 04:45 AM
Sub to her Onlyfans cx
KND 04:45 AM
not that hot
The WCT 04:45 AM
[Replying to "annirenee looks hot"]
She's cute.
but not hot.
Kyle 04:46 AM
6/10?
The WCT 04:46 AM
no. lol
She's an 8.
KND 04:46 AM
7.1
that smile isn't perfect.
The WCT 04:46 AM
too bad she's another E-Girl.
(she recently turned 18 in October)
Kyle 04:47 AM
She the lesbo in the jacket?
KND 04:47 AM
which one
The WCT 04:47 AM
[Replying to "She the lesbo in the jacket?"]
[Cropped image of Praetor with Chris, showing only Anni Renee.]
KND 04:48 AM
maybe we could start a rift in their ranks
ask the females what they think about praetor trying to zap chris
Kyle 04:49 AM
That ™️ is a fake, soooo...
The WCT 04:49 AM
maybe fake a compromise?
KND 04:49 AM
use the females for info
Peachy 04:50 AM
The tag on the girl in the flannel is the wrong person. Keep that in mind
The WCT 04:50 AM
I'll see if I can hit up Anni if possible. I don't know if she'd be interested in discussing Chris. lol
Kyle 04:50 AM
We need an in to the other people, @KND or @Neko Onyx (Kat) Make a fake insta to DM them.
KND 04:50 AM
nope i can't do social media.
Kyle 04:50 AM
[Replying to "I'll see if I can hit up Anni if possible. I don't know if she'd be interested in discussing Chris. lol"]
Oh you...
KND 04:50 AM
have no personality online.
Peachy 04:51 AM
I’ve tried to get in touch with her. I haven’t had any luck
The WCT 04:51 AM
[Replying to "Oh you..."]
relax, I'm not going to make the same mistakes again.

The WCT 04:51 AM
[Replying to "I’ve tried to get in touch with her. I haven’t had any luck"]
what did you try doing?
Peachy 04:52 AM
Instagram on multiple accounts. I tried the day we learned about Praetor and weeks after. Nothing each time
Oh yeah I also messaged her on TikTok. Nothing there
The WCT 04:52 AM
maybe she's not the kind of person who'd respond to dudes.
Kyle 04:52 AM
@Neko Onyx (Kat) Try some simping, IDK, maybe you have a way with desperate fuggos.
Peachy 04:53 AM
I think she replies to men more tbh
The WCT 04:53 AM
[Replying to "@Neko Onyx (Kat) Try some simping, IDK, maybe you have a way with desperate fuggos."]
oh you...
Peachy 04:53 AM
She has some videos of her messaging boys on Insta found on her TikTok
The WCT 04:53 AM
I don't want to get cocky yet, but what if my simping did end up resulting in CWC being saved?
(I can only dream)
Kyle 04:54 AM
Exactly what I thought.
Peachy 04:54 AM
That might be an expensive endeavor cx
The WCT 04:54 AM
honestly, that would make me the worst kind of hero ever possible.
it'd be funny though. lol
Peachy 04:54 AM
People love antiheroes
Kyle 04:55 AM
We need an outcome.
The WCT 04:55 AM
hey, I got an idea.
Since Chris and I both follow her on Twitter, maybe I could try getting Chris to hit me up with her.
And if you guys have any questions for her, maybe provide them to me.
KND 04:56 AM
honestly you shouldn't narrow your focus too heavily.
im sure praetor has invited chris to a separate discord.
sure would be nice to get in there.
then you have access to all their females
Peachy 04:56 AM
Im not sure. Caden always says he’s a “Discord newbie.”
The WCT 04:56 AM
we're going to need a mole then.
The WCT 04:57 AM
[Replying to "Im not sure. Caden always says he’s a “Discord newbie.”"]
I think he's lying.
Kyle 04:57 AM
Damn, I'd rather have hit on the marginally less fugly one.
Peachy 04:57 AM
I can try to get info out of Owen. I’ve had dms with him before
KND 04:58 AM
ok
MKR 04:58 AM
Sounds good
KND 04:58 AM
lets say caden hasn't got a separate discord...
what if
we
ban him from here.
that would force him to create one
then we could get a hold of it.
and then we'd have access to all of cadens friends
The WCT 04:59 AM

sup.
You wanna talk man? @Deleted User
About?
The WCT
There's talk in this server about me potentially replacing Anaxis as Lainchu.
Naught
Seems like a natural progression
The WCT
CatLoPez says he doesn't want to do it, and other than you, I think people in here think I might be the next best thing.
Nova, MKR, I, and maybe you if you're interested are going to have an emergency VC meeting at 5 PM Pacific tomorrow night. (edited)
Naught
