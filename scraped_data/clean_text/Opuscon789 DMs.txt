================================================================================

Delusion disclosure: This article or section takes place during Chris's phase of role-playing as Sonichu. He may refer to his Christine Chandler personality and physical body in the third person by using terms such as "mama".
This page contains DMs between Chris and Opuscon789. On 27 November 2020, Chris DM'd Opuscon over Discord on the subject of Opuscon's fanfic, SNT Vs Sonichu. Hours later, Chris again sent DMs bragging about his modifications in the Sonic World video game. Opuscon leaked the DMs onto Kiwi Farms.
Naught warned Chris about the leak occurring, to which Chris claimed he was not surprised.[1]

SNT Vs Sonichu
27 November 2020[2]
Chris (as Sonichu)
Hey, dude.
Opuscon789
can I help you
Chris (as Sonichu)
For now, just wanted to say that we personally have enjoyed the fanfics you wrote.
Opuscon789
who is this?
Chris (as Sonichu)
Chris Chan
Opuscon789
well thank you Chris
Chris (as Sonichu)
I mean, you really went beyond the meta distance in your chronicling of SNT Vs Sonichu, even though you were talking of Courtney and the others of 1218 (this dimension) and SNT of our C-197, you picked up on a different dimension's Chris Chan and crew.
For now, just want to tell you personally, good job.
Opuscon789
Yeah, the point of writing these is to sort of challenge yourself at what you can do as a writer but also make sure that your audience can enjoy what you create and at the same time trying to figure out what your audience wants to see
How much have you read?
Chris (as Sonichu)
At the moment, I listened to Courtney read the first half of the first story in her birthday stream, and then personally read the rest of the story. And I am reading the sequel; at chapter 3 of it with the kangaroo election in that twisted alt-dimension.
Let me come a bit clean, because I'm certain you've read or at least heard of what's been typed on Twitter, personally. This is the body of Chris Chan you are talking with, but the soul, since she and I had body-swapped over seven months ago, is I, Sonichu Prime of C-197.
I didn't want to scare you off initially.
Still, the impression of Mama Christine from a number of others in their fanfics doesn't surprise me. But, yeah, Mama is actually for universal health care, for one, and she is cool with the second amendment.
Just a couple of notes, to say the least of her.
I'm certain you meant it with respect in one way, and I am not going to make you change anything in the fanfics.
It's all good, and you and we can be friends, at least on here, if you want.
Opuscon789
I appreciate your respect but I'm sorry, I can't bring myself to take your friend request as of right now.
But I will allow you to contact me at anytime if that is fair
Chris (as Sonichu)
I understand. We are here should you wish to talk as well. It is still very good to get in contact with you, at least.
Check Mama's YouTube if you haven't already; there's a video from last February where she, herself, read the rest of SNT Vs Sonichu. Give it a listen; her commentary is worth it.
Opuscon789
I am already aware of the video
And thank you, that fan fic is already done and I have already moved on to the third installment but I appreciate your commentary

Chris (as Sonichu)
Do you play Sonic World? There's a mod of me available now, and I personally updated its Bio and with my voice
Opuscon789
No I don't play a lot of games to be honest
Chris (as Sonichu)
That's a shame; the game and the Mod are really good; the Mod even better now.
