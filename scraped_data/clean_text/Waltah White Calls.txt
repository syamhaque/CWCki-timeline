On 27 March 2025, Walt told Chris to "grow up" in a rude reply on Bluesky, prompting Chris to leave a reply and block his account:
Also, considering how sensitive I am to the energies and timelines, and this should be clear with y'all who are #AuthenticallyWoke: if it vibes Light Powered and Good, then it is beneficial for this Timeline and all of You. You do best to Vibe with that. ⚡️💙⚡️
Good vibes? Are you serious right now? Have you looked back on your life at all? Your life is full of your manipulating your parents, yelling at strangers on the internet. You live a life full of lies you pass off as "alternate time lines" grow up
You do not know everything I have done off the internet. Your comment is based solely on only a handful of videos and opinions from others. You have no right to speak like that, because you do not know me personally.[1]
On 29 March 2025, Walt began sending multiple $2 donations to Chris while he was live.[2] Most of them are asking Chris to arrange a time for calling the donor's personal phone number. It appeared that his attempts were futile, but he did not give up after this stream.
29 March 2025 interactions
Note: Some of the donation messages have been cut off and unfinishable due to being too long.
waltahwhitesfreemovies donated $2!: "So I'm currently watching this stream from dimensions prr gg1 4876 and all my predictions say it Wil merge with both 1218 and c197"
Chris: "Hm, I feel like that is a demonic statement so therefore you are false."
waltahwhitesfreemovies donated $2!: "According to my calculations it will happen and it isn't false. I'm also not a demon."
Chris: "Well, I disagree with you. And I do not have to acknowledge your comments anymore about that. I have answered your question."
waltahwhitesfreemovies donated $2!: "May I call you on a phone number lol? If so wich nunber?"
Chris: "Mm. Uh, no, I will not, uh, take pho- unsolicited phone calls, so you are not going to get my number."

waltahwhitesfreemovies donated $2!: "So will a call at 7 am est with prr gg1 4876 work for you?"
Chris: "Maybe. We'll see."

Chris: "Uh, 'kay. Yeah, okay. Yesh."
Walt's call with cwc! 5/17/25
Walt's call with cwc! 5/17/25 is a video uploaded to waltah white's free movies's YouTube channel on 17 May 2025. This call was the one that abruptly interrupted Chris's stream that same day. The video was incorrectly titled to be in February, before later being corrected. On that day, Chris livestreamed once again, and Walt appeared with more $2 donations, continuing his attempt of calling Chris.[3] Chris eventually caved in, and took a break from the stream for about 20 minutes to talk to Walt. Once Chris returned, he brushed the call off as just being asked questions about the Dimensional Merge and then resumed his stream as normal. Walt later posted the call on Kiwi Farms on 18 May.[4]
17 May 2025 interactions
waltahwhitesfreemovies donated $2!: "It's me again chris! Still waiting for a call at 706 804 2884! It's up all night long"
Chris: "Oh yes, I remember you from last time. Mm. Mm. You know what? [pauses game] Uh, let me get- let me see if I can find that right quick, one moment. On the one detail, I tried remembering the, uh, phone number but I could not, uh, find it, uh... The Super Chat just came up but yet it's not coming up on here, on the sidebar, dagnabbit. What is up with this? [stress sigh] Okay, well, I'll just, uh, note it's about half hour since I started. About a half hour since I started, when that came up. [resumes game]"
waltahwhitesfreemovies donated $2!: "It's 706 804 2884, please call me as soon as you can"
Chris: "Yeah, well, I'm not going to call you during the livestream."
waltahwhitesfreemovies donated $2!: "And why not?"
Chris: "Eh, "why not?", I don't know if you're talking about the, uh, Swimsh thing. I don't- I think you're somebody- you're not the guy that wanted me to call them, just making sure..."
waltahwhitesfreemovies donated $2!: "I am the guy who wanted a call. It's 706 804 2884"
Chris: "Okay, you know what? There you go. Alright? I got the sc- I just screencap- I just took the picture of the phone number. I will call you later, so there. Okay."
waltahwhitesfreemovies donated $2!: "I'll be up all night. But I'd prefer you vall during stream. In fact I'll donate 50 bucks if you vall on stream"
Chris: "Really, you're gonna bug me for that now... Fine, maybe I'll consider that, okay? But it's like I would have to put the stream on pause at that point. "Yeah. Yeah, I'm going to call you just so I can be like either amazed, be like "Wow, you finally called me!" or otherwise just a bunch of "Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, hate you!" and all that shit." That's to be confirmed on the next [montel?]."
waltahwhitesfreemovies donated $2!: "It's ok, I'll be up all night. If you don't want to puase the stream. I'm not going cuss you out at all man. That's just silly, I just want to talk. Again it's 706 804 2884"
Chris: "Uh, 'kay. I see. Okay, well, I'll keep that in mind. I apologize for my earlier outburst earlier but I have encountered people like that before. I'm just pointing it out, and I'm aware of it."
waltahwhitesfreemovies donated $2!: "So the call is still good for after the stream. But the 50 bucks for a call rn is still available if you want the 50 bucks"
Chris: "I see. Okay. Maybe when I get a break."
waltahwhitesfreemovies donated $2!: "How about after this level?"
Chris: "Maybe, yesh, we'll see. Depending how I feel..."
waltahwhitesfreemovies donated $2!: "End of the level. Up for a call?"
Chris: "Yeah, I get to the next save point, alright? I'll put the stream on pause. Get through these cutscenes! Okay... uh, it's the boss. Mkay, I'll pause. [reads a meme donation silently, then replies] Hm. Hm. That's one for you to figure out, isn't it? Okay, well, I'll be back in a little bit."
[takes off headphones and pauses the stream for about 20 minutes]
Chris: "Hey everybody, sorry for the wait there, but, uh... Anyway so, I called- I called the gentlemen and we had a pleasant conversation. But yeah, just I can actually- he asked me a few questions about the merge, which I will be more than happy to answer right now for y'all's reference, so... The cars of pixels cars, so, Pixar cars: They are sentient cars who live in an alternate dimension as opposed to the 1218 and C-197 halves of the Earth. And, uh, let me see... The Pikmin, they live in this universe, in this timeline, they live on another planet. And let's see, oh, so, regards to Gotham City, that will merge into where it is originally meant to be. Look it up in like, the maps that's been chronicled like within the comic books, TV shows, or whatever. That part of Jersey, that's where it's going to be. It's going to fade in and, uh, just nope. Nobody's gonna die unless they actually destined to die, you know, or like, you know, they committed so much, uh, toxicity and badness from, you know, where they reside on 1218 half or C-197 half, I mentioned this before. And Spider-Man, he is living in New York presently as opposed to previous times when he had- when he was in Jersey, it's like- it's like a little back and forth going on. And after all, he's a spider-flingin' superhero... web-slinging superhero. Anyway, so that's pretty much, uh, the, uh, details there. So without further ado, let's, uh, resume this game and do this boss battle."

Transcript
Walt: Hey!
Chris: Hey man, ab- how're you doin'?
Walt: I'm doin' great, man. How are you?
Chris: I'm doing alright. Mm.
Walt: I see you're- uh... Pardon?
Chris: Yep. Uh, say again?
Walt: Oh no, no, no, no. You were about to say something, you first.
Chris: Nuh, just, uh, just making sure you're the guy I was supposed to call. The guy, that just, uh-
Walt: Yep, yep, yep, that's me. That- that- that's waltah white's free movies.
Chris: Walter White's free movie, yup. I like that you ha-
Walt: Yeah, so- Well, no, no, no. Is it alright if I ask you a few questions before you go?
Chris: Um, alright. Alright, I'll give you- alright, but how are you doing?
Walt: I'm actually doing pretty fine. How are you?
Chris: I'm doing good. Alright, so, hit me with your questions.
Walt: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, um, I was wonderin', uh, since- are the Pixar cars gonna be anywhere in the, uh, Dimensional Merge?
Chris: Mm. Mm. The Pi- the, uh, cars that are- that are sentient like that, they live in an alternate dimension. They are not on the C-197 half of the Earth.
Walt: Okay. Alright, alright. Um. Also, I, uh, have a question. What about Pikmin? They in Cwcville?
Chris: Mm. The Pikmin... they live on another planet, so-
Walt: Okay. Alright, alright. So they're in their universe, they just don't live at Cwcville.
Chris: They're- they're- they're elsewhere- they're elsewhere in this universe, in this timeline.
Walt: Okay. Alright, alright. That's- that's pretty cool. Um, uh, also, another thing, you said that, uh, Gotham City was gonna replace all of New Jersey... in the merge?
Chris: Uh, Gotham City is one part of New Jersey, New Jersey is part of, eh, of multiple cities in it, so it's just, uh, Gotham City is one city in New Jersey.
Walt: Okay, alright. Um, so, uh, where in New Jersey would that be? Like northern New Jersey or southern New Jersey?
Chris: Mm. Well, if you look up any, uh, Batman comic book or, uh, anything that was chronicled online with like, you know, specific locations of where Gotham City is... in America, in New Jersey, there's your pinpoint right there.
Walt: Alright, alright. I was- I was just wonderin', cuz I heard that, I've got a lot of friends in New Jersey, and I didn't want them to be, uh, completely crushed by the merge.
Chris: Mm. No, essentially it'd be like a fade-in when the, uh, when the thi- when the place is actually transitioned in. So, if the people will still be- the people will still be around, the ones that, uh, surviving the merge. It's just, uh, not everybody, especially like, uh, those that have- that have been proven bad or toxic and- in the, um, eyes of not only the gods and goddesses-
Walt: Okay.
Chris: but also, just as they're, uh, destined to be.
Walt: Alright, alright. Sweet. Um, also, about railroads in Cwcville, does Cwcville have its own railroad or does it get, um, served by different railroads?
Chris: Hmm. Well, there is a- there is, uh, there is like a metro that goes from, uh, Cwcville to nearby Sydney.
Walt: Okay. Alright. Alright, um.
Chris: Something metro... But mainly- it mainly exists in the, uh, northeast part of the city.
Walt: Alright, and you said previously that Spider-Man's gonna be in New York City, correct?
Chris: Oh yeah, he's been living in New York City the entire time with, uh, Dr. Strange and all of them.
Walt: Alright, um... So i- so in theory, could he go over to Jersey and see Gotham City, since New York's right on the New Jersey border?
Chris: Mm, yes.
Walt: Alright. And you said Equestria's gonna be Maryland, right?
Chris: Uh, the portal to Equestria is in Maryland.
Walt: Okay.
Chris: That's where, uh, Canterlot High School is.
Walt: Alright, I was- I was- I was wonderin'.
Chris: [mic craps out] that, uh, island that had the portal that went straight into, uh, Canterlot.
Walt: Alright, uh... and I got like, two or three more questions if that's alright.
Chris: Alright.
Walt: Uh, I saw in your Bluesky a while ago, that your, uh, PO box is, um, not- is no longer your PO box, and to send stuff to 14 Branchland.
Chris: Yeah.
Walt: Are you still living there?
Chris: Mm. Well, I'm not living- I'm not living in, uh, Branchland. I'm not living in Ruckersville right now...
Walt: Okay.
Chris: But, uh, but mail is to be sent to that address until, uh, whenever-
Walt: Alright, so you like, go there like on a monthly basis and pick stuff up?
Chris: Or just, uh, when I feel like it.
Walt: Alright, alright. Sweet. Um...
Chris: Yeah, but- but likely maybe we'll set up- we may- we may consider, uh, opening up my new address at some point, or we'll open up a new PO box. But that's still to be confirmed.
Walt: Okay, um, and my last question: Who is Flutter and why are you going to Finland?
Chris: That remains absolutely with no comment!
Walt: Well, then you're not getting your fifty bucks then.
Chris: Mm. I-
Walt: I'll donate fifty bucks- Hey, my lips are sealed, this is not being published anywhere, I'll give you fifty bucks if you tell me who Flutter is and why you're going to Finland.
Chris: Heh heh. Mm. Well, she is a friend of mine, I will give you that.
Walt: Alright, she's a friend of yours. Alright.
Chris: And... I am not going to Finland! That is somebody else you're mistaking-
Walt: You're not go- oh, that- that's somebody else, okay. Cuz I've- I've seen quite a lot of photos of you in Finland, I know there was-
Chris: Yeah, (?)-
Walt: I think last year, you were spotted in Dallas airport. Um.
Chris: Mm. I was not in Dallas airport at that time.
Walt: So that's not you either. You're not going to Fin- Finland. Uh, does Flutter have a name other than Flutter?
Chris: Mm. Yes, but that is remaining off the record, I am absolutely not doxing her nor anybody.
Walt: Well, like I say, this- I- I- I literally do not have any way to get this call on the Internet, Chris. Like, uh, your secret's safe with me.
Chris: Mm. I just, uh, feel better no- leaving that discrete and not said to anybody.
Walt: Alright, well, I won't give you the fifty bucks since, uh, you didn't tell me who Flutter was. But I'll still give you twenty, since you picked up the phone.
Chris: Okay, yes. That will be- that will work out just fine.
Walt: Yep, and you are not- you- you've not been to Finland, right?
Chris: I have not been to Finland.
Walt: Cuz like, there's a [sic] undeniable amount of proof of you being in Finland.
Chris: Well, I have not.
Walt: Uh, are you sure about that? I mean, you can go on the Reddit and see it, it's pretty public information.
Chris: Mm. I am aware of the Reddit.
Walt: Yeah, also, the Dlingo thing, you're also doing Finnish in Dolingo. So why would you be taking Finnish if you're not going there?
Chris: Mm. I have not been using Duolingo!
Walt: Alright. Is Flutter Finnish?
Chris: Yeah, obviously looking at, uh, somebody else. Or otherwise, I had used Duolingo, but it was mainly for the purposes of math.
Walt: Uh, I don't use that stuff, but I'm pretty sure you can't use math on Duolingo, Chris.
Chris: Mm. Look on Duolingo dot- ook on Duolingo, there is math on the app.
Walt: Alright, I'll- I'll- I'll- I'll do so when I get off the call. Um...
Chris: Yeah.
Walt: So she's not Finnish?
Chris: Yes.
Walt: She American?
Chris: Yes.
Walt: Okay, she's American. She from Virginia?
Chris: Mm. She came from another state.
Walt: Uhh, Northeast, Southeast, Midwest?
Chris: Mm. North.
Walt: Up North. So like, New York, Boston, Philly?
Chris: Mm, somewhere around there.
Walt: Okay, alright. Uh, and- and again, like I have no- no reason to contact- I have no inform- no way to get this call off of, uh, my computer here. So, I c- Last chance, man. Fifty bucks if you give me a name for Flutter. I will donate fifty bucks, uh, when you get back on.

Chris: Mm.
Walt: B?
Chris: That is not for me to say.
Walt: Look, Chris, my lips are sealed.
Chris: I have to be very careful in regards to the identities of those that I am associated with.
Walt: And I- and I understand that, however, you're talking to a random stranger on the Internet who is not even going to take a second chan- second thought about this afterwards, alright?
Chris: Mm.
Walt: I'm just gonna go back to playing my video games, or you'll go back to your stream, you're gonna have a fun time and the name's not gonna be leaked.
Chris: Mm. I am not going to be saying her name whatsoever. She shall remaining knowing online as Flutter.
Walt: Really, Chris? Really?
Chris: Yes.
Walt: I- Alr- I-
Chris: I'd rather keep it that way.
Walt: Alright.
Chris: For [her?] safety, and because I would feel remiss and... bad if I did.
Walt: Well, then, you're only getting the twenty bucks, Chris. And I'm t-hesitant to give you even that now.
Chris: Well, I'm sorry to give you that disappointment.
Walt: Well, you're not getting my money then. That's for sure.
Chris: Mm. Well, that's fine then.
Walt: Alright, last question: How's Barb and when is the last time you've talked to her?
Chris: Mm- Barbara's doing okay, um. Um, just essentially she calls me on occasion to, uh, check her bank balance since she doesn't have easy access to that at this point.

Chris: Yeah. Philly.
Walt: Oh man, I uh- I feel bad for her. Have you seen what's been going on in Kensington?
Chris: Mm.
Walt: You would-
Chris: [I should, um...?] Mm.
Walt: Like, you would not imagine the druggies that are going on in Kensington. Like, I can, uh, I can send you the link to the 24-hour live cam.
Chris: Mm.
Walt: They've got a- they've got a serious problem up there.
Chris: Yeah. Well, she's in a sacred city actually, as opposed to Kensington.

Chris: Mm. I don't- I don't have the, uh- I don't have that particular detail memorized at this point.
Walt: Okay. So, she... does live in Philly, right?
Chris: Mm. Yes.
Walt: Okay, cuz, uh, I mean, you've known her for what, about a year now?
Chris: Yeah, a bit over a year.
Walt: And- and you don't- you don't know what part of Philadelphia she lives in?
Chris: Mm. I know which part of Philadelphia she is going to university in.
Walt: Well, which part?
Chris: [crapped out audio] Mm. I'm not saying specifically because I don't wanna risk her being doxed.
Walt: Well, Chris, I'm not doxing anyone here. Like I say, I've- Die- I literally have no way of getting this computer- this call off the phone. I'm not very good with tech.
Chris: Mm. Still, just to be safe.
Walt: Alright.
Chris: I have my sense of morals, as you might be aware. And-
Walt: Well, Chris, you say that, you- you- you- you literally went to jail for doing things to Barb. I wouldn't call that very moral.
Chris: I have not done anything to Barbara whatsoever-
Walt: Then why were you sitting in jail for a year?
Chris: Uh, the accusations, and, uh, Bella doing a- doing all the storytelling and everything, and calling the police. Yeah. Blame it on Bella.
Walt: Uh, but they arrested you, which means that you had to have some level of evidence of this.
Chris: Evidence can be fabricated, as you are aware.
Walt: Uhhh, I mean, if you say so. However, uh, I beg to differ.
Chris: Mm. Anyway, the point, during my time with, uh, Bella, there was a bit of roleplaying going on.
Walt: Roleplaying?
Chris: Yeah.
Walt: You sure it wasn't anything other than roleplaying?
Chris: Cuz she was a bit messed up in the head like that.
Walt: Well, I wouldn't call 'having dementia' messed up in the head, Chris. Oh shoot, did I lose you?
Chris: But anyway, just- that detail- that detail, it was fabricated by her-
Walt: Okay, completely- So- so you're- so you're completely innocent?
Chris: [the main?] Yes, I am completely innocent.
Walt: Alright. Uh, c-cuz, uh, I mean, I watched your bodycam video, have you seen it yet? It's out on YouTube.
Chris: [stress sigh] I am quite aware of them-
Walt: I mean- I mean- I mean, even- even the criminal lawyer, uh, th- that- that legend of a man saw it. You- you watch him? The criminal lawyer, uh, Bruce something?
Chris: Mm. No, I am not aware of that guy.
Walt: Oh, he's- he's- he's pretty fun if you like law and stuff.
Chris: Mm. I see.
Walt: Yeah, he's- he's- he's pretty fun.
Chris: I see. Okay, that's cool-
Walt: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, um, so-
Chris: Okay, well-
Walt: uh... Well, one- one last q-question about Flutter, uh, f-f-'fore you go, Chris.
Chris: Mkay.
Walt: She- she- she live with you on the weekends or somethin'? Cuz like, uh, I know there's some couples that like, if one's far away, they come over on the weekends or whatnot.
Chris: Um... Yeah, I know, but it's like her v- her studies keep her busy, so it's like, um, it's like, uh, pretty much every few months or so.
Walt: Alright. And she's in Boston, right?
Chris: Mm- No, I said Philadelphia.
Walt: Okay, okay, okay, s-sorry. There's- there's so many cities on- in that little strip, I- I get them mixed up constantly.
Chris: Yeah-
Walt: Alright, well it's, uh, been nice talking to you, man. You have a good one.
Chris: Alright, you have a good night too, take care. Bye bye.
Walt: See you.
walts call with cwc 6/9/25
On 9 June 2025, Walt repeatedly called Chris. Chris grows annoyed at him, and says that he betrayed him (likely due to learning about him leaking their first call). After picking up the phone for a third time, Chris seemingly threatens to block his number. The calls would not be leaked until the video walts call with cwc 6/9/25 was uploaded to waltah white's free movies's YouTube channel on 15 June 2025.
