================================================================================

"CWC Trollin' More" (aka "Rollin' and Trollin' 2: Electric Boogaloo"), uploaded on 19 July 2009, is a video in which Chris confirms that he is indeed a jobless virgin with rage with autism and mocks all the trolls who he trolled into believe that his life was a ruse all along.
It was revealed in the Jack Thaddeus E-mails that Chris made this video in what he believed to be a clever attempt to stop Jack's cunning plans. (Jack "threatened" to use Chris's claims of full-time employment in the Rollin' and Trollin' video to get his monthly tugboat cut off, resulting in this retraction.) Needless to say, Jack's plans went on unabated.
Suspiciously, the video and audio are completely different tracks. Chris, being the lazy fucker that he is, recorded a video and didn't like it, but instead of re-recording it, he just dubbed his voice over it hoping no one would notice. As a result, the video is horrendously out of sync.
Chris deleted the video within about twelve hours of posting it.
