Chris in October.
October was the tenth month of 2023. The month saw Chris's full, true return to the Internet, marked by the uploading of a YouTube video. Following this, he would become much more active on social media, posting more videos on YouTube as well as messages on Twitter. Between these, he publicly proclaimed his status as The Messiah and took a more active approach to collaborating with Praetor to promote himself and the OfficialCWCmart. The month also saw Chris reveal the identity of the mysterious woman that he has been hanging out with in the past month, nicknaming her Flutter. Also during the month, Chris began using the Duolingo language app.
