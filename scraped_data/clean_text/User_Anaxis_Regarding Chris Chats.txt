Regarding Chris
This was a group chat created by former Watchman The WCT in order to interrogate Bella about the incest leaks. After attempting to get answers through DMs, WCT acquiesced to Bella's request of making a group chat so that she could explain herself properly (she might have been under the impression that Null would be in this chat, but this was not the case). Members of this chat besides WCT and Bella were The Fool, Silvia, Para, and myself (Anaxis).
Note that every attachment (image, audio, video) is broken due to the group chat having eventually been deleted. Bella also lies frequently within these chats to protect herself, which will be pointed out in each section's summary when applicable. Keep this in mind when trying to evaluate context.
The selected chats are from 30 July 2021 to 1 August 2021.
Bella's Initial Claims
30 July 2021
Summary: Upon joining this chat, WCT announces that its purpose is to give Bella a chance to tell her side of the story. Bella begins by reiterating things she had already told WCT, blaming "Avery Oswald" and "tenerymerc," claiming that they worked for Chris's ISP and were supposedly responsible for leaking the incest call. She also continually insists that we (the Knights) shouldn't be "supporting" Chris and should cut off contact. As we ask questions, Bella acts scared and disgusted over Chris's actions, claiming that she wants her anonymity preserved and that Chris was responsible for rape. She states that the call was supposedly 4 hours long, and that we should contact one of the people she named if we wanted to know more. The Fool points out the absurdity in Bella's claims about the people working for Chris's ISP, but she is adamant that this is the truth.
The latter person Bella refers to, ternarymerc, is actually the username of one of her Chess Club friends, while "Avery Oswald" is apparently the name of another student at her university. There is no evidence of their direct involvement in the incest call.

Anaxis 06:51 PM
[Replying to "Wdym “we”"]

Bella 06:51 PM
I never published anything
The WCT 06:51 PM
I've been hearing reports that the uncut call is 4 hours long. Does it exist?
Bella 06:51 PM
[Replying to "Well you were saying we shouldn't "support" Chris, so I'm saying that that's not really what the discussion is about"]
I’m making the discussion here
The Fool 06:51 PM

Silvia 06:52 PM

Bella 06:52 PM

Anaxis 06:52 PM
So you think one of them leaked the call?
Bella 06:52 PM
1000%
Silvia 06:53 PM
If you were in the call, and you heard this, why didn’t u say “no Chris I don’t think u should do this. You need to stop please”
Anaxis 06:53 PM
Who are they, exactly? What do you think motivated them?
Bella 06:53 PM
Uh i did
Silvia 06:53 PM
Ok. I didn’t hear the full call.
Bella 06:53 PM
I was the only one who said that
The Fool 06:54 PM
so about this Avery guy, did he tell you he works for Chris' ISP? because I don't believe that for a second and I'm just wondering if he or someone else lied to you
Bella 06:55 PM
Yeah he did (edited)
Idk and Idc if he’s lying (edited)
Silvia 06:55 PM
I have another question when available.
Bella 06:55 PM
He posted the text convo
Go ahead
About the Suitress
30 July 2021
Summary: I mention the Suitress's real name (Fiona) being stated in the call, and ask if Bella knows who that is. Bella claims that we already know Fiona, and that she (Bella) was trying to get Chris to date her instead. I post a picture of Fiona and ask if it's the person mentioned, but Bella ignores me in favor of answering a question of Silvia's. I reiterate my question, and Bella insists that they aren't the same person. She claims that Fiona was a minor and that Chris has had sexual relations online. After Bella continues to act scared over me speaking for the group, Silvia asks why she would try to get Chris and Fiona to date if the latter was a minor, and Bella claims that it wasn't being taken seriously since the two of them live across the country from each other, and that she had no idea Fiona was a minor until recently. Despite this, Fiona still wanted to date Chris.
I ask again if Bella is sure that Fiona isn't the same person as the Suitress, and Bella again says they aren't the same and asks why I'm asking her this. I clarify that the Suitress was known to have a history of obsessing over Chris and that was why I believed there was a link. After Para notes that Chris would rather fuck his mother than Fiona, Bella claims that she was trying very hard to get Chris to date her (before Bella supposedly learned Fiona was a minor). At the end of the conversation, Bella says that Fiona had leaked "some" and wanted to protect her identity.
These claims on Bella's part would later be disproven as lies: the Suitress was the same person as Fiona, and she was not a minor at the time, something Bella seemed to be perfectly aware of.
Regarding Chris
Anaxis 06:55 PM
Someone named Fiona was mentioned in the call. Can you tell us who that is?
Bella 06:56 PM
It’s a girl he mentioned, you would know her
We were trying to get him to date her instead
Anaxis 06:56 PM
[Screenshot of a post by the Suitress in the Official CWCki Server, reading "Like, this is me. You'd never guess who this person is obsessed with if you didn't know that was me" along with a picture of her.]
Silvia 06:56 PM
I’m not saying this to be rude. But why didn’t u come to us about this sooner?
Anaxis 06:56 PM
This girl?
Bella 06:57 PM
[Replying to "I’m not saying this to be rude. But why didn’t u come to us about this sooner?"]
Why would I tell u
It’s not ur business
Para 06:57 PM
is there a video of chris finger banging his mom
Bella 06:57 PM
It’s the laws and his moms
No but he does it constantly
And she says it’s hurts her
Para 06:57 PM
and did you guys coerce oh ok
Silvia 06:58 PM
[Replying to "Why would I tell u"]
That’s fair. Wasent trying to be rude once again.
Para 06:58 PM
okay
Bella 06:58 PM
It’s cool
The Fool 06:58 PM
some of us are still just a little blown away by all this lol
Anaxis 06:58 PM
Is Fiona the girl in the pic?
[Broken video attachment, likely one of the Suitress's videos imitating Classic Chris.]
Bella 06:58 PM
No
Silvia 06:58 PM
Yes I am flabbergasted
Anaxis 06:59 PM
She's someone else, then?
Bella 06:59 PM
What r u guys going to do (edited)
With him
The WCT 06:59 PM
we're not doing anything.
Bella 06:59 PM
Are u going to leave the server
Anaxis 06:59 PM
There's nothing we can do at the moment
We're just trying to get all of the facts
The WCT 06:59 PM
we are not in control of anything.
Bella 06:59 PM
But why do u need them
The WCT 06:59 PM
anything that happens to Chris now is beyond our control.
Bella 07:00 PM
I’ll tell u this
Silvia 07:00 PM
As a **** victim myself this dosent sit well. But I don’t think we can do anything. It’s the laws and it’s up to the police to decide.
Bella 07:00 PM
Fiona is a minor
And he has had sexual relations online
Anaxis 07:00 PM
[Replying to "But why do u need them"]
Because information around Chris is twisted often, so we just want to make sure we have the full picture on whatever this is
The WCT 07:00 PM
[Replying to "And he has had sexual relations online"]
how credible is this.
Bella 07:00 PM
Yeah but again it doesn’t matter he’s in jail
Silvia 07:00 PM
Fiona?
Bella 07:00 PM
I’ll tell u all of this to be nice but not ifs u guys act as a collective
Bella 07:01 PM
[Replying to "how credible is this."]
Very I have messages of it
I saw it first hand and he told me first hand
Anaxis 07:01 PM
We have no intention of taking any action
[1 ✅ reaction]
We just want to know what's up, is all
Bella 07:02 PM
Ok but this “we” stuff is weirding me out
Silvia 07:02 PM
I’m honestly just here bc me and Chris had common interests and I thought they were an actual chill person. (Mlp and sonic and kid stuff)
Anaxis 07:02 PM
Alright, I'll speak for myself then
The WCT 07:02 PM
[Replying to "Ok but this “we” stuff is weirding me out"]
you're going to be ok.
Bella 07:02 PM
[Replying to "I’m honestly just here bc me and Chris had common interests and I thought they were an actual chill person. (Mlp and sonic and kid stuff)"]
Same
Anaxis 07:02 PM
I have no intention of doing anything, I just want to know all the facts
Bella 07:03 PM
I’m fine, nobody’s after me
Even if they were nobody has any of my info
Ok I get it but I’m not lying to u but I’m not going to tell u all of their info
Fiona is someone u know and she’s a minor
Chris is aware
Silvia 07:03 PM
I have a question
Anaxis 07:03 PM
Someone we know?
Bella 07:03 PM
Yes
Silvia 07:04 PM
You said they were trying to get Chris to date Fiona instead. But why if their a minor
Bella 07:04 PM
Bc they’re not actually going to date
They live across the country
But we didn’t know they were until today either
Apperently Chris did
Silvia 07:05 PM
Ok. So it was a joke thing
Bella 07:05 PM
No
Nobody knew she was a minor, she’s still interested in dating
Silvia 07:05 PM
Ohhhhh.
Bella 07:05 PM
We’re not going to let that happen
Ofc
Silvia 07:05 PM
Yea pls no.
Bella 07:05 PM
But she wanted to meet up and sleep with him
Anaxis 07:05 PM
And you're sure that she's not the same girl as the one in the pic?
Silvia 07:05 PM
[Replying to "But she wanted to meet up and sleep with him"]
That’s not good.
Bella 07:06 PM
I said if she went I was going to follow here there and make sure Chris doesn’t touch her
Bella 07:06 PM
[Replying to "And you're sure that she's not the same girl as the one in the pic?"]
No but why is she also dating him
Anaxis 07:07 PM
[Replying to "No but why is she also dating him"]
The girl in the video is someone who is obsessed with Chris, in a sexual way, whose name is also believed to be Fiona
I thought there may have been a link there
Silvia 07:07 PM
I’m also asking bc I don’t know too much on praetor or anything of that nature. I just tend to be friends with odd folks. Me being odd myself
Para 07:07 PM
why didnt chris fuck that girl instead
so dumb
Bella 07:08 PM
ikr
we kept trying to say hey shes into u
he said the psychic force stopped him
Anaxis 07:08 PM
I mean, would've still been bad
Bella 07:08 PM
like the taroot cards
Anaxis 07:09 PM
Since she turned out to be a minor
The Fool 07:09 PM

Bella 07:09 PM

Silvia 07:09 PM

"BDSM Stuff"
30 July 2021
Summary: Bella makes the claim that Chris and Barb did what she calls "bdsm stuff," stating that Chris wouldn't feed Barb unless she sucked his dick, and that he inserted sex toys inside her despite how much pain sex allegedly caused her. The rest of us react in horror and disgust, and Bella states that the two of them had essentially groomed each other. She asks how Null feels about this, and states that we're free to tell him what she told us, noting how he had pinned blame onto her on Kiwi Farms. The Fool states his opinion that Barb wouldn't be charged with anything given her status as a victim. Bella says that Chris justified keeping this secret by stating that God told him it was okay, which I question on the grounds that Chris doesn't believe in God anymore. Bella says that she will find it in the video if someone posts it in the chat.
No evidence of the "bdsm stuff" described has come about aside from Bella's word and her later attempt at fabricating text messages from Chris describing these acts.
Regarding Chris
Bella 07:12 PM
thx
he does bdsm stuff with his mom
[2 😳 reactions]
Para 07:12 PM
like what
Bella 07:12 PM
he said that he wont feed her until she sucks his dick and calls it bdsm
Anaxis 07:13 PM
???
Bella 07:13 PM
she s too old to prepare food in their extremley cluttered house apperently
Anaxis 07:13 PM
That's...horrifying
The Fool 07:13 PM
jesus christ I could have never believed this shit until today
Bella 07:13 PM
he put up 3 vibrators in her and appernetly she was screaming in pain
sex he says is extrmeley painful for her but they do it conatntly
The Fool 07:14 PM
I'm really not looking forward to the hospital results
Para 07:14 PM
what the fuck
Bella 07:14 PM
unless he was bs me which i doubt then hell be pput away for a long time
but what im not sure about is whether or not she fully constented
he said yes and no
she groomed him and chris groomed her
The WCT 07:15 PM
[Replying to "she groomed him and chris groomed her"]
AnOminous on Kiwi Farms suggested they'd both get arrested. lol
Bella 07:15 PM
yeah makes sense
The Fool 07:15 PM
anom is kind of a retard
Bella 07:15 PM
y is their name so close to mine ;/ (edited)
The WCT 07:16 PM
[Replying to "anom is kind of a retard"]
at least he's not Naught. lel
Anaxis 07:16 PM
Unfortunate coincidence
The WCT 07:16 PM
[Replying to "she groomed him and chris groomed her"]
it goes on both ends indeed.
Bella 07:16 PM
whats jush feel about this
josh
The WCT 07:16 PM
[Replying to "whats jush feel about this"]
he probably feels the same way as we all do.
Bella 07:16 PM
feel free to tell him
idk how he is but i heard he tried to pinpoint it all on me
The Fool 07:17 PM
I don't think barb's going to get charged, especially because she's in the hospital right now (just a checkup I think but it doesn't bode well), she's definitely a victim in this even if everything an0n is saying didn't actually happen
Bella 07:17 PM
the last thing i want
Bella 07:17 PM
[Replying to "I don't think barb's going to get charged, especially because she's in the hospital right now (just a checkup I think but it doesn't bode well), she's definitely a victim in this even if everything an0n is saying didn't actually happen"]
sex is so painful for her that she probobly is bc of that
The Fool 07:18 PM
yeah I mean, she is old, I'm no gyno but I don't think it's a good idea to do that stuff at her age
Bella 07:18 PM
its crazay how into it he was
i said "how do u live with this secret, chris"
he told all fp us in individual times
"god told me its ok" (edited)
Anaxis 07:19 PM
But doesn't he not believe in God anymore?
Since he believes he's a Goddess?
The Fool 07:19 PM
weird I thought he didn't believe in god anymore, then again I recall him mentioning god recently, can't remember when
I was confused when he said it too
Bella 07:20 PM
it was in the video clip i think id dint see much of it
can soemone post it here
i need to watch it to see if anything was edited
The Fool 07:21 PM
we believe you we just have no idea what chris believes anymore lol
Bella Claims the Suitress is Speaking to Chris in the Incest Call
30 July 2021
Summary: I link the longest available version of the incest call for Bella, and she makes the claim that the person speaking to Chris on the call was Fiona. I ask if it was possible that she was the leaker, and Bella states that she was responsible for most, but not all (somehow).
This is a lie: the speaker on the call is Bella herself.
Regarding Chris
Anaxis 07:21 PM
[YouTube link to "leaked chris chan: admits rapng his mother [FULL AUDIO]" by Dr. Retard]
The Fool 07:21 PM
Changed the channel icon.
Changed the channel icon.

Is it at all possible that she was the leaker?
Bella 07:30 PM
not alll of it but most
The Fool Pokes Holes in Bella's Hacking Claims
30 July 2021
Summary: The Fool begins poking holes in Bella's story about people hacking modems, but she doubles down and claims that she's being truthful, stating that Chris had given "us" (Bella and her cronies) the password to his modem. The Fool asks if she means router, since modems don't have passwords, but Bella continues insisting she's correct, claiming Chris had an unusual setup.
Bella's claims are almost certainly lies, given all of her attempts at deflecting blame away from herself for involvement in this incident.
Regarding Chris
The Fool 07:30 PM
btw for future reference when someone says they hacked a modem they're lying lol
Bella 07:30 PM
and the isp modem guys
The Fool 07:31 PM
cuz thats not how any of that works
Bella 07:31 PM
uhhhh not exactly
chris gave us his password
to the modem
it is the mesh has his osc on it (edited)
and sc
The Fool 07:32 PM
you mean router? modems don't have passwords. computers have to be physically connected to the router's network to access it I think, but I don't know how his router works
Bella 07:32 PM
no not the router the midem
the mesh bc he lives in a community where the wifi is supplemenatry
The Fool 07:32 PM
🤔
Bella 07:32 PM
so they share it, modem is mac adress
The Fool 07:32 PM
ah
okay that setup is weird as hell I don't know how that works but that makes more sense than just saying someone hacked a modem lol
Bella 07:33 PM
if u live in a student apartment or a cheap townhome or a condo, the wifi comes from the center or whatever
each house has a mode m
so thy knwo which house spent more tiem online so theyc an pay per each person
The Fool 07:34 PM
I see. I can see someone fucking with that, I thought you were talking about like a big ISP like Verizon or something where they have security for that shit
Bella 07:34 PM
each modem is accessable via mac
Discussing Chris's Mental State and Alleged Abuse of Barb
30 July 2021
Summary: After providing me with the timestamp of when Chris claimed that God told him it was okay to do what he did with Barb (as I had asked earlier), Bella has a discussion with the Fool and Para over Chris's mental state, with the latter claiming Chris was insane and citing Bella's BDSM claims as proof. Bella uses this opportunity to state that Chris had tied up Barb and left her on the floor, resulting in her needing to visit a chiropractor.
Again, there is no proof that Chris tied up Barb.
Regarding Chris

The Fool 07:36 PM
I've seen him say god before too, I'm starting to think his mental state is deteriorating so badly that he doesn't know what he believes anymore. I mean jesus look what he did to his wall lol
Anaxis 07:36 PM
[Replying to "8:50"]

[Replying to "I've seen him say god before too, I'm starting to think his mental state is deteriorating so badly that he doesn't know what he believes anymore. I mean jesus look what he did to his wall lol"]
what he do
The Fool 07:37 PM
did you see his latest video yelling at hasbro? his wall is full of holes in the background
kat asked him about it and he was "practicing to break down the iron curtain"
but he did intentionally punch his wall enough to break the drywall, several times
delusional or not, that's teetering on actual insanity
I don't know many people with maladaptive daydreaming who punch holes in their walls because they think ponies will come out of it
thats more like the mindset of the dude who shot John Lennon
"there were little elves in my walls and I was their god"
Bella 07:41 PM
ohhhh
nah ironically im not invovled wiith his shit anymore
exceppt for now lmao
he showed me his room tors
tour
holy shit
Para 07:42 PM
teetering on insanity?

The Fool 07:42 PM

Para 07:42 PM

Bella 07:42 PM

no way can barb handle that stuff, she even lost her appetite, I'm surprised she's lived for so long being so slim when she was overweight before
I guess it's like after jason got faceraped by rosechu, "that should have killed me but dark forces keep me alive"

30 July 2021
Summary: Bella asks if any of us know Geno Samuel, as she wanted to ask him to leave her out of his series. WCT states that he does, and offers to contact Geno on Bella's behalf. She asks for Geno's information directly, and WCT provides her with his Discord tag. Bella claims that she doesn't want any clout, then again asks why we're still chatting with Chris. WCT states that we're currently waiting to see if he is charged with anything before making any moves.

The WCT's Leaking Plans, Medical Testing Discussion
30 July 2021
Summary: WCT announces his intent to leak materials if Chris gets charged with incest. Bella asks if he thinks Chris will definitely be charged, and he states that it would depend on how the investigation goes. When I mention that medical testing will reveal the truth, WCT wonders aloud if Chris left any of his "DNA" in Barb, which I react to with disgust. Bella claims that Chris's only concern was getting Barb pregnant, and had had sex with her as recently as two nights ago. I question this, pointing out that neither party would be physically able to conceive a child, which the Fool agrees with.
Regarding Chris
The WCT 10:00 PM
If I get word Chris is going to be charged for incest, I might consider releasing stuff.
Bella 10:56 PM
U think he will get charged?
The WCT 10:57 PM
It depends on how the investigation goes.
Bella 10:57 PM
Unless it was bs he shoukd
The WCT 10:57 PM
if the evidence is there, he will go to jail.
Anaxis 10:57 PM
Medical testing will reveal the truth
[1 ✅ reaction]
The WCT 10:58 PM
what I want to know is if Chris left any of his DNA behind in Barb.
because if he did, he's going to jail.
Anaxis 10:58 PM
Ecchhh
Bella 11:34 PM
1000% that was his only concern
Getting her pregnant
And he fucked her 2 nights ago
Anaxis 11:35 PM
Pregnant?
He's sterile and she's long past menopause
The Fool 11:35 PM
I have a fucking copypasta from like a decade ago of chris impregnating barb lol
and yeah barb is long past that
chris' fertility is debatable but barb is biologically incapable.
huh I can't find it
Para 11:42 PM
so he nutted in barb
The WCT 11:42 PM
[Replying to "so he nutted in barb"]
I hope he didn't.
but knowing Chris, he likely did.
Para 11:43 PM
maybe he put on a "raincoat"

Updating Bella on Chris's Situation
31 July 2021
Summary: Bella asks for an update on Chris's situation, and WCT recaps earlier events, stating that Chris is getting a hotel room after sleeping in his van the previous night, and that Null had cut ties with Chris. Bella expresses shock at Null cutting Chris off, and I explain that Null did it because of Chris taking money out of Barb's account to sustain himself, which was an apparent violation of his emergency protective order. WCT again reiterates his intention to leak material from the server, as well as his DMs with Chris and some screenshots. I note that doing so will add to the big picture, and Bella encourages WCT to do so in order to "ensure Chris finally gets into a mental hospital." She then states that there is a lot she wants to leak but can't trust the Suitress.
Regarding Chris
Bella 03:12 PM
Any updates
The WCT 03:12 PM
Chris is homeless.
Bella 03:12 PM
Wasnt he sleeping in a parking lot
The WCT 03:12 PM
he's getting a hotel room, but Josh has cut ties with him.
The WCT 03:12 PM
[Replying to "Wasnt he sleeping in a parking lot"]

I'm shocked

Anaxis 03:13 PM
Null cut ties with him because he stole money from Barb's bank account
[1 ℹ️ reaction]
Which violates the emergency protective order
And chris then lied to Null about it
The Fool 03:14 PM
I saw screenshots on twitter but I didn't actually see the lie
The WCT 03:14 PM
At this point, I'm thinking about leaking information from the server.
We're pretty much past the point of no return. (edited)
The Fool 03:15 PM
I'm clueless as what to do myself, honestly I almost want to leave the server (but keep contact with you guys cuz you're cool) but I also want to see how this shitshow ends
Anaxis 03:15 PM
[Replying to "I saw screenshots on twitter but I didn't actually see the lie"]
I believe that chris said that Barb sent him the money when he actually took it out himself, and null knows the truth because he monitors Chris's emails.
The WCT 03:15 PM
if you guys want to know what I'll specifically leak, its the DMs I had with Chris.
all the screenshots.
Anaxis 03:16 PM
I mean, it'll certainly add to the bigger picture
The Fool 03:16 PM
I still can't process that this happened, all day today I was just like "what the fuck"
Anaxis 03:16 PM
Yeah. Shit is fucked up.
The Fool 03:17 PM
I'm going through the goddamn stages of grief
The WCT 03:17 PM
I was actually prepared for this.

That's what Null believes. He's contacted the police about it.
Bella 03:18 PM
There's alot I want to leak but i can't trust fiona
Rant About Null and Trans People, Discussing Chris's Sexual Perversion
31 July 2021
Summary: Bella begins ranting against Null, which Para and the Fool participate in, and this soon devolves into a rant about trans people. I attempt to get them back on topic since this has nothing to do with Chris (the subject of the chat), and WCT agrees, but they stay on this topic of discussion for a short while. This soon turns into a discussion about Chris's sexual perversions and whether Barb was indirectly responsible for what happened. Finally, the Fool asks Bella why she would sit through 4 hours of incest discussion with Chris, and Bella responds "to record it bc he needs to go to a mental hospital."
It's notable that in this conversation, Bella seems to "break character" from the concerned and scared front she was putting on, as she liberally dispenses with slurs and other vulgar language. This sort of persona returns at the end of the conversation when the Fool asks her about sitting through the 4 hour call with Chris.
Regarding Chris
Bella 03:18 PM

josh: hi police? chris-chan just stole from his mom
CPD: aren't you the guy who kept harassing us about some retard giving some money to some people who held his imaginary friend hostage?
Bella 03:19 PM
Null kinda sucks hard
I cant bekeive my leak made him 5k
Para 03:19 PM
he kind of shouldn't have access to chris's emails
The WCT 03:19 PM
that's Null for you.
Para 03:19 PM
even what josh does is good (edited)
The Fool 03:19 PM
josh is a faggot
Para 03:20 PM
to a degree? i dont know
Bella 03:20 PM
The dude says the Chris is a more valid trans than any other trans person lmao
Para 03:20 PM
i get that its morally wrong to take 750 from his mom in a situation like this
The Fool 03:20 PM
no I mean yeah telling the cops about this is good
but I mean in general he's a fag
Bella 03:20 PM
[Replying to "josh is a faggot"]
Honestly
Para 03:20 PM
but he has no money for food or a place to stay i get why he did that
and josh has exploited chris for e fame for years he if anyone should fucking feed his cow
The Fool 03:21 PM
josh banned me from KF because I sassed him about him shilling brave when he said he doesn't sell advertising, he's banned most of the cool members by now, a lot of them made a splinter site called lolcow.org

Para 03:22 PM
im sorry i am in a minority of people who thinks trans people aren't people at this point
anyone who falls for that propaganda and pursues to become trannies arent smart
and they're narcissists
The Fool 03:22 PM
they're people until they join the percentage :)
Bella 03:22 PM
Trannies are kikes
Para 03:22 PM
they are really good cogs in a machine at times but they require you to grovel to do basic shit
they can be a good programmer or speedrunner
they're just garbage people
The Fool 03:23 PM
they're rarely good at those
they just make a vocal minority about doing those (badly)
there's probably maybe 5 good tranny programmers and 3 good tranny speedrunners
the rest are just there to bother people
Bella 03:24 PM
If they're autistic they're 98% Likley it's they're autism and they're not trans according to like 13 studies in numerology today (edited)
Anaxis 03:24 PM
Let's not have this discussion here
Bella 03:24 PM
Y
The Fool 03:24 PM
yeah I'm bored of talking about trannies
The WCT 03:24 PM

Bella 03:25 PM
Yeah abd regarding Chris, trannies suck my skinny cock
The Fool 03:25 PM
but I do agree, we definitely should treat chris as a proud trans woman, if not a representative of her cause :)
Para 03:25 PM
he is a legit pervert and his dick lead him to this
i didn't think he could get this bad
its very sad
why didn't he just buy another hooker
The Fool 03:26 PM
because he's genuinely insane now
he doesn't deserve an insanity plea deal but he is actually insane
Bella 03:26 PM
Hes actually retarded, his brain is stuck in childhood and it can't develop
The Fool 03:27 PM
no it was like that, now it's something worse
Bella 03:27 PM
Ofc he wouldn't have developed a sense of self or sexual identification, hrs just projecting
The Fool 03:27 PM
yeah
Para 03:27 PM
HE NEEDED SEXUAL RELEASE
so he takes it out on his corpse of a mother
Bella 03:27 PM
This dude says its ok to call him "he" if we're talking about about few years ago
He did more than just take it out on her
He made LOVE to her
The Fool 03:27 PM
I always like to say chris is asexual and would identify with that if not for the media and his church telling him he has to be straight and has to want to fuck women or else he's gay and lame
Para 03:28 PM
no i think chris is a demented pervert who keeps his true desires under wraps
Bella 03:28 PM
Candles and vibrators and massage oil and lube and everything
Para 03:28 PM
he always has bought vibrators to put up his ass
The WCT 03:28 PM

chris isn't a pervert, but he's programmed himself to be because he thinks it's what he has to do to be normal and to get a fuckmommy

You guys followed him way longer than I did
Must be worse for u
The shock at least

WCT Shares DMs Between Him and Chris
31 July 2021
Summary: WCT shares portions of a conversation he is currently having with Chris, where they discuss the fallout of the incest leaks. Reacting to the screenshots, Bella claims that the Suitress had leaked "99% of things," then states that she (Bella) intended on sending the recording to the authorities, but the Suitress instead leaked it onto Reddit and YouTube. WCT continues sharing screenshots while the rest of us react to the conversation.
Bella's claim that she wanted to send the recording to authorities is dubious, as she expressed a desire in other chats to release the recording herself after copiously censoring it.

Discussing Chris-Centric Servers, Favorite Trolls
31 July 2021
Summary: Para starts ranting about servers (assumedly on Discord) centered around Chris being terrible, and how their members are young and frequently obsess over old trolls like Liquid Chris.

WCT Laments Not Doing More
31 July 2021
Summary: WCT begins lamenting how he could have done more to prevent the current events from happening, stating that he should've known what was happening and could've stopped Chris. The other Knights and Bella assure him that there was no way he could've known how bad things were going to get (with Bella reiterating the likely lie that she told authorities as soon as she found out the truth). WCT extends the blame to Null as well, and continues to lament his failure as a leader.
Regarding Chris

I could've done more...

Pedofork Discussion, More Call Details
31 July 2021
Summary: Bella states her belief that pedophilia may not be too far off with Chris at this point, which Para and the WCT talk about briefly. Silvia asks what the call was originally about, and Bella says that Chris had said that he had something important to tell her, and called her over Signal. She claims that Chris shared that he had started dating a 70-year old a month prior, but Bella had only just put the facts together with this call, and that the audio quality was poor because nobody knew (presumably meaning that she was caught unprepared to record).
Regarding Chris

The Fake BDSM Texts, Bella Tricks WCT Into Framing the Suitress
31 July 2021
Summary: Bella posts a screenshot of a purported text message from Chris to her, in which Chris describes very detailed acts of BDSM being performed on Barb. WCT and Para react in shock and horror to these messages, and Bella claims that this was what she had woken up to the morning after the call took place. She goads WCT into releasing it, but insists that he doesn't say it's from her. WCT posts it and links the post, writing a few minutes later that other users on Kiwi Farms were claiming the messages were fake. Bella asks how she can prove that Fiona has this evidence too, and WCT states that he will have to name people. Bella states Fiona's real name (throwing her under the bus), and WCT asks for her alleged TikTok. The Fool expresses his doubts about the text messages, and WCT tells Bella that she should step up herself, insisting that she join the Farms to explain things but not state her identity. Meanwhile, Para posts something (likely NSFW) that doesn't have anything to do with Barb or Chris, and WCT calls whatever it is out as fake.
Bella says "alright they believe me" in regards to Kiwi Farms, then expresses surprise at us not knowing who Fiona is, stating that she's in the Knights of CWC Discord server (this is true). WCT posts another screenshot of a Kiwi Farms post and says that Bella should leak more if she has to. The Fool asks if he could back Bella up, but WCT says that nobody trusts him. The Fool then floats the idea of getting KF mod The American Hedgehog to verify, which WCT seems open to, but Bella states that it's fine and that she will leak more.
Image analysis from users on the Farms would later reveal the text messages Bella shared to have been fabricated.

Bob Discussion, Bella's Attraction to the Suitress
31 July 2021
Summary: Para states that everything seemed to go downhill when Bob died, and the Fool and WCT agree, having a short discussion about Bob's role in Chris's life when he was still alive. Bella states her surprise at Fiona having a TikTok (which the WCT was asking about, not stating as fact), and expresses that she finds Fiona cute. She then makes some claims about Fiona making her talk to someone about Chris for hours, which just resulted in a lot of screaming. Despite this, Bella gushes about simping for Fiona because her voice is cute, and says that she doesn't understand why Fiona wants to fuck Chris so badly. After this, Bella shares a Kiwi Farms link and claims that Fiona had called her in tears and claimed she was being cyberbullied. WCT then advises that Bella and Fiona both turn off their notifications for the time being, and Bella asks how to get Fiona to like her instead.

Incest Leak Thread is Locked, Astrology Discussion
31 July 2021
Summary: The megathread in which the incest leak was being discussed is temporarily locked by KF moderator The American Hedgehog, possibly due to the disinformation spread by WCT on Bella's behalf, and WCT announces it in incredulity. Bella claims that it was locked due to people pretending to be her friends, and WCT says that the mods are likely trying to clean up problematic posts.
Later, WCT posts a link to a Kiwi Farms thread on "The Astrology of Chris Chan," which then triggers a discussion between WCT and Para about astrology.

WCT Gives Bella Advice, Bella and WCT's Leak Argument
1 August 2021
Summary: Bella asks again about updates on Chris, and WCT states that everything is currently at a standstill. He tells her that she should speak with American Hedgehog on KF, but Bella doesn't see the point. Bella posts a Google Drive link, claiming that it contains an unedited 14 minutes of audio, and asks where she should post it. After a bit of silence, she states that we could also share it. WCT asks about the uncut call, but Bella keeps insisting that WCT post what she had given him. He again inquires about the alleged 4 hour call, but she claims that it doesn't exist due to her recording software shutting off randomly, and only has 45 minutes. WCT requests Bella send that instead, and she refuses on the grounds of it having Fiona's information on it (this was after she had tricked WCT into throwing Fiona under the bus on Kiwi Farms). Despite his continual pressing, WCT is unable to convince Bella to give him the 45 minute version, and eventually backs down.

Calling Out the Fake BDSM Texts
1 August 2021
Summary: After Bella posts a link to Imgur with a screen recording of the texts she allegedly had with Chris, WCT asks if Null had banned Bella and mentions that people were accusing him of fucking with Chris. Bella states that she's currently logged in. I call out her texts as fake (referring to the BDSM texts), but she insists that what was in the Imgur link was real.

Chris's Arrest, Bella's Removal from the Chat
1 August 2021
Summary: Bella asks if anyone had posted her information on the Farms (which roughly coincides with her first thread being created). Shortly after, I announce that Chris had finally been arrested. WCT then advises Bella cut all ties with Chris, which she advises back to him. She confidently states that Kiwi Farms had failed to dox her (which we knew was not true at this point). WCT then tells Bella that he will remove her from the group chat and likely delete it afterward, and removes everyone from the chat other than himself. However, it is not deleted.
On 5 August, WCT adds an unknown individual to the chat, for an unknown purpose.
Regarding Chris
Bella 06:25 PM

Notes
↑ There actually is no evidence that the Suitress ever had a TikTok; it was just assumed she did due to her Chris cosplay videos taking on a TikTok-like style. Notably, none of the videos bear TikTok watermarks.
Emotes Used
↑ 1.0 1.1 Emote of a close-up picture of a cat's face.
↑ Emote that simply read "this tbh" in red letters.
