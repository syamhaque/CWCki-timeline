================================================================================

On 19 May 2018, Copitz and his friends went to Chris's house to give him fanart he had drawn. Chris was overjoyed to meet them and kissed each of them on the cheek,[1] which he thought they found flattering[2] and agreed to do a video with them.
The video took place on 26 May 2018, with the videos released a few days later. A highlight is Chris saying that he regrets being more infamous than famous while hearing about the recent documentary made about him. He also says that he still goes to Anytime Fitness and has a membership, but "had to relocate" to one that wasn't in Ruckersville. He mentions that some unknown friends took him to see the movie Pokémon: I Choose You.

This article is still yet to be completed due to stress. We get a lot of stressful torture in our lives that makes us crash into slumber. Given that inspiration is a big variable, and we may have been lacking of it, this article will be completed as soon as possible, at our own pace... HONEST!

A Chat With Christine Chandler
Filmed Saturday, 5/26/2018
We accidentally lost the first bit of this footage, so that is why there is no intro here.
The only important thing that was lost was Christine indulging in some "JULAY" memes, believe it or not.
That being said, enjoy the video!
(0:11-0:22) Chris discusses the weather
Chris: Ahh...I-I tend to perspire easily.
[Chris fans his face, takes off his glasses and wipes sweat from his head]
Copitz: Yeah...It is pretty hot today.
Maybe eighty degrees?
Chris: Yeah. It's-[wipes face] mid-eighties right now.
Copitz: Mid-eighties?
Carson: This is really good.
Lee: It's nice out.
Copitz: It is nice out, yeah.
[jump cut]
(0:23-1:17) Chris discusses the Kiwi Farms and BraveryJerk
Copitz: Y- you probably know about the, the Kiwi Farms, right?
Chris: Oh, yes.
Copitz: Yeah, yeah.
[jump cut]
Copitz: People probably, uh-[jump cut] replied to you on Twitter when you posted the picture of us, then I posted it on Kiwi Farms.
[jump cut]
Copitz: I didn't even know what the Kiwi Farms was, I w- I just thought like [jump cut] It was a place to maybe brag about my experience, you know, [Chris laughs] 'cause it was the first thing I thought of when I got home, but then I realized... that wasn't such a good idea and [Chris: Mmm.] th- most of the people on the forums were telling me it wasn't a good idea either.
Chris: Eeh.
Copitz: Um, but, you know-
Chris (interrupting): I forgive you this time.
Copitz: Haha, thank you. [jump cut] A lot of them were-were afraid that I was like a ween and I was gonna be like, you remember BraveryJerk?
[jump cut]
Chris: Ah, not sure.
Copitz: He was the, uh, the African-American fellow who interviewed you at the, uh, the, uh-
Chris (interrupting): Oh... oh, yeah, yeah.
I did n- I did not know his offline name.
Copitz: Okay- no, that is his online name, is BraveryJerk.
Chris: Online, offline, [raspberry-like sound], what did I say.
I-[Chris uses an extremely high-pitched and loud sing-song voice]I kept sayin' words!!
Copitz: How did you feel about the videos that he made?
[jump cut]
Chris: Uh, it is what it is, I just m'let it go, I'm cool.
Copitz: Yeah, yeah.
(1:19-2:28) Chris discusses Toys "R" Us and restaurants
[jump cut, Chris is now leaning forwards, reaching for a cup of tea]
Chris: Which tea is this again?
Carson: It's called iron oolong.
It kinda tastes like, sweet, even without sugar.
[Chris laughs]
[jump cut, the tea is now being poured into Chris' cup]
Chris: That's good.
Carson: Oop, didn't get your hand, did I?
Chris: Nah, you're cool. [jump cut] Ha, could've been hotter.
[Copitz laughs]
Chris: Yeah, I like spicy things.
Copitz: Yeah, I like spicy th-
Carson: Hey, what's your favorite food, by the way?
Chris: Mmm.
I like, uh, Mac and Cheese for longer time.
[jump cut]
Copitz: When you go- go out to eat at uh, at, at near Ruckersville, where do you normally go, do you come down to Charlottesville, or...
Chris: Uh, yeah, kinda here 'n 'ere, I mean, [jump cut] I just feel like it's cheap to just name McDonald's all the time, or KFC, or Taco Bell, [Copitz: Yeah, yeah] but I tell you what-[Copitz: Those are cheap, though] if I like it good, I might get something good from the Wood Grill Buffet.
Copitz: Oh, yeah, uh- that's down near where Toys "R" Us is, right?
Chris: Yeah. [sigh] Stop the closing of the Toys "R" Us!
[Copitz and friends mock-scream in dismay]
Copitz: No! Not the Toys "R" Us!
[jump cut]
Copitz: You probably get a lot of your, your MLP stuff from [jump cut] Toys "R" Us, don't you?
Chris: Yeah, but's it's like, a lot of it's available online now, everyone's buying online [Copitz: [sucks teeth] Yeah.] Maybe KB will make a return, just like I heard on, uh, kind of a, news thing I s- read about, few weeks ago.
[jump cut]
Copitz: Yeah, it might- you know, that would actually be a good idea because it could pick up the business that Toys "R" Us, um, [Chris: Lost.] would have lost, yeah.
[jump cut]
(2:28-3:22) Copitz tells stories about Monster Energy and his friend Eric
Chris(to one of the friends): It was pretty good, by the way.
Carson: I know, I like it a lot.
[jump cut]
Copitz: I remember, I was here one time, and, and I, and I had a, I had a big, um, can of Monster Energy, and I tried combining it with the tea, but it just tasted like gross, warm Monster.
[They all laugh]
Chris: They make a tea for Monster, Monster Tea.
Carson: Oh, Rehab, I think it's called.
[jump cut]
Copitz: So you remember Eric [Shows a picture of Eric on the screen], my friend that, uh, that came to [Chris: Uh, yes.] your house, right? [Chris: Yes.] He-
[jump cut]
[The camera lurches awkwardly towards one of Copitz's friends]
Copitz: When he was taking the behind the wheel driving lessons, he went up to- to the Wal-Mart [phone buzzes] on 29 North. [Camera tilts around] Not the one in Ruckersville, but the one- [Chris: Alright.] the one near Charlottesville.
[jump cut]
[Copitz drinks some tea]
Copitz:
Ooh, that is good.
I like that.
[jump cut]
Carson: Eric was actually the one who showed me the tea.
Copitz: Oh, really.
Shoutouts to Eric. [closeup of Eric's face]
[jump cut]
Copitz: So when he was driving- [jump cut] through the parking lot with his driver's instruction teacher and a couple of other students- [jump cut] he actually saw you.
Uh, a while ago, he saw you, and he recognized you.
So that- so that was, uh, exciting for me, and we were all jealous.
[Chris and Copitz laugh] They got to see you.
[jump cut]
(3:23-3:43) Chris discusses people coming to his house
Copitz: What were you thinking when we came to your house? How often does that happen?
Chris: Uhh... [jump cut] Feel like I wanna say on average... maybe.. uh... once every few months?
[jump cut]
Copitz: Is it normally fans, or normally trolls?
Chris: Um... I'm not quite certain.
Copitz: Not- not sure? Maybe just people trying to- people that live in the area and just wanna meet an- an icon?
Chris: Yeah, kinda.
[laughs]
[jump cut]
(3:44-5:54) Chris discusses Animal Crossing, Let's Play, and the GenoSamuel2 documentary
Chris: Hey, try the Hi-C!
It's got mint in it, and it's really good.
Friend 3: [unintelligible]
Friend 4: There are many, huh?
Copitz: Yeah, there are a lot of 'em.
Chris: I like mint.
[jump cut]
Copitz: Um-
Chris: Minty Squirrel from Animal Crossing.
Copitz: Minty Squ- Yeah, you know, you did a lot of Animal Crossing stuff back in the day, didn't you?
Chris: Yeah.
Copitz: You made that Animal Crossing video for your parents?
I thought that was really nice.
Chris: Yeah.
Copitz: Yeah.
Chris: And then I just did touring of what I had on my GameCube.
Copitz: Ah, right.
Yeah.
I- you kn- I remember people saying- I thought this was really cool- They said that you pioneered the Let's Play experience.
Chris: I did?
Copitz: Yeah, 'cause you did it- you, you like, you recorded yourself, um, you're y'know, commentating over gameplay before basically anybody else did on the Internet.
[Copitz plays 5:02-5:10 from Chris' Animal Crossing Documentary]
2003 Chris: -moving on with the tour of my house. As you can see I've got- I'm collecting the NES games. I've got most of them down here, and I've got a couple upstairs.
[Video clip ends]
Copitz: So some people consider you the pioneer Let's Play.
Chris: Huh.
Copitz: That's pretty cool, isn't it?
Lee: That is pretty cool.
Chris: Okay, well that's news to me.
[Copitz and friends laugh]
Copitz: Yeah, I saw that ag- on the, um, do you know, the uh GenoSamuel2 documentary?
Chris: Mmm.
Copitz: Um, he's making this crazy long, comprehensive documentary, and I'd say it's very objective, he's not making fun of you in any way.
Chris: Mm.
[jump cut]
[Chris Chan: A Comprehensive History - Part 10 is shown on the screen]
Copitz: He's on Part 10, and they're each 40 minutes, and he's only on like 2008, [Picture disappears from the screen] so it's like, it's like he's getting everything in there.
Chris: Ah, as much as he can, right?
Copitz: Yeah, yeah.
H- how do you feel about it when people make, like, documentaries and stuff about you but they're not making fun of you?
Chris: Um, I feel abou- I kinda feel like, uh...
Copitz: You wish your past wasn't documented as much?
Chris: Uh, no, I don't wanna say that.
Copitz: Mm-hm.
Chris: Um, I just kinda wish I wasn't as- more famous than infamous [Copitz: Yeah, yeah, that's true.]
for more of my good qua- more of my good traits, but I think they're all well noted, among which. I have faith in the goodness of people.
And that's , uh, that's discounting and discrediting the obvious bad ones.
Copitz: Yeah, yeah.
[jump cut]
Copitz: Y- you've met some good people out there.
I mean, we're here, right? You know. [Chris: Yeah.] Yeah, we're- we're trying [camera suddenly zooms in on Chris and Copitz fist bumping] to be friendly.
[all laugh]
[jump cut]
Lee: You want a, uh, cameraman?
Copitz: Yeah, you think you could help us- help me out here? Thanks, Lee.
(5:55-6:01) Interlude
[The same techno music plays, text is shown on the screen]
Starting here, there is a lot of background noise that I did not realize was being picked up.
I apologize for this error.
That being said, please carry on and enjoy the rest.
(6:02-6:45) Chris discusses his favorite games
[The camera is now in a different position, revealing more of the room.
Lee is gone from the frame, and is now the cameraman.]
Copitz: All right, we're good, we've got Lee as our cameraman now, so that's good.
[Chris laughs]
[jump cut, camera is zoomed in more]
Copitz: Um, so Chrischine[sic] was just saying off-camera that her favorite, uh, Sonic game was Sonic CD.
Chris: Yeah.
Copitz: Um, would that make that your favorite game of all time?
Chris: Uh...
Copitz: Or you like Animal Crossing or LittleBiGPlanet more?
Chris: I like, I like all the games I've played-
[Copitz starts getting up from his seat and reaches for the camera.
As he touches it, there is a jump cut.]
[Copitz withdraws his hand from the camera]
Chris: -definitely earned, like up to a hundred percent of the trophies.
[someone laughs]
[jump cut]
Chris: I dunno about favorite game of all time, though.
Mmm...[wipes face]...Although, big props to everything LittleBiGPlanet, especially everything on the PS3, 'cause I'm able to make my Sonichu costumes and play the game [Friend laughs] as Sonichu in a way.
Copitz: [Looks at camera] You- you still uh, kind of a big gamer?
You play games a lot?
Chris: Yeah.
Here and there, just when I- I do as I feel.
[jump cut]
The picture in question.
(6:46-6:56) Copitz shows Chris a picture
Copitz: I got this picture right here where somebody swapped our mouths and made Eric's head really big.
[The picture shows up on the screen]
[Chris and Copitz laugh]
Copitz: I'll put that up on screen.
Lee: Oh yeah, I saw those, too.
Copitz: You think that's funny?
Chris: Yeah it's silly, yeah.
[jump cut]
(6:57-7:16) Chris talks about his typical day
Copitz: What is a typical, uh, 'CWC' day like?
Chris: Um... Well,I'm gettin' into something a bit more exercising. Going to Anytime Fitness, I am a member there.
Copitz: The one, uh, in Ruckersville?
Chris: Ehhhm... Not so much anymore, had to relocate, I'm not sayin' where.
[jump cut]
Chris: The one I'm going to, does- it's much farther... Yeah.
[jump cut]
(7:17-8:09) Chris talks about his jobs at Wendy's and Cutco Cutlery
Copitz: So you worked at the Wendy's in Ruckersville for a while, didn't you?
Chris:[nervously] Yeah.
Copitz: Wh- what was your experience like there?
Chris: Ehhh... Kinda hit-or-miss, [Copitz: Oof.] and I was still young... um... I felt like it [jump cut] just didn't quite suit me as well anyhow.
Copitz: Mm-hm.
[jump cut]
Copitz: Did you work anywhere else?
Chris: Uh... uh... No, not these days. Uh, but I did work one summer as a... representative of... Cutco Cutlery?
But I- I treated it only as a summer job, so...
Copitz: Okay. Yeah. Yeah.
[jump cut]
Copitz: Are you 36 now?
Chris: Uhf... Yes.
Copitz: 36.
[jump cut]
Copitz: We can still make the next [unintelligible].
Carson: Yeah.
Chris: It's a generation gap that can be a brrrrrridge.
Like in a blidge[sic] dictionary, I'm making a bridge.
[Unsure of what Chris is actually doing here.
I think he's trying to roll his 'R's, but if he is, he's doing it so badly that I can't tell.]
Copitz: Bridge.
[Chris moves his hand in a horizontal motion, supposedly imitating a bridge]
[Copitz and Chris fist bump, creating an explosion.]
[Copitz and Chris laugh]
Chris: There's a good bridge.
[jump cut]
(8:10-9:36) Chris talks about his name change and his favorite movies
Copitz: What was it, the um, the uh, the bear, at the, at the Midlothian mall that gave you that name?
[Text is shown on the screen, accompanied by a doorbell-like sound effect.]
*Referring to the name "Christian" here.*
Chris: Yep.
Leonard... Bearstein.
Copitz: Leonard Bearstein.
[jump cut]
Carson: Do you have a favorite movie?
Copitz: Favorite movie.
Chris: Mary Poppins.
Copitz: Ah Mary Poppins.
Chris:[odd voice] Supercalifragilisticexp-
[Copitz joins in]
Both Chris and Copitz: -ialidocious.
[jump cut]
Copitz: You ever go to the theater?
[jump cut]
Chris: Yeah, my friends, uh, took me there, t' see Pokémon: I Choose You
[The video cuts to a still from the movie, text laid on top:]
POKEMON[sic]: I CHOOSE YOU SPOILER ALERT
SKIP TO 9:12 TO AVOID
Chris: Pikachu... talked to Ash, literally.
Copitz:[muffled by the tea he's drinking] Mmm?
Chris: An' it's like, "Pikachu!"- [Copitz: The whole movie?]- No, just one part - but it's like [Chris does an admittedly good impression of Ash from the Pokémon anime] "Pikachu! Why don't you get in your Pokéball?" an' he's like, [very high-pitched voice]"It's because..." [Copitz:[incredulously, looking at the camera] What?] "...It's because, I want to be with you."
Copitz: That happened in the movie?
Chris: [still using the high-pitched voice] Yeah.
[Copitz plays the clip from the movie]
Chris: The whole movie was quite good, we enjoyed it.
[jump cut]
Chris: [unintelligible mumbling, continuing in high-pitched voice] left. [unintelligible] to refill? Oh, no, we're still good. Ha.
Copitz: We're good, we're good.
Chris:[normal voice] It's like, almost half full, and I like being... optimistic.
[jump cut]
Copitz: You're a half-full kinda...
Chris: -person.
Yeah.
[strange, deep voice that is probably supposed to be an Optimus Prime impression] I'm an optimist.
My name is Optimus.
Copitz: Optimus Prime
Chris: Optimist Prime.
Copitz: Optimist Prime.
[both laugh]
Copitz: Yeah.
[jump cut]
(9:36-10:35) Chris rambles about bells and bananas
Copitz: I wanted to ask you how you feel about- [jump cut] - Richard Simmons.
[Copitz most likely meant Robert Simmons.]
Chris: Oh... yeah.
[jump cut]
Chris: Hearing his name definitely rings the bell.
Copitz: [sucks teeth] Yeah.
Chris: Rings the bell.
[Chris suddenly moves his head to his left shoulder, imitating a bell.]
Chris:[deep voice] Glung.
Copitz: Is that the troll bell?
[jump cut]
Copitz: What's that called, a gong, yeah.
[jump cut]
Chris: Yeah, no, I was actually thinking if a really big bell-
[They all start talking at the same time]
Carson: Oh, I got it.
Copitz: Oh, yeah, like a really big, like a really big, yep, like...
Chris: -like in a high tower.
Chris: Yeah, although, I think this one would probably have a crack in it . Not like the Liberty Bell, exactly, just like, you know, just a f- kind of a crack, because, I dunno, we're not perfect, we're all a little cracked somewhere.
Copitz: Yeah. [jump cut] Carson on his face.
[The camera zooms in on Carson, showing in more detail the bandages on his face.]
Carson: Yeah, ha ha, [jump cut] my face is destroyed.
[The camera zooms in on Chris's hands as he pours himself tea.]
Chris: W- we're all- [drops spoon] Whoops!
[The camera zooms back out]
Chris: Ha, there's a little fumble, but it wasn't an epic fail.
Copitz: Yeah.
No, not an epic fail. Could've been an epic fail.
Chris: Yeah.
[jump cut]
Copitz: What's your opinion on Minions?
How do you like Lee's Minion shirt he's wearing?
[A picture of Lee with a Minion shirt is shown on the screen.]
Lee: Probably, uh-
[Chris suddenly starts talking an an obnoxiously loud, nasal, and high-pitched voice.
The camera starts zooming in on his face, and the audio is edited to be echoey, making Chris's outburst even more terrifying than it already was. It's hard to tell what's Copitz's editing, and what's just Chris.]
Chris: AH, MINION, DEY SO FUNNY,GNA GNA GNA, BANANA.BANANA BANANA BANANA.BANANA! MINANABANANA!THBBPTHBPT
[The camera mercifully zooms back out, the audio returning to normal.]
Chris: Uh, I not- I've seen the first Despicable Me movie.
Copitz: Yup.
[jump cut]
(10:36-12:11) Chris talks politics and Danger Dolan
Copitz: Th- this is kinda personal, you don't have to answer this, but, wh- what are maybe your political opinions?
How do you feel about the President?
Chris: [stress sigh]
I'm not, I'm not totally into politics, I'm kind of a neut- I'm kind of neutral, but I definitely wish that, uh, Obama could stay in office,
[Copitz: Yeah.] but if it had to be what it had to be(?) then you know I voted for Hillary.
[jump cut]
Chris: -yeah, but instead we got Dona-[long gargling noise]-rump.
[Copitz laughs]
[jump cut]
Chris: An' I learned recently to roll my 'R's, an' it was by accident.
[Copitz laughs]
Chris: My tongue was in the right place, and I went with it.
[The gargling noise is apparently supposed to be rolling his 'r's, but it's not remotely like what it should be.
It sounds more like an 'L' sound than an 'R' sound, and his tongue is definitely not "in the right place".]
[jump cut]
Chris: And, you know, Danger Dolan does it, ud, [odd voice] I am Danger Dolan, und today I'll be a [gargling noise] rater(?), and I will tell you the ['rolled 'r's"] treek(?).
And why does he say it like 'trees', by the way, it's truth, not trees.
[jump cut]
Copitz: I was wondering, 'cause I saw- you know how, like, when somebody likes a Tweet, it shows up on your timeline sometimes, on Twitter?
Chris: Oh, yes.
Copitz: And I saw you- you liked one of Donald Trump's tweets.
Chris: [mumbling] Wait, you talkin' about, uh, earlier today, oh, yeah, it was like one having to do with the, er, the American people bein' held... over dere... in wherever it was.
[jump cut]
Chris: They're being released, they're coming back to America, they reunite with their... family.
Of the White House.
Copitz: So you're just happy to hear it.
Chris: Yeah.
I like good news.
And Tara Strong shared dat link, by the way.
Copitz: Okay.
Chris: Tara an' I, we hate Trump, but we do like the good news, and good things in life.
Copitz: The good news.
Well, you know, you gotta see the good in people sometimes, even if they're not so good.
Chris: [earsplittingly loud and high pitched voice] YEAH, EVEN TIMMY TURNER IS SO POSITIVE ALL THE TIME!
Copitz: That's, that's-
Chris: [continuing the voice] YEEEEAH, LOOK AT MY FAIRY GODPARENTS!
Copitz: That's Tara Strong.
Chris: [odd laugh] [normal voice] She's really awesome.
[jump cut]
(12:12-?) Chris talks about his Cutie Mark
Copitz: Lee, can you get in front of this right here? What is this, uh, [unintelligible] character?
[camera zooms up to something Chris is holding]
Chris: That's my cu- That's my Cutie Mark.
Copitz: Oh, okay, from, uh, My Little Pony.
Chris: Yeah, but it's my- it's my special Cutie Mark, I took multiple quizzes to find out what I be.
I ended up being, you know, to make my OC pony Night Star. That's her Cutie Mark, an' she and I share da Cutie Mark.
Copitz: Oh, cool, okay.
Chris: Yeah, and of course, if I- if I ever went to Equestria though, I wouldn't beco- I would not become, a unicorn, I'd become an alicorn, because I'm a bit higher up, just- just because of my rule in Cwcville and everything, and that w- that was kind of a di- thing, because y'know, it was like- y'know, I cou- I only drew Nightstar because I was like: "I could draw myself whatev- whichever way I wanted, so, I was like EH? I'll spoil myself, and I, had felt like I had wings... on my shoulders... for quite a long time, even longer than tha- for quite a number of years.
Copitz: [Sings "I Believe I Can Fly by R Kelly."]
Chris: Just- just kind of an imagery of wings on my back.
Copitz: [Looks straight at the camera] We got a modern-day R. Kelly right here.
Chris: Modern day R Kelly?
Copitz: Woah, woah, woah- wait, wait- The good parts of R Kelly. [Laughs]
Chris: [Laughs and starts rapping] I don't know about that, but you could do a rap, and we can do this and that- gettin' go blip blap blip blap.
Copitz: There you go. R Kelly.
[Camera zooms in on Chris's face to finish the rap]
Chris: [Continues rapping] I'm not a rapper, but I'm here to say, that y'all can do it, as you'd like your way.
Copitz: Do you think maybe you- you'll get into voice acting, sometime?
Chris: Uh, possibly, if they- we get an anime show for Sonichu I'll voice myself and my son.
Copitz: Oh! That would be so cool!
Chris: And, y'know I would definitely want to make a deal with Funko for making some POP vinyl figures, of, myself and my family.
[General agreement noises]
Copitz: You've been let down by a lot of fake, uh...
Chris: People have been faking the, actual people, like Regis Fil Aime for one, yeah.
Copitz: Yeah, yeah, did you actually f- uh, fly out to Washington?
Chris: Nyooo.
Copitz: No, you didn't?
Chris: No, we didn't fall for that.
Copitz: It was funny, you drove out to...
Chris: Cleveland.
Copitz: To Cleveland. And then it was that, old worn down house?
Chris: Yeah.
Copitz: Not what you expected... not- not Julie, no.
Chris: Just a little old lady!~
Carson: Now you were talking about, voice acting Sonichu, what would Sonichu sound like?
Copitz: Oooh, that's a good question.
Chris: Uh, something close to the original, like, y'know, back in the adventures Saturday morning phase, somin- sounding like that, Um, ha! Robotnic totally got me with this, but nah, I ain't gonna be falled by that. Uh, but they're scratchin' rounders, I'm gonna go trip on them, hubre I am referring to the episode, rounder the genius. Which was the first episode of, Adventures of
the Sonic the Hedgehog I had ever seen. It was the first time I'd heard Sonic's voice.
Lee: It's amazing that you can remember that.
Copitz: Yeah, yeah.
Lee: Yeah.
Copitz: Good memory.

A Chat With Christine Chandler - DELETED SCENES
Copitz: Do you have any, umm, any real life friends you ever, umm, hang out with?
Chris: Uhh, yeah, I have some real life friends that I do hang out with from time to time, yes.
Copitz: Near Charlottesville?
Chris: Uhh, yes.
Copitz: Okay, that's good. Did you meet them online, or did you -
Chris: Uh, mostly in person.
Copitz: Do they know about you from, from your your, uh, like, your fame on the internet?
Chris: Umm, like when we first met, most-most- majority did not know about me from the internet, and then they kind- they got to know me and they're like "Ehh, well we know Christine, we know Christian or Christine better than that."
Copitz: How's uhh, Mrs. Barbara Chandler been doing?
Chris: Ehh, she's doing fair in general. She's getting up more. She's -
Copitz: In her 70s now?
Chris: Now you're gonna make me think of her age now.
[Copitz laughs]
Chris: Ehh, she's like 76, she'll be 77 later.
Copitz: Okay, yeah. We- we saw her, she- she was a little concerned what we were doing at- at your door I remember.
Chris: Yeah, I calmed her down. I told her, like ya know "they're both fans, and it was a nice little visit."
Copitz: I was hoping you'd answer because I was afraid if she answered she might- she might slam the door on us.
Chris: Yeah, [in a Barb impression] ??. We're not home! We're (sic) not wanted! We're not interested! Go away!"
[All laugh]
Copitz: Yeah.
[Chris makes angry elderly noises]
Chris: No, that's not the typical old- elderly lady I'm quite sure. I mean I've met a lot of very nice elderly women, I respect my seniors and elders.
Copitz: Yeah, yup.
Cameraman: That's good.
Chris: 'Specially since my father was a senior citizen literally my entire life from birth.
Copitz: Yeah, was- how old was he when you were born?
Chris: If you wanna go beyond that, he was... 52 years old on conception.
Copitz: 52 years old on conception. [Chris laughs] So maybe 53 when you were born or so?
Chris: Yeah, that's about right.
[jumpcut]
Copitz: Do you think if you had, uh, gone to the Albermarle County Public School, maybe because of kind of like the more industrialized area than Greene County maybe you would've had a better experience in Elementary School than you did with Greene?
Chris: [in Pinkie Pie impression] I have no idea!
[Copitz laughs]
Chris: And I'm imitating Pinkie Pie saying that.
Copitz: And at least you're able to go to Richmond and, and I think- you think that going to Manchester High impacted your- your life for the better?
Chris: Yes, I do believe so.
Copitz: Mhmm, you met some friends at PVCC too, didn't you?
Chris: Uhh, I didn't make as many friends at PVCC.
Copitz: No?
Chris: Ehhh, I met people, I tried, but it's like, ummm, we couldn't really connect.
Copitz: Ahh, yeah.
[jumpcut]
Chris: I've, uh, started watching the new Rocky and Bullwinkle yesterday on Amazon Prime.
Copitz: How do you feel about that?
Chris: Oh, I kinda liked it, it was classic silly, silly, silly. And Tara Strong voicing Rocky J. Squirrel. I would definitely like to meet her one day if possible, 'cus, ya know, [in ?? impression] She does a very good ?? [in a Twilight Sparkle impression] and a Princess Twilight Sparkle.
Copitz: Maybe- maybe if she, uh, she ever needs somebody to take over for her, you could do it. [Copitz laughs]
BACK: Yeah!
Chris: I don't know, I'm not exactly [in Bugs Bunny impression] be the guy who did Bugs Bunny or [in Daffy Duck impression] Daffy Duck Sufferin' succotash!
Copitz: [laughing] Not exactly, no.
[Camera zooms in Chris makes quacking noises]
Cameraman: I can't do characters as well [Copitz: Yeah!] as well as you can.
Chris: Ehh, I got kinda like a voice copy thing [Copitz laughs] and I tend to- it's like, ya know, when I'm talking with somebody else, just one other person, for a while I tend to sound like them after a time.
Copitz: Oh really?
Chris: Yeah, but if it's like- when I'm in a group then it's kinda mixed so I end up with more natural voice more often in the conversation. [in a Copitz impression] I'm talking with you right now Christian and I can kinda get your voice down after you and I- you and me in this pow-wow. I mean, whaddya think? We sound a lil cool?
Copitz: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, we sound pretty similar haha.
Chris: Yeeeah, we just hip dudes.
Copitz: Haha, pretty good.
[jumpcut]
Chris: Found a recent top ten, they uh, they top ten voi- top ten characters who were voice- multiple characters by voice- by the same actress. They put Tara at number four, but she was like, uh... the female- the only female in the top four, so she's pretty much the queen of voice acting.
Copitz: Oh, yeah.
Chris: While the ki- while the se- well- I can't remember his name -
Copitz: Wow, the reqs were met, huh? ??
Chris: the king of voice acting is the guy who did Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck and all of them.
Copitz: Yeah, I can't remember his name [Chris: Me neither], but he died a while ago, didn't he?
Chris: But number two was Frank Welker. [In Megatron voice] "Do as I command! I am the Megatron!"
[jumpcut]
Lee: Do you have any favorite YouTubers that you'd like to shout out?
Chris: Ehh
Copitz: Shout out Copitz!
Chris: Ha, Copitz, I'll give him that. I'd definitely want to give a shoutout to Emgo, Dr. Wolf, and uh, lemme think, Scribbler, I like- I like the way she reads the MLP comics. [Copitz laughs] Ehhh, I wan- I like watching WatchMojo.
Copitz: Oh yeah, yeah, the top tens?
Chris: Yeah.
[jumpcut]
Copitz: I noticed, when you're livestreaming, you have like such good quality, ummm, but cus you live in more of a neighborhood, but my internet's so bad, like, [Chris: Ehhh, you could- ] if you saw the quality on my stream [laughs]
[Chris refills his drink]
Chris: Ehhh, internet streaming quality, brought to you by Comcast XFinity!
Copitz: Yeah, you get Comcast, I only get CenturyLink.
Cameraman: Yeah, I only get CenturyLink too.
Chris: Shall I top you off?
Copitz: Oh sure, thank you.
[camera zooms into Chris pouring drink into Copitz's cup]
Cameraman: I can't stream at all on CenturyLink. [Lee: Really?] Yeah.
Copitz: Yeah well, it depends where you are I guess, but... And Lee lives just outside the city, just south of, uh, Charlottesville, and still CenturyLink doesn't give him anything good.
Chris: Oh dear.
Cameraman: We're installing Ting, which is... yeah.
Copitz: You're getting Ting?
Cameraman: Hopefully soon. You have to get a certain amount of people.
Copitz: It said a couple years ago they took Ting a little bit to your neighborhood, but not all.
Cameraman: Yeah, but they didn't like give it to anyone yet.
Lee: Fiber-optic?
Cameraman: Yeah.
Copitz: Fiber-optic, fiber-optic is great, I'd love to have that.
[jumpcut]
Copitz: Okay. Oh, so |KB Toy store was in the Fashion Square Mall!
Chris: Yeah, it was.
Copitz: Oh, okay. Yeah, you know my- my favorite, uh, my favorite thing from the Fashion Square Mall that they- they closed, it seems like they closed everything there, nobody even really goes there anymore [Chris: yeee] seems like, was the uhh- the big candy store. I loved the candy store. And then the arcade, but that was before my time.
Chris: Yeah, I vaguely remember an arcade at Fashion Square.
Copitz: Yeah, that was more your time than my time. My parents went there a lot.
Chris: Oh yeah, I remember. It was, uh, near where Spencer's is now, over there.
Copitz: Ah ha.
[jumpcut]
Chris: And which college are you going to?
Copitz: I'm hoping- umm, I'm graduating next year. I'm- I'm a junior in high school. So I'm, I'm hoping to go to VCU in Richmond. [Chris: Okay.] That would be cool.
[jumpcut]
Chris: My dad recommended PVCC so that's where I went. [Copitz: Yup, yeah?] He had this planned all the way out for me get me following his footsteps, but it just wasn't meant to be.
Copitz: Didn't work out, did it?
Chris: Yeah, sorry, sir. Sorry I lived for bigger and better things. [Chris laughs]
Copitz: Bob did some good things, didn't he?
Chris: Oh yes, he designed the controls for many a machine including steel mills, saw mills, plastic mill- I think one of them was a crane. I found, uh, in old filing cabinets, was like patents that he had made and filed and all that. So, completed patents right there. You can't find his records at GE cus he hadn't worked there for WAY more than ten years.
Copitz: Yeah, you probably feel bad having to sell some of his old stuff, don't you? But...
Chris: Yeah, ya know, it was pretty much that time was the postage stamps.
Copitz: You know what? I'm- I wanted to mention to you, somebody I saw- I don't know if you saw this in your replies on Twitter, but somebody had I think a great idea. I don't know if you'd want to do this, but, if you sold like one LEGO for a dollar, umm, each, then people could just pay a dollar and they could have a LEGO that was owned by you! And, it goes in an envelope so you don't have to pay any extra shipping.
Chris: [Clearly uninterested] Hmm, well... that's an... option...
Copitz: ?? idea. Y'know, it's all up to you, but I thought it was neat. [Chris: Yeah...]. So I know you're kind of, uhh, discouraged to- to apply for jobs 'cus of like people can just look up your name and see everything about you.
Chris: Yeah, background check. Plus, I've tried, and nobody ever calls me back!
Copitz: They yeah, y'know, it's sad but they might just look up your name and see all the stuff people have 07:43 about you, which is- it's a shame. Y'know, keep trying though. There are jobs out there that are made for- that are made for people that have trouble getting jobs. You'll find something, or hope so.
Chris: And some jobs just in the makin'.
[jumpcut]
Copitz: Do you maybe you'll ever think about going back to college?
Chris: Ehh, probably not. [Copitz: No?] Got too much going on on my plate.
Copitz: Yeah, at least right now. You never know about the future.
Chris: Yeah.
[jumpcut]
Copitz: When you like go out to eat, do you uhh, like, do you usually go with uhh, with your mom or?
Chris: Ehh, I end up going by myself.
Copitz: Does she not like- does she just eat at home?
Chris: Ehh, a lot of the time, but she can go out to eat too.
Copitz: Yeah. Nice and relaxing.
Chris: You know what's funny though? It made me think kinda, y'know? When one gets high and, y'know, it's like- I tend to get haunchy, and even sometimes-
Copitz: What does that mean? Haunchy?
Chris: It's like when you get drunk but rea-
when you're tired.
Copitz: Ahh, okay.
Chris: And like it happens not only when- it's like, especially when I'm really mentally tired, so it's like I could be physically going all over and I'm haun- mentally haunchy at the same time.
Copitz: Ahh.
Chris: Yeah, but then, uhh, also, I- I have uhh, drank- drank my share of alcohol, and it's like I fou- I found that I have such a great sense of self-awareness and, this applies for when I'm haunchy too, it's like I'm still self-aware. [Copitz: so -] But anyway, so, I- you can get me drunk and I'm still aware of everything around me. I've accidentally got high off of uhh, like cold medicine one time.
Copitz: Ooh, how'd that happen?
Chris: Ehh, just, y'know, took a little bit more than I oughta and it just... zoopf. But yeah, high is just not my general thing to- I'm definitely more sober.
Copitz: Okay, yeah, that's good. What's good for you but-
Chris: Yeah, life gets tough, but if you, uhh, stay sober you tend to... get through it under your own power and feel more power yourself that way.
Copitz: Yeah, that's true.
[jumpcut]
Copitz: I think we can all say when we found out, umm, like how close you live we were like "Wow, that's just crazy!" You hear about all this stuff online and... that's- it's a small world!
Chris: Yeah, small piece of Virginia, and CWCville's just north Vi- just in north Virginia!
Copitz: Is it? Where is CWCville exactly?
Chris: Ehh, I'd have to pull up a Virginia map, I'll do that right now. Ehh, look it up on my phone.
[Chris pulls out phone and an overlay appears shows the approximate location of CWCville to be around Fredericksburg, VA]
Chris: CWCville is right by R- near Fredericksburg.
Copitz: Fredericksburg
Lee: Oh! That's where I wanna be.
Chris: And you see the body of water because you remember there's a beachfront- there's like a beach front.
Copitz: Yup, right there at, uh, Rappahannock River.
Chris: Yeah.
Copitz: [to Lee] You said you wanna go to college there?
Lee: Yeah, Mary Washington, yeah, a school in Fredericksburg. Yeah, it's very nice there.
Copitz: I was in Fredericksburg a few weeks ago at the Rappahannock, it's definitely a nice place. I like it.
[jumpcut]
Copitz: Normally you charge maybe, what, $100 for like commissioned videos and stuff, err uh shoutouts, is that right?
Chris: Ehh, fifty to a hundred and negotiable.
Copitz: Yup, but you only charged us $30? [Chris: Ehhh] Thought it'd just be fun to hang out, maybe?
Chris: Yeah...
Copitz: Cut us some slack, as you said?
Chris: Yeah, make it easy for you- for y'all this time.
[Everyone thanks Chris]
[jumpcut]
Copitz: What kind of TV shows do you- do you maybe watch other than uhh My Little Pony?
Chris: I watch Frasier. [Collective "Oh!"] Friends, and recently my loves and I we were watching Mom on Hulu.
[jumpcut]
Chris: [singing with all half-joining] Billie Jean is not my lover!. She just a girl who says (sic) that I am the one! But the kiiiid is not my son!
