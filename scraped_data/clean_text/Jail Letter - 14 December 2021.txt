“
• THE FINAL COUNTDOWN FOR THIS EARTH IS ON.• TWO SUNS AND THE RED MOON OF YOUR DREAMS.
”
Chris's apocalyptic ramblings written on the envelope, 14 December 2021.
On 14 December 2021, Chris sent an eighth letter Kenneth Englehardt.
Some highlights of this letter include:
Chris demanding $200,000 to be sent to Barbara minimum. With no time index given it can be deduced that Chris wants to see the amount accumulated ASAP. He also felt the need to write down decimals in a round number.
This is not the first time that Chris has set a $200,000 money goal. In October of 2017, Chris put a $250,000 goal on his Patreon page to pay off the Chandler's debts, mainly the mortgage and credit card debt. The other $50,000 was for Chris as a reserve for a "rainy day", though it is likely that Chris would’ve spent it all on toys should he have received it.
In the wake of Barb's traffic accident and the totalling of Son-Chu, Chris seems more concerned with replacing the vehicle than with the physical well-being of his own mother.
"The final Countdown for this Earth is Now." Seems to imply another stage of the Dimensional Merge has initiated, even though Chris declared the final stages of the Merge were happening as he was being arrested on charges of incest on August 1st 2021.
The use of the word Tithes, albeit "kind tithes" might imply Chris views donations to Barb as an obligation of his "True and Loyal Fanbase".
Chris wrote that people can send Barbara checks, only to add the word valid later, implying that he is aware that people will likely send Barbara bad checks as an attempt at weenery.
Chris adds up the digits of the date to make 13 and then adds up the digits of 13 to make 4. Since Chris has previously indicated that he considers 13 an unlucky number, this may be meant as a bad omen, especially since 4 is considered an unlucky number as well in East Asian cultures.
In contrary to previous letters, the pages of this letter haven't been numbered in the top-left corner of the sheet with a circled number.

Hey Kenneth.
This letter, I consent and wish to be uploaded on to OnionFarms, shared with SomkeyMcCrack on his channel, and shared on Kiwi Farms, posthaste, please.
I wish to state to ALL of my kind and Genuine fans and followers my most personal and humblest of gratitude and appreciation. Your genuine love and compassion continues to humble and inspire me to be the Best Goddes Possible for and with ALL of you and everyone else in the Majority I shall save, and soon after, as well, draw, write, and share my numerous previously- written and drawn 100-plus "Sonichu" Books on Dearth in Universe 1C-211987.
On the flipside, I have expressed many a wish for All to Donate and pay kind Tithes and offerings to the Sonichu Temple (my home), and to Barbara Chandler, There. Barbara has informed me over the past couple of months that she has received NO such Donations via Mail, or received visitors. I have also informed you all in Truth that this was the foretold Storehouse you all were to donate to of Malachi in the Old Testament. And I know All of you have expressed genuine Interest in Barbara's History and stories. I feel baffled in finding such lack of compassion for Barbara that should have been equal to that I have, and continue to, receive. →
IF there is Anything All of you could have done for me in regards to the Holiday Season, at least, on top of actu-ally redeeming yourselves (from among the toxics and neutral-Bads), is to Send Barbara at The Sonichu Temple at least a total of $200,000.00 minimum, so the Mortgage and Debts can be paid, and she would buy herself a new Car to replace the van.
Valid Checks can be send to Barbara Chandler at 14 Branchland Ct. in Ruckersville, VA 22968-9545, regardless of the Timing of Events now.
The Final Countdown for this Earth is on Now.
I was praying to be able to have offered Blessings and reconsiderations in response to this by now, on this date of December 14, 2021. But I see in confirmation of this lack of compassion for Barbara.
Be safe and well
Sincerely,
Ms. Jesus Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu, the Goddess Blue Heart, Avatar, Lord, Messiah, Savior, and God of all.
I shall see you all of the Majority on the Original, Recombined Earth after I shift you all of the collective after and upon my Second Coming.
