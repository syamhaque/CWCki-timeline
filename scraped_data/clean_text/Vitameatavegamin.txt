From the I Love Lucy scene.
Vitameatavegamin is a video Chris uploaded on 18 October 2010. In it, Chris repeats, almost verbatim, a well-known bit from the I Love Lucy TV show, where Lucy hawked a patent medicine.
Without the main punchline of the original (Lucy trying out the medicine for herself while rehearsing the commercial and discovering it tastes really bad - as it's mainly alcohol - thus resulting in her flubbing her takes) it's basically just a bland, shot-for-shot remake of the said bit. Then again, even if he kept what made the original scene funny, it'd probably still be of the same quality.
