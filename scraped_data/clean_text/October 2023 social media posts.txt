Wait why did you green screen yourself into the Roman colosseum

Chris
It’s the Royal Albert Hall, for obvious reasons.
Chris is still mad about MLP G5
18 October
Equestria Daily
The G5 comic Black, White, & Blue has officially released today! I love how many side series we are getting for the comics lately.
Go check it out: equestriadaily.com/2023/10/my-little-pony-black-white-blue.html
Chris 12:56 PM
NOBODY Cares for MLP G5; Resume Friendship is Magic Already, @Hasbro, Please!
I Literally Foreknew and Foretold how Premature and Awful G5 was to be.
#PsychicPowers #Avatar #JesusChristIsRightHere
Chris 12:59 PM
Still have not watched ANY of MLPG5 At All, and I Never Shall until AFTER My Little Pony - Friendship is Magic, Season 14 Episode 26 is aired on tv, streaming services and all, @Hasbro
Chris 1:03 PM
Here, @Hasbro, I’ll make this EASY for you, so Heed My Input and do it: hire everyone of G4 cast and crew back, and with John DeLancy as Discord, start with Discord telling everyone G5 is undone and resume G4 from there. Definitely get Faust back on as well. Nightstar and I are more than happy to help, personally.

Elon Musk

Chris 1:07 PM
And on an unrelated note, Verification Process improvement aside, but the price is not needed for that, @elonmusk really has fucked Twitter up.
Nobody, not even I, will ever refer to it as “X”; that is just as Stupid Y Stupid (tonto y tonto) as Team Rocket and Giovanni, period.
Chris 1:08 PM
Phew!
It feels really good to finally get that off of my mind and back.
Chris's thoughts on Israel and Ukraine
18 October
Carrie Krueger
@CPU_CWCSonichu What’s your input on what’s going on in Israel?
Chris 1:12 PM
Demons and Devils are literally at work on both sides there.
Chris 1:18 PM
Also, Putin shall die by his own sword, I heavily support and supported Ukraine 🇺🇦 in defenses amidst my work.
And the Ukraine girl sitting by POTUS Lisa Simpson in the circle meditation drawing, in a Church in Israel with that church’s Israeli priest there leading the circle, was an escapee from that WWIII that Lisa adopted.

Favorite Mane 6

In response to a tweet asking people which one of the main 6 characters from My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic is their favorite.
Rainbow Dash and Applejack are tied as my top faves.
Yet I also identify with Princess Twilight Sparkle.
Etsy Store update
22 October
5:47 PM
Hey, everyone.
I am very well aware of the orders that have been coming in on my Etsy store.
The Medallion stock is low, but we are personally restocking with personal crafting, painting and certification.
Please, remain patient as we restock and complete the orders.
The wait will be worth it.
Thank you all for the continued support and kindness.

She speaks truth

She speaks truth; meditate on it for yourselves.

[Links to a YouTube video titled Find Your Purpose By Doing THIS]
Transcript of the video
Teal Swan: Purpose is not something you can find. It is something that falls in your lap as a result of following your emotions in the direction of what feels good, and that is a moment to moment choice. If you can't find your purpose, it's because you're not doing that moment to moment. You're falling into a common trap, which is that you're looking for purpose to make you feel happy, instead of looking for happiness in the moment. So, right here in this minute, what would make you feel better?
Minecraft server

11:11 AM

Send inquiries to cwcvilleguardian@gmail.com if interested.

Apple a day keeps the doctor away. Oranges have Vitamin C for Defenses. Banana, Strawberries and Cherries are also good.

can someone please give me an alternative theory as to who that is in this picture so I can sleep at night, because my initial assumption is no good. k thx
Chris
No, GiBi, that is, indeed you; no alternative theory.
You have gone back in time to February, 2006, as did Lightning Bliss and a number of others.
