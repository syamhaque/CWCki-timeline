Subject: Sonichu Concept
From: Vivian Gee
Sun 11/04/07 1:06 AM
I am Vivian Gee, originator of the Sonichu concept. I have noticed that you have a strikingly similar character that I have created. Some people have accused me of stealing your idea and I would like it if you could announce that I have not stolen from you.
I would really appreciate that.
~Vivi G
An initial attempt at trolling Chris in 2007, when she claimed to own Sonichu.
Subject: RE: Please, Don't do this.
From: Vivian Gee

JESUS, ARE YOU SO HIGH ON YOUR HORSE THAT YOU THINK IT'S FAN ART?!
JESUS CHRIST MAN, YOU ARE IRRITATING ME. YOU ARE PUTTING ME UNDER MORE DAMN STRESS THEN YOU'LL EVER HAVE.
I ALREADY BROKE UP WITH MY BOYFRIEND AND COLLEGE AIN'T HELPIN' SHIT. YOU AND YOUR CLAIMS OF OF YOUR PRECIOUS CHARACTERS THAT MEAN NOTHING TO ANYONE.
THEY MEAN FUCKING NOTHING TO ANYONE CUZ THEY ARE WORTHLESS TO EVERYONE. YOU THINK YOU HAD A WORSE WEEKEND HUH!? THEN TELL ME YOUR STORY AND I MIGHT FEEL SOME DAMN PITY.
I WANT TO EXPRESS MY GOD DAMN SELF TO THE INTERNET AND I FIND THAT SOME PRICK WHO THINKS HE'S SO GREAT, CAN CALL HOMOSEXUALS WRONG (AND I HAVE TWO LESBIAN FRIENDS WHO WOULD BE OFFENDED AS FUCK BY YOUR IGNORANCE) AND THINKS THAT GOING AROUND STALKING GIRLS WILL GET YOU A GIRLFRIEND.
NEWS FLASH, BITCH, YOU MEAN NOTHING TO THIS WORLD AND YOU WILL NEVER GET FUCKING LAID UNLESS YOU IMPROVE YOURSELF
YOUR TROUBLES WITH JERKOPS ISN'T BECAUSE OF THEM, IT'S BECAUSE OF YOU
FUCK OFF AND DIE
- VIVIAN GEE
A tough love attempt at trying to help him. Spoiler alert: It didn't work.
Subject: Just some advice kid...
From: Vivian Gee
Wed 11/07/07 2:29 AM
as a girl, I think I'd like to know what women want.
here's just one hint.
get rid of that damn medallion.
just destroy it and show the world that you mean business
that'll help you a bit
i mean honestly, that sonichu thing just turns most women off.
if you really do hang out at the same places, destroying it and showing it to the world might be a way to improve your image
i'll stop.
~vivi g
She tried to help get rid of the medallion, never realizing shoving it up his ass would be easier.
Subject: Liquid fears you.
From: Vivian Gee
Thu 8/07/08 3:02 AM
I have been speaking with Liquid and he's not really afraid of the Hatred from others.
What he does fear is you. Telling others that you hate him isn't going to do as much as you telling him directly.
~ LOVE VIVI
Nine months go by, and Chris posts his DYKES-DYKES-CHINA video. Vivian attempts to contact him again.
Subject: ViviG, someone is digging up the old news...
From: Chris
Sat 8/16/08 4:54 AM
Firstly, after checking my saved e-mail from you, I wish to apologize for not offering my input on your part of Sonichu in the long time. To make up for that, in case you haven't heard, I have got back to work on Sonichu #7, one page at a time. I've already promised a 2 or 3-page "In-Comic" interview with one Sonichu1985, AKA Robert Simmons, based on his YouTube videos, but I believe that I WILL have a few more free pages after doing his interview, so with your permission, I can interview you as well, based on what I've seen on your deviantART page. And if I come up with additional questions, I will ask you.
Now, on a more urgent matter, the dickheads behind the cursed Encyclopedia Dramatica webpage, are bring up the outdated rumor of you creating Sonichu before me, which as I recollect from my saved e-mails from you, you've apologized to me, and you've relinquished assumed ownership on Sonichu. I ask you, as a friend, to log onto ED, and set the record straight. You may wish to upload your later art to prove yourself to be who you are; my best lesbian friend, Anna McLerran, AKA "Anniebanny", created the "ChadamRocket" account on ED to speak in my defense, and I quote,
"I wrote that blog back when I didn't know Chris personally. I got to know him soon after that, and we became real friends. He's a really nice guy, with a great sense of humor. Yes, to the outsider he is quirky, and some of his actions and the things he says can be funny, but at the same time he cares deeply about his friends, and all the other good stuff nobody looking at this page wants to hear about. I just wanted to put that out there, though, since I obviously can't permanently delete the blog inclusion. I'll just have to wait until this whole website is shut down for good."
You may also send a message to Anna via e-mail at sketchybananinja@hotmail.com, or through MySpace from her page at http://www.myspace.com/annamclerran. I Promise you, Vivian, that Anna is my trusted friend.
Right, as for the image(s) you may upload, may I suggest those that I've found interesting on your page, "CC and MisD Adventures 1", "Another old chris and misdrea", or "vivi profile 8."
Please set the record straight for me as a friend. :)
Peace;
Christian C.
Chris apparently cares more about Sonichu than his real life endeavors.
Subject: Ugh Chris, do you not understand what you're doing wrong? (About the latest Rosechu comic...)
From: Vivian Gee
Wed 9/10/08 4:37 AM
First off, no one really wants to know how two made up hedgehogs have sex.
No one. People would rather find out how actual people have sex.
Not hedgehogs.
Second off, proving something about woman's rights or something by having a girl strip naked...that's a conflicting message.
I don't know what kind of message you are trying to portray.
You say you care about women yet your pictures and other sayings all conflict with one another.
I honestly don't know what to feel except one thing...
To quote the great Asuka, "Disgusting."
Third off, you should have better judgment when adding in jokes. That Obama joke comes off extremely racist.
You clearly make the joke about his skin color with him repainting the White House black.
If your father or mother have been teaching you this kind of thing, just...just learn to think for yourself. Please.
Chris, you've got a way to fall.
-Vivian Gee.
Chris apparently didn't care. No reply.
Subject: Because no one else is going to explain it to you. Jason Howell has NOTHING to do with the ED page.
From: Vivian Gee
Thu 9/11/08 5:18 PM
You can pester him all you want, but he has no control over the ED page.
He has done absolutely nothing but claim he created it. He hardly did shit to the page.
If you want to bring the page down, you will have to speak with the following people
Joseph Evers, the owner.
Girlvinyl, the founder.
Ghettofinger, the developer.
Crayolacrime, the admin.
Weev, the attorney.
http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Encyclopedia_Dramatica
You can find their information in the box with information.
Many people contribute to ED, but those are the people who run it.
They are the only ones who have the power to bring the page down.
I still don't know why I'm explaining this to you. You need to figure this shit out yourself man.
Also, 4chan or "4-cent garbage" also has nothing to do with ED. The people at 4chan detest ED despite all you may have heard.
But really...
It's just best to let it go, the page will stay up forever. It may haunt you, but you'll have to get over it.
Chris still didn't care. No reply.
Subject: This will be my last message to you unless you reply. This message will be about everything.
From: Vivian Gee
Fri 9/12/08 4:07 PM
I don't know where to begin.
I'm not even sure why I'm sending this to you.
Listen to me.
Listen.
No one gives two shits that your pictures are now all on the internet for everyone to see. Tons of celebrities have nudes and they don't care. They're way more popular than you'll ever be, so don't get your fucking panties in a bunch.
Sonichufan is a fucking troll. Why else would he be the one to set you up with Kawaii? Can't you understand that? I mean, all he's doing is imitating your mannerisms. Look at his latest video. He stuffed his shirt so he can look more like you. I can't believe you're still so naive.
There are no fans of Sonichu. Sonichu is a bastardization of properties that belong to other people. Your entire comic is pretty much a bastardization of your life. Sonichu will never get anywhere. Quit your dreams of Sonichu (the game, the comic, merchandise, everything) now, and if you still feel a need to be "creative" or whatever bullshit you say, make something completely original. Don't base it off your life, don't base it off stuff that exists. Just make something completely new.
If you quit Sonichu and start working on your real life harder, I'm sure you'll find success. If you stay in your deluded fantasyland, I don't know what you will become.
You have never tried when it comes to women. Never. You can't just sit around and wait for it to happen. You have to make it happen. If you can't muster up the courage to do that, then you will never get a wife, letalone a girlfriend. There are places where single men and women go to, I'll let you find them on your own in your area.
Take off that medallion. I can't stress this enough. If you do, it will signify your detachment from Sonichu, and a brighter future.
Forget about all those "haters", they don't hate you. They are trolling you. They want to see you become this way. Don't you understand, there is no reason for you to get upset about them. That's what they want. If they see you upset, defeated, angry, you're just giving them the victory. Your latest comics as a retaliation is a result of that, and they love it. They don't view it as an attack. They view it as victory.
If you feel you can't do any of this, get a therapist. A real one. Ask your parents to send you to one. Do something about your life instead of bitch and draw comics about it.
Chris, you've got a way to fall. But you can change that.
- Vivian Gee
No reply, again. We can see that, by trying to be a white knight, she is still a better person than Chris will ever be.
Subject: Listen, please. I broke my promise to stop the contact. This is how severe it's gotten.
From: Vivian Gee
Sat 9/27/08 1:23 AM
Chris, you have to listen to me.
Please.
For God's sake man, you need to stop trusting everyone on the internet. Go outside, meet women like you used to.
The good days for you man, don't you want those back? Get off the internet!
Panda is a troll, she is just setting you up for a fall.
Reply telling me you acknowledge this
Please.
Vivian
After warning him about Blanca, SonichuFan1985 and Panda, Chris finally listens!
Subject: none
Sat 9/27/08 10:46 AM
From: Chris
I have read, understood and acknowledged your e-mail, Vivian. Listen I receive a lot of UNBELIEVABLE e-mails about putting down my Panda, saying that she is a troll. Well, she and I have a True, Honest Relationship between her and me. Unless I have HARD evidence proving that for real, NOT the LAME evidence like Mudkips, Pickles, web-documents and digital text. Like an audio recording of her voice, talking to someone on the dark side, or a video of the same thing that was not CROPPED and EDITED or whatever. When such CONCRETE evidence arises, I'll be more inclined to believe you, as well as the popular opinion.
Peace,
Christian C.
Another thing, Vivian,
Sat, 27 Sep 2008 12:21:50 -0400
without total realization, I have uploaded a few of your works (Sonichu-Related) onto my SonichuSite accout; may I continue to upload the rest of what I have from you and quote you, or just leave them off my database, and quote you only through YOUR deviantART account. I have added your Sonichu Fanartwork into my Vivian G Folder. Please Reply with your answer.
Peace,
Christian C.
Only to care more about Sonichu, still.

Chris,
no one likes sonichu, the only reason we "like" sonichu is because the entire idea is stupid
nintendo and sega will never make sonichu a reality
just...just look at all the games out there today
they have ORIGINAL characters with ORIGINAL stories (well at least a few of them)
sonichu and all of his stupid furry friends are just ripoffs of mostly just sonic team characters
black sonichu? obviously a rip off of shadow.
fuckin' you know those chaotic combo things. all just sonic recolored and given an element. punchy is also knuckles just in hedgehog form
you gotta stop with the sonichu
forever
FOREVER
ARE YOU LISTENING
I HAD TO PUT TOGETHER THOSE AUDIOBOOKS
I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, I HAVE SEEN EVERY SINGLE SONICHU STRIP
THE ONLY REASON SO MANY PEOPLE LIKE IT IS BECAUSE IT IS SO PATHETIC THAT IT'S HUMOROUS
BUT I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO THINK THAT, YOU TAKE SONICHU SERIOUSLY
NO ONE DOES
NO ONE ARE YOU LISTENING
LISTEN TO ME STOP SONICHU NOW
JUST STOP IT
TAKE DOWN THE WEBSITE MAKE SOMETHING NEW DO SOMETHING MORE WITH YOUR "CREATIVITY" THAT YOU OH SO CLAIM TO HAVE
LISTEN TO ME
COME ON
REPLY
i'm sleepy
-vivian
And no reply.
Subject: I hope you still watch ED closely.
From: Vivian Gee
Tue 9/30/08 11:57 PM
Even though you seem to have disappeared, they still manage to get things.
Like your CD. Whoever you gave the CD out to, they are part of ED.
Stop trusting people so closely Chris, you're going to get hurt.
Vivian.
Still no reply.
Subject: Guess I was wrong. Blanca has been a troll from the start.
From: Vivian Gee
Wed 10/01/08 8:08 PM
She could have fooled me.
She's been a troll this entire time, orchestrating the break up and the reuniting of you two.
Don't you dare let her near you, she is just going to steal your things.

Listen, Chris. I'm the last one trying to help you. Honest to fucking god.
Vivian
Again, no reply.
