================================================================================

"Christian and the Hedgehog Boys Theme" is the eighth and final track from Christian and the Hedgehog Boys's self-titled debut. Notably, it is sung over an instrumental version of the song, "Open Your Heart" by Crush 40. This is a major step up for Chris, as this way he isn't competing with the lyrics, as in most of his covers. He still sings pretty terribly, though.
Until Chris officially released a lyric sheet in 2021, the low volume of the vocal track relative to the instrumental track made the song's lyrics extremely difficult to parse. As the CWCki's best attempt to decipher the lyrics was the listener's only reference for years, its incomplete version thereof has been a substantial influence on cover artists and Christorians, and is preserved for historical interest.

Sung lyrics
[sung over Sons of Angels's "Open Your Heart" (instrumental) from NASCAR Arcade and Sonic Adventure.]
Christian and the Hedgehog Boys
Zipping along, rockin' with joy!
Guitars and rockin' speedsters
And many fans with cheers!
Shadow and Black Sonichu,
The dark half can rock too!
Sonichu and Sonic,
Rockin' in the atomic!
And the leader who put the band together
Singin' with his soul
His name is Christian Chandler!
Rockin' with adventures
and without stopping!
Runnin' faster than sound
And zappin' with lightning!
Instruments of rhythm
Listening to their souls
We are setting out on a mission
Christian and the Hedgehog Boys will rock your world!
Rock your world!
Yeah, yeah!
Rockin' with adventures
and without stopping!
Runnin' faster than sound
And zappin' with lightning
Instruments of rhythm
Listening to their souls
We are setting out on a mission
Christian and the Hedgehog Boys will rock your world!
Rock your world!
Yeah, oh yeah!
Printed lyrics
Christian and the Hedgehog Boys, zipping along, rocking with joy.
Guitars, and rockin' speedsters, and many fans with cheers.
Shadow and Black Sonichu; the dark half can rock too.
Sonichu and Sonic, rockin' in the atomic.
And the leader who put the band together, singin' with his soul, his name is Christian Chandler.
(Repeat the following few lines twice)
Rockin' with adventures, and without stopping.
Runnin' faster than the speed of sound, and zappin' with lightning.
Instruments of rhythm; listening to their souls.
We are setting out on a mission.
Christian and the Hedgehog boys will rock your world.
Rock Your World! Yeah, Yeah!
Chris's official lyric sheet, written as prose without line breaks. No wonder his timing is so awful.
Lyrics as formerly interpreted by the CWCki
Christian and the Hedgehog Boys!
Zipping along! Rockin' with joy!
Guitars, drums, and seniors!
[Unintelligible] with you!
Shadow! Black Sonichu!
The dark half can rock you!
Sonichu and Sonic
Rockin' in the atomic!
And the leader who put the band together
Singin' with this song!
His name is Christian Chandler!
Rockin' with adventures
and without stopping!
Runnin' faster than sound!
[Unintelligible] my day!
It's a mental rhythm
Listening to their songs!
We are setting out on a mission!
Christian and the Hedgehog Boys will ROCK THE WORLD!
Rock the world!
Yeah, yeah!
Rockin' with adventures
and without stoppin'!
Runnin' faster than sound
And zappin' with lightning!
It's a mental rhythm
Listenin' to their songs!
We are setting out on a mission!
Christian and the Hedgehog Boys will rock the world!
Christian and the Hedgehog Boys will rock a world!
Yeah!
Oh, yeah!
