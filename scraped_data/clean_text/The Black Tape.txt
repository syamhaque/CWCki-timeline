The "Black Tape" is the unofficial name given to an audio recording of a Skype call between Chris, Jackie and some other trolls that involved Chris being emotionally distraught at the death of his father.
Some time between 7 and 8 September 2011, Marvin and the other trolls attempted to contact Chris over the phone shortly after Bob's death for unclear reasons; and Chris was noted to be audibly upset as he cried throughout the conversation. While the audio was recorded and archived, the call was deemed to be so upsetting and morose that the trolls who had the call in their possession opted to never release it to the public. What makes this stand out is that the trolls who participated in the call realized after the fact that it was simply too soon to try to reach out to Chris in this fashion and, for a change, opted to respect his privacy for once.
As of 2025, the Black Tape remains a piece of Lost Media. It either still exists in the hands of the trolls who participated in its creation, or it has been lost to time.[1]

Jackie Email
On 9 June 2013, Marvin leaked the very last email that Chris had sent to Jackie, where he unexpectedly talks about the death of Bob.[2]
The next day, Marvin then answered in response to a user's comment,[3] "As for the rest of the Jackie mails... I hope they illustrate how Chris felt about Bob's death a little bit more. Marvin has said numerous times that Bob's death really fucked up Chris, but it's been hard to see. Even this e-mail could be seen as Chris being angry at the Reaper for BEAKING HIS PROMISE, rather than him being devastated by his father's death.":
He kinda got worse past this point. Hell, he might've been worse before it too and just calmed down a bit to bitch about the broken promise. I don't remember the details. He was sobbing at times though. I do remember that.
The topic was then split to a separate thread by forum administration in which users discussed the unreleased call.[4]
In response to a user's comment, "You heard him?":
Yes.
The other user replied, "The implications! Can we get to know more?".
Another user commented, "I would guess some evil trolls hacked Jackie's skype and listened in. I also doubt any of that would ever be released as there's no humour and I think even OPL gets to have some privacy when he grieves."
Marvin replied:
This. That stuff's not getting out.
Interview with Marvin
Marvin had given further details about the tape on 14 July 2025 after a Kiwi Farms user asked him about it:[5]

I know it's been 10+ years ago at this point, but I am a bit curious about "The Black Tape". I don't want specific details, but are you able to tell me what the vibe/mood was at the time for you and/or Chris? Was Chris inconsolable at that point? I know he took Bob's death pretty hard, but I guess I'm looking at it in more of an insightful angle.
Edit: I may have found my answer: https://kiwifarms.st/threads/undropped-jackie-email-september-7-2011.1185/
its fine if you dont want to answer
Marvin
My memory of it is fuzzy today as well but some details stuck.
Yeah, he was pretty much inconsolable. Chris was a manchild and because Barb was the coddling parent while Bob was sort of the hardass, Chris sorta took Bob for granted up until the end. But he really loved Bob more than I think even he realized at the time until he was gone. The thing was, like sure, he'd cuddle with Barb and watch TV, but much of his daylight hours and time outside of the house were often spent socializing with Bob. They'd go out and get lunch or breakfast and sit and talk. Bob was his main social outside aside from us.
So when Bob died, and especially because Chris being a naive manchild, didn't see it coming, it hit him like a ton of bricks. He was sobbing, like the sort of sobbing you see with really distraught people on the news during a crisis.
The calls involved some chick (or some of the guy trolls) talking to Chris over skype, but streaming the call over to the group in real time. And invariably, someone in the group would be recording from that livestream. This is where all the recordings came from.
So we were all sitting around, and sure, we figured Chris would be a little sad, but we never expected a spectacle like *that*. So when it happened and the troll (forget who it was) awkwardly consoled Chris and hung up, we agreed that was one recording that never needed to see the light of day.
I'm sure it's floating around on and old hard drive in someone's basement somewhere. Though none I have. I used to be a pretty spergy digital hoarder, but I gave that up long ago. I'm sure whatever hard drive of mine had it is dead in a landfill somewhere. Probably an old sata drive, considering the timeframe.

Thanks for your insightful answer. That's the kind of vibe I got from reading the email you posted. I read it and thought, "I feel like Chris would cry like how a mother loses her child, kind of war cry". I felt that Chris would scream and cry in a way that you would know it fucked him up. I guess my last question is, do you know how long that call was? I am curious to know if this was an hour of the trolls talking to Chris, or was it a multi-hour thing listening to Chris cry about it.
I think you guys made the right choice in not releasing it because I don't know how I would feel seeing Chris so emotional.
Marvin
Frankly I think it might've been a half an hour or less. It really took us by surprise and the troll on the phone had nothing really to say to him. It was a lot of awkward silences.
