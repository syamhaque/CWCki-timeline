Title: The Place chats - Avatar State

================================================================================

Delusion disclosure: This article or section takes place during Chris's phase of role-playing as Sonichu. He may refer to his Christine Chandler personality and physical body in the third person by using terms such as "mama".
In this conversation, Chris discusses with the Watchmen member Kyle about his discovery of "deeper meditation" or what he calls "The Avatar State", a concept apparently introduced to him by the Praetor associate Isabella Janke, who Chris mistakenly referred to as "one of our Praetor group friends". This led to one of the Watchmen believing she could have been partly responsible for the Goochland speech.
The conversation also provides hints as to what his relations to Bella may have been like prior to his arrest. While Kyle describes the animation she made as being "the gratuitous porny one" and her as a "sycophant", Chris appears to have held a much more favorable opinion of her.

Chris
Hey, y'all. Today was yet another real doozy with a bunch more constant meditation. I've ended up learning about the deeper meditation that this body tends to do at times that I, as the soul host during this time, or Chris if she was in this body, can resume control and take advantage of. Borrowing the term from the Nickelodeon show: being in the Avatar State.
Kyle
So, like a remote desktop?
Chris
The term was brought to my attention today by Bella, and it piqued my curiosity, so I looked up its definition; even saw the episode titled "The Avatar State". What this is similar to what happens. It involves Chris Core (of the Solar Plexus (to correct the misunderstood chakra term of Sacral; that's below the Solar and above the Root) essentially taking over conscious control of the body and brain, and even able to access the powers and abilities from deeper within the body.
So, yeah, I have this topic some further thought. This can also be comparable to when Star Butterfly transformed and flew through portals in her sleep for a time; her Star Core, if you will, taking conscious control over the body while Star, herself, was temporarily disabled and unconscious.
Also watched the movie "Soul" on Disney+ today; really good movie.

Who is Bella?
Chris
As for me, though, not totally unconscious, but left in observation mode while Chris Core had control of the body in the Avatar State (I feel like there is a different term synonymous to that), I remain somewhat conscious. And I can regain control should I fell need to and have a reason.
Chris
One of our Praetor group friends, she's the one who made up the lovely animation:

Ah, I see

Kyle
Hopefully not the one who made those mock edits to the speech.
Oh ya, the gratuitous porny one?
Chris
We are not judging, plus she's actually cool to talk with.
Kyle
Judgement is good, sycophants are cheap.
Chris
Anyway, pretty much a let-you-know on this bit of progress in figuring out the further details of Chris' body's abilities and powers.
