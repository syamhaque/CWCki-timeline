“
Actually, it is fact that when you daydream, you are seeing into another dimension.
”

Background
In his List of OkCupid Answers from 2009 and 2014, Chris put down "sometimes" for the question "Do you space out or daydream a lot?" In his profile from 2009, he also put down that he preferred his partner "never / rarely" do it.
List of daydreams
On 19 November 2020, Chris had a "premonition vision" that the "moon was full and it was looking really close to Earth, also it looked like it was daytime." Given the vagueness of Chris's comment, Kyle asked, "So?" and Chris angrily replied, "What do you mean “So?”? It’s a premonition. A vision of forewarning." The following day, Chris claimed another vague detail about chaotic ocean waves.[2]
On 22 November 2020, Chris had a vision about the Chris Chan doppelgangers which had been spawned by a spell Jacob Sockness had cast. In his vision, he believed that one such doppelganger to be working at Manchester High and would die by either suicide or a heart attack so that the doppelganger's power could be absorbed by the main Chris Chan for breaking the Iron Curtain.[2]
On 1 February 2021, Chris had a "deep meditate session" in which he envisioned that, in ancient times, he had been a deity guiding the wizard ancestors of Sarah Hammer and Wes Iseli.[3]
