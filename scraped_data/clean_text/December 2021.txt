C-Mas card sent by Chris to Kengle
December was the twelfth and final month of 2021. Chris remained in jail for the entire month, presumably celebrating Christmas in the pokey. The biggest revelation of the month was that Barbara instigated a serious car accident in late November, causing serious damage to both herself and Son-Chu.

Highlights
1 December - Two additional letters, one from 25 October and the other from 30 October, which Chris had written to Kenneth Engelhardt are posted publicly.
2 December - A day which was "VERY Cosmically Eventful" according to Chris, apparently because it can be written as a palindrome (12/02/2021). Chris "observed" the date and later asked Kenneth if he had done the same.[1]
3 December - The jail letter addressed to Onion Farms user Celestia from 30 November is received and posted online.
6 December - Chris writes and sends the sixth letter addressed to Kenneth.[1]
7 December - The jail letter addressed to Twitter user Eels and the Egg-man from 30 November is received and posted online.
8 December - Kenneth reveals that he has received a fifth jail letter from Chris describing a car accident Barbara was involved in on 24 November which totaled her car and put her in the hospital. Kenneth does not make the letter public at the request of Chris. It also contains personal information about Chris's relatives.
9 December - Chris writes and sends the second jail letter to Onion Farms user Celestia. Chris bizarrely claims that Jacob Sockness started the COVID-19 Pandemic.
10 December - Chris draws "The Sonichu Temple's Relocation."
11 December
Kenneth reveals that he has received a sixth jail letter from Chris, this one concerning Null.
A Kiwi Farms user confirms that the Barbara automobile accident did actually happen (though apparently on the 23rd, not the 24th) by looking up the Vehicle Identification Number of the Dodge Caravan.[2]
12 December
Chris's Affirmations List‎‎, from March 2021, is leaked.
The jail letter from 6 December is posted online in full.[1]
13 December - Kenneth receives and posts a Christmas post card that Chris wrote to him at an unknown date.
14 December - The jail letter from 9 December is received via Discord.[3]
16 December - Larry Vaughn posts on Reddit about his latest visit to 14 Branchland Court. In this post, he claims that most of the hoard was cleaned, though some of Chris's stuff is still present, and that the house appeared to be for sale.[4] A Kiwi Farms post made a few days afterwards would dispute the claim of it being for sale.[5]
25 December - Chris's first C-Mas while in jail.
29 December - Barbara was found to be at fault for last month's car accident, and was charged a $30 fine and $76 in court costs.[6]
