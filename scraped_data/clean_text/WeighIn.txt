================================================================================

WeighIn is a video Chris uploaded on 25 October 2010, in which Chris, to the surprise of us all, steps on a scale to weigh himself. The scale gives a weight of 216 lb (15 st 6 lb / 98 kg). There is some speculation as to whether or not Chris offset the scale, but in any case, it didn't do any good; based on BMI, this weight implies that he is obese for a man of even his claimed height (5'10" / 178 cm).[1] Admittedly, BMI is a flawed metric, which doesn't take into account muscle mass or build, but in any case Chris has almost no muscles and has quite a thin build.
It is also revealed that Chris is wearing blue Crayola Model Magic around the bridge of his glasses.

[Aims camera, jerkily, at scale readout.]
If I can stay still long enough.
Hmmm.
Anyway it says 216.
