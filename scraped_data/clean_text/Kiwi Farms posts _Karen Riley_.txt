Art Commission
1 November 2015[1]
So I asked Chris to draw Sonichu, Inos and Meaowthkip hanging out... I have no idea what Meaowthkip is doing
Face Drawing
14 December 2015[2]
So I asked Chris if he could draw a coloured sketch of me... :(
Unpaid Video
26 December 2015[3]
In a thread on Holiday Greetings to Karen Riley:
I'm not adverse to giving Chris money (when it's not 500 dollars in a Visa gift card) but I didn't pay Chris a penny for this. I told him a sample video greeting would drive up sales, but I didn't, I didn't expect this.
Ethics
26 December 2015[4]
Like I say, I've never been against morally sending Chris money, I mean my profile photo is a donation sketch he drew of my face, which is how he got the photograph of me to begin with. I personally don't find paying fifty dollars for a video to be good value for money but that's not because I think Chris is an evil bastard who doesn't deserve a penny like some people believe.
A couple of Facebook posts and a few brilliant videos aside the people who get so uptight and angry over people giving money to Chris were almost as funny in 2015 as Chris was.
My problem with Sonic Rainboom and his 500 dollar visa gift card wasn't even that he did it, it's that he then proceeded to post on here like he was some sort of master troll and expected us to shower him with praise for his efforts. There's a big difference between that and paying Chris for art.
Spend Amount
28 December 2015[5]
In response to Sonic Rainboom's comment, "$50 for this drawing. Chris did the video for free, but it was an advertisement to try to get another $50.
I don't really have a problem with people giving Chris money, but let's be clear about what's happening here: Chris is getting money.":
I paid Chris 50 dollars for a commission in early November and another 20 for a sketch this month. I've never said I have a problem with giving Chris money, what I had a problem with was you then proceeding to brag about spending 500 dollars on Chris and how much of an epic win troll that made you.
I've never claimed that spending money on Chris made me a successful troll or provided any insight into Chris, if you earn your own money you can spend it on whatever entertainment you want.
I think most people are over chastising you for giving Chris that 500 dollar gift card, myself included now. Going after me and making constant jibes about people's reaction to your gift is doing you no favours.
Poem Explanation
26 January 2016[6]
In a thread on Update 1/25/2016, in which Chris read her poem on video:
I thought Chris being given a poem would make him feel happier and more confident that he has actual fans who'll support him instead of just a sea of faceless haters who wish nothing but failure on him.
I'll admit the poem wasn't amazing but if he'd read it with something more than the enthusiasm of a deadpan 'seasick crocodile,' it might have not been just as awful
Blocked by Chris
5 August 2017[7]
In a post on the subject of Karen tweeting at Chris about DoopieDoOver:
I replied to this telling Chris he needed to realise that Doopie wasn't his friend and to stop harassing her since she specifically said he wasn't her friend and got this before being blocked.
(:_( I don't think I deserve blocked just for telling Chris the truth. He really hates the fact that Doopie specifically shut down any chance of friendship
