Beedee, Beedee, Beedee; I’m Back, Buck! is a video Chris uploaded on the 4th of May 2018.
In this video update, Chris apologizes for 'the lack of progress' on Sonichu, after angry fans complained about his lack of work on the comics they pay for monthly via his Patreon account. He also announces an exclusive comic for his Patrons about himself, Magi-Chan and Cryzel Rosechu.
The title of the video may be a reference to the TV series Buck Rogers of the 25th Century.
