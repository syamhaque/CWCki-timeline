Optimus Prime: [-o?] Son-Chu. By request of mayor Robert Franklin Chandler Jr. of the city of Cwcville, as well as Magi-Chan Sonichu, you and your Autobot team are hereby requested and destinated to go protect and defend the city of Cwcville with the others. I will trust you to do that. I leave it up to you to protect the city of Cwcville, along with the- your fellow Autobots and your team, as well as the Sonichus and Rosechus. With the present mayor, as well as the future mayor herself after him. I'm trusting you all you will do a good job.
Son-Chu: Yes, sir! I'll do my best, sir!
Excelina: [Four mouth noises imitating movement.] Hello, sir!
Optimus Prime: Ah, yes, Excelina. How may I help you?
Excelina: I've come with a present from you. From Cwcville Pizzeria! Here you are, a big box of...
Optimus Prime toy: Mmm! Pizza bagels! Yum! Let me have it!
Excelina: Yes, sir.
Optimus Prime: [Eating noises.] [Groan that's supposed to be a belch.] Ah, yes. Very good, really good, really good. Thank you Excelina, and I'll trust you to do very well in the city of Cwcville. Now both of you, go forth!
Son-Chu and Excelina: Yes, sir!
Alpha Trion: [Scream coming from off-screen.] YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNG WARRIORS! [Enters scene after video cut.] Young warriors, lishen to me now, for my advice is relevant to today's standards.
Son-Chu: Eh, I wonder what he means by that.
Alpha Trion: When an Internet bully or cyber-troll is bothering you a whole lot, ignorance is truly bliss against thy foes. Report the emails, and all the haters and fakers on the social media, and block them all.
Son-Chu: He's right you know. So, you approach- you find a hater, somebody that's just giving you really bad commentary, just block them. Ignore them. Ignore all the comments that are not beneficial. And all you haters and fakers? Stop it. Stop hating and faking yourselves, and start being honest and good with others and yourself. Alright? It's enough about that.
Chris: Okay, breaking the fourth wall here. Have a good day, all of you. Thank you.
