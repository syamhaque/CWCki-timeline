Chris's eBay seller account was restricted on 16 June 2019 due to his poor performance in not shipping out items and all of his listings were removed by eBay.

Hey, Everyone, check it out! I had to get a new pair and colour them, so my previous pair, the second pair, of my coloured, stylish kicks, are now available for one lucky individual. These are Adidas Neo Cloudfoam, size 9. I personally autographed the inside soles in permanent ink, and a personal Certificate of Authenticity will be included.
Collectible Celebrity Sneakers can be yours, if you Buy It Now!
On Twitter, a fan expressed sticker shock. Chris replied:
Celebrity Shoes, dude! Hear how much Michael Jordan’s Kicks go for? BAM!

For once, Chris chose to sell something of interest and value to collectors, although it seems that he has significantly overpriced the coins - for example, in ordinary circulated condition, a 1939 Mercury dime normally only costs a maximum of $3, with higher prices being reserved for examples in better condition. Contrary to Chris's descriptions of the items in their titles, the coins have not been graded by a numismatic authority (in coin collection, such ungraded coins are considered 'raw') making their actual condition unverified.

Sonichu Graphic Novel Set From Zero To Awakening
Listed: 14 June
Price: $170 (10 available)
Sold: 3 during June
Sonichu Graphic Novel Set From Zero To Awakening. Condition is New.
This is the opportunity to own all of the books I have created up to this point, and it is indeed still ongoing, and I fully intend to continue chronicling work when I can, albeit Higher Priorities DO take Precedence. The books will be directly ordered from my printer company and directly shipped to you with Ground Shipping (included in this listing’s price). Comic book bag, card backs, nor personal autographs will be included in this bulk deal, and I need the money, so individual book sales is Not an Option at this time.
Note that the listing also contains two comics not created by Chris - Bryanfrogboy's Chris Chan Prequel and Trickie's Rosechu's Story.
Following Chris's eBay account being restricted, Chris tried offering this off-site, by claiming if people donated $170 to his Paypal.me account he would send them the set, tweeting, "I don't need a listing for that." So far, nobody is known to have taken Chris up on his offer.
