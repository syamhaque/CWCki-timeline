Hurricane Helene

I am simply relaying this in empathy and concern for those affected by the recent hurricane in North Carolina.
People with lost homes and road closures that prevent aid from getting to them.

My intuitive reading for this time shows that self care and self love has been beneficial with Emperess.
The embrace of actual friendships under the Sun is warm and good, founded and maintained on inner Strength.
Compromise in tough choices remain of importance in future instances.

Another new page from Book 0 HD that also sheds a bit of light on why post-transformation some (temporarily) lose abilities, and some gain abilities.

Are you going to watch G6? Or just pretend these mares are here forever?

G6 is non-existent like G5; #MLPG4Seasons10-14.
There is no pretending.
Shall vote for Harris

Kamala Harris
I promised Amber’s family that she would not be just a statistic. We will speak her name.
Nothing can undo or heal the incredible pain Shanette, CJ, and Andrika have endured. But we can do everything in our power to restore reproductive freedom and get rid of Trump’s Abortion Bans to ensure preventable death like hers never happens again.
Chris
I remember hearing this during the interview with @Oprah.
It was quite disheartening to hear.
But, yes, a vote for @KamalaHarris is a vote in the just, right and Light-Powered direction.
I shall be voting for Kamala on November 5, 2024. ⚡️💙⚡️
A very good win-win

Billionaires shouldn’t pay a lower tax rate than working class Americans.

Definitely agreed.
And with the richer actually contributing more, a lot of things would be less expensive for everyone.
A very good win-win.

If you had to pick a pony fandom art style for G6, who would you go with?
We know hasbro does actually read feedback based on those recent insights. Maybe you will influence g7!
Go drop your ideas over here:

We are influencing the resuming and return of G4; G5's premature execution was never meant to be in this timeline; it was made very well clear.
G4, Friendship is Magic and Equestria Girls, in animated form, shall be resumed.
There is no G6 nor G7 until After the more proper that comes about only After MLP-FiM Season 14, and no sooner.
It shall be so.
