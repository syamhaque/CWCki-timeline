This article or section is
off topic or deviates too much from Christory.Help the CWCki by putting it back on track.
This article, like Chris's pickle, is a bit small. You can help CWCki by expanding it.
This article is about the Discord server. For the hobby shop, see The GAMe PLACe
The Place server.
The Place is the Discord server that is most associated with the Watchmen.[note 1] Chris was in it from approximately September 2019[note 2]-June 2021. In August 2020, the Watchmen announced the presence of the group publicly via the 2020 Discord leaks. It was during this time the Watchmen name was adopted to describe the group.
Signs of the group collapsing began appearing around late June 2021. Earlier in the month, The WCT had been doxed on Kiwi Farms by an account named Nightmare, and signs pointed to fellow Watchman and group leader Naught as the person behind the account.[2] When The WCT confronted Naught in a voice chat during the group’s movie night on 21 June, Naught denied the allegation, then threatened to further dox The WCT in an attempt to silence him. Kyle and MKRNightVee took Bismuth’s side in the dispute.[3]
On 25 June, The WCT informed Chris about the infighting. He showed Chris screenshots of Nightmare's Kiwi Farms posts and the voice chat in which he had confronted the group over Naught being Nightmare. According to The WCT, Chris gradually processed the information, in particular picking up on red flags from Bismuth in the chat - noticing his defensiveness and hostility towards The WCT. Ultimately, Chris believed The WCT's evidence and apparently cut ties with Bismuth over it.[4] A leaked voice clip of Chris saying “Fuck Bismuth!”[5] (a pseudonym of Naught's) was posted to a Lolcow.org thread made about Naught the following day.[2]
Kyle banned The WCT from the Watchmen's Discord server. In response, Chris then decided to leave their server. As The WCT explained, "he saw my banning as a signal to him that my suspicions about Bismuth and the others were correct." The Praetor group, who had also been in the server, left it as well following Chris's departure.[4]
On 29 June, MKRNightVee made multiple tweets that suggested Chris had cut communications with her. She tagged Chris’s Twitter and posted, “Your obviously good at using people and then moving on to the next. Have fun getting fucked over by WCT and Praetor.”[6] She then followed up with accusations against The WCT, believing him to be messing with Chris and having sinister motives.[7]

He set the movie night for the following day.[8]

Notes
↑ When most people talk about the "Watchmen Saga", they primarily talk about the going ons within this server and its members.
↑ The Place server may predate September 2019 as it had been reset during that month.[1]
