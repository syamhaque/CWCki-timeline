Chris's poster celebrating SLGBTQ pride. He brought this poster with him to UVA Remembers Pulse. Note that the flag for Heterosexuality, a white flag with black stripes, is the first flag of the set when viewed from left to right.
SLGBTQ is a CWC-ism variant of the more common acronym LGBTQ, an acronym for "lesbian, gay, Bisexual, transgender and queer". Chris coined his variant on the term sometime in April or May 2017 but did not explain the reasoning behind his alteration until a Facebook post on 21 May 2017. He subsequently used the term consistently in contexts where most people would use the more conventional acronym, cementing its CWC-ism status.
The "Q", for the blanket terms "queer" or "questioning", is a reasonably common addition by modern activists. Chris paid fairly little attention to the letter in his explanation; he likely picked it up from organizations such as the Human Rights Campaign or Cville Pride, both of whom routinely include it. More notable is Chris's inclusion of an "S" for "straight", which he explained as being to welcome non-LGBTQ people "with open hearts". As straight people make up the vast majority of the population, Chris's new acronym covers almost everyone (with the notable exception of asexual people and intersex people, who are typically included under the "A" and "I" of the "LGBTQIA" acronym respectively), thus defeating the purpose of identifying LGBTQ people as a minority group with common attributes.
A recreation of Chris's Straight Pride flag, reminding people to STAY STRAIGHT!
Chris was evidently unaware that many in the LGBT community frown upon the inclusion of straight people in the acronym, with '+' in the extended acronym "LGBTQIA+" is inclusive of straight allies and other allies (alongside representing people of other genders and sexualities who are marginalized); they would almost certainly object to offering heterosexuals the first letter. A tweet using the phrase was in fact called out by such a "social justice warrior" (as well as notorious A-Log Michael Hirtes) for this exact reason.
With Chris's increased interest in the "SLGBTQ" community, he has made artwork and writing supporting the community, culminating in the observation of CWCville's first SLGBTQ pride event in Sonichu 12 - a marked change from Chris's statements in the comic advocating criminalizing and later curing homosexuality eight years earlier. The comic even shows a change in his particular dislike of gay men, as it features Chris's comic persona apologizing to Reldnahc Notsew Naitsirhc for hating him based on his orientation (though Chris immediately follows this up with an apparent gay joke when Reldnahc goes to "choke down a relish dog with mayo"). However, the pro-SLGBTQ statements in Chris's works predictably tend to be heavy-handed and insubstantial. It is also unlikely that Chris's views would have changed had he not joined the community himself.
According to a letter from October 2021, Chris has stopped using the "SLGBTQ" acronym.
“
I have not repeated the acronym with Straight/Cisgender in the main letters in years, and I was still in a learning phase then, socially. I like being Inclusive and Open-Minded; simple as that.

Chris's original post
Let's talk a bit about my idea of adding the "S" to "LGBTQ". Firstly, ‪‪The "S" is for "Straight" (or Cisgender); both the Straight and Cisgender flags are above the "S".‬ I feel it beneficial and good to include the straight/cisgender, as to not leave them feeling left out. I mean, we, the LGBTQ, have our straight allies and supporters, and to figure ourselves as different from them, in a sense, have seeded the idea of our community in us. Regardless, we do welcome them to our Pride Festivals and events. But they each may have been feeling singled and left out.
Plus, look at the acronym this way, "SLGBTQ": we the LGBT, and everyone in between. The "Q", being the Queer and Questioning, either amongst our allies, and those who may be exploring and figuring themselves out. And the "S", our allies (most of, at least), that were here before us. And we still welcome them, at least the ones with open hearts.
We, the LGBTQ, still strive and work towards equality and freedom, like everyone else. Have we totally considered the same for them. We are equal to everyone, and we are to remain included, and the least to return the favor unto them. Include their flags and letter in what we already have, the total salad of our multitude of variants that makes us all as a whole, a damn great salad (meats and fruits included).
We, the whole world together, are the SLGBTQ.
Thank you.
