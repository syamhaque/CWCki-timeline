Ivy, I’m sorry I’ve made some mis-, I’m sorry I’ve made the mistakes of showing your picture off to some, to a few, trusted individuals in real life, and I’m sorry about'ta other mistakes I’ve made like, I've should have been drawing the comic, but I got caught up with other things from real life.
Ivy, I promise you, I promise you my undying love and devotion, I promise you my heart, my soul, even my virginity, and all my romantic ways and all my emotions, my undying emotions. They belong only to you.
I swear in the name of my lord and savior Jesus Christ (maybe?) [Chris blatantly gropes Kimmivy's left breast], I will never, ever, leave you. You have my undying devotion. I'm all yours, and I hope that you fee-, mmh, I know that you feel samely about me. So, let’s just try to keep it that way and Ivy, I love you so much. [Creepy french kissing with Kimmi]
Never leave me, Ivy. And I will never leave you. I love you too much.
