Poem
Saddest Heart in the World[1]
By. Christian W. Chandler
November 4, 2003
Lonesome and sad, lonesome and sad,
the Mastermind is very bad.
In efforts of getting a Boyfriend-Free gal,
that female dog took my only idea for a fall.
Heart-broken, sad and very lonely,
I may never remove my virginity.
And with Backstreet Boys’s tune, I sing my lonesome croon:
“Tell me why, I’m stuck as a virgin with rage.
Tell me why, I so need a cute girl my age.
Tell me why, I ain’t ever wanna hear you say,
‘I have a boyfriend.’”
And so, deep in dreary thought,
a girl was what I sought.
A stitch in time,
will never remove my crying rhyme.
I may be destined for loneliness forever;
fate is to blame… whatever.
I conclude this cry,
to say that as long as there are no matching girls, my happiness well runs dry.
