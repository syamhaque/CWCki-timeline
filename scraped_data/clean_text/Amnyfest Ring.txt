“
I want everybody to know that when I am wearing my ring, I am being most honest and upfront, just like I did when I wore my medallion.
”
Chris, 9 March 2009[1]
The One TRUE and HONEST Ring.
The Amnyfest Ring[2][3] (an egregious mispronunciation of "amethyst ring", as amethyst is Chris's birthstone[4]), also known as the high school ring,[4][5] is a special souvenir ring that Chris got while at Manchester High School. After Blanca destroyed his Sonichu medallion on 20 October 2008, to counter the victory cries of trolls, Chris went back on his claims regarding the medallion and said that the ring was the real source of his powers.
The enormous emotional significance that he attaches to it is further evidence that Chris cannot move on from high school.

Chris and his precious
And you thought it was the medallion that gave Chris his powers.
“
my POWERS NEVER truly came from the Medal; they came from my High School Ring the WHOLE time. I wore the ring the VERY FIRST TIME I thought of Sonichu and from then on as well, so there is the FACT.
”
Chris, 15 October 2008[6]
The One Ring is engraved with "LANCERS", "CWC", an image of a lancer and a coat of arms for the class and school. The amethyst is a galaxy cut on top and a rainbow on the bottom.[7][4] It also bears the letters "HJ ULT" on the interior, a reference to the manufacturers, Herff Jones, and their "Ultra Supertone" alloy, which is 10-karat gold.
The importance Chris gave to his medallion induced trolls to get their hands on it. After Blanca stole and destroyed the medallion in 2008, Chris indicated that the high school ring, not the medallion, is the source of all his powers, and that wearing his ring is sufficient enough to make a video TRUE and HONEST. After all, he explained, "mine is the ONLY ring of its kind...it has my initials engraved inside it...and it has my birthstone in it."[8] Since then, many videos started with Chris briefly showing that he was wearing the Ring, to indicate that it was a TRUE and HONEST video.
Chris considers the ring indisputable proof of his identity, rhetorically asking
"WHO ELSE owns the same class ring with the same finger size, engravings and such?"[9] The fact that Chris assures himself that nobody could possibly replicate a generic, cheap ring is testament to his feeble grasp of reality.
On 10 January 2010, Chris, for some reason, started wearing the ring around his medallion while calling out Alec Benson Leary.[10]
Along with the Sonichu medallion, the Amnyfest Ring went on hiatus for much of 2010. (It was theorized that its destruction by a heroic Icelandic troll led to the March/April 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption.) However, Chris reverted to classic form in a video released on 6 September 2010 featuring, among other familiar tics, an emphatic display of the ring.[11] He also wore it to his 2012 court hearing, and again in the April 2013 "I AM MY OWN FREE BITCH!" photos. It popped up again in the autographed photos he offered for sale on eBay in late June 2014, proving that it survived his house fire.
...and one for my sweetheart.
In late 2014, Thetan revealed that Chris had, unprompted, offered to give the amnyfest ring away to his sweetheart Catherine as a sign of commitment.[12] This new purpose for the ring is connected to Chris's obsession about the symbolic meaning of wedding rings. For example, he drew a picture of himself offering a wedding ring to Ivy. His drawings of the fantasy weddings of Sonichu and Rosechu, and himself and Ivy, both featured ring-bearers. He has also been long frustrated that only married women wear rings, because his noviophobia makes him afraid that he might get an ass-kicking from a jealous boyfriend if he tries to talk to a woman who has already been purchased. Unsurprisingly, he wants women who are not boyfriend-free to be legally required to wear rings.[13] We can surmise that he intended to use the amnyfest ring's power to ensnare Catherine forever. Fortunately for her, she refused it.
However, although Chris had stopped wearing his medallion during this time, this does not appear to be the case with his ring, as he has constantly been seen wearing it through 2014, even at his court hearing. This is likely because it allows him to be TRUE AND HONEST without wearing a medallion, which could be because he realizes how ridiculous he looks with it, but is probably because it would ruin his tomgirl look (despite it already being ruined by Chris' horrible choices of attire). Since Chris believes his magic powers stem from the ring, he presumably doesn't feel the need to wear the medallion.
In the comics
Beel learns the true sources of Chris's powers.
In Sonichu 10, while Chris-chan Sonichu was trapped in the 4-cent_garbage.com Building, the demon Beel stole his medallion. All seemed lost, but then Chris discovered that the true source of his power was the Amnyfest Ring, which he used to regain his medallion and temporarily defeat Beel with a Hyper Beam.
Chris can also be seen wearing the ring, along with his wedding ring, in the Giant Penis Comic (Sonichu Comic Special 3).

Role in defeating the Idea Guys
“
$10,000
”
One of Chris's asking prices for the ring, before settling for $200.
On 14 April 2018, to raise money to pay off the Idea Guys, Chris listed the Amnyfest Ring for sale on eBay. In doing so, he flip-flopped again on the source of his power:[14]
“
No, the ring is not the source of my power. My power source is inside me, behind where my Medallion hangs over. Yet, I still require my Medallion, so the ring is for sale.
”
Chris sold the ring to The Captain on 17 April 2018 for $200.
The Captain noticed the odd behavior Chris was displaying from being manipulated by the Idea Guys and had also been contacted by Anna McLerran to intervene against them.[15] To counteract the Idea Guys' influence, The Captain exerted his own influence by telling Chris that the ring was sending out messages. Anna had also previously vouched for The Captain to Chris, and the combination of the ring and Anna's vouching got Chris to trust him.[15]
“
I simply told him that the ring was sending me morse code messages and that the idiots in Discord were lying to him. So I did a five minute photoshop of the ring glowing and sent it to Chris as well as a piece of notepaper where I wrote "The CPUs have been hacked. Don't trust the CPUs" claiming that was the morse code message.
Sure enough, Chris believed it because, y'know, amnyfest ring and proceeded to give me his passwords and everything else - that's how we got to where we are today.
”
The Captain[16]
As an attempt to undo the beliefs the Idea Guys had instilled into Chris, The Captain told Chris that the ring was actually the Reality Stone (a concept from Marvel comics) and that Chris could change the reality of CWCville to whatever he wanted.[17] However, Chris continued to maintain belief in many Idea Guy concepts - such as his polyamorous marriage and characters such as Kun T’Nyuget.
The Amnyfest Ring Reality Stone
The Captain sold the ring back to Chris after it fulfilled its use.[18] On 16 July 2018, the ring made a triumphant return to Chris's possession, as announced in a Facebook post.[19]
