Anaxis's summary
NovaKyle informs WCT of Jacob Sockness's intentions to go to Everfree Northwest and meet with Chris, and WCT warns Chris about this in turn. The Fool states that Chris should have bodyguards at the convention and WCT agrees, sparking a discussion on strategies to keep Chris safe. WCT soon decides to reach out to the convention and warn them about Sockness as well, though I take the position that he should inform Null first. Para later takes the position that Nova isn't a bad guy and points out how the Knights aren't much different from the Watchmen. WCT mostly agrees with the latter opinion but disagrees strongly with the former, citing Nova deciding to side with Naught (again).
WCT later shares DMs he had with Chris, where the latter states that he had informed Null about Sockness and that Sockness couldn't take his "new virginity" because he had been having sex with his "lady friend." WCT and Para shit-talk Sockness for a while, then Para bashes Praetor some more. The final topic of discussion is Chris's future, and how the WCT believes that Chris's story will end when Barb passes away.

Kyle giving me a heads up about Sockness going to Everfree Northwest.
The Fool 04:39 AM
wow?
that's peculiar
The WCT 04:40 AM
At least he now recognizes me as the new leader.
The Fool 04:40 AM
yeah, that's wild
The WCT 04:40 AM
I should probably warn Chris.
The Fool 04:40 AM
do you have protection for chris?
The WCT 04:41 AM
I won’t tell them that Kyle gave me that link, but I will give him said link.
The Fool 04:42 AM
yeah but does chris have bodyguards? like even a normal person would want protection against sockness lol
The WCT 04:42 AM

The Fool 04:43 AM
[Cropped screenshot from the Reddit page, reading "my suit is ready and my goddess is ripe."]
fear
like legit I'm not even joking make sure chris has bodyguards
The WCT 04:45 AM
[Screenshot of The WCT warning Chris about Sockness and sending the Reddit post link.][note 1]
The Fool 04:45 AM
this isn't even about chris' mental faculties this is about a stalker
The WCT 04:48 AM
[Replying to "this isn't even about chris' mental faculties this is about a stalker"]
I agree with Kyle on this.
Sockness needs to be stopped and Chris needs to avoid him at all costs.
[REDACTED] 5:01 AM
Tell Null about it too since he's helping Chris with the trip.
The WCT 05:10 AM
Of course.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 01:02 PM
Well, at least we know that Kyle still cares somewhat for Chris's wellbeing that he was willing to put aside his animosity for you to warn you about Sockness
The WCT 01:27 PM
[Replying to "Well, at least we know that Kyle still cares somewhat for Chris's wellbeing that he was willing to put aside his animosity for you to warn you about Sockness"]
Because we both despise Sockness.
That’s what originally brought us together 2 years ago.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 01:28 PM
I guess shared hatred really does bring people together
Silvia 01:53 PM
Ewwwww sockness
The Fool 02:02 PM
okay now that I'm sober
can you call the convention and tell them about sockness?
Silvia 02:02 PM
This lol
Lainchu (Anaxis) 02:04 PM
I feel like bringing attention to Sockness will simultaneously bring attention to Chris
And may cause a preemptive ban for both of them
But I think the decision on how to move forward on this should be Null's, since he's the organizer of this whole shebang
Silvia 02:06 PM
I hope they will at least tell bull
Null
The Fool 02:26 PM
sockness is dangerous in general, you can call them and not make it about chris
Silvia 02:26 PM
Fair
The Fool 02:26 PM
just sound really sincere about your concern of this person being dangerous to certain con goers
show them anything incriminating he has, I don't really follow him so I don't know what he does besides post shoops of ghost portals or something
The WCT 03:22 PM
ok people, what should I do:
A. Contact Chris and Warn Him.
B. Contact Null.
C. DM the Convention on Twitter about Sockness.
Or D. Stand back and do nothing.
The Fool 03:23 PM
all three
just make sure not to directly mention chris
just say he's a dangerous man in general
show them some evidence
maybe do C first and if they don't say anything then contact chris and josh
The WCT 03:25 PM
The Fool 03:26 PM
if they ban him then it's a non-issue but if not then chris deserves to know and maybe josh can set him up with some guards
The WCT 03:29 PM
I just DM'd Chris.
and knowing him, he'll probably listen to me.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 03:29 PM
Well, I was gonna suggest telling Josh before reaching out to the convention, but I guess it's too late now
The Fool 03:30 PM
why?
Lainchu (Anaxis) 03:30 PM
Because Josh is the one coming up with all the plans
The Fool 03:30 PM
removing the threat of sockness being there entirely would be the best outcome
Lainchu (Anaxis) 03:31 PM
Yeah, I know. But having Null be the one to tell the convention or get chris bodyguards would be the best solution, I think, since he's got so many connections.
The Fool 03:31 PM
for the bodyguards yeah
but I think if we can just get sockness to fuck off ourselves then we wouldn't have to bother josh about it
and if we can't then maybe he can
Lainchu (Anaxis) 03:32 PM
Well, I'm always more of a fan of the hands-off, indirect approach
Have Josh do the dirty work rather than us
The Fool 03:33 PM
same but kat seems pretty eager to take initiative
I'm just throwing suggestions out there
Lainchu (Anaxis) 03:33 PM
Well, that's up to him
The Fool 03:33 PM
yeah
Lainchu (Anaxis) 03:33 PM
Was just putting my opinion out there as well
The WCT 03:42 PM
If people ask me what's the difference between the Praetor group and Sockness, I'll tell them this:
One grifts, the other stalks.
We all know who the lesser evil in this is.
Para 05:29 PM
why are you acting as if kyle stopped caring
nothing changed
you guys decided to pull away because somehow this group which is kind of samey is “different”
The WCT 05:34 PM
[Replying to "you guys decided to pull away because somehow this group which is kind of samey is “different”"]
There is mostly no difference other than the fact that Meghan and Kyle aren’t here anymore.
The Fool 05:36 PM
here comes para to save the day telling us what we already know in this most pessimistic way possible
[Image of a man wearing a Fedora, Photoshopped into a screenshot from Assassin's Creed: Revelations.]
The WCT 05:37 PM
The Knights of CWC is overall the same thing as the Watchmen except we don’t have the “toxic trio” as Chris describes. lol
The Fool 05:37 PM
we don't discriminate over which of each other's dicks we jerk off
The WCT 05:38 PM
And we also aren’t as controlling of Chris’s actions as the old Watchmen were. We’ll only intervene when Chris’s physical safety is at stake.
The financial and legal issues are mostly up to Null.
[...]
Para 05:47 PM
anyways i am not being a downer its better than being delusional kyle isnt a bad guy
The Fool 05:48 PM
no we're all very well aware kyle is irredeemable
it's just interesting how he sort of, I dunno, broke character like that?
Para 05:48 PM
is this just larping (edited)
The Fool 05:49 PM
I dunno ask kat
The WCT 05:52 PM
[Replying to "anyways i am not being a downer its better than being delusional kyle isnt a bad guy"]
Kyle sided with the man who doxed me and treated me like shit.
If he wants to give me some helpful advice, it would be great. But I won’t tolerate endless hostilities.
The WCT 05:53 PM
[Replying to "it's just interesting how he sort of, I dunno, broke character like that?"]
It’s good, nothing wrong with that.
The Fool 05:53 PM
he's a big fat meanie face and I don't like him
The WCT 05:54 PM
Kyle needs to lay down the bottle and rethink his morals.
Para 06:05 PM
then its a question of who sided with who not really one of principles
or personal actions
i unno
The WCT 06:10 PM
Like I said, I’m willing to listen to him if it’s something that’s helpful.
But he has to understand that any relationship between us at this point is nothing more than the occasional team up.
Para 06:15 PM
i feel like
if you guys wouldve just handled your shit
between eachother
it wouldve been fine
but the internet makes the most simplest of shit so gay
The WCT 06:17 PM
[Replying to "between eachother"]
the problem though was Naught was not willing to cooperate with me.
and he successfully manipulated those two.
The Fool 06:17 PM
yeah dude naught's gone totally silent
I keep saying he should have just rolled with the punches and took the L but he's cowering like a baby over dumb internet shit
The WCT 06:18 PM
If Naught had been able to prove his innocence to me in any possible way, along with not being so hostile as he was in those recordings (along with making that thread about me on the ALog Cow board), we might all still be in the place today.
Para 06:19 PM
i get that he forced your hand
The WCT 06:19 PM
I wanted to give him a chance.
I literally did.
But he kept on burning the bridges.
Its almost like he never tried.
Para 06:20 PM
what if he just admitted to it
and apologized
The WCT 06:20 PM
[Replying to "what if he just admitted to it"]
he did.
Para 06:20 PM
why not say sorry then
dumbass
The WCT 06:20 PM
[Replying to "why not say sorry then"]
because of his ego.
[Screenshot of WCT goading Naught into posting WCT's "big boy dox."]
By the time he posted that Cow thread, I was almost ready to move on and just focus on everything else.
but then the WCT got hit with community guideline strikes, and its pretty clear that he and a few others mass flagged my channel. (edited)
but like @The Fool said earlier: He's long gone.
And he'll never be seen again. (especially when some of his biggest haters are on the brink of finding his dox as well)
The WCT 08:23 PM
[Screenshot of Chris responding to WCT's warning, stating that he would alert Null, which WCT then encouraged.]
The Fool 08:54 PM
I hope chris actually makes his stupid blue heart costume that is going to be so funny to witness
The WCT 08:54 PM
Chris also told me he'll try to get some protection for himself there.
The Fool 08:55 PM
thats good
13 July 2021
The WCT 12:22 AM
[Screenshot of Chris informing WCT that he told Null about Sockness.][note 2]
Para 12:25 AM
hes gonna get a rubber
The WCT 12:26 AM
[Screenshot of WCT responding to Chris in relief, followed by Chris stating that Sockness couldn't claim his "new virginity" because he had been having sex with his "lady friend."]
The WCT 12:31 AM
[Replying to "hes gonna get a rubber"]
Josh might cuck Sockness.
Para 12:31 AM
mannn
The WCT 12:32 AM
the convention is not for another month.
which means that Josh will have more than enough time to pull some strings.
Para 12:32 AM
can't like
sockness go away
chris hasn't really told sockness to fuck off though
kind of partially his own fault
The WCT 12:32 AM
Sockness is mentally ill and he believes with the Watchmen gone he can finally fuck Chris.
The WCT 12:33 AM
[Replying to "chris hasn't really told sockness to fuck off though"]
yes he told him to fuck off.
and we put a stop to it in September 2019.
Para 12:33 AM
yeah but he didn't do it
on his own
he likes the attention
is what i am saying (edited)
The WCT 12:33 AM
I don't disagree with you there tbh.
Para 12:33 AM
he likes feeling desirable like a woman
The WCT 12:34 AM
I feel like on one hand he's serious about this but on the other he's doing this because he wants some clout.
Para 12:34 AM
even if he wouldn't overall consent
The WCT 12:35 AM
[Replying to "even if he wouldn't overall consent"]
If Chris consented that'd be a problem.
but fortunately he is smart enough to understand how gross Jacob is.
Para 12:37 AM
okay if he would consent right
why are you protecting chris from him again
they're both gross
they're both men
they deserve eachother
The WCT 12:38 AM
[Replying to "why are you protecting chris from him again"]
because Sockness wants to do more than have sex with him.
he wants to murder him because he's crazy.
Para 12:38 AM
then he should be locked up
or put in a home
god damnm
The WCT 12:38 AM
[Replying to "or put in a home"]
he lives in the Tenderloin in SF.
the worst neighborhood in all of the City.
I've been there a couple times, its a shithole.
A fitting place for Sockness.
Para 09:32 AM
why think that kyle is unforgivable but praetor weens are perfectly fine
because its not personal?
Para 10:06 AM
i still dont think those praetor folks are good news but whatever
The WCT 12:31 PM
[Replying to "why think that kyle is unforgivable but praetor weens are perfectly fine"]
They’re both bad.
The WCT 12:32 PM
[Replying to "i still dont think those praetor folks are good news but whatever"]
Yeah they’re cringe and should be laughed at but they didn’t deserve to be bullied.
Para 12:35 PM
yeah i am just saying tread carefully
i dont like em
The WCT 12:46 PM
[Replying to "i dont like em"]
You should be skeptical with them, but don’t a log them like the others did.
Para 12:49 PM
i just calls it like i sees it
they are weens who manipulate and exploit an autistic guy for eclout
and they think they are internet badasses for it
oh and they’re fucking zoomers
on top of it
chris is like a relic of my generation of internet so even if hes retarded narcissistic and what have you
i dont want people using him for personal gain
especially by zoomers
dude these fags are 15 years late
can they just stop
[...]
Para 12:54 PM
zoomer humor is like
beating a dead horse
shit is dead and over but they’re still catching up on something that came and went
The WCT 12:55 PM
Exactly
I really hope Chris can arrange a chat between me and Caden because a lot of things need to be cleared up.
Para 12:57 PM
tbh they just need to fuck off
i know you want to fix things
but this new generation
of faggots
are 60x more predatory psychotic and self serving
than older people
The WCT 12:58 PM
You’re not wrong
Para 12:59 PM
i get isolating chris isnt fun and shit but when i look at it
its for the best
The WCT 12:59 PM
I still think it will happen.
Para 12:59 PM
chris might never have a genuine friend in his life because he is incapable of forming those bonds on his own
fuck he cant even take care of animals
The WCT 12:59 PM
I already know when Chris might become isolated.
When his Mom dies.
That will make him wide open.
Para 01:00 PM
i just dont think exposing him further to degenerate psychotic exploitative zoomers
is a great idea
but its chris’s life
he does what he want
makes me sad though
as an old fan
and an oldfag
PuckDisapproves[1]
yeahhh
ur right
he needs to be in a home eventually
The WCT 01:02 PM
@Para Barb passing away will be the moment Chris’s story ends imo.
Josh will make sure that he goes somewhere that nobody will bother him again.
And long before the Watchman broke up, I went through over states across the country with Kyle to see where we can have Chris move to.
Para 01:05 PM
probably should set up a situation where people can visit hjm in some way just not predatory dicks
cause its nice to know that people care
jersh should do that
The WCT 01:06 PM
I think Chris should live in either a Rural area or a Suburb.
We already figured out that he wouldn’t like the big city.
Para 01:06 PM
i think hes too attached to ruckersville/charlottesville
The WCT 01:07 PM
He could remain in the Charlottesville area.
Or maybe we can have him move to Richmond, Virginia.
He went to High School there.
Or maybe have him move to another state with a similar vibe like North Carolina

Anaxis's summary
The WCT shares (passive-aggressive) discussions he had with Nova over how to prevent Sockness from attending Everfree, including his idea to stop Sockness from coming with a similar strategy the Watchmen had used previously, where Chris would create a clip to inform the public about Sockness's intentions, which would inform the convention in turn. A server member expresses doubts about this idea, but WCT still defends it. Silvia shares her experiences with convention security, and since she is in Everfree's Discord server, WCT asks her to contact their staff since they hadn't responded to him on Twitter.
The WCT then shares a DM with Chris where the latter rejects the clip idea, and states that Bella is going to attend the convention with him and would be a "bodyguard."

Kyle just sent me this.
The Fool 02:19 PM
god I hope it gets the boot that would be hilarious
The WCT 02:21 PM
You know what I thought about doing?
maybe we should do a repeat of what we did in 2019.
This clip was how I was able to stop Sockness the first time around:
https://sonichu.com/cwcki/ChrisReleasesAStatementRegardingJacobSockness
🙄
[Screenshot of Kyle sending WCT the previously-posted Reddit link, WCT sending Kyle screenshots of his correspondence with Chris about Sockness, and WCT sharing his clip warning idea with Kyle.]
[REDACTED] 02:41 PM
How would a clip help in this case?
The WCT 02:41 PM
[Replying to "How would a clip help in this case?"]
the public would contact the convention.
and letting them know about Jacob's past attempts to fuck with Chris.
The Fool 02:42 PM
I'd help with that but I don't know how to use twitter and my twitter language is set to japanese so I can't really understand anything
[REDACTED] 02:46 PM
Maybe it could work though that approach doesn't work when weens do it to Chris.
The WCT 02:48 PM
[Replying to "Maybe it could work though that approach doesn't work when weens do it to Chris."]
It worked 2 years ago, just saying. We can try it again.
[REDACTED] 02:49 PM
Wasn't that from Sockness realizing Chris would turn him away? But he could freely go to the convention or even just to the hotel.
The WCT 02:50 PM
[Replying to "Wasn't that from Sockness realizing Chris would turn him away? But he could freely go to the convention or even just to the hotel."]
In this case, the Convention would be put under pressure to ban Sockness.
Para 02:50 PM
maybe security will beat the shit out of him
The WCT 02:50 PM
oh they will. lol
we also have plenty of time to prevent this from happening.
1 month that is.
[REDACTED] 02:51 PM
Even if they do listen to Twitter, and Sockness could probably deny the allegations, there's also the hotel itself.
The WCT 02:52 PM
there's little we can do in regards to the Hotel.
and you know, there's a possibility that Sockness might be fucking with us just so he can get some free clout.
The Fool 02:52 PM
the con is more of a concern because sockness is going to be disguised in a costume, I don't know what the policy is for hotels if you're walking around in a costume
[REDACTED] 02:55 PM
Could Chris recognize Sockness if he came up to him without costume? What with the facial blindness?
The WCT 02:55 PM
I'll give him a picture to refresh his memory.
The Fool 02:55 PM
🤔
more reason to have a bodyguard I guess lol
Silvia 02:56 PM
As someone who’s been to cons I can say that once you point out someone to security, they will be on high maintenance. You would need to show him his face though so security can be on a lookout
I’ve had to ban a stalker of mine at bronycon 2019
The WCT 02:57 PM
Sockness will immediately be escorted out of the convention once he gets caught.
so either way, he will not succeed in his current mission to assault Chris.
Silvia 02:58 PM
Also if your in the discord message one of the board members they will definitely tell
I believe I’m in the everfree discord
The WCT 02:59 PM
I think the organizers are there.
Silvia 02:59 PM
These are the brony cons I’m in
[Screenshot of the Discord servers that Silvia was in.]
The WCT 02:59 PM
so maybe they might stop him ahead of time.
Silvia 02:59 PM
They should.
[...]
The WCT 03:06 PM
I mean, you're in Everfree right?
Silvia 03:06 PM
Yes I’m in the server
The WCT 03:06 PM
they have a channel where you can chat with staff.
Silvia 03:07 PM
Yes
The WCT 03:08 PM
ask efnw staff is what its called.
Silvia 03:08 PM
Yes
The WCT 03:10 PM
TaikoDragon is one of the people you can speak to.
Silvia 03:10 PM
Ok well if u guys need me to I will tho I
thought u guys had it
The WCT 03:12 PM
I DM'd them already on Twitter and I have no response.
Chris claims to me that Josh is already taking action.
Silvia 03:12 PM
Ok that’s good.
They’re extremely busy with con and vip guests and all so I’m sure they’ll reply soon if not I’ll message one.
Tho it’s odd to me bc most con staff at least reply by the end of the day
The WCT 03:25 PM
[Screenshot of WCT sharing his idea with Chris, and Chris rejecting it, stating that Bella would help be a "bodyguard" for him.][note 3]
So a member of Praetor is going with Chris.
The Fool 03:27 PM
nice
Silvia 03:32 PM
Ok that’s good
The WCT 03:36 PM
Its good that we're building up our defenses already 1 month prior.
I'm confident that Sockness won't stand a chance.

Anaxis's summary
The WCT posts a discussion he had with Chris about security at Everfree, in which Chris brings up the Randy Stair (Ember's Ghost Squad) lore that he learned of from WCT. Silvia inquires about EGS, which WCT summarizes, and the Fool blames the Idea Guys for Chris's interest in the subject. The WCT sheepishly admits his involvement in getting Chris to parrot Stair's lore, which Silvia lightly shames him for. He then explains the history of Stair and EGS further, and dismisses MKR's belief that Chris would try to kill himself due to WCT's series on Stair, which Silvia agrees with.

The WCT 11:47 PM
[Continuation of the same discussion between Chris and WCT.][note 4]
Silvia 11:49 PM
Who is randy and the ghost squad
The WCT 11:50 PM
[Replying to "Who is randy and the ghost squad"]
long story short: A wannabe school shooter and his fantasy ghost group.
The Fool 11:50 PM
randy is a spree shooter who killed himself after his spree
I think the idea guys told him his ghost is trying to contact chris or something
Silvia 11:50 PM

The WCT 11:50 PM
[Replying to "I think the idea guys told him his ghost is trying to contact chris or something"]
uh
no
that's not what happened.
The Fool 11:51 PM
IIRC he shot up his workplace and killed three people
The WCT 11:51 PM
The Idea Guys had nothing to do with Chris getting into Randy.
The Fool 11:51 PM
oh?
The WCT 11:51 PM
Chris found my Randy documentary series and he liked it.
so in a way...its my fault.
Silvia 11:51 PM
Bad Neko u get the cone of shame
The WCT 11:51 PM
it was his decision, not mine.
lol
I thought Chris wouldn't care to watch but he did and what do you know? he liked it.
maybe a little too much.
Silvia 11:52 PM
Who is ember and Andy.
And I gotcha
The WCT 11:52 PM
Ember McLain is like some cute teen ghost girl that Randy liked
and Andy is one of Randy's aliases.
[Picture of Ember McLain from Danny Phantom.]
this is ember. ^
Silvia 11:53 PM
Ohhhhhh so from Danny phantom
The WCT 11:53 PM
Meghan for some dumb reason thinks that Chris will kill himself because of my series. lol
fortunately, me and Chris have cleared that up.
Silvia 11:54 PM
Nah I don’t think she Will kill herself. I think she just takes everything into her world at this point
The WCT 11:54 PM
exactly.
Chris is just fascinated if anything by Randy.
He's as much of a Kiwi Farmer as I am. lol
Silvia 11:54 PM
Ahhh. I may need to watch this
Documentary.
The WCT 11:55 PM
you're gonna have to wait.
Silvia 11:55 PM
I actually love the psychology behind ppl like Ted bundy Ed gein
and such. And oh yea your channel I forgot
The WCT 11:56 PM
or you can just go here: https://newtube.app/The_WCT
The Fool 11:56 PM
wow a girl who likes serial killers, how unique 😏
Silvia 11:56 PM
Haha. No I don’t actually like them like how some chicks mail them and shit.
