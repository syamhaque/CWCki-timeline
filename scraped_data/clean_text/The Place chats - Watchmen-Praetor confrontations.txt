After Chris had DM'd the Watchman Naught about his plan to use a taser supplied by Praetor on his quartz crystals to activate the Dimensional Merge,[1] Naught posted to The Place asking Praetor to make sure everyone is safe.
Naught
@Praetor cwc told me about the trip, please make sure everyone's safe ok?
Kyle
Is that, really advisable, considering?
MKR
@Praetor
[posts several emotes]
If Cwc comes to harm because of your negligence there will be consequences.
Think about that before you try anything ok?
Naught
I just want everyone to be safe & happy,
MKR
Agreed

The Watchmen again ask Praetor about the taser. Earlier in the day, Chris had mentioned wanting to use a taser to spark his collection of crystals to activate the Dimensional Merge, which Praetor said they would temporarily supply him with.[2]
The discussion begins poorly, with Watchmen members Val and MKR using name-calling and other hostile remarks towards Praetor member Caden. Caden responds with mocking remarks.
Chris tries to defuse the situation, wanting the hostility to stop. Watchmen member Kyle jumps in and accuses Caden of fraud, to which Chris disagrees and responds that there is no fraud.
Hostilities from Val spill over to verbally attacking Chris as well, calling him an idiot.
The discussion continues via the Taser Discussion voice chat.
Chris posts his thoughts on how he felt overwhelmed from the aggression, recalling instances from his childhood in which he had felt aggrieved, and saying he interpreted the remarks as war-like instead of comical banter, and that he would try not to take future remarks personally.
Following the discussion, MKR took to Twitter to spread a rumor that Praetor wanted to get Chris to use a stun gun on himself. To fuel the rumor, she cropped an out-of-context portion of the discussion.[3]

Praetor (Caden)
We're doing what we do because of profit, goofball. It makes money. If it happens to piss off MKR along the way, it's a bonus.
We're sorry that the rest y'all are suspicious. We don't intend to do much to change that, as it doesn't sound like we'd get cash out of it. We're also guessing y'all won't be changing your minds anytime soon.
Naught
Buff mlp
Praetor (Caden)
Feel free to message us with any concerns though! Except for @MKR . She hurt our feelings.
We may never recover.
Naught
Ok, I've been kind and not passive aggressive as you've been to me, but ok, I'm fine with being a dick if need be
Val

Chris (as Sonichu)
I know there is disagreements, because you all do not fully comprehend the other.
Kyle

Chris (as Sonichu)

[During the Taser Discussion voice chat, Val demanded that Caden type out an apology statement to MKR; Caden obliged:]
Praetor (Caden)
My dearest MKR,
I sincerleyleye apologize for the disconnect and disdain for our differing views on Twizzlers. However, your agreement on the putrid subject of Twizzler Milk Straws I believe has bonded us. May we be joined forever as Twizzler friends, and no longer enemies. I won't be a cunt. I love you. 😢

Chris (as Sonichu)
From my end, I wish to state on behalf of Christine, this brain and how it interprets or misinterprets aggressive and cruel dialogue and its main context.
Over the years, at least up to 2011, Robertchu had and would often pick a spar with her in verbal arguments.
For the majority of the time, obviously, and goes in sync with the loud verbal abuse that went on between both of her parents, and (especially) with the Greene County school system back in the hay day of her fourth grade time.
Stack on the Roache woman who locked her in a room with toys and all by her lonesome.
When this brain hears constant arguing within a group of people, it picks up on the aggressive aspects, and add the empathy of feeling the anger from the ends of all shouters and arguing individuals about, it gets overwhelming to say the least.
“Oh, grow up, Chris” is what I would tell her as well, and she has somewhat improved in sparring back over the years, but the flaw still and can occur when feeling fatigued.
She has been made aware in various media that there exists the argument context where those involved are arguing and shouting insults for the sake of arguing and shouting insults or venting.
As well as the “excuse” of bullies picking on those younger and considered weaker than them to toughen them up.
But, obviously, that does no one any favours either.
The same applies to all online haters and bad trolling types.
This body and I have had a long day from waking up at about 9:00 am today; had the drive and focused outing with successful results.
Still, feeling need to be on with the voice chat, despite the fatigue, I got on Discord tonight and was face-slammed with the very aggressive words.
Obviously, considering what I have just told you all, this brain interpreted that as violent and war-like in context.
It was not interpreted as comical banter.
It is obvious that there was no way this could have been avoided or altered towards the banter interpretation, and this brain still has, and certainly will, get further training and education with Robertchu later on, so it can have an easier time to not initially take the words personally and interpret the actual context better.
That is all I can think of at the moment to share this with you all.
Thanks for listening.
KND
war is always the last option.
everyone is just on edge cause when you zap this rock it could be disappointing.
and since we don't know praetor we'd hope that it wouldn't be made into a public spectacle.
obviously there is a very low chance of the zapper working.
Kyle
Why its preferential to not follow through on people who try to use character assassination.
KND
its not a bad idea to sell rocks that have been electrified though.
as long as you associate with weird people they're going to keep targeting you chris.
i could see praetor staying our friend, i could also see him acting demented if allowed to act that way.
so please let us be weary for your sake and ours.
and praetor please understand our distrust.
@Praetor what type of assurance will you give, that christine wont be mocked when this experiment is a failure?
do you currently have intentions to release a video documenting christine's experiments? (edited)

13 February 2021
On 13 February 2021, Chris called out the group on its recent behavior, pointing out the aggression in the Taser Discussion call, as well as out-of-context leaks.
Watchmen Kyle and MKR reacted to the criticism by immediately making more hostile remarks towards Praetor. MKR also deflected blame onto Caden of Praetor, claiming he had attacked her first. She apologized for upsetting Chris and claimed she would stop and not post anything more on them.
A disappointed Chris said he would check in again later.
MKR's claim lasted less than three weeks; on 5 March 2021, she again lashed out over Twitter[4] and spread another rumor about Praetor.[5]
Chris (as Sonichu)
Not to break our friendships or anything, but from the way you all have been talking and behaving lately, including deviating from the serious moments of the merge and the present events, not to mention how you all play-bullied in the recent voice chat, in general; to be blunt, I am beginning to feel like you all are not on the same page as I and Chris are.
It feels disappointing.
Also, to add, and not counting what we’ve authorized @Lainchu to share publicly in chronicling, as well as the recent one @ภคยﻮђՇ posted that I have forgiven him for; just about everything else that some to a lot of you all have talked on the Kiwi of in leaking details that were not meant to be shared or taken out of context.
One of the points of our Discord server, here, was to be a safe space for us to talk with you all in mostly confidentiality, and to discuss any and all related events that have occluded not only with and around me, but the same with each and every one of you all.
And you all know what I find on here most of the time, even though fun things are cool from time to time, but it feels like a total distract-a-thon here that I feel unable to relate with a bunch of the time. (edited)
Kyle
Why talking helps. Evidence helps too.
@Praetor Hey, dumbfuck, your entity status expired, unless you were lying about being a company, which is also fraud.
MKR
I was bullied by caden first then he gave the most laughably insincere apology possible. You know that I care, I always have, and I defend you when I think people are trying to do you harm.
Much like Jacob, these people are not sincere.
Kyle
Or Josh Wise.
Might want to actually have someone who knows finance to back any of this up.
MKR
I'm sorry if my actions upset you but they were done out of concern. Nothing I did or said would get in the way of the merge or anything related.
I'll stop.
I wont post anything else on them, but I'm still weary.
Please be careful, ok?
Be safe.
Chris (as Sonichu)
[quotes his "Not to break out friendships or anything" line]
