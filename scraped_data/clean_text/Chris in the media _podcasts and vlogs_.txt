Harry Partridge
"Actually, it is excellent; I would not change a thing about it." -Chris, Mailbag 9
Animator Harry Partridge (best known for his slanderous mockery Saturday Morning Watchmen) has made several references to Chris and Sonichu, the first of which is a drawing of Rosechu uploaded to Newgrounds.[1] An animated version of Chris appears briefly in the animated cartoon short "Nicolas Cage Wants Cake",
a musical remix of a scene from The Family Man.[2] In the animated short "Skyrim", Son-Chu's "SONICHU" license plate can be seen in the background during the first scene.[3] In the Followup, "Song of Skyrim", Chris makes a brief cameo in the crowd [4]
Harry himself has commented on TheCWCvilleLibrary's upload of the Christian and the Hedgehog Boys song "I'll Never Leave You, Ivy", jokingly stating "I want this played at my funeral."
When interviewing Harry Partridge on Animation Aficionados, the hosts asked Harry about Chris's cameos in some of his videos (from 0:19:43). The discussion the hosts have with Harry about Chris is quite lengthy, during which Mr. Partridge admits that he is "obsessed with him":[5]
“
I really am obsessed with him... I check Sonichu.com, the wiki about Chris-chan and his weird life, if not daily, every couple of hours... there must be more written about Chris-chan than George Washington.
”
Harry Partridge
During an episode of SleepyCabin, it was revealed that Harry actually contacted Chris to ask him if he wanted to work on a game together, in which Chris declined saying that Harry's animation style wasn't that good at all, despite many considering Harry to be one of the best animators online. The reason why he wanted to work on a game with Chris is unknown to this day, whether it be for trolling or because he actually wanted to.
Atop the Fourth Wall
Comic book reviewer Lewis Lovhaug (a.k.a. "Linkara") goes on a brief tirade in his 99th video "Top 15 Things I Will Never Review" about Sonichu on the subject of webcomics at the 24-minute mark.[6]

“
"But wait!" the internet cried back, "let me tell you about the horror that is called Sonichu!" Yes people, I have heard of Sonichu. I really wish I hadn't heard of Sonichu. I would be a much happier man if I hadn't.
”
Linkara, speaking for everyone who has ever become aware of Sonichu.
While he'd previously made the point that he wouldn't review webcomics in general, Linkara didn't want to review Sonichu in particular because he didn't want to acknowledge it further. He describes Chris as a "creepy stalker". Towards the end of the episode, a character tries to pressure Linkara into reviewing Sonichu before Linkara settles on reviewing a Sonic the Hedgehog comic for his 100th episode. At the end of the video, he uses "Weird Al" Yankovic's "Do I Creep You Out?" as the credits music, a possible jab at Chris.

“
Wait a minute, did he just say he recycles his...HOLY SHIT! Oh, that is some NASTY shit, oh, oh GOD!
”
Ray, representing pretty much anybody who saw the video for the first time
In an early episode of =3 (pronounced "equals three"), vlogger Ray William Johnson made fun of Chris's habit of recycling his navy. Though he never gave Chris's name, referring to him rather inaccurately as "your average Star Trek fan", he did provide a link to Chris's old channel. Jump to 2:09 in the linked video.
BlackBusterCritic
Chris has been on the BlackBusterCritic's Sonic Brainfart's videos where BBC highlights the points of Chris' wrongdoings. Jamin also has a part two of the series, but it is unknown what happened to it.

“
"...Or when I spent 50-something years as an overweight, mentally unstable manchild creating grotesque crossbreeding products out of already existing characters owned by different companies, in the hope of having mankind realise that their ways are faulty so they would pick up the torch and head for the future rather than sitting idly by and engage in pettiness, superstition, gluttony, and hatred for one another. That plan was genius. Too bad people were too fucking stupid to find the enlightening messages hidden in all those holo-recordings I made."
”
The God Emperor of Mankind, reflecting on his actions during his life as the manchild we know today.
Filthy Frank
On October 8, 2014, popular YouTuber Filthy Frank uploaded a video deriding weeaboos, using an image of Chris as an example in his song about them; he can be seen at 10:08 in the video.

SleepyCabin
Sleepycast is a podcast hosted by many famous internet animators, including OneyNG, Psychicpebbles, Stamper and Spazkid.
On 14 December 2014, Spazkid, creator of Sonichu the Animated Series, described his fascination with Chris, how he began trolling in 2007, and why he ultimately regrets doing it. Despite this, he doesn't hesitate in calling Chris a retard and being aware that Chris is still a despicable human being.
“
Chris-Chan is—he’s an enigma which to so many people—they thought he was a troll. Because they’re like “there’s no way this motherfucker is real” because he’s like the most saddest human being ever. And it’s SAD because… I spent four years of my life fucking with him, and people are like “bring it back!” And I’m like, “NO! LET IT DIE.” It’s like depressing—it’s not the golden age—it’s the depressing age.
”
Spazkid, rebuking the weens.
In another podcast they made, they all got into a heated argument when Spazkid said that he believed that Chris-Chan at least tries to make decent content with a huge majority of the podcast members completely disagreeing with him.
They occasionally reference him sometimes in other episodes.
Interestingly, the Sleepycast members reveal that Harry Partridge once contacted Chris about developing a game with him. Apparently, Chris turned Harry down because he thought he wasn't a talented enough animator. Jump to 1:43:25 in the link.

Main article: WTFIWWY Segment
On the 29 December, 2014 edition of his What the Fuck is Wrong with You? podcast, Radio Dead Air (and Channel Awesome) star Nash and his co-star Tara discussed the 26 December 2014 incident. Until this point, Nash had shed away from discussing Chris for much the same reason as Linkara, but decided he had to discuss it to the overwhelming volume of attention and e-mail the incident generated, along with the utter insanity displayed by Chris.[7]

The Mysterious Mr. Enter
Animation reviewer The Mysterious Mr. Enter made a slight nudge at Chris while preparing to rant about the infamous "I Am Autism" commercial from Autism Speaks (one of many reasons why the organization is disliked among the autism community), saying that it "makes autistic people look worse than...I dunno, Chris-Chan does." Jump to 2:15 in the linked video--and by the way, that is a microphone, not a giant Icee cup. He also mentioned Sonichu near the end of his review of 12-oz. Mouse.

OneyPlays
OneyPlays is a gaming channel on YouTube run by popular animator Chris O'Neil, better known as "Oney" or "OneyNG." He and his friends Ding Dong and Julian (as well as other later frequent members of the show) occasionally reference Chris in their banter. In their playthrough of Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back, they came up with a humorous scenario where Chris becomes Harry Potter. They further mentioned that their favorite video of Chris is THAT IS MY HOUSE. Among the original three, Julian seems to be the most respectful toward Chris Chan, this is seen when he became somewhat upset when Oney called Chris Chan a retard in the F-Zero playthrough, and also in their Sonic Adventure playthrough, when Ding Dong joked about Chris Chan committing suicide by electrocuting himself with an Xbox, though despite all this, he does always end up laughing.
