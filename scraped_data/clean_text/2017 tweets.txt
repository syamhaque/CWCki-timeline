I've got lots to talk about. Standing up to bullies is top of my list.
Me too; I do not like bullies. People fear their kids will turn gay if the LGBTQ youth are protected; that's just dumb; Protect All Youth.
9:37 am
“No fair, I just wanted to insult a celebrity from comfort of my own home, I didn’t want them to stand up for themselves or show integrity”
@tarastrong You never know when people will get wind of the insult and rather or not they stand up for themselves after. People Stand.

I just find it comforting that @realDonaldTrump is tweeting about #Apprentice ratings & bogus wiretaps while #NorthKorea threatens war.

7 March
DoopieDoOver
Chris

I'm trying my best to understand people. BPD makes me rather judgmental towards those who've hurt me. Their actions confuse me.

5:18 am
@DoopieDoOver I have been hurt by a number of them, as well as some people in person aside. I have felt upset and emotionally distraught.

5:21 am
@DoopieDoOver Nowadays, I have put the bad people behind me, and I try to maintain a positive outlook; some success, but I still have...
5:23 am
@DoopieDoOver ...my own mental quandaries to try resolving. Anyhow, all we can do is take life one moment at a time, and do what we...

Ranting at Tara Strong about Cole
7 March

Chris tagged Tara Strong and Danny Zuker while making his multi-tweet rant, revealing his family drama to them.

London terror attack
22 March, 1:51 pm
Chris commented on the London tragedy, in which an attacker drove his car through a crowd of people. For some reason, Chris believed that the victims were passengers.

Why isn't anyone up at 1am and wanting to chill? Being an adult is so boring.
Chris
@DoopieDoOver I know. I'm unable to fall asleep right now, and I'm feeling bored from trying to sleep and fail.
@DoopieDoOver And to be an adult sometimes involves a Lot more stress and worry to fret over, which takes the fun away, then I'm bored.
@DoopieDoOver I'd like to be done adulting with a lady friend and "just be pony".
Doopie
Like i would literally drive to someone's house at 1am just to watch netflix and draw on my laptop. I just like company.

Discussing creativity with Emgo316
8 April, 5:58 pm
Emgo
Why do I often get people calling Mascot "minion"? Where are they getting that from. I've never called him that lol
Chris
You have made your Mascot be viewed as beneath you, plus coining the term "Chest Minion" in the CW Review videos might have helped too.
Emgo
But I've never called HIM that, so it still makes no sense
Chris
What is your Mascot's name?
Emgo
His official name is stronius
Chris
May I suggest you do a review video of your Stronius, and tell us his backstory?
Emgo
I don't review family lol. I've told told the story of how mascot came to be a few times before.
Chris
Except Stronius reviewed your self-figure. LOL I just searched "Stronius emgo" on YouTube; not much to go on. If you have talked of him before, then I feel a compilation video of those bits, and some new details about him would be appropriate.
Emgo
I talked about mascot, not stronius. I told his story in the very first q&a I ever did and the transmissions podcast I was a guest on
Chris
I did not know that. Still, to a lot of other people who did not catch those, who were new to you (I'm sorry), A Mascot Story would be good
Emgo
How many times do I need to tell it?
Chris
Good question. I ask myself that every time I have something with Sonichu on it, and kids ask me, "Is that Sonic?" Or say, "Look! It's Super Sonic!" The short what it is, "It's Sonichu, the Electric-Hedgehog Pokémon." The kids have disregarded the fact and say, "Still looks like Sonic to me." Then I get a feeling of disappointment, as well as a mild irratation of anger, thinking "OH, MY GOD!!!"
In further thought, I'd guess try one who video on your channel, or maybe have someone write a comic book of Mascot. And then in future when someone else asks, you can refer them to the video or book. At least for me, I will always have "Sonichu #0", and the more than ten books of content with that. That I have personally drawn, written, colored, and put a lot of my love, heart and soul into it all. Then counter-points of stress and anxiety, in consistent multiples at the time, leave me feeling not in the mood to create; falling into a deep hole in my mind and heart, until when I can get myself recovered and out again, and work on the feeling when it hits me again at the random future time, and I'm back to work again for as long as possible. But I digress.
Missile strike against Syria

The following set of tweets are between Chris and andiemations (a Planet Dolan staff member). Andiemations's tweets are protected, so only Chris's side is archived. They appear to be talking about Twitter user guttygoop, who had tweeted a gore picture to andiemations.
Chris
You are not kidding, and he was following me too. UGH! The images he tweeted. I've reported him. By the way, I also thank you all for the recent countdown of "canned goods that shouldn't exist"; remembering the #2 item shocked Gutty's imagery from my imagination. I'll think of other things as well. Still, that canned bad; I was like, "NO! No no no no no...NO!"
Most Nobody of kind and good nature does not deserve to be subdued to such disturbances.
Quite alright. Still shocking to my eyes, regardless, I have seen equal or worse from the haters and trolls when they deface my webpages.

Weens
16 April, 10:42 am
Chris left an innocuous tweet on a photo of an MLP fan at a convention, who was wearing a plush pony on his head. Weens then spammed the thread with shitposting about Chris, resulting in one of MLP's VAs taking note, and thinking that the comments had been directed at the fan, asked people to show sympathy for him. The fan deleted his photo as a result.
Chris
Big Baby got hatched.

I love this guy and this picture. But for some reason it's brought out a rash of mean-spirited ratty comments. If you know him, send love.

Doopie defends Chris
21 April, 3:54 am
Chris and Doopie discussed hair-coloring. Weens then flocked to the thread to shitpost, and Chris brushed them away. Later, they returned in force, and both Doopie and Chris criticized them for barging into their conversation with unrelated spam.
Chris reacted to a ween who brought up DStecks, recycling several excuses as to why he hadn't been working on the comic he was paid $1,000 to do.
Chris
@DoopieDoOver Did you actually color your hair, or is it just your avatar?
DoopieDoOver
my hair used to be blonde, but it's brown now. A lot of people still draw my character with blonde hair but I prefer brown now.
Chris
That's cool. I think in comparison, you look more mature and smart as a brunette. I'd say welcome to the club, but I'm keeping my hair blue and cool like Sailor Neptune.
A ween intruded, saying, "More like brown and yellow like your underwear."
DoopieDoOver
I don't mean to be "that guy", but is commenting on this conversation necessary?
Chris
Do not listen to these two; they are a couple of the haters amongst the internet trolls. And I just reported and blocked both of them.
More weens then arrived.
Ween
Take it easy Chris, she already knows who you are and all you're antics. She and her boyfriend mocked you in one of their podcast.
Ween
Spend a day with Chris and see how long your Feels last for him. Ten+ years of his awful behavior (and current scamming) doesn't lie.
DoopieDoOver
You don't spend time with her either so? If you don't agree with her life choices, ignore it. Plain and simple.
Ween
White knight there much? Ask Chris if he's ever going to refund that guy the $1000 he paid him to draw comic pages for him.
DoopieDoOver
not yours or my problem. I like how you have to label me as a white knight because I'm standing up for someone minding their own business.
Ween
It's everyone's problem if he goes around scamming people.
DoopieDoOver
but what does that have to do with christine having a conversation with me. why do people have to butt into that. lol
Ween
LOL! You're all like "Why is everyine listening to me while I'm talking out in public for everyone to hear me?".
DoopieDoOver
this has nothing to do with the scam or whatever. she was literally talking to me about her hair. why are you so obsessed?
Ween
DoopiecameforCWC.jpg LOL

Chris
Thank you for defending me, Doopy. I feel blessed, for your recognition of my kindness. Lots of Love to you. 💖😊
Ween
Chris has done awful things, and not recognizing that just because she's nice to you is my issue. I respect your opinion, I just don't agree
Chris
As for you, Trolling lot, it is not my fault that I ended up feeling lost after the Lulu incident, and I DO intend to get back to drawing and writing the comics and whatnot. I have a dementia problem that makes me fall mentally blank, and when I end up not doing the task from the previous day, onward, because of distress from whatever situation kills my mood and emotions. And that is MY Problem. And for everyone else I still am indebted to with merchandise or whatever, I do intend to repay those few, whereas all of the others that I Have been able to serve before my problem happened, those are a Majority that have been satisfied, and I am a genuine soul who feels better not to leave debts unpaid, regardless of being overwhelmed with them. Alright? And that is ALL I am going to say to you three haters before I report and block y'all. Stop Hating on People and taking advantage. You lot make me sick.
And all of those mistakes are in the Past; get over yourselves, you Trolling Stupids.
DoopieDoOver
im not defending her on what she's done i'm saying that we were literally just talking about her hair.

fuck you if you treat my boyfriend poorly cause your jealous ass ain't hitting this. He's annoying. I tell him I hate him and that i will kill him. I push him away. But it's all because I love him and I get shy. I'm mean to him publicly, but he knows I'm not serious. I love him with all my heart. he treats me very well. he does not abuse me. you treating him poorly is treating me poorly. We are a packaged deal so if you can't handle it, unfollow me. :) Thanks!
Chris
I support genuine relationships, and as long as Doopie is happy with her partner, you all should be kind and supportive too. I don't understand why people feel they Have to(?) hate on others; it is just simply wrong and uncouth. Love Is Love! Have you read the comic book, "Love Is Love", @DoopieDoOver; it was a collaboration from the DC comic artists in response to the Pulse incident; I read it cover to cover; it is awesome. :)
