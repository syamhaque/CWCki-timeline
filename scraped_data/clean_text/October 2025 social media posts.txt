Hey, y'all.
I lack full understanding of internet communities that have a fascination of my life and a lot of memes and jokes. I had felt apprehensive when reading some of the things said about me by these communities, including on 4Chan.
But I admit that at times some of the people in...
...these communities have wanted to help me. Even Null and what he did for me after the events with IdeaGuy. I have become better aware of the efforts, and I appreciate it and I feel thankful for it.
I also have realized that sometimes comments are just simply commentary. They are not necessarily hate intended, and they are just a truthful expression from the person who posted them to whatever in the moment.
I sometimes take things online too personally. I want to work on that. ⚡️💙⚡️

Go Transformers!
Til All Are One, the Matrix and Allspark show the future of the past. The wisdom of the Primes and ages guide and show the way. And when it becomes a dark hour, they light it up with the power of their sparks.⚡️💙⚡️
