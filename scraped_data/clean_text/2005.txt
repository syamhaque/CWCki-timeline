On 5 November 2005, Chris gets his first e-mail from Megan.
2005 is the year where Chris turned 23 years old. It was, in retrospect, Chris's most productive year, largely due to the amount of free time he received upon being expelled from his college. He drew four issues of the Sonichu comic, and put much emphasis and effort into his Love Quest.
June and July were tumultuous, characterized by a series of fights between Chris and the local authorities, these clashes resulting in a court hearing with the charge being dropped, and, according to Chris, severe traumatic scarring.
This year also saw Chris gaining two of his most renowned friends, Anna McLerran and Megan Schroeder. The first, a Mormon PacSun employee, Chris met while pacing the mall on his Love Quest. The second, an insecure female otaku, he met playing Yu-Gi-Oh! at his local game store. His friendship with the latter would not end happily.
