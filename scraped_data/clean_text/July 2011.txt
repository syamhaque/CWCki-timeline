July was the seventh month of 2011. It saw slightly more activity from Chris; a couple of his new Internet activities were discovered, including a new Facebook page and an account on a tomboy/tomgirl forum.

The explicit videos he made for her this month, as well as their email correspondence, would not be leaked for some time.
