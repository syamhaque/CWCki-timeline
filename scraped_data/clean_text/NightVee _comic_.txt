This article is still yet to be completed due to stress. We get a lot of stressful torture in our lives that makes us crash into slumber. Given that inspiration is a big variable, and we may have been lacking of it, this article will be completed as soon as possible, at our own pace... HONEST! This article is missing the following:
• Synopsis
NightVee is a fan spinoff comic of Chris's magnum opus created by MKRNightVee in 2018. MKR posted pages of the comic on her tumblr and Twitter.
When Chris was in contact with MKR and her associates, he implemented many bits of lore from the comic, as well as some of MKR's other ideas, into his own,[1] as well as creating many cards based around the comic and its world for his TSSSF expansion series Nightvee & the Warriors For Andromeda.
Chris has also given his input on the comic on several occasions, and MKR made changes to it accordingly.[2]

Promotion
MKR promoted her comic over Twitter - her first tweet read (along with a scan of her NightVee Issue 1 cover):
“
The dimensional merge is coming people, be prepared and safe. The first issue of Nightvee will be released soon. Nightvee, Creamarina and I are excited to share our adventures. The 🌙💜🌙
”
MKR, 27 December 2018[3]
MKR also briefly uploaded videos onto YouTube under the channel Mkr Nightvee. According to Twitter user oldmoney, the videos were deleted after Chris followed her Twitter.[4] No copies of the videos have surfaced, however screenshots from oldmoney indicate that one was titled "Introduction of Mkrnightvee" (with a description reading "Hello everyone follow me on Twitter for more Nightvee content!" along with a link to her Twitter) and the other "Why I stopped the merge."[5]
Synopsis
Volume 1
Prologue
NiGHTS being freed from a magical prison by a rainbow of chaos energy. While flying, NiGHTS accidentally collides with an Eevee, causing it to evolve into a new flying Pokémon called "NightVee," a fusion of the two characters. The same energy also transforms a nearby Primarina into a more powerful form called Creamarina. The story concludes with the newly evolved Eevee, now able to speak, being reunited with his human owner and accepting the new name "Nightree" (Yes it was spelled that way) in honor of NiGHTS.
Episode 1
Creamarina is abandoned by her trainer for her new looks. She is immediately befriended by Rosechu, Together, they watch a news broadcast of Team Rocket attacking Pokémon Tower, it cuts to NightVee rescuing a girl and her Pikachu from the tower. Upon seeing him, Creamarina develops a crush. Two character summary pages later confirm she has feelings for NightVee, but he’s too oblivious to notice, and she’s too shy to tell him.
After the rescue, Nightvee realizes Team Rocket is stealing Pokémon and the corrupt police won’t help. Too weak to stop them alone, he flies off to find a stronger ally. Meanwhile, Reala who is NiGHTS’s nemesis is found weakened and captured by Team Rocket, leaving the episode on a cliffhanger as Giovanni prepares to use Reala’s powers for evil.
