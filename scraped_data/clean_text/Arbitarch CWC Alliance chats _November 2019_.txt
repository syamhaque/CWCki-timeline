Chris's invite

@ChrisChanSonichu1982 As stated we will be here all day if you wish to speak, whenever your available
Chris
Ah. Here, I see. I will be on later. Also, new word of the day for me, "Arbitarch"; can't find a definition on Google. Little help, please. I have an outing to go on today, but I'll be back on later today.
Hey, y'all.
I had a productive and good day. A little tired, but I still have some energy to chill and talk for a while.
For now, I'll recount the recent events.

Body-swapped with Tri
26 November 2019
I had body-swapped with Tri Sonichu to work on a number of planned setups for getting Magi-Chan back into 1218 and/or myself, fully, into C-197. I had to swap back with Tri earlier today, because his aura, And his body, have just become fully chakra-balanced and overpowered; he is Rainbow Aura too, now. [blushing emote]
So, for this total sync-up for himself, he needed to be fully together again. And I helped him get there with my abilities, and pre-existing Rainbow Aura of my own.
I will tell you this: The Rokat and Kidasuna really do have such a crazy slavery problem. After experiencing it first-hand, personally, under Magi-Chan and Tri's temp job in the VR Simulator that allows their avatar to go between dimensions. The co-workers I was working with were toughened, yet they all were simply Just Soo Tired of not only being Slaves, but for not getting paid for their work. They only get paid in nourishment and rest during their breaks in between shifts. It is simply horrific.
I am emotionally still caring of Jacob, and remain aware of his future self-sacrifice, but I will not have to be in too-close contact with him anymore.

Sockness's interview
Note: the "interview of Jacob" Chris mentions is an interview by GiBi, seen here, in which Sockness discusses his demonic fantasies.
26 November 2019
I sense the Interview of Jacob, that we've been hearing about lately, is possibly falsified, but it still woke me out of the infatuation I had, in mind, body and soul.
I still have yet to read the transcript of that interview.

RPing over Sockness
26 November 2019
Chris
As Aqua and Val had put it, he was a messenger of kidasuna, and he didn't know everything, yet he knew a lot with the help of Michiro.
So, we've been putting up with him in the selected fated events in order to learn and attain what we needed to proceed further.
Adjudiarch/Kylechu
I'm worried as to what the self-sacrifice will be, any idea?
Chris
I have foreseen it.
Cpu aqua
I was about to ask the same, Val has told me few things, he thinks im not ready to handle it all at once
Chris
Simply put: during the battle between Earth and Jakoba, where we all will be fully together to fight and defend Earth, us of 1218, and those of C-197, I will be sharing energies with everyone to take on an even more OP Jakoba, and Jacob will come in to attack Jakoba, but he will fall, and I will have need to recover after what I will go through in that fight round. Jacob will sacrifice himself to replenish my strength and energy in order to fully take down Jakoba with a final blow after a few more successful hits.
Adjudiarch/Kylechu
That is a vulnerable area in any event, considering alternatives would be preferable
Chris
But, of course, we still have the present goal of getting me and my body fully into C-197, so I can become fully able to use my powers and transformations and being them back with me into 1218.
Cpu aqua
Anything can happen until then, Nothing is set in stone yet according to Val
Chris
What does Val suggest on the initial dimensional traversement of myself? What was the situation with his Chris Chan? Getting her from "Reality" and into ZX-49.
Cpu aqua
Hers was relying on the unreliable.

Dimensional hot dog
26 November 2019
I can actually manifest what comes to mind in the C-197 side, including recently, where I was curious how a fried hot dog wiener would taste like, I manifested it into my hand, appearing only in C-197 and in my view. I was able to taste it and feel it's texture fully. It's not bad an idea, but still a fattening one that I would not pursue constantly.
I literally took a bite out of that hot dog.
Fragments of Chris's soul
26 November 2019
I've been focusing my energies and soul Everywhere, and in down time, focusing it in simpler tasks, including making the TSSSF cards.
My soul literally gets force-projected multiple times, divided, simultaneously, and so forth to Help As Many Individuals As Possible from pains and stresses and towards positive events.
One percent goes to help a mountain climber survive
One percent plays Guardian Angel to someone else
One Percent helps a child with their test
That is the way it has been with me for YEARS.
Chris has a paypig
26 November 2019
A member asked Chris about how his financial situation was going.
Fair, can get better. Strictly Confidential, I have a Very Generous Donor who donates greatly and consistently during the months.
BABScon plans
26 November 2019
Anyway, I have my badge, and a room reserved in the building the convention is in. I will still need to plan the train trip and remaining details, but so far, it is going good (not counting Jacob at all).
Still desperate for the Dimensional Merge
29 November 2019
I am not fully knowing of the final instance and moment in detail, but it is very soon. Someone on Twitter commented possibly February of 2020, but we are very optimistic it will be long before then. The Dimension Merge completion. As for getting me into C-197, that Has to happen ASAP.
Chris thinks he'll live for thousands of years
29 November 2019
And dying is not happening with me; I'm set to stay alive for thousands of years. Anyway I pray every night that I wake up the next day fully in C-197, also transformed into my Sonichu form. And snapping my fingers after the prayer does send my body a tingling in the frequency vibrations.
Chris's day-to-day life
29 November 2019
As for what I do while awake, on the recent, I get up, take my meds, meditate while playing Tetris 99 to at least take on the daily tasks for the game. Most days, I go out on errand or simple walking and bursts of Fast running speed on impulse. My typical walking pace is comparable to that of a speed-walker, and yet I'm not speed-walking, and I don't get tired out.
Anyway, during the time at home, I tend to binge a show, do some drawing or creative, work (namely the TSSSF cards and the comic pages).
