Description
Villains and Trolls Unite! The time has risen for our retribution against Christian Weston Chandler!
Flash back to 2008 with the Sonichu Villains Expansion Pack, featuring some of the iconic villains from the Sonichu comics (and Chris Chan's life, for real) back to ruin your love quest! Maybe this time, you can find common ground, agree to disagree. Who says all villain bretheren have cold hearts?
This set is based on past, outdated interpretations and should be enjoyed at that. A Homage to the Classic Chris Chan (and Christine Chan) Sonichu.
This pack was a compilation assembled by "The Sergeant At Arms"; check out his channel on YouTube, and I, Chris Chan Sonichu, personally approve and endorse. This Expansion Pack contains 45 cards.
Cost:
$21.00[1]
