Chris emerged from his chrysalis a strange butterfly.
The 2010s: Chris was aged between 27 and 37.
One of the darkest decades in the CWChronology at the time, the 2010s were notable for events such as Bob's death, the 2014 house fire, Chris becoming transgender, and the further erosion of Chris’ mental health, especially at the hands of the Idea Guys throughout late 2017 and early 2018. It also saw Chris have numerous run-ins with the law: he harassed The GAMe PLACe,[1] was arrested for hitting Michael Snyder with his car while attempting to flee,[2] and was later arrested again for macing a GameStop employee.[3]
