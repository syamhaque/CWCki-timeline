The 2020 Discord leaks refers to material involving Chris that was posted by Naught to the Official CWCki Server starting on 10 August 2020. It ranges from DMs, screenshots, photos, and select excerpts of Discord servers such as The Place. Naught often did not label the contents and added in his own commentary. On at least one occasion, he spun a chatlog excerpt so as to portray Chris in a positive light.[1]
When Chris joined the Official CWCki Server at Naught's request, Chris was surprised to find the Sonichu Journal Pages present among the leaks and complained about it in The Place.[2]
