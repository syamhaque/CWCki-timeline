“
Hey, @everyone. For starters, in light of the recent events @Neko has been through, and the light shedding on the toxic trio, an announcement with care for now:
To all of you in my flock, I highly encourage each of you to begin and continue your own individual self-work in enlightenment. For amongst you all, as the Dimension Merge/Collective Shift draws closer upon the main event with the removal of the veil between our universe halves, each of you has your own inner potential and strength. We have no need for war or quarrel at all with the OCs and individuals of C-197, as I state to all of those individuals in regard to us of 1218.
Unity and a greater strength for our combined Earth and galaxies is at hand. Need not take arms, but be open for the good in each other.
All superheroes and deities, myself included, and other individuals of military strengths and powers, and the leaders of each nation and countries; on both halves of this whole Earth, we maintain wisdom and peace for the greater whole as best as we are capable of.
It is not perfect, but we are most appreciative and grateful for the understanding and compassion of the general public and flocks there of that we each help, work with, and defend, during these times at hand.
And to you all until my next announcement or insight, I state in positive encouragement to you all: Be safe and well with lots of love. Thank you.
⚡️💙⚡️

The "Toxic Trio" (sometimes dubbed the "Toxic Duo" after the departure of Kyle) consists of the three former Watchmen members Naught, Kyle and MKRNightVee. These were also the three primary members of the group, with Naught being the leader, Kyle being his second-in-command, and MKR providing Chris a numerable amount of art which was used to influence Chris with. For once, Chris had provided a befitting name to something he hated this time around, as these members were also subject of stirring up drama, both within the Watchmen group and with other orbiters. They also happened to be the most possessive of Chris, with Naught spreading rumors about orbiters like Praetor, MKR threatening to leave Chris to play with tasers to guilt trip him back into The Place, and Kyle siding with both of them on pretty much everything they complain about.
Chris began distancing himself from these three particularly toxic Watchmen as a result of conflicts between both the Watchmen and Praetor. This worsened after the trio had banned Anaxis from The Place, and attempted to replace him as Lainchu. The final straw for Chris was when Naught had doxed The WCT, something that WCT informed Chris about in an interview, convincing Chris to distance himself from the trio.

Strike 1: Crystalgate
Main article: Praetor-Watchmen Conflicts
“
Not to break our friendships or anything, but from the way you all have been talking and behaving lately, including deviating from the serious moments of the merge and the present events, not to mention how you all play-bullied in the recent voice chat, in general; to be blunt, I am beginning to feel like you all are not on the same page as I and Chris are. It feels disappointing.
”
Chris, roleplaying as Sonichu, calling out the Watchmen for their feud with Praetor.[2]
The first strike at the Watchmen's credibility was when they had gotten into an imaginary feud with Praetor, a feud that proved to be entirely pointless.
Chris introduced Praetor to the Watchmen on 22 September 2020, hoping for both parties to coexist.[3] However, the Watchmen had been suspicious of Praetor potentially extorting from Chris or manipulating him. However, because of how Praetor presented themselves as a benevolent party that worked in Chris's best interests, it was significantly more difficult for the Watchmen to target them. Because of this, the Watchmen kept a careful eye on all of Praetor's activities with Chris, looking for anything they could use against them. After they doxed the Praetors, the Praetors showed no concern for this, which only pushed the Watchmen further.
After Chris stated that he wanted to borrow tasers from Praetor on 5 February 2021 to shock both his Gate Crystal and Celestial Key, the Watchmen had been intent on confronting Caden about this. Naught created a Kiwi Farms thread about Praetor's supposed plans.[4] Following this, Caden discussed the incident with the Watchmen, something which Anaxis recorded in Thinking with Portals. Later that night, Caden had gotten involved in a voice chat recorded by The WCT with the Watchmen Naught, Kyle, MKR, and Val, as well as Chris. Throughout the call, the Watchmen that were present lambasted Caden, but Chris continually told everyone involved that they should get along.
Chris saw what was going on after this and confronted the Watchmen about their behavior. [2] Due to his dislike for conflict amongst his allies, and how the Watchmen were ultimately unable to convince Chris that the Praetors were somehow harmful to him, as the Guard Dogs did with the Idea Guys or the Arbitarch CWC Alliance did with Jacob Sockness, Chris ultimately sided more with Praetor. This caused Chris to begin backing himself away from the Watchmen that were leading the attacks: Naught, Kyle, and MKR.
Strike 2: Banning of Anaxis

“
And if they haven't done any weenish stuff lately, maybe they're just focusing on the business. I still think it's possible that they're not so much malicious as they are naive.
If Josh or one of us just calmly asked if they could stop with the ween stuff, their response would be a good gauge for how willing they are to be cooperative.
If we come at them with hostility right off the bat, that won't come off very well, especially if Chris is actually making money from them (plus he likes them)
If they're talked down and just continue the business while giving chris a fair share, then I see no reason we can't coexist with Praetor.
Of course, if they continue weening anyway, that's a different story, but we won't know unless we try.

@Lainchu Are you a part of Praetor?

The second strike was when the trio began terrorizing their own members, accusing them of being in on conspiracies with Praetor.
Following the conflicts with the Praetors, significant infighting had occurred between the Watchmen. The "Toxic Trio" began antagonizing the Watchmen Anaxis and The WCT. With Anaxis in particular, MKRNightVee had been accusing Anaxis of conspiring with Praetor due to him suggesting that they approach the group less aggressively, and questioning some of the claims that the Watchmen had been making about Praetor, pointing out how the Watchmen's approach had been turning Chris against them.[6] Eventually, Anaxis had gotten exiled from the Place server out of a combination of his proposal on how to approach Praetor, as well as his opinions on Christubers, and MKR accusing Anaxis of being involved with the MKRs Bloody Chunks acount.[7]
Chris didn't take Anaxis' ban kindly, with Chris questioning Kyle on why he got banned. While Kyle had tried to ease Chris by claiming they did this out of Anaxis being "unproductive", this did little to appease him.[8] Because Anaxis, the previous person who played Lainchu, had been banned from the server, and Chris was dependent on the character, Lainchu needed a replacement. When WCT had volunteered for the role, it was decided that he'd be the new Lainchu. Chris however, didn't accept The WCT as Lainchu, deeming Anaxis as the "One True Channeler", and deeming The WCT as channeling an "impostor" [sic] Lainchu.[9]
The Watchmen's attempt to replace Anaxis had resulted in Chris posting on The Place server less often. It had gotten to the point where when Chris shared two lists, inspired by Molly the Medium, it made the Watchmen anxious that Anaxis was controlling Chris behind the scenes as a result of Chris miscommunicating with them.[10] However, the Watchmen ultimately gave up the Lainchu character in favor of implementing other characters into Chris's lore.

“
Coup D'etat under way.
The Watchmen are about to fall.
”
The WCT on the fall of the Watchmen.[11]
The final blow to the trio's grasp on Chris, and perhaps the most crucial one, was when Naught had doxed The WCT.
On 28 June 2021, another autistic slapfight arose between the Watchmen, this time between Naught and The WCT after WCT declined on giving Naught access to one of his Kiwi Farms accounts after getting banned for abusing sock puppets.[12] Naught then proceeded to dox WCT, which he did under the account Nightmare.
The WCT then had an interview with Chris where he tells Chris about the activities the Watchmen had been performing behind his back, and tells Chris that he should make his own decisions about who he hangs out with and not have the trio oversee him.[13] Chris, angered at all that WCT had told and shown him, was thoroughly convinced by him to leave The Place server and join WCT's Knights of CWC server instead.
Aftermath: Involvement with the Mean Girls
“
Yeah, we dont want people to know we have Naught and MKR here

Halal Server member Sakura Blossom on concealing MKR and Naught's involvement in the server.[14]
Usually the saying goes "three strikes, and you're out". But true to their CPU Goddess-given nickname, the trio; now short of Kyle; had other plans to be petty as fuck. Because of how The WCT was able to sway Chris away from them, the duo were intent on getting revenge on The WCT. They took advantage of how he was being vilified due to his communications with Bella, someone who the Watchmen previously expressed concerns over.[15]
After MKRNightVee had falsely claimed that The WCT "probably" wanted Chris to kill himself on Twitter,[16] Mean Girls leader Spooky Bones sought her out on her GrafinDusyTold account. Spooky was then invited into the Halal Server run by her associates on 18 August 2021.
