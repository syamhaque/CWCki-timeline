Title: Open Relationship E-mails

Categories: E-mails, Catherine Saga
================================================================================

Prior to, during, and in the aftermath of Chris's open relationship with Catherine, a number of emails were exchanged between him and one or more trolls. Two female personae were created (Shaina and Renee) and a third, black male one called Colin. Given that all three characters supposedly knew Catherine (and corroborative details were thus necessary) they almost certainly worked in tandem with the troll who played the part of Catherine, or Catherine's troll herself may have been one of the puppetmasters.
The emails involving Shaina and Colin concern the Open Relationship drama almost exclusively, but his correspondence with Renee began after both of the other two exchanges had finished, and detail Chris's reaction to the relationship ending and his fury at Renee refusing to be his girlfriend now that Catherine is out of the picture.

She's With Colin

Hi Christian,
I actually haven't seen Catherine since about 3 this afternoon.
Nikki surprised Catherine by asking her to be a bridesmaid at her wedding, and this afternoon we had a party to celebrate (more of a brunch really). After the party Colin (one of the groomsmen) asked Catherine and I to go sailing, followed by dinner afterwards. I told Colin and Catherine to go without me. because I was still feeling hung-over from the bachelorette party, and spending a few hours on the water with my queasy stomach didn't sound very appealing.
I tried calling Catherine a couple of times, but she's not answering her phone. Depending on what time she and Colin got back, they could still be having dinner (which would explain why her phone is turned off). I'm not sure which train she's catching to get home. I'll let you know when I hear from her.

To: Shaina Cohen
I pray Colin is not trying anything funny on her, even though our relationship is open. I would continue to support her for who she is and everything. But I do not know who Colin is, and I feel at unease with the risk of breaking up with me going on. I pray she doesn't fall for him or anything. **sigh** I am feeling worry over Catherine. Please Do keep me posted on her. And if you get in touch with her very soon, please tell her I am still sorry over what happened, I continue to pray for her safety and well-being, I worry about her. and I miss her a lot. Even though it has been like three days, it really feels like forever. You know what. I am going to text that to her right now!

You don't have to worry about Colin. I've known him for a few years. He's a very nice guy from a very respectable (and wealthy) family. He's not the type of guy that would try anything inappropriate with Catherine. I still haven't heard from her, but that doesn't mean that anything is wrong. She may have turned her phone off. and just forgotten to turn it on again. I've turned off my phone while at a movie, then forgotten to turn it on again afterwards.
I'm sure everything is fine.

I'm sorry Christian, I wasn't trying to make you feel bad. I was just trying to reassure you that Colin was from a good family and was of good character. He's not the kind of person who would force himself on a woman. If he were the kind of person you're worried about. I would have said something to Catherine.

She's Strong But I Have To Micromanage Her Social Life
29 Sep 2014
Well, there's not much else I can do. I've already texted her. I pray she responds soon. I understand her for being a strong and strong-willed woman, but I still worry and care about and for her.
When you called her phone; does it go straight to voicemail; that is how you know her phone is off or disabled? And have you tried calling Colin to check on her? Also, how soon from now is the wedding?

I'm curious. What's going on with you and Catherine? I haven't heard from her since you and she left to go sailing. Did you end up taking her to Le Cirque?
Anyway, I've tried calling her and I texted her several times. She finally texted me a few hours ago. All she said was that she's going to be staying in the city for a few more days.
So dish.... what's going on? What have the two of you been up to?

That's alright; I read it anyway. I promise not to contact Colin.
And please forgive me if I am acting in a bit of. well, somewhat off or mal-content. but I am worrying about our relationship so much. And I am fearing that Colin may be turning Catherine on. Feel free to ignore the following request, but should Colin respond that he is attracting her well, I want you to tell him to be repellant to her. I feel certain he would not honor or respect her for the person and bisexual she is, nor would he offer her the open relationship with deepest care, fondness and loyalties to her that I have been. I wish I could afford to make a trip to New York myself to intervene with honor and stand up for our relationship, but too much responsibility here and lack of funds prevent me from much sorts of a rush and spontaneous trip.
UGH!!!
I appreciate you contacting him to find out more. Thank You.

Christian,
Colin may be angry right now. but he's not a troll, and he's not going to give out Catherine's email address. He's not that kind of a person. Even if he is mad at you, I'm sure he wouldn't do that to her. He was abrupt with you because you kept pestering him and he got angry. Colin also has a very odd sense of humor, which can rub you the wrong way if you don't know him.
You've got nothing to worry about. I'm sure Catherine will be in touch with you.

Oh yeah, and he gave me shit about ccing you on that message.
Colin is a nice guy, but he can be a bit abrupt, especially if someone says something to piss him off. He says you keep bothering him. and that you've been insulting and made threats. If he thinks you're messing with him, he's not going to be very nice.
I really wish you had left this alone Christian. I tried to do you a favor by contacting Colin to try and find out what was going on. Now he's pissed at me and. as a result, he probably won't tell me anything.

Colin E-mails
These emails were between Chris and "Colin Boyle", whom Chris understood to be a wealthy man and whom he perceived as a dire threat to Catherine's affections. Note that instead of talking to Catherine about this, Chris simply attacks his perceived male competitor, as he believes Catherine will just go to whoever clamours most for her attention like some kind of dog.

Not only That, but I fully support her for the Orientation she is, as well as The Sweetest, Kindest and most True and Pure Soul that she is! I can only imagine that your Cold, Money-Filled Blue Blood will not satisfy or fulfill her emotional needs. She and I are a great 95+% Match from the over one thousand questions we both have answered on our OKCupid Profiles! You can never top that!
If you have any shred of a heart or respect as a human being, I would deeply appreciate it if you would be repellant to Catherine, and encourage her to stay with the one who can Emotionally Support Her Fully and Utmost!

Have You Heard From Catie?
1 October 2014
Christian to Shaina
Have you heard anything new from Catie? I texted her agln yesterday now; still nothing. I am not going to be able to ease up on the worry until I hear from her again. Our relationship was on a thin line the last time we talked last Thursday (I forwarded the emails to you). I feel need to know for sure that she and I are still a couple, and that need is growing more desperate for me each passing day. I even thought about her when I responded to Britney Spears talking about how women should be more self-confident, and that men were not needed, on Facebook.

The Past Lesbian

That's nice. I would suggest something of the past, like an English Dress. She and I, we were going to do a "Lesbians Through Time" Theme between our matching costumes. I will put together a 70s Groovy Gal outfit for the Modern Lesbian; she was to be the Past Lesbian. Also, check this out: http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_lesbianism_in_the_United_States
It is a Great Read. Melissa Etheridge is a Lesbian too.
Also, Catie is going through a rough time herself (I will let her tell you herself), but good news: she and I are still In Our Relationship as a couple. But in her patch, I really do feel for her as well; I have gone through similar times with my father a lot up to his passing.
Thank you for checking in.

Oh, Catherine and I were talking about more of a Catwoman/Dominatrix sort of thing. There's a prize for the best costume, and it would be fun if Catherine won. (I won 2 years ago so I've had my turn.) I'll run your idea by her and see what she thinks.
Catherine explained to me that you and she had an open relationship. That's very impressive. There aren't a lot of people that are that open minded.

Hi Christian,
I passed your suggestion along to Catherine. Colin had already talked her into going as a dominatrix. She was really amused by the idea. Colin is going to go as her slave. (The whole slave thing made me uneasy, because Colin is black. NYC is a very politically correct place. He's OK with it though so I guess they'll be fine. "Slave" means something completely different in BDSM circles anyway.) I really think they may have a shot at winning the costume contest.
Maybe Catie will she'll send you some pics of her in her costume if you ask nice.

Really? Colin is black? Huh. I mean, it is cool; I guessed he was white. I stand corrected. I will not oppose or anything like that. After what she is going through with her father right now and all, she deserves to have the fun. She has expressed interest in dominating in her OKC profile, so I had known about that. She answered Over One Thousand Questions on there; I answered all of them as well, which put her and me at a 97% Match. I would like to see her in the costume; I will ask her for photos later. Thank you for telling me. Have a good and safe day.

You don't get why males should be top-covered? Well, for one thing, I find their BREASTS simply horrific and vulgar, and the nipples do not help them either. Second, a LOT of Males are going to end up with drooping "B" Cup or Bigger breasts ANYWAY; would you want those things flopping all about while they're topless? I would not! BLECH!!! Third, there is a Major thing called MODESTY; not many people like show-offs. UGH!!!

Christian,
I don't understand why you seem so angry. Very few people get offended by shirtless males or male nudity or whatever. You expressed your personal preference, I expressed mine. No harm, no foul.
I've seen quite a lot of topless males, and the ones that have large floppy breasts are usually that way because they're fat or they have a medical condition. It's not as common as you make it out to be.
Honestly Christian, do you really think it's worth getting yourself this worked up over something so trivial? If you don't like topless men, look away (and stay out of male strip clubs).
And, just between you and me, this is one of the things that bothers Catherine about you. She hasn't told you because she's waiting for the right time. I'm telling you as a favor.
I Feel Conflictions + Here We Go part II
3 October 2014 9:28 PM
Christian to Shaina
Oh.
I apologize for my attitude earlier; I was going under mental (adjustment) stress over it being early to me for either of us to, well, sex with other people, when she and I have not yet. I told her about that earlier today. I had guessed she was mutual on the feeling, but I was mistaken. The open relationship Was my idea, including for supporting her for being a bisexual; free to explore. But now she wants to see Colin more, and then he told me about her telling him of her desire for a menage a trios with two males. Anyway, I collected myself, and I told her that as long as she still loves and cares about me, as much as I do for her, I won't be upset if she wants to do anything with Colin. But with him, I feel need to emphasize that it would have to be with HER Sober Consent towards doing anything. I am trusting him in keeping her safe and well, but if he does anything to her against her will and consent, well that is just plain downright awful of him!!!
And Catherine is put off by me due to how I feel about topless men? Uh... I don't know what to think or say in response to that. She means the world to me, but then I feel strongly towards the cause. I feel conflictions that I need to sort out through.
Let me ask you, Shaina, do you REALLY BELIEVE that More than Half of the Whole Population between BOTH Genders do not feel offense, even from the WORST Case Scenario of the male breasts?! I feel you could ask around; maybe start a Public Poll; asking EVERYONE to Vote Once Per Person, Are They Really Not Offended by the Males' Bare Breasts? If you can prove to me, out of OVER One Million People, that more than half of them are Truly Not Offended, I will close the Facebook Page, and reprogram my mind tediously to not feel offended at the sight, or at least tolerate them. UGH! Actually, in mid to heavy public situations, I would tolerate them anyway (while averting my gaze).

Why Male Chests?
3 October 2014 9:45 PM
Shaina to Chris
Christian,
I'm glad to see that you've calmed down. Didn't Catherine tell you that we went to a male strip club after the bachelorette party (and those guys took off more than just their shirts)? Anyway, based on what I saw at the party, Catherine definitely does enjoy bare male chests (and nudity) so it would probably be a good idea to not keep bringing this up around her.
And yes, I not only believe that most people don't have an issue with topless males (whether they have moobs or not) I know this to be a fact, based on my experience. As a matter of fact, you're the first person I've ever met that has this odd prejudice. And no, I'm not conducting a poll - :). I've got better things to do.
If you feel that strongly about your topless men Facebook page, leave it up.
All joking aside, how often do you actually encounter topless men? I doubt very much that they're walking around in the street, or in stores or restaurants. It seems to me that you won't have a lot of trouble avoiding them.

Yo! Colin!
Shaina has just forwarded me the email you just sent her.
For your information, I am VERY SERIOUS about encouraging Males to wear Sports Bras to Cover Up. NOBODY is ever truly impressed with the topless male nudity. I, for one, find it VULGARLY OFFENSIVE! I truly feel like throwing up every time I see some Male running around topless while outside working, walking or whatever! >:(
And I have informed Catherine that in OUR Relationship, I was remaining abstinent for her when she felt ready for any penetrative sex, which she has had none at all. I had theorized she felt the same mutually. I Truly do have my own mental default hangups against the Majority of the Male Population, because the Lot of them did me More Bad Than Good! UGH!!! Damn Trolls and Bullies!!!
And from what you have said, you are portraying yourself to be among the Majority who just plain Bothers and Offends Me.
I am trusting you to respect Catherine and her wishes, safety and well-being. If I hear anything bad has come to her without her sober consent, you will see trouble from me!

Well, most people don't find shirtless men offensive (Catherine certainly doesn't), so I guess you're shit out of luck there. Serious or not, your FB page is still fucking hilarious.
Why are you making such a big issue out of something so trivial? Are you in some kind of denial? Does the sight of shirtless men make you all warm and tingly? Do shirtless men give you naughty thoughts?
You don't have to worry about Catherine. She's in very good hands with me. I've never left a woman feeling unsatisfied.

I am really pissed off at his crappy attitude on me and my project. I am trusting him with Catherine, Solely on Your Praises of him. You tell him that it would be appreciated that he Shuts The Hell Up with his Damn Laughing against me. He will not listen to me, because he does not understand I am being Serious. Right now, he is putting himself in the Stereotypical of the Uncaring, Idiotic, Feeble-Minded Male Population, that makes up the Majority of the Worldwide Male Population (not counting the minority of actual Caring, Empathetic, Understanding and Intelligent Males, which makes the remainder).
I Really Do Not Like Colin Bryce Boyle.

I do not Trust Him
I want you to make sure Catherine remains safe and well; if she decides she wants to do something with Colin, I would appreciate it very much if you would make Positive her decisions were made with full consent and Sober. That SOB is no better than any one of the Trolls and Cyber-Bullies, even the Jock Bullies from real life High School! I have no idea why you think highly of him when he keeps bullying and mocking anyone like This! He is an inconsiderate SOB.
If I were you, I would plain dump him, and tell him to stay the hell away from Catherine (I am not saying this out of jealousy, but Think about it, Shaina: He IS being a Bully to one of your friends).

Colin Likes You

Shaina to Christian
Christian,
He's not being a bully, he just has an odd sense of humor. I told you, he likes you.
Colin never insulted you personally, he just thinks your Brassieres for Males Facebook page is funny. He's just expressing his opinion. That's not bullying.
I am a little offended though that you seem to be implying that Colin would get Catherine drunk and rape her. He's not that type of guy. Believe me, Colin has no trouble finding women willing to have sex with him. He appreciates Catherine for who she is. She isn't just some one night stand to him.

I Can Help Him

Colin to Shaina
I guess some people can't take a joke huh? I was just trying to have a little fun with Christian.
Anyway, I took another look at that page. Based on his pictures, it looks like Christian is significantly overweight. I'm beginning to think that Christian's problem with topless males is actually projecting his hatred of his own body. A lot of men are ashamed of having man boobs but they don't make silly Facebook pages, they actually do something about it. (I'm sorry but, as funny as it is, that Facebook page is ridiculous.)
If he's up for it, I can help Christian with his problem. With a good diet and a some gym time, he can have a chest [almost] as nice as mine. He won't need to wear a bra anymore.
As you know Shaina, women love a bare chested man with nicely defined pecs and washboard abs. Catherine is certainly appreciative. When we were out sailing, she insisted that I keep my shirt off. She said she enjoyed "the view".
Anyway, I think I'm beginning to understand now why Christian is so upset over this, and I'm wiling to help him if he's up for it.

Christian,
Colin sent me this in response to your last email, which I forwarded to him. I think it says a lot about Colin that he's willing to help you improve your health and appearance with diet and exercise advice, even though you insulted him and pretty much came out and said that you were a date rapist.
You should also know that Catherine is pretty pissed off about the whole date rape thing. She told me she doesn't like being treated like a child and she's perfectly capable of judging someone's character. To her, it feels like you're trying to micro-manage her relationship with Colin. Anyway, it's probably best if Catherine tells you about this herself. She told me she was going to talk to you about it, after she'd calmed down.

Firstly, I had received and responded well to Catherine's email. Second, based on what you have forwarded to me, I will unblock him. And More Importantly, I am NOT THAT FAT. I have, and will continue to, lose the weight. I have Not been projecting anything onto anyone else. I appreciate his gesture, but I take offense to the fat comment. I am now around 200, give or take two or three. You can forward this to him and tell him I take a Lot of things very seriously.

Talk To Him Yourself
4 October 2014 3:35 PM
Shaina to Christian
Christian,
He didn't actually say you were "fat" he said "overweight" which can be anything from a couple of pounds overweight to 20 plus pounds overweight.
To be honest with you, I'm a little overweight myself. I've been spending a lot more time sitting down, due to work and school, and I've gained about 20 lbs. I'm doing something about it though. I run every morning and I lift weights three times per week.
Compared to Colin, I guess a lot of guys would be considered "overweight". He's 6/3 and around 185 lbs. You could grate cheese on his abs. He's helped me out in the gym, and he really knows what he's doing. Colin also taught me how to make healthy, low-fat meals for myself. Like I said, he's a good friend.
Also, you really need to talk with Colin directly, rather than having me relay messages for you. Catherine mentioned this to me as well. She thinks you're intimidated by Colin for some reason, and you're afraid to talk to him. I know that's not the case, and you're stronger than that, but, at this point, Catherine may need some convincing.
Besides, and email can't really hurt you. It's just a bunch of text on a screen. You're tougher than that, right?
Colin Didn't Realize
4 October 2014 5:02 PM
Colin to Shaina
I didn't realize Christian was so sensitive about his weight. He says he's around 200 lbs. Do you know how tall he is?
He really does need to lighten up though. I still don't understand why he's getting upset over my laughing at his silly Facebook page. Have you seen it? How was I (or anyone) to know that it wasn't a joke? Catherine thought it was pretty hysterical as well. Did he get mad at her too?
Colin Is Fun
7 October 2014 12:40 PM
Shaina to Christian
I always kid Colin that he's not like us "regular folk". Colin tends to have a very lighthearted approach to life. He's rich (he worked his ass off to get there, but that's a long story) and he doesn't have the same kind of problems that people like you and I do. Colin is always in a good mood and he laughs a lot. That's just part of who he is and it's one of the reasons people like him so much. Colin is fun to have around. His sense of humor can be a bit of an acquired taste, but you'll probably get used to it.
I've been in an open relationship and I can tell you it's not easy. The man I was seeing was also seeing two other women, and he slept with a third. Open relationships can get tricky, because there are no set in stone rules. They're pretty common in NYC, where a lot of people don't want to settle down and get married. People here like the flexibility that an open relationship offers.
It's good that you're researching open relationships on Wikipedia, but no amount of research can prepare you for the real thing, trust me. The best way to learn about open relationships is by being in one. It's not always easy, but it can be rewarding.
You don't need to try to become friends with Colin (I'm not sure this would work anyway because the two of you are very different types of people), just accept his involvement with Catherine and try not to create any drama. That's the best advice I can give you.

About The Handcuffings
Yo.
Christian Chandler to me
About the handcuffings: ONLY ONE of the two was when they took me "downtown" with fingerprints and mugshots. I did not have to spend a night in jail; my parents bailed me out. And I was found Not Guilty on the Solicitation Charge. The other handcuffing was just to the Fashion Square Mall Office; my parents bailed me out of there as well. I wish to be the one that tells her about the handcuffings; I have told her the story about when my mother and I both were arrested for a trespassing setup. The store owner failed in his trap and got nothing out of the deal. Meanwhile, we have "Felon" labels hanging over our heads until next June. Aside from that, we are all good here.
Jerkops: Police People who abuse the power of their badges to cause more evil of their own wills, and abuse the innocent more.
Manajerks: "Managers" of a place who give innocent people a difficult time when they are just plain evil or bored.
If you really want to know more about all of that, and also see how bad my name has been made out to be, you can visit the Internet Troll and Cyberbully Controlled website against me, the damn Cwcki. |:(

You're A Felon?
Colin Bryce Boyle to Christian
I won't say anything to Catherine, but you've just confirmed that you have a police record, which I find disturbing. You (and your mother?!) must have done something pretty serious in order to have the label 'Felon' put on you. Are you saying that you're on probation until next June? That's not good. Catherine has a right to know, but I'll trust you to tell her. If you don't though, I will: She deserves to know the truth. You're right though, it's better if she hears it from you.
How the hell did you get hit with a solicitation charge? Were you some sort of prostitute? I'm confused. None of this sounds good.
I still don't get the whole 'Jerkops' and 'Manajerks' thing. These sound like silly made up words a petulant spoiled child would use. If you want to be taken more seriously, just say 'Police', 'Cops', or 'Managers'. Using childish terms makes you look foolish and less credible.
Are you sure you're emotionally mature enough to handle an open relationship? It seems like you have some growing up to do.
Here We Go part IV
Christian Chandler to me
It was not serious, just a major pain in our asses. Long Story Short: I used to go to the Game & Hobby PLace for TCG play (mostly Pok'emon). Michael John Snyder, who Later came to be the Manager of it, hated me for his own messed up reasons, and was looking for an excuse to ban me from there. He did so in April of 2008. I had returned two years to plead with him to unban me; his heart was as cold as the apex of Mount Everest; he would not listen or let me get a word in edgewise. Fast Forward to October, 2011: my mother and I were driving by the PLace; it had a sign, "Under New Management". I took that to mean Snyder was gone, and I was free to return. We enter, He Is There, NOW as the Manajerk. But he had a trap set up for me at least: he hired people from the next door Staples to act as witnesses of the Trespassing. As my mother and I tried to escape, Snyder stood in front of our van like Stonewall Jackson. He even TWICE kicked our front bumper and Faked His Falls. We managed to get out of the parking lot without anyone getting hurt, but that was a victory short lived, the Jerkops Snyder paid off as well, pursued us, physically abused us, arrested us; a nightmare night in freaking jail. The following morning, my church's Pastoral Counsoler, Rev. Rocky Shoemaker, bails us out. The months of trials were a pain onus. Under Rob Bell's chicken advisement, we pleaded guilty; we were under monthly observed probation for a few months, followed by Unobserved Probation that will be over next June. Meanwhile, Snyder got NO Financial compensation at all for his setup. We guessed that the Staples employees turned on his sorry ass, and he was left with less allies. As early as a few months ago, I heard the PLace went out of business and closed. I later drove by and visually confirmed it for myself; empty, dark and deserted.
The Trolls take their own tabs on me, even as far to Spy In Person on me sometimes. They have observed and made their mockery of the trials and details related to the case. But from my point of view, that's about the whole story in all its love and glory. Catherine has been told the story as well, by me personally.
It was all a set up by Snyder to get me in deep shit and more nightmarish stress and emotional/mental abuse. My mother was an innocent bystanding victim of circumstance from my enemies.
**sigh**...
Also, the "solicitation": another long story short: with my Autism, I had less ability in foreseeing incoming circumstances to my actions. With my paranoia, fears and whatnot, in late 2003, I started just hanging out between PVCC, Fashion Square and Wal-Mart's McDonalds (when it was there), With a Sign that simply stated, "Hello, I am a 2X (twenty-age back then) Single Male, seeking an 18-2X-year old Boyfriend-Free Woman to become my Sweetheart from the Ground-Up". For a long time, I had NO Idea or Clue that what I was doing was being viewed as solicitation. About two years later, I was Finally informed directly about my sign being viewed as something of Solicitation. I stopped using the sign forever. I stayed away from Online Dating, it was NO GOOD to me, because I preferred meeting women In Person and Face to Face. Newspaper Ads were money better off saved. I had thought of just about EVERY OTHER OPTIONS AVAILABLE AT THE TIME, and none of them were any good to me. And I was just TOO DAMN SHY THAT I COULD NOT GET OVER FOR YEARS. I felt like I was Publicly Invisible for YEARS. I had not understood what the hell was Wrong with me. What the hell was wrong with Women making the first move, especially since I was most Unable to make ANY MOVE AT ALL.
So, there's that story too. Think what you may or will. My adult life in my twenties were miserable and depressing to me.
Bullshit
Colin Bryce Boyle to Christian
Christian,
I'm trying very hard, to be polite here but I have to call bullshit. This is the biggest crock of shit I've ever read. I did as you suggested and Googled you. The incident you mention above is fully documented, including your arrest record. Official documents don't lie.
Trying to run someone down with your car isn't something minor. As if that wasn't bad enough, the arrest record states that your MOTHER assaulted a police officer and you resisted arrest. This is incredibly disturbing. What kind of people are you?
Do you realize how paranoid and crazy you sound? Mr. Snyder was part of some sort of intricate conspiracy designed to ruin you and your mother's good names? He 'hired' people to lie to the cops? That's some next level batshit crazy right there.
What happened with the Game & Hobby Place was 100% due to your poor judgement and stupidity. You could have avoided this whole incident by calling the store, and asking about the new management. I'm assuming that you have your cell phone on you pretty much all of the time, like most people. Mr. Snyder was the victim here, not you. A simple phone call could have saved you all of this trouble, and spared Mr. Snyder his injuries.
Despite everything you put him through, Mr. Snyder asked the court to go easy on you. He's obviously a decent person and you should be grateful to the man for being so charitable towards you, not gloating about his business closing. Did you at least apologize to him? Your attitude is absolutely despicable.
I also found it disturbing that, in your defense, your attorney referred to you as an 'adult autistic child': this, and your use of stupid made-up childish words like 'jerkop' make me even more doubtful that you have the maturity to be in any kind of meaningful relationship with another adult, let alone an open relationship.
I'm going to cc Catherine on this, because I think she deserves to know what she's potentially getting herself into. I'm trying to be civil to you, for her sake, but this is too much.
Are you jerking me around about the whole sign business? If it's true, then it's just fucking sad. I can't imagine being that desperate and I sort of pity you there. Then again, the mental image is absolutely fucking hilarious. As funny as it is though, I can see where some women could get creeped out be it.
I told Catherine I'm willing to talk with you, as long as you're willing to behave as a reasonable adult. I'm not seeing that here.
I Told Mommy
8 October 2014
Chris to Colin
My mother doesn't like you
I have told my mother of your involvement, and more recently, your being nosy about the court case. Frankly, I wish I had not said anything about it, but I felt need to mention it among my reasons for not feeling comfortable of taking advantage of the open relationship, to put it in your own words. Anyway, here is what She has to say (attached photo of the handwritten note to you from her quoted, plus her own additions and edits).
Colin:
What is between my son and Catherine is none of your damn business. Shut your f'ing mouth. You're the dumb one trying to tear down someone you can't meet face to face, as well as his relationship with a woman. Our business is none of yours. You live in hell; you will suffer for your attack a on my son and his girlfriend.

My Fault For Being Honest + Poetry Slam
9 October 2014
For Your Information, Mr. Boyle,
Christian Chandler to me
I was Not hiding behind my mother. I told her of your involvement and your misuse of the information I mistakenly provided. She wanted to tell you off, and I was only honoring her wish in relaying the message from her to you.
It is my fault for being an honest person to such an extent. And I was being Sarcastic when I told you to look up the info. I had No Direct Webmaster involvement whatsoever at all in the Cwcki, or any of those Troll Websites. It was YOUR fault in blowing something that is near ancient History about me out of proportion and further screwing me and Catherine over in more stress than was required. Plus, I asked you to not say anything to her about it; you said you would say Nothing to her. And what did you do, you go on ahead and forward everything.
You, sir, are a most untrustworthy individual, and I feel you should back off the both of us. She has her father troubles; I have my mother troubles, and we both have our own local stresses that do not need any further provoking by and from your unsolicited recourses of action. You do realize that what you have done is not only hurting Catherine even more, but you are Sabotaging me AND Yourself in the relationships with her.
It was also my mistakes for jumping the two times when I did upon her outing with you while she and I were separated in communication, as well as learning of your surprises of expensive things, and your misconceived notion of Planned sexual intercourse. She had not made any plans with you on that at all yet.
And Now, you have jumped like I had, and then WORSE! Because she has more become hurt from such old news. And all I was doing was honestly justifying in confidence of WHY, in response to your question of "You have sexual freedom in the Open Relationship; Why aren't you taking advantage of it?"
To you, sir, I say you can rot in your own piece of hell you have crafted for yourself from your Leap of Ten Feet Off The Ground in response to my honesty from my knowledge of the events.
Stay Safe with Peace,
Christian W. Chandler
And now, a bit of random humor you may take a laugh to from me.
Alright, I'm going to fart on your head
My name's not Fred
Don't wet the bed
Is your face feeling red
You have bad street cred
Has your family been fed
We've got a lawn to mow and shred
This pencil has lead
The patient has bled
Stay out of my shed
Don't break the bread
For your crimes, have you plead
The book has been read
I fear where to tread
Lord Zed
The lesbians have been wed
The world is corrupted
My bear likes to be called Ted
Hasn't enough been said
Oh, look, it's Ed
Your conscious and mentality is Limited
You do not know every thing of the world, and perfection of anything is only a grand illusion in your head
Ridiculous And Stupid
9 October 2014
Colin Bryce Boyle to Christian
That 'poem' or whatever it is, is the most ridiculous and stupid things I've ever seen, and it just goes to further prove my point that you're too emotionally immature to be in an adult relationship. Based on what you've told me, you play with toys, you have kiddie bed sheets, and you run to your mother when life gets too scary or difficult. You can deny it all you want, the evidence speaks for itself.
Do you ever take responsibility for anything? If you didn't want me to find out about your criminal past, and other embarrassing (and disturbing) details about your background, you shouldn't have volunteered that information about yourself. In addition to your myriad other problems, you have demonstrated poor judgement and impulse control as well. You handled this whole situation poorly from the beginning and now, after things have blown up on you, you're desperately trying to shift the blame to me. It's really pathetic.
My relationship with Catherine is just fine, as a matter of fact, I'm spending this weekend with her. Your relationship with her.... (well just between you and me, I think someone may have just been 'friend zoned'). Seriously though, if you want Catherine to ever see you as more than just a friend, then you've got a lot of growing up to do. You're going to have to prove to her that you can act like an adult. Right now, she's not impressed.
In the meantime, if you're lonely, you can always get yourself another one of those nice clean prostitutes you told me about. That seemed to work well for you last time. Why not treat yourself?
We BOTH Are To Blame
9 October 2014
chrischansonichu to me
I do take responsibility for my own mistakes, errors and everything. We BOTH are to blame for this chaos. I have grown up a lot more than you think. You might be the one who has growing up to do; all of your money just fell into your lap with half to little to no effort at all on your part at all. I have had to WORK mentally, emotionally and physically to overtake my own damn Autism as much as humanly possible. What have You done? You have your own mental traumas, dramas and damage; you have taken little to no effort for yourself to mend yourself at all. You have not spent a night in jail worrying about the safety and being of your own mother. You have not had the crap beaten out of you by any "Police" or "Managers" or Internet Trolls and CyberBullies!!! I have more mental knowledge from great education, maturity over my mental troubles and faults, and certainly More Maturity from Years of Mental, Emotional and Soul Abuse by the considered criminally insane, corrupted and warped individuals worse off than either you or me!
Oh, Sure, you can shirk me off, but in the near future, you will be a worse troublemaker than you have already, and all hell will break lose on your conscious and subconscious, making you into an eligible resident in an asylum or something.
I do not fear you; I do not trust you; you give males a worse name than they already have.

Not Impressed

Colin Bryce Boyle to Christian
<<I have had to WORK mentally, emotionally and physically to overtake my own damn Autism as much as humanly possible.>>
Not impressed. Other Autistic people have earned advanced college degrees and have successful careers, some even own their own businesses.
You're on welfare and you sit at home playing with toys all day. You can't even run a simple ebay business.
There were no more emails recorded after this point. The cause for their cessation is up for debate; Colin clearly won the argument, but a spurned CWC does not simply accept defeat. It may have been that Catherine put a stop to it.
Renee E-mails
Renee
The following are e-mails exchanged between Chris and the persona of Renee, who was played by Thetan, the same troll as Rebeckah. When she was "introduced" to Chris, it was put to Chris in no uncertain terms that Renee was not a potential sweetheart because she was in a long-term relationship. This did not dissuade Chris from "subtly" implying that she should be the surrogate mother to his child, though, and his various hints throughout the emails suggest (particularly towards the end) that he was attempting to secure some kind of backup girlfriend, in case things fell through with Catherine. Draw your own conclusions about Chris's ethics.
Renee's involvement with the Open Relationship fiasco came about because Renee was Catherine's friend and knew Colin as well, thus allowing her to pass messages between the principals involved.
The Renee emails both began and ended later than the others.
The Hooker Story
About one month into their relationship, Chris sent Renee an attached text document, originally written for someone else, dated 4 April 2012. In it Chris relates the story of how he lost his virginity, almost immediately after the fact. Some individuals' identities have been redacted.[1]
The Lunar has Finally Launched
Christian Weston Chandler to
Well,
I am No Longer a Virgin! :)
I will tell Only You the story; I want you to keep it Most Strictly Confidential between just you and me; although if and when I finally do get a girlfriend who stays with me for a long while, I will inform her about it as well. I will be deleting this e-mail from my side of the mailbox, after copying/pasting the text onto a notepad file backed up on a memory card.
I arrive at the predetermined destination of the intersection of 29 and 250; therein lies over four hotels, including the nearby English Inn. I stay assumed with the Days Inn. I try again with Riley, And I shot for Kristy; Riley did not answer at all. Kristen stated, "I am very busy now". So, in my cell contacts, out of the ones you have provided for me from the backpage, I call up the one I had assumed as a long shot, because of the enclosed image of a company logo on her page, the one called Mia "Hamm" (Hamm is not her real last name, and IMHO, it does not do her justice; she deserves a better name than that). She Answers. I introduced myself; told her I found her on the backpage; she sounded mature in her voice; down to earth. I was in the Days Inn parking lot; she confirmed she was in 338. I arrive at her door and knocked three times. It's about 4:30 PM. She opens and invites me in; unexpectantly, but not surprising, I was also greeted with the smell of aged smoke; she had done the weed. I complained a little, and I sniff up a small handful of hand sanitizer; it quelled it down for me. Mia was very nice, likeable and down to earth; and she was 24. I forgot to mention, she greeted me in a black lace negligee. She had an average figure; her breasts were a C; she had a lip ring bauble, tongue ring bauble, and ring baubles in each of her fine nipples.
We casually strip for each other; we communicated good throughout. She was fixed, but she insisted I be protected as well. She offers me a green, apple-flavored condom; I lie on the bed naked; she was naked; she had the condom in the edge of her lips. She mouths it onto my most erect penis, and she gives me a very good B.J. Her tongue bauble was a very delightful and stimulating bonus onto my hard one. As she blows me, I place my hands on her shoulders. After she was done, she laid beside me; her pussy was wet; we handled each other. Her vaginal opening felt really good, and I found her clit, yet she was very clear about me keeping my fingers Outside; I respected her request. Then we roll into each other; we make out (no tongues) with peckings and open-mouth. We touched each other; her skin was very smooth; my 5:00 made my chin a bit rough. Her long, black hair was silky, smooth and shiny; her blue eyes smiled at me, and so did she. I gave her a sample of my strong-handed massage that my mother enjoyed in the past. Mia really like that.
Then, I felt and informed her that I was ready to go in. I requested Cowgirl, with possible missionary later, but that did not happen. Her pelvic thrusts were amazing; her pussy was tight, even after pushing two daughters out of there years ago. And I supported her thrusts with my hands on her knees, weaving back and forth. I also gave her breasts a good thrusting. I felt her front pelvic bone, which really made the top of the game. She came and I came, but on my coming, it was only half-felt. And the semen that was mostly inside, but a smidge on the outside of the condom, confirmed it.
Then I washed my dick with a washcloth I brought with me, and dried it off with a towel I also brought. I was really satisfied. Then we conversed the rest of the $150 hour; it was very pleasant. She is a mother of two; they're staying with her mama; papa bear ditched Mia; it is very sad. She goes from town to town, and she is getting education for a better future along the way. Her individual escort service is a quick spot of cash for her. God bless her and her family. I also told her a bit of myself here and there, including the trolls/cyber-bullies.
Mia is also Half-Cherokee, so that was an unexpected good bonus. I told her a few funny bits; informed her of what I knew of the weed from Family Guy and that one episode of South Park, "Medicinal Fried Chicken". We had a few good laughs.
Then her clock chimes, alerting her that her next appointment was arriving, so we hugged another time, and I got out of her hair. I promised I would call her later. I did, about 6:30; she had already finished with the next fellow; he was a disappointment to her; his was smaller than mine; a "weiner in a hallway" situation. She really enjoyed my dick, and my personality. I pray the best blessings for her and her daughters. Plus, I may well likely see her again another month, when she's in town, and if I'm not in jail.
The whole thing felt natural to me the further it went; I was also surprised that I did not have a premature ejaculation. It was awesome, pleasant and soo good. Worth it.
Only you, until my girlfriend comes around, knows the story. But as for everyone else, all they will get to read from me is, "I am not a virgin anymore."
TTYL, and Stay Safe,
Christian Weston Chandler.

Sidenote:
Right before, on the radio station, Z-95.1, Katy Perry's "Teenage Dream" played. And right after leaving, Kelly Clarkson's "Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You) played. Soo Appropriate, AND the BEST Combination for the occassion. [sic] :)

Need my daughter
On 12 November 2014, Chris received a letter from Fairfax Cryobank rejecting him as a sperm donor. Evidently seeking alternatives, he sent the following texts to Renee, trying to impose upon her to bear his child:
12 November 2014
Hey, Renee. I'm feeling a bit lonely right now. My donor application got rejected. So, I'm stuck in searching for a woman to have my daughter (if not Catie).
I would ask you, but you're going through a LOT right now, and I wouldn't want to bother you about it.
I really miss you. Please respond.
I wish you could be here.
I am still praying for you.
Banned everywhere
This was sent on 22 November 2014, and although loquacious it concerns little more than Chris's bans:
I still have the Zapbud medallion I made for you, that I was going to give you on Halloween (oh, well). I still want you to have it, as a token of our friendship, and potential benefits (but Mostly on our friendship). I can mail it out to you in NH, even to a PO Box of your if applicable. I would keep your info Most Strictly Confidential, I Promise.
Aside from that, what happened to me that knocked me for the loop the past week: aside from my silent, peaceful protest of Sonic's arm colour change in the new games and TV show, I got banned from my local Target for Cursing the "Security" Janekop. The damn Manajerk gave me a difficult time as well. UGH!!!
But, when one door closes, another opens: I still needed to buy a couple of groceries for my family, so I drove up to Wal-Mart in Charlottesville (I got banned from the one in Ruckersville over a year or two ago for defacing an XBox One standee by adding an "H" next to the logo, next to the "X", to spell "HeXBox One". I do not like or care for XBox at all, especially since that is the favourite gaming platform for the damn Trolls and Cyber-Bullies. I was feeling upset from my own loneliness as well at the time. Shortly after that, word got to the one in CVille, and the Manajerk gave me trouble there as well. But I went in last Sunday, after Target, with my sunglasses on: No Trouble from anyone.
I REALLY despise and loathe the embarrassment and crap from being Banned anywhere. I was banned from PVCC for two years, middle of earning my CADD-CAM Degree, for trouble with the Dean of Student Services in the early start of my Sweetheart Search in '03, banned in early '04, for my own emotional and anger responses to her intruding in my Search by Destroying My Signs (I was so damn shy, that I required a "I am a single male, looking for a single (matching-age) female to be my Sweetheart from the ground up"). I learned and realized a few years later that sort of thing was considered solicitation, and I had not done that again since.
was rebanned from PVCC after earning my degree three years later.
I also got Banned from the Game & Hobby PLace, because the Manajerk there plain did not like me at all. I got banned from Fashion Square mall for emotionally being loud in outbursts on the phone to a few incoming troll calls. That was Over two years ago; I might be able to sneak my way back in there now. And among which, between the bannings, and a few trouble with Troll instances, I was handcuffed by the Jerkops like four or five times, and under a misunderstanding at the PLace in late '11, both my mother and I spent a really miserable night in jail. For Hours, I had thought it was still 7:27 PM, because there was no clock nearby to check. I went bonkers worrying over my mother in that cell. We got out the next morning with help from a friend of ours at my church.
before that year, and the Manajerk, Snyder, did not get any money he was expecting, and had to close down the PLace last year.
And my mother and I will have our "Felon" labels hanging above our heads removed middle of next year.
Being Banned from Anywhere really Hurts!
**sigh**
I just try not to think about the bad things and move forward with my life.
And sometimes, I vent or think about other things.
Barb is borrowing from Chris's life insurance
25 November 2014
That's cool. My mom has just sorted everything out: she borrowed from my life insurance, and we are renting a second storage unit to put the furniture in.
It's all better now.
Repiercing The Taint
On 4 December 2014, Chris revealed that he repierced his taint with gold jewelry. The area had just become severely infected (to nobody's surprise) with the last piercing, and Chris had given it woefully insufficient time to heal.
Hey, Renee! 1:42 PM
I got the new gold barbell jewelry piece, and I will be getting repierced later today. 1:44 PM
Let's pray that in a month, this one does not go migrating either. 1:44 PM
I'm sending caring vibes and love your way! Have a lovely and 1:45 PM
safe day. 1:45 PM
Barb is flirting
7 December 2014
right now, my mother and I are expecting to be moving back into our renovated house within the next couple of weeks. I would expect Christmas to be simple at home this year. But if you can make it, I would totally love and be delighted to spend time with you.
The people at Rainbow are going to lend us a truck to help us get the lot of our stuff moved from here and the Storage Unit to there.
My mother has been flirting with the males there and among the construction crew.
No Longer Together With Catherine
On 10 December 2014, Chris confirmed that he and Catherine were no longer together.
I am feeling sad. While she still wants to be friends, Catie just told me she does not want to be in a relationship with 9:54 PM
me; essentially dumping me. She took this from when I reacted when she went out with Colin in New York; I was still learning the understanding of being in an 9:55 PM
open relationship. I Have learned from the mistakes and improved, yet she said half to the relationship with me. 9:55 PM
I am hurting in my heart right now. I'll check in with you later. 9:55 PM
End of the Un-clit
On 12 December 2014, Chris revealed that he gave up on the piercing, after a second rejection incurred after learning nothing after the first.
I have an update to just let you know: the patch of skin the jewelry was in was shrinking again. I have just removed the barbell and spheres; I am
6:05 AM
giving up on that piercing now. 6:05 AM
Trolls are hacking my text messages
On 14 December 2014, in his usual paranoia Chris thought that trolls were hacking into his text messages and "pinning" his female friends "as trolls". How he got this idea (and what it even means) isn't clear.
<Subject: **Breaking the fourth wall**> - Hey Trolls, I Know you all are hacking into my text messages and pinning my women friends as trolls themselves. Your tricks and cons will not work on me ever again. 12:29 AM
<Subject: Because, of you Trolls> - I do not care or give a crap. 12:30 AM
Renee, don't worry about the Trolls; they are always looking into hackery and crap. I don't care what they want to think or hate about me, regardless of what I 12:32 AM
say or feel. You shouldn't worry about them either. 12:32 AM
Modelling Career
On the same day, he asked Renee to help him in his modelling career.
Also, would you help me put together a modeling portfolio, and teach me to become more sex positive 4:53 PM
and all that like we talked about before? 4:54 PM
Neutral Christmas
20 December 2014:
Well, right now for me, Christmas is going to be neutral around here; the house won't be ready before the holiday. So, it'll just be a peaceful day at home with the family.
Pained thud
24 December 2014:
My heart has been hurting, and making it more difficult to feel Christmas Spirit or, with the Autism, appreciate any positive emotions and...
...vibes from most anyone else. I can appreciate it from my mother and pets. But everyone else, nada and/or a pained thud in my heart.
Depressed on Christmas
Chris's indirect pleas for Renee to become his new sweetheart were rampant on 25 December 2014:
I got the family time, and I got a little bonus cash and bought the Light and Dark expansions for Skylander Trap Team. I've been working taking the dogs to the sitter; our cat refused to get into the carrier.
The only things, either of which, would have made me feel better: waking up next to and sharing the holiday with my Sweetheart/Girlfriend, or a Magical Transformation of my body from Male to completely Female.
And my heart has been aching off and on.
I'm busy getting on in sorting and packing for our move next week.
I hope your house burns down
Renee makes it clear she doesn't want a relationship. 7 January 2015:
You are being Unfriendly to me and a Meanie. 11:48 AM
I hope your house burns down with You and your Jerk boyfriend inside. Good Day. 11:51 AM
One inch shorter
11 January 2015:
I am feeling very sad and upset right now. I think I've shrunk in height by one inch. And because I lost your love, I have been feeling a LOT worse...: 3:55 AM
...for wear. And I do not care if you share this with the damn Trolls or not; I Know you have been on their forums sharing about everything. 3:56 AM
Good Luck with that weighing down on your individual fucked-up head. 3:56 AM
