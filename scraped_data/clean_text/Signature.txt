“
Before the night was at midnight, we had finally received a new letter from Heilberg and Overstreet. They sent us more forms to sign as "Christine Weston Chandler", because some people were so dumb not to accept her signature, "Chris Chan Sonichu".
”
Chris[1]
“
Mrs. Jesus Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu, the Goddess Blue Heart of the Nation of Cwcville, Guardian over the Sonichu and Rosechu Species, Immortal Avatar, Lord, Messiah, Savior, and God of all.
”
Chris's signature in a jail letter from 2021.[2]
Chris's signature has evolved over the years, most notably turning into yet another means to express his ego and maladaptive coping mechanisms. For instance, in online postings, Chris incorporated lightning bolt and heart symbols to signify his Goddess status - in response to a fan's question on what the symbols meant, he replied that it was an emoji signature symbolizing CPU Blue Heart.[3]
In another example, Chris has signed legal documents as "Chris Chan Sonichu" and has even drawn the signature with lightning bolt-style font. This was most seen with his March 2018 trespass charge forms. Chris also signed documents as "Chris Chan Sonichu" during the 2021-2023 Jail Saga, although it is unknown whether he drew out the font that time - unlike the 2018 case, the signatures were rejected and Chris's lawyer had to resend Chris forms to sign with his actual legal name.[1]
During his phase of role-playing as Sonichu, Chris expressed his signature in his script for the Goochland Library Sermon as the name "Sonichu" drawn to resemble lightning bolts.[4]
Chris constantly added text onto his signature in many of his Jail letters to online followers, using it as a means to express his delusions of grandeur.
