Chris explains why he won't get a job
Chris then raged in the comments after his IRL friend from The End Games and Kim Wilson both told him to get a job anyway.
4 April, 3:01 am
People online tell me to "Get a job". I Can't get an application-required job, because the bullies and internet trolls have totally ruined my background check YEARS ago. I also Fear being discriminated against because not only of my autism/mental handicap, but now to add that I am a transwoman and a lesbian; I am sick of hate-filled people and the insincere ones too. The top reason why I don't "get a job" is because I already had an Have a full-time job of caretaking my father before he passed on in 2011, AND my mother. AND I have a subtle and lingering shocks that I am still having impressive difficulty shaking off that keep me from feeling like drawing and writing for my books. You Trolls and Bullies do not understand my long-troubled mind.
**sigh**
He then linked to a Huffington Post article about how "landlords keep out transgender renters."

Christine, my mom works for an organization called DARS, or Virginia Department for Aging and Rehabilitative Services. They help for those in your exact situation-they help you with finding a job that suits your needs (even with your schedule since you are taking care of your mother, your shocks, etc.) and find an employer that will not discriminate against you for any reason (although any employer should not be doing that.) DARS helped me go to JMU, and best of all it is free, you do not have to pay back for their services. I can PM you my mom's contact information and she can meet with you to discuss job opportunities. Just go to 1 appointment, I really think it can help you. I agree on those that just say "get a job" when there is no support for you, but I really do think DARS can be that support.
Kim Wilson
Christine Weston Chandler Don't you remember? We've talked about this. I pointed out that your criminal background check for most jobs would be clean, so there's nothing keeping you from getting a job.
We talk and then when I explain that to you, you don't have anything else to say. We conclude that you just don't want to get a job because it's too much work.
And that's fine! Keep reminding yourself: you choose not to get a job because it doesn't fit in with your lifestyle. There's nothing forcing you to live such a bohemian lifestyle, it's your choice.
Say it every day: I love being an impoverished artist because I choose my art over financial stability, and that's OK!
Chris
Ugh! The point is that I am prone to anxiety and shock. I have a lot of fears, including that which I have stated in this post. The result is my brain becomes mid-difficult paralyzed, or even Numb with greater, consistent amounts of shock moments in my life. What if something gets to me deep while at work, then I am left unable to function for a while, even Hours? Fired! What if the stress is super great that I end up making the whole building floor go silent after an impulsive and Loud shout? Fired! And maybe even Banned for Life. You have not been where and when I was employed, and around people; I was the epicenter. And nobody wants to hire an anxiety-prone lesbian transwoman whose Google Search shows a sex doll-humping gif and my bare behind sitting on an $11 cake, among which, because I was easily duped and blackmailed by a number of Cyberbullies and Internet Trolls pretending to be sincere-and-honest-for-my-heart women on EVERY DATING WEBSITE ON THE FREAKING INTERNET! Oh, My Gosh!!! UGH!!!
Kim Wilson
Christine Weston Chandler No, the types of jobs your resume would qualify you for don't care about your personal life.
To be fair, you really just don't want to apply for jobs. And like I said, that's OK. Not everyone wants to work.
(To clarify, it's OK not to work when you don't need money.)
The things you're describing (stress at work) are actually very normal. You really just don't want to get a job. That's all it is.
Alexa P.
DARS prevents that type of thing happening, they will talk with your employer on your behalf to make sure you are not fired because of your disability or any "issues". But like your friend Kim said, if you don't want to work that's cool, I was under the impression that you did.
Whining about the mortgage
He continued his rant from the previous post in the comments.
4 April, 7:33 pm
I Really Do Not Like Seterus Mortgage. My mother scheduled a payment of the one past due amount, and then they go behind us to get the remainder for one month, Leaving my mother's bank account in the red by more than $800!
F***ing Seterus! I really wish SunTrust had never referred our Mortgage to them. UGH! seterus.com
Comments
Kim Wilson
Christine Weston Chandler Oh wow, are you in financial trouble?
You should ignore my last comment then! You should start applying for jobs ASAP!
Interviewing for jobs is hard, but you can do it. For my past few jobs, I applied to between 30 to 40 places before I got an offer. You should start applying now!
Quinn
Didn't someone pay for new comic pages a while back? Maybe you could get back into that if it's a guaranteed money maker. Just a thought.
Chris
Copy-Past the last comment I typed here, and then add:
Do you think it is snap-my-fingers easy to FEEL like drawing my pages? NO. I have been under so much lingering stress in my head, it is no wonder I fall into random mental paralysis that derail any train of thought I would have at that moment. How do y'all think my mother and I are feeling right now?
Someone, PLEASE buy the stamp album already and the high-priced covers on my shop already!
I am stuck as a caretaker of my mother and our pets; even that overwhelms me. I do not feel I would be mentally suited for an application-required, long waits to be contacted or not contacted, "am I hired yet", under "The Man", Freaking job!!! Stop Telling me to "Get a Job". Gawd!!!
Quinn
Wow, ok. I wasn't expecting this first thing in the morning.
I'm just saying you need to find a stable source of income instead of relying on people buying things for you or asking for donations. I just assumed that doing what you supposedly like to do could be a solid way to help you out. I sort of figured it was a no brainer if you were really that desperate.
In all honesty, I don't know anyone who collects stamps. As such, it's a very limited market and I'm not sure those who are interested would agree with the amount you asked for depending on the actual value of the stamps. But like I said, I don't know much about it.
Kim Wilson
Christine Weston Chandler I'm confused.
To people reading your facebook, it sounds like you really need money sometimes.
But then they see that you're not trying to find a job. That means that you don't actually need money.
Which is it?
If you don't apply for jobs, you really don't need money. People reading your posts think that. They really do. I have friends who have seen you at your pokemon events, and every one of them thinks you're lying about needing money, because you don't have a job and you have lots of toys.
If you want money, you need to apply for jobs. A lot of them, like 30 to 40.
Quinn
She's right you know. It's best to take a step back and make some priorities in your life.
It's very frustrating to continually hear you bemoan your situation if you, yourself, the only one who can really do anything about it, chooses not to put any effort into anything when it's even slightly inconvenient for you. 🙁
For instance, the "long wait" is a problem? What exactly else do you have going on? You have nothing to lose by throwing out applications.
I really wish you would try to adjust your perspective.
Chris
Need Money! Why am I selling my father's stamp collection on eBay? DUH!
Kim Wilson
Christine Weston Chandler Because you merely want money, you don't need it. People who need money get jobs.
Quinn
You're either not reading our advice or are too stubborn to listen. There are some extremely simple money making options available to you but you're choosing to go the least reliable route.
I wish you'd listen once in a while hon, your life could be so much easier.
Begging for sale of $1,000 album
5 April, 2:55 pm
Chris reposted the stamp album announcement from 3 April, but deleted the part about a chance to win T-shirts and replaced it with begging. He kept the "bonus update" heading, though.
**REMINDER AND BONUS UPDATE**
Buy the sentimental and collectible Beginners Stamp Book of mine, with various collectible stamps and 10 random stamp covers from my father's collection to automatically receive one of two limited-made Son-Chu figure with accessories, a Skylanders Imaginators CWC Figure, and a Skylander-functional card.

Ellen Page, and her bio does resonate of me.
He then screen-capped the bio, and continued:
Although I feel uncertain of the "self-sufficient" aspect.
Captain's log and reaction videos
12 April, 1:05 am
**ANNOUNCEMENT**
Who likes People React videos? I am considering doing a React video, aside from the return to a weekly "Captain's Log" thing. And what I am considering allowing all to see is my reactions to the Saturday Night Live episode from 2015 with guest host, Donald Trump. If you'd like to see this, leave a Lot of "Ha Ha"-type Likes (hold Like and select the laughing face). If that reaches over a hundred by Saturday, I will do it as a Live Stream on YouTube on Saturday Night.
He met his target goal within one hour.
One of his IRL friends tried to dissuade him.
I advise against it.
Chris didn't listen and went ahead with the reaction video.

Transformed face
12 April, 1:56 pm
Ever wanted to make a Transformer face of your self? I did, and there is a story behind this reasoning, canon to the Son-Chu parts of the Sonichu books, of which I will go over in the first returning Captain's Log video this Friday. Also, dig it, my eyes can be seen through Optimus' helmet.

Offering The Classic shirt for $12,000 minimum
19 April, 1:30 am
You all ask, and you all wanted to know about, the striped shirt of mine as constantly drawn in my Sonichu comic books.
I previously stated that I lost the iconic shirt in the house Fire of January 10, 2017. Actually, that shirt was Not totally lost in that fire; to my recollection, it was in a mountain pile of laundry in the laundry room. So, more accurately, it was in one of the black bags down here. I have just dug through the dirty half of those bags, more than ten or twenty of them. Then, in a bag of damp ones, I found the shirt. I took a photo; part of the selling amount will go to better restoring the shirt; I am personally putting it through a page or two in my washer and dryer. Only after sale of the relic, I will be able to afford having it restored to its glory, and I will frame it and add a personal Certificate of Authenticity, before shipping it. Thank you.
He linked to the eBay listing.
Shirt update
19 April, 3:53 am
Just got the shirt out of the dryer; it is clean, no odor; it will still be restored with mending and hopefully put the white back in where that became pink, after the sale and receipt of money. So, Buy It Now.
He linked to his eBay listing and rated his post Love.
Comments
Marie:
It looks like it's falling apart
Chris:
Yeah, which is why part of the final sale will be used to restore it.
Chris:
Be glad I found it.
Chris:
I'll probably have another cold or something; my throat felt the familiar scratchy after going through those bags; a few of them had wet dirt and wall lining in them. Dang house fire.
Marie:
The wet dirt smell was more than likely mold, be careful digging around in that, it can get you pretty sick if you're not careful
Chris:
Tell me about it; like cat litter.
Shirt slideshow
19 April, 11:33 pm
Chris uploaded a slideshow of The Classic shirt of images he had posted earlier.
Shared memory post
20 April, 10:45 pm
Chris saw his own post from 4 years ago and shared it.
Marie:
What is on your cheeks?
Chris:
I think a bit of paint; I forgot why from that day.
Unicorn frappuccino
21 April, 11:42 pm
That is a shame, because I enjoyed a venti Unicorn Frap, and it was good. Even fun, when ordering it, I told the clerk, "Give me a Venti Alicorn".
I have something to say to the barista who got pinked. Suck It Up, Dude! You can just wash it off; it is not a big deal. Pinkie Pie would lick the pink sugar off her fingers. And when I dig into a cutie orange, I get some orange-yellow color on my fingernails. Do I complain and end the existence of Oranges? No; I wash my hands at the next opportune moment. Do NOT ruin the Pride of the Unicorn, Pegasus, Earth Ponies, and Alicorns from us all. (Puns intended) And to #Starbucks, Please Do offer the Unicorn Frappechino again in the future.
Barb borrowed from life insurance
22 April, 10:08 pm
**Minor Update**
My mother borrowed from our Life Insurance Thursday; I shipped the totem out of that the same day; the remainder of that money got her bank account back into the black, as well as some groceries; Californian fan received the totem Friday; eBay released the funds back to my PayPal and it's back in black. Yes, the shirt's auction has ended high, but I am still awaiting payment from the mother of one of my fans, who, unless remains anonymous, will have her name go down in History for not only restoring a very Iconic Artifact, but also improves this artist's family's life, After the restoration and disinfection of the shirt. Her most grateful son will be proud of her for having gone down in history for Restoring the Fire-Survivor Iconic Shirt of Sonichu and Rosechu's Creator. Thank You, Missus.

I also enjoyed the Unicorn Frappucino from Starbucks; I hope they bring it back for a longer time in the future; it was yummy.

Prone to sweating
25 April, 6:12 pm
I've noticed that I'm prone to perspiration; just an open question for any suggestions to quell the sweat, "no sweat".
Shared link for trans news
26 April, 4:31 am
Chris shared an article titled "Safer Sex for Trans Bodies"
Making conversation
27 April, 2:02 am
A person on Facebook posted a photo of him hanging out with his dad at a restaurant named Royal Oaks. Most comments were either about the restaurant or complimenting the photo.
Chris tried to relate to the conversation by bringing up cartoon characters, even citing the episode they appeared in.
Bugs and Daffy did too; they went to the Royal Oaks, Glen Oaks, Oakley Oaks Community Club. Lola and her family are there regularly. "The Looney Tunes Show", season 1, episode 2.
Would you vote for Caitlyn Jenner?
27 April, 3:17 am
Yes, I believe I would vote for Caitlyn.
Victor B. disagreed with him.
Caitlyn has been nothing but a thorn in the side of the trans community.
Adam E. then informed Victor that he was responding to Chris Chan.
Victor, you're talking to Chris-Chan (google it real quick). I don't think you can soundly expect reason.

Repairing The Classic
29 April, 10:15 pm
Could any of you haters sew any better? The hole was large; I sewed as good as possible, then I reinforced the latter with the patch covers. If anything, this not only keeps it as iconic, but marks it as another masterpiece from myself, making it worth more.
