================================================================================

Donations Required, Serious. Please help. is a video Chris made on the 14th of June, 2016.
Barb is shown in this video in a very weak state, possibly due to a lack of funds to buy asthma medicine. After seeing this video, a concerned viewer called the Ruckersville police department and requested a welfare check on Barb.
Barb is fine. She spoke with the dispatched officer and everything is okay.[1]
That points to the video being staged, or at least exaggerated in order to receive "free money" from his loyal Sonichu trolls fan-base.
Later that day, someone texted Chris and scolded him for wasting hundreds of dollars on Transformers toys two weeks before. Of course, instead of running to the nearest pawn shop and unloading his toys to ensure his mother's medication is taken care of, Chris simply attempted to deflect blame for his poor spending habits by saying, "In my defense, the Trolls should not have been able to view anything I do on eBay."[2]
A year later, Barb would make a similarly disturbing begging video, asking for money to pay the power company, while wearing a $400 gold necklace.
