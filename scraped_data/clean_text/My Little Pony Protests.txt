“
FIVE MORE SEASONS FOR MLP G4! APPLEJACK FOR PRINCESS OF HONESTY!
DOWN WITH G5 FOR THE SAFETY OF EQUESTRIA AND EVERYWHERE ELSE!
”
Chris's rallying cry[1]
"When do we want it?!""Later!"
The My Little Pony Protests are a nonviolent series of tweets, videos and other media with the intention of persuading Hasbro—the owners of the My Little Pony franchise—to continue producing five more seasons of their animated series, Friendship is Magic in lieu of rebooting the franchise into its fifth generation, and from 2019 to 2020, to cancel the spin-off series, My Little Pony: Pony Life.
Chris, of course, remains the only active participant since August 2018. Being quite the big shot in C-197, he has conveyed that the aims of the protests are a means of preserving his imaginary friends in the Pony realm of Equestria; or simply put to everyone else, he refuses to accept that his favorite cartoon has concluded without his approval.
Having become seasoned in campaigns, such as the "Sonic Boom Protests" and #HarassCWCdirectly, the Hasbro Protests are one of Chris's most out of touch ventures to date, with him repeatedly demonstrating a very limited understanding of how animated shows like My Little Pony are actually produced. Fortunately, in his own best interests, he is proceeding with these protests in a far more restrained manner than previous endeavors.

Background
Main articles: My Little Pony and Chris and reality
An example of Chris's chronicles in Equestria, which he perceives as reality.
My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic was the fourth generation (or G4) of the Hasbro property, which aired from 10 October 2010 to 12 October 2019;[2] by definition, it was Chris's favorite show of the 2010s. His history with the franchise
is a particularly rich one: he initially got invested with the franchise to get closer with Megan, but he was still a fan even long after she stopped speaking with him. Years later, Chris attended three BronyCon conventions, his Mary Sue OC, Night Star, would partly take on the mantle of his adventures in Equestria, and he was publicly ostracized by several members of the brony analyst community.
Made especially clear after the Idea Guys' manipulations in early 2018, when faced with injustices in the real world, one of Chris's main coping mechanisms is escaping to his fantasy world of C-197, where he is an omnipotent, revered deity, and his denizens are various OCs and other fictional characters. According to Chris, in Equestria, he is an Alicorn—a Pegasus/Unicorn hybrid usually attributed to almighty characters in the series—and
has a strong rapport with the main characters, in addition to Night Star.[3][4] Elements of his delusions frequently seep back into reality, which is how articles such as these come to exist in the first place.
Rumors of a fifth generation were appearing as early as January 2018;[5] in due course, they caught the attention of Chris. To him, the end of Friendship is Magic is not just the conclusion of his favorite contemporary cartoon, but the end of his sporadic social life in safe spaces such as BronyCon, among other gatherings stemming from the series. Inwardly, he interprets the end of G4 as a threat to his airtight coping mechanism, as he claims the shift to a new canon in the form of G5 would see the perpetual stagnation or demise of C-197.[6][7]
Weeks prior to his opening protest, Chris attended BronyCon 2018, where the staff announced that 2019 would see their final convention.[8] This, compounded with the looming dread of G4 ending, may have been the catalyst for him to take arms and get Hasbro's attention. For Chris, Hasbro not succumbing to his demands would be to defy his self-proclaimed divinity. Though his decision to campaign was purely of his own accord, he asserts that the continuation of G4 was demanded by the highest order in Equestria – the Princesses of Equestria.[9]
Protest beginnings
On 13 August 2018, Chris commenced his campaign with a statement posted via Twitter.[10]
In his opening statement, Chris declared that he had foreseen a possible future timeline in C-197, in which a spell intended to ascend Applejack (who was in G4 an "Earth Pony", ie. a normal horse that's neither a Pegasus nor a Unicorn) to become an Alicorn backfires, causing the incumbent Alicorn, Twilight Sparkle, to transfer her wings and horn to Pinkie Pie (who was in G4 an Earth Pony) and Fluttershy (who was in G4 a Pegasus), respectively; this was apparently where G4 would transition to G5.
On a more tangible note, Chris seems to have based his concerns on a single concept image for G5, which may or may not be official anyway.[5] Chris's delusional theory falls flat, considering that the alleged G5 art of Fluttershy has removed her wings.
The image which got Chris all riled up.
Everyone of Earth 1218! I have an announcement!
I have seen a future that we must prevent: My Little Pony Generation Five.
Spoiler Alert: Princess Twilight Sparkle was prompted to promote Applejack to become an Alicorn Princess, but in doing so, the spell backfires and then we end up with... THIS!
Twilight becoming an Earth Pony (SIMPLY UNFORGIVABLE!), and the horns and wings being lost and swapped between Twilight, Pinkie Pie and Fluttershy.
I just did a reset to prevent that from happening. Celestia will take it upon herself to promote Applejack, because she Will be doing something that brings the magic out of her, like it did Cadence and Twilight. AJ’s Promotion needs to happen; she becomes the next Alicorn Princess by Celestia’s Power; Twilight and the others remain as they are, and G4 continues on. Generation Five Must Not Happen!
Listen up, @Hasbro and @HasbroNews , because I HAVE The Power and Link to our Sister Dimension, and I have seen it too.
#ContinueMLPG4!
CONTINUE My Little Pony Friendship Is Magic for at least Five More Seasons, @Hasbro and @HasbroNews !
Our Matching Futures are at Stake Here! I, your CPU Blue Heart Commands it so as well, in agreement with Princess Celestia.
Please, Heed Our Warning!
Thank You.[10]
A short time later, Chris uploaded Hasbro! MLP G4 Must Continue; NO MLP G5!
Chris's premonitions
Because if Chris has portrayed it, it must be canon.
The rest of August 2018 saw Chris continually ranting about five more seasons of Friendship is Magic. He eventually explained that if G4 was to be cancelled, the mishap stated in his video would occur, leaving Equestria vulnerable to Akan – the villain of Hardcore Henry and Sonichu #13, as instilled by the Idea Guys. G5 would follow said events, resulting in Akan's invasion extending into our universe:
The separation of the species, and the aggression is the future Celestia had seen should G5 continue and G4 end. Twilight will become an Earth Pony, and then with her unable to defend Equestria, Akan and his forces will overpower Equestria, and in the G5 show, in all the ”action” and “cool looks” and all that, Akan’s message of worshipping him as leader of all worlds will be broadcasted subliminally, and his reign will spread into Our World from our Sister Dimension there![7]
It was during this wall of tweets when he started tagging the show's voice actors. It remains unknown whether the actors took notice of Chris's posts, but Hasbro certainly didn't.
Never mind Goku or the Power Rangers. Only cartoon horses can defeat Akan.
On the other hand, Chris offered insight into what would be in store if the show was to continue. He believed that by the end of Season 14, all the main characters would become Alicorns, as part of a King Arthur-esque "Round Table of the Princesses of Harmony":
[The] rest of the Mane Six are destined to join Princess Twilight and the soon-to-be Princess of Honesty, Applejack, as Alicorns, themselves during that time frame. Their Stories MUST be told and continued. The Reboot will ONLY just Kill the timeline of ours that will simply stifle the originals’ growth, as well as throw Both of or dimensions into a chaos that must never ever take place, @Hasbro.[6]
Despite Hasbro neither confirming nor denying a new season beyond 9, on 22 August, Chris went ahead with the good ending regardless:
Everybody! Mark this day at about 4:10 pm, Eastern Standard Time; I saw it as it happened, as Celestia and Twilight had Applejack in her hall of memories. Without a hitch or backfire, Princess Applejack of Honesty, has arisen! And Princess Twilight remains an Alicorn!
Everybody of this world, you all may congratulate Princess Applejack in shouting, social media sharing, or you can even write a letter directly to her (no address or stamp required; just your hand writing and signature and a moment to let your link shine for her to get the message.
All Hail Princess Applejack! All Hail the Equestria Princesses of Harmony! All Hail the continuation of MLP G4 as well![11]
He even attended the coronation:
Well, everyone, I was just there, in my Ponysona, sitting with Nightstar, Kun and Zap Note in the front row in Canterlot; our Princess Applejack, of Honesty, has been coronated! Everyone praise her today! Yeee-Haw![4]
The battle was won, at least in Chris's mind, but the war was not yet over.
Later, in November 2019, Chris immortalized his pseudo-canon as part of his
Twilight Sparkle's Secret Shipfic Folder card collection:[12]

Prince Spike
Princess Applejack
Princess Rainbow Dash
Princess Fluttershy
Princess Pinkie Pie

Friendship is Magic ends
Imagine being one of the VIPs at a convention, and one of your fans tells you that you would continue voicing a role because the character you voice communicated her demands from another dimension to said fan. That was voice actress Nicole Oliver in 2019.
On 16 February 2019, My Little Pony confirmed that Season 9 would be their final one.[13] Chris's campaign reemerged in the June of that year; in his second wave of protests, he pulled the "Big, Greedy Corporation" card as his excuse for Hasbro not budging:
On the Good News: Everyone At Hasbro has received, either directly from Celestia, herself, or from those of us in the fandom, communities and then some and so forth. BUT, apparently, there are Some at Hasbro who do not believe in Fate and Destiny events, in addition to their monetary greed (no surprise).[14]
Failing to understand that companies delegate productions to other studios to meet time and budget constraints, he advised his fellow campaigners to boycott the new (canon) television special:
The upcoming MLP Special, Rainbow Roadtrip, as it was made by a different media company: Please, Boycott Watching It, as well as Any and all Uploaded Video Content of this show.
Typically, I am not one to bad mouth about that which has no hatred content in it, BUT this is a Royal Request.[14]
At the final BronyCon in August 2019, Chris relayed to Princess Celestia voice actress, Nicole Oliver, that her contract would be extended (note: Chris assumed the identity of Magi-Chan during the following post):
Celestia and Luna are a long way from retiring. As @CPU_CWCSonichu has personally told @mouthnoize at BronyCon, “The Reirement [sic] is not in.”[15]
Nicole Oliver later blocked Chris on Twitter for undisclosed reasons.[16]
In the final days of Season 9, My Little Pony offered fans other ways to engage with the franchise. One of which was the comic book series from IDW Publishing, which moving forward, was to promote its publication with the Hasbro approved tagline of "Season 10".[17] Chris was not having it:
Dear @Hasbro, #MLPFiM G4 Needs to have its Seasons 10 to 14 Animated in Chronicling; Not Just Comic Books. This is Celestia, Luna, and Princess Twilight’s Command, as well as the Command of all of the Deities between both dimensions.To leave it as simply @IDWPublishing comics is very much an insult.[18]
On 12 October 2019, Friendship is Magic aired its final episode – with no allusions to the forthcoming Akan or Round Table of Princesses. By the following month, Chris remained in the first of the five stages of grief:
I will also comment that I have not at all yet watched the Season 9 three-part finale at all (the mild spoiler imagery is not helpful) until after Season 10 of Gen4 #MLPFiM is aired on Discovery Family in 2020, and proper full announcements have been made in this dimension by @Hasbro and the people therein of the show. I eagerly await hearing this confirmation from the News Sources. Princess Celestia Has commanded you all before as well of this.[12]
On 20 April 2020 Hasbro released the Friendship is Forever series which was a clip show of MLP G4 and added a little bit more context to the last episode of the series. Chris (roleplaying as Sonichu) responded to this in celebration, most likely because he thought it was G4’s return. After a few minutes Chris followed up his original response by changing his original prediction from October 2019 to align with the current news, implying that his original prediction was wrong.[19]Chris attempted to take credit for the news as he had made a card in his TSSSF Nightstar and Friends Expansion pack about Season 10 of MLP G4 coming in April 2020, but Friendship is Forever and tenth season of MLP G4 are clearly two different things.[20]
Hmm. Actually, with consent from Mama, let me add a bit further: MORE of “Friendship Is Magic”, Delay of Gen 5, falling of #GOPony, and this now in April. And her Fifth Bonus card in her #TSSSF Nightstar & Friends Expansion that was put together months ago...
Can you say Kra-Kow?
According to Chris (roleplaying as Sonichu) in August 2020, he had finished viewing Season 9:
Yes, Mama has reluctantly watched the future episode of the season that was very much premature on being chronicled and shown at all.[21]
G5 Approaches
“
CANCEL MLP G5 AND RENEW MLP G4 FOR ITS FIVE SEASONS ALREADY, @Hasbro, PLEASE!!! ⚡️💙⚡️
”
Chris demanding for G5's cancellation[22]
The failed petition which Chris promoted to cancel My Little Pony G5.
Chris continued to descend into denial as more G5 content began to come out. On 5 February 2021, the synopsis for the MLP G5 movie and series was released. Chris (roleplaying as Sonichu) commented on this synopsis on 6 February 2021, stating that G5 was more of a continuation of G4 instead of it being its own standalone generation, therefore making his prediction correct.[23] This doesn’t line up with Chris’s original prediction as it included that the main 6 characters of the show would all become alicorns and G5 would be delayed to 2025.
25 February 2021 was a significant day for Chris, as a short teaser video for G5 was released by Hasbro. After nearly an entire year of roleplaying as Sonichu, this new video encouraged Chris to stop the roleplay so he could respond to it.
[24] This was most likely because Chris believes that his “Goddess authority” would make Hasbro listen to him. Chris would also later agree with Twitter users stating that G5 was supposedly leftist propaganda.
Even moreso why G5 is a really deity-level awful idea, @Hasbro. We are very much opposed to it, even Princess Twilight Sparkle, herself, in Equestria. I Know, because I have been there and talked with her, Celestia, Luna and everyone else, personally. ⚡️💙⚡️[25]
Chris increasingly began to show his further disapproval for G5 on multiple posts made by Twitter users showing excitement after watching the teaser. Chris then began to call G5, a “G3 remake” despite looking very little like G3 of My Little Pony. Chris most likely thought that G5 looked like G3 because characters in both series have wide noses. Chris would then make a post telling bronies and Hasbro that G5 would be bad, and if it were released, the world would end.[26] However, the hype for the new series continued to grow in the brony fandom, and members of the community that Chris admired, such as Dr. Wolf, made videos discussing their enthusiasm for the series. This, along with The Merge not happening, caused Chris to leave Twitter.
Hey, y’all. I am going to stay off of Twitter for a while until When #NotMLPG5ItsMLPG3Remake is confirmed Cancelled. @Hasbro, you listen up and Cancel MLPG5 Now, please.[27]
Unsurprisingly, Chris would return to Twitter the very next day.[28] Later in March 2021, Chris would then promote a pre-existing petition on Change.org to cancel/postpone G5. This petition would unsurprisingly not be successful.
Please, help keep our universe, here, and our Equestria, from falling apart and sign this petition to Cancel MLPG5 Right Now and Today.
Listen Up, @Hasbro.[29]
Throughout the following few months leading up to G5's premiere in September, Chris would continue to enact various forms of protest. The most notable of which being him once again claiming that the world would end when G5 was released,[30] and that he would supposedly be willing to pay Hasbro one million dollars to convince them to cancel it.[31] During sometime in the middle of July 2021, leading up to Chris's planned trip to the Everfree Northwest My Little Pony convention, Chris recorded a statement for Fiona, promising her that he would not get angry in front of her when they would inevitably come into contact with pieces of merchandise or toys from Generation 5 at the convention, claiming to have "a good sense of self and self-control."[32]
Later on July 27th, Chris recorded and uploaded a video to YouTube entitled Direct Message to Hasbro: MLPG5 Is Cancelled. In it, he angrily shouts into the camera demanding that Hasbro cancel the production of MLP G5 and continue Friendship is Magic for five more seasons. In the background of the video, multiple punched-in holes in a wall can be seen. Although Chris stated in a Discord message that he had initially been punching the wall for other reasons,[33] it's still entirely possible that at least some of the damage dealt to the wall was simply done out of his anger for Generation 5.
The holes Chris punched into his bathroom wall seemingly out of My Little Pony related tantrums.
In a different series of Discord messages from the same day, Chris further explains his motivations for recording the above mentioned video, claiming that he had encountered MLP G5 toys at several stores and literally snapped them out of existence with his fingers.
After getting the soda and water, I took a lap around the store as I like to do. Then, looking in the toy aisle where the My Little Pony toys were normally, I saw the sign that I was not looking forward to find. A handful of figures of the magic-less unicorn from G5. Needless to say, I was triggered, but I had known what I was to do in this event. I literally snapped my fingers, and these particular figures literally phased out of existence from the store. With that in mind, I opted to check Target as well. I found four figures of the orange G5 pony, and I repeated the process with that bunch of figures. [...] The impact of G5 being aired prematurely will literally do a heavy Metaphysical amount of damage to our very Timeline, here.[34]
While onlookers during this time were initially patiently anticipating a possible public meltdown from Chris due to G5's inevitable presence at Everfree Northwest, those prospects were all immediately thrown out the window when Chris was arrested in the beginning of August 2021 on charges of engaging in incestuous behavior with his mother, Barbara. As a result of Chris being preoccupied with numerous unrelated exploits during his stay in jail, his previously active protests would enter a state of silence for over the next two years as the fifth generation of My Little Pony was being released.
Post-Jail Protests
After Chris was released in March 2023 and fully returned to the internet in October 2023, he would resume his protest where he left off in 2021. Only this time, in renewing his outcry, he has taken his acts of protest and intertwined them with his Neo Spiritual Christianity and Messiah complex. Since February 2024 he has engaged in a bizarre campaign of ongoing escalation on social media, first by blocking the majority of G5's voice cast on Twitter, then by directly suggesting that MLPG5 - and Pony Life before it - were Russian creations designed to destabilise and destroy G4, preceding this with the utterly bewildering claim that G5 was responsible for 'instigating' the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War. As seen in the past, Chris can't handle changes to his beloved fictional characters. However, if this behavior goes unchecked, it could be only a matter of time before history repeats itself if he chooses to take matters into his own hands.
