v2.3 is now available! Explore CWCville's overworld, meet a friend(?) at church, anger the local squirrels, and more!
Chris
I never really approved this particular game, because it is not accurate of me or of Cwcville and the Sonichus and Rosechus.
The chaos portrayed in it is not at all valid nor in this time.

Minecraft Realms not working
15 August
3:00 PM
How much longer, @Mojang, will it take before @minecraft Realms is back up and running?
And I am tired of the glitch that happens when you have a bartering market of Villagers nearby and I get stuck in place and can't move while playing on @NintendoAmerica Switch.⚡️💙⚡️
Chris on Sub vs. Dub
16 August

Just putting in my two bolts and a heart, but in regards to anime, or animations from any country whose primary language is not English, I like the original language voices, as they are authentic with the respective show as opposed to dubs in the local language.
Another thing, live action shows and movies; keep it in original audio language.
Shows like "Woo Young Woo" on
@netflix
, it makes no sense dubbing it, because the lip sync would be off a lot.
Just turn on the subtitles.
Good show and story, by the way.
Even animations of countries that outsourced to Japan or US for the visual work but dubbed it in their country's original language since the original creator of that series lived there.
Authentic like Charlie Brown in Minnesota.
⚡️💙⚡️

Rick and Morty anime
16 August
11:38 PM
Also, just watched the first episode of #rickandmortytheanime; it felt slow, the art style, while near point with the original series, does not totally vibe, and most of the episode was spent in Morty's VR headset.
Will give rest of the season a chance, but episode one was rather a dud.

Trust Tarot card
17 August
11:57 AM
In my Tarot draw for present moments and future manifestations, Trust came out.
Keep Faith in that the Brightest Light Powered and Good individuals and our media shall triumph and make things better for the majority who are at least Neutral to Good and open improvements for the neutral bad to become neutral-good.
This is good.⚡️💙⚡️
"Expection" Vs Reality
18 August
12:05 PM
Expectation Vs Reality.
Expection: always tired and lazy.
Reality: does a lot of chores and keeps clean.
Friendship realization
20 August
11:28 AM
I had s realization recently.
I realized that I did have a good number of decent, actual in-person friends over the years, and I have a few good ones now.
I also realized that I could improve my friend count online, but I hesitate due to the physical division of the internet and the devices between us and what had happened with me with the various online fakers.
As well as those fakers and toxic ones who manipulated others to play on me within the bunch of theoretical exes.
I am content that I no longer require the details of online dating websites.
I also state in regards to the recent and more recent in-person encounters with my fans and admirers my deep appreciation for their genuine kindness and support.
I was hurt by the misconduct of those toxic ones online over the time, but I know better now.
How many times did it have to happen before it finally sank into my brain for better.
Too many people have social anxieties for this and other fears and concerns in avoiding the pains for themselves.
But establishing friendships is similar to dating in that you make the better friends from acquaintances.
It remains important to distinguish the differences between acquaintances and friends and the social boundaries and conduct, appropriately.
I admit, I was stuck in my desire for the long term love and romance with one particular individual; that was quite the search.
But I did understand since even before the year 2000 that such the deeper, intimate relationship requires friendship first and foremost.
After all, the various couples and poly partners respectively get to know each other amongst themselves, and those details are not always going to be storybook fairy tale romances.
Drama from time to time I'd to be expected, and supporting each other through those times kindly and lovingly helps a lot.
But I digress.
I would consider online friendships, but in doing so, it should be required that at least one video call and/or in-person meeting face-to-face be done.
And Honesty and Authentic is a Must for the better, Light-Powered and Good friendships.

Support for Kamala Harris
25 August
1:03 PM
My apologies for not putting a tweet up for a few days, but I wanted to offer a bit of support to @KamalaHarris.
I have read the Wikipedia article on her Political Platforms, and I agree with a lot of what she stands for.
And channeling her energy, I did a reading just now.
The first card, Conditioninh in reverse, reveals she has become more unique an individual compared to the mostly corrupt politicians around her affirming her position in high support from outside her peers.
Innocence shows she is pure in her intentions for good and just for everyone.
Her future card, Mind, reveals she will be feeling overwhelmed.
The top deck card, Laziness, shows and affirms her resting and recovering her energy for the moment when she is to strike against the evils it will be the most powerful and influencing Thunderbolt.
She shall get my vote, regardless, as I had done back in 2020 for her influential and prophetic C-197 counterpart, Lisa Simpson.

Justice Tarot card
27 August
Chris 2:53 PM
I just got my new Tarot Deck; waited months for it.
Anyway, in a general present tense energy, Justice came out upside-down indicating there is something sketchy going on.
Intuition tells me the sketchy one is Trump and his recent admissions.
Regardless, for everyone of you all, it is best to remain diligent in doing good by yourself and everyone around you.
Chris 3:02 PM
The top card on the deck was the Star and the bottom being Strength, so we can have faith in that the injustices will be overturned.⚡️💙⚡️

Despicable Me coming in the merge

Crystal Sage ✝️
i need to know...will gru and his minions come to our world during the dimensional merge?
Chris
Annoyingly, yes.
A reasonable observation
29 August
9:11 PM
I'm stating a reasonable observation:
@transformers and @Hasbro have had a good plethora of Crossover Toys in recent years.
Gigawatt remaining as a personal favourite out of them.
But I also had the G1 Jetfire, which as a lot of you all know is also in the form of a Valkyrie from #Macross (aka #Robotech in America).
Is it not obvious that G1 Jetfire was the very first #TransformersCrossover toy at Transformers X Macross.
I feel like it should be recognized and updated to match the original in a new Crossover and dub it Valkyrie, or even Hikaru.

It is not.
Do not listen to that guy or anyone who doubts the Dimension Merge, because it is happening and manifesting as we speak right now.
