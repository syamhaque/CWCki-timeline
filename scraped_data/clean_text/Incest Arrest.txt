"Ladies and gentlemen, we got him."
Chris accepting the inevitable.
Incest Arrest refers to footage of Chris being arrested for incest on his mother.
At approximately past midnight on 30 July 2021, the Incest Call was posted on YouTube, in which Chris confessed to having sex with Barbara Chandler, his mother. Hundreds across the world called the police, leading to Chris being evicted from his home, taking $750 from his mother to stay at Regency Inn Richmond, a motel on the outskirts of Richmond, Virginia, until he was finally arrested by officers of the Henrico County Police Department on 1 August 2021.
The arrest was filmed and livestreamed by internet personality Ethan Ralph and his crew. Additionally, footage of the arrest was captured on the bodycams worn by police officers, and the footage was later acquired by YouTube channel EWU Bodycam.

Chris, while being arrested.[1]
Ethan Ralph, who recorded Chris's arrest while cosplaying as him.
On the evening of 31 July, Reddit user Chrisisaman located Son-Chu at the Regency Inn Richmond, confirming that Chris was in the city and that he would be spending time in a motel.[2] The next day, a number of people attempted to observe or contact Chris there. Observers noticed police cars stationed at the motel, but because the place was known to have a seedy reputation, it was not obvious if they were there for Chris or for some other reason. These cop cars eventually left without arresting Chris.
The most significant of the observers was YouTuber Ethan Ralph who livestreamed himself and his friends driving to the motel to meet Chris. The group ordered a pizza in the hopes of luring him out, but this was unsuccessful. They then went about knocking on every door on the second floor (Chris had previously been filmed walking along the second floor balcony, suggesting that was where he was staying), but this was fruitless as well, and only led to the menagerie being ordered to leave by a motel employee.[3]
Not giving up, the group went to the Regency Mall (of 'the bear' fame) across the street, following (incorrect) speculation that Chris might be there since he was not in his room. While livestreaming at the mall they had an encounter with a police officer, who would happen to be one of the officers who arrested Chris a few hours later (as Ethan acknowledges during the arrest).
Later that afternoon, Ralph was tipped off that four Henrico County police cars had shown up at the motel. At around 6:00 PM, he got back just in time to film two officers perp-walking Chris down from his room, streaming the whole debacle for a live audience of over 3,000 viewers. While the police talked to Chris, Ralph sporadically yelled questions and comments, to which Chris occasionally responded. Despite trying to turn Chris against Null, who Ralph had a grudge against, Chris did not respond to these questions, nor did he respond to Ralph's offers to have him appear on the Killstream after his release.
Unlike Chris's previous run-ins with the law, he remained mostly calm and compliant during the arrest (possibly due to The WCT having advised him the previous day to cooperate with the police during his arrest),[4] though he rambled about the Dimensional Merge to both the police and Ralph's crew, promising that the Merge was in fact happening right at that moment. The police then loaded Chris into a squad car and left without answering Ralph's questions.[1] An additional POV shot filmed by an anonymous onlooker showed Chris climbing directly into the cop car.

Highlights
Throughout the video footage, the police are unaware of Chris or his infamy, expressing confusion about it at several points. In stark contrast to most of Chris's orbiters, the officers show little interest in humouring Chris's delusions, instead simply doing whatever it takes to keep the situation civil.
As Chris is being arrested, a police officer points a taser at him and warns that if he fights he will be tased. Chris then says he will comply.
Chris reveals that he uses two cellphones, one to deal with trolls, and one for friends; he refers to the Kevin Gates song "2 Phones."
As he's sitting handcuffed, Chris farts and says, "pardon my flatulence."
The police ask if Chris would like to remove his "necklaces" (which includes the medallion) as the jail will require them to be removed later anyway. When the police inform that the jail makes exceptions for religious crosses, Chris claims that his medallion is a "cross" protecting him. The policeman responds that he doesn't think the jail staff will go for that.
While the officers double-check the arrest warrant, Chris tells them that his husband Magi-Chan is giving them a "gentle punch" across dimensions. Chris tries to elicit a reaction from the police, but one simply replies that he did not feel anything. Chris then encourages Magi-Chan to “punch him harder, hubby.”
When Ethan Ralph and a bunch of other observers in the area talk to Chris, the officers repeatedly suggest that Chris shouldn't respond to them. Chris responds to them anyway.
While riding in the police car, Chris starts telling the officer about the Dimensional Merge and asks the officer who his favorite superhero is.
When the cop replies, "Probably Spider-Man," Chris excitedly informs him that he'll be able to meet Spider-Man in person.
Chris's response
In MINECRAFT Cubepy Build Part 4, while building in Minecraft, Chris decides to mention the bodycam footage.
“
Oh, um, you know what, well... at this time recent, the, uh, bodycam footage... I mean, okay, that's a thing, but you know what? That was so three years ago now! So, why are we bothering with that? LOL... because it's a thing you wanna talk about or whatever. It's just like (scoff) whatever! It's not present. So why're y'all... making it present?
