Happy Cat *kisses* is a video Chris made on June 4th, 2016. The video itself is of Chris, attempting to take a video of his cat Pollo, while "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairies" is playing. About 6 seconds in, it freezes on Chris's chest and starts glitching out, going to static several times, where it remains until the last 2 seconds of the video, where Chris then ends the video. This video is an amazing example of Chris's cinematography, as he can't even manage to use the YouTube Capture app right. Chris deleted the video hours later, only to be re-uploaded by YouTube user "CWCville Tourist" the same day, though without the image stabilization Chris added.
