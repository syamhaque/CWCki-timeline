December was the twelfth and final month of 2009. Chris opened the month by answering the Mailbag, but with shorter, less-enthusiastic answers. He also created additional "rejected" Mailbags to handle questions that made him feel uncomfortable — namely, those dealing with homosexuality and autism — and even published a vitriolic screed against people with Asperger syndrome. He would then upload several disturbing YouTube videos: one with him performing a baffling improvised rap that suggested he was a drug-crazed rapist, another rap video where he was painted up like an Insane Clown Posse groupie, and 10 minutes of him playing with homemade Lego figurines of Sonichu and Rosechu. Once again, he tried to write a story, and after spending six hours writing A Sonichu and Rosechu Christmas Story (which consisted of a few rough, unedited paragraphs), he tried to finish the story in comic form as Sonichu #11. It dragged on past Christmas day, and ultimately wouldn't be finished until 2017. Unflattering photos of Chris appeared on a Times Square billboard: all real pictures of him drinking his semen and such, except for one where he was Photoshopped into a gay bar. Chris was also infuriated by increasingly explicit pro-gay banner ads which appeared on CWCipedia. He would direct his hatred at Jack Thaddeus, who would be the subject of video death threats on Christmas Day. Chris would close out the year by going batshit insane about the gay ads and mailing a letter to President Barack Obama requesting that the gay ads be made illegal.
