================================================================================

DrainedCreativity is a video Chris uploaded to YouTube on 30 October 2010. In this video, Chris bemoans the trolls for draining his creativity. This video could be a logical explanation on why there's a shortage of Sonichu comics, if we didn't already know it's because Chris is horrendously lazy.
This video's audio served as the intro to the album Trollsta's Paradise: A True and Honest Tribute to Christian & The Hedgehog Boys.

Transcript
Well, you trolls and Clyde Cash... I hope you all are happy. [dramatic glasses removal] You quit - you put me down so much and belittled my - belittled my creativity and my artistic capabilities. Pretty much made me scar-you pretty much made me nearly scared to draw and think creatively.
You drained me.
You drained me, you damn idiots.
Sons o' bitches.
