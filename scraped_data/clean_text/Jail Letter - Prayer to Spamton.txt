This article is still yet to be completed due to stress. We get a lot of stressful torture in our lives that makes us crash into slumber. Given that inspiration is a big variable, and we may have been lacking of it, this article will be completed as soon as possible, at our own pace... HONEST! This article is missing the following:

On 30 January 2022, Chris sent a third, brief letter to Spamton G. Spamton. In the belief that he is about to be sent home, he describes his plans to upload a video message, after which the point of no return will be passed in the Dimensional Merge and he will see everyone alive on C-197 Earth. After this, he pens "The Lord Goddess Blue Heart's Prayer", which he may have been repeating to himself in jail. The tone of the letter is worrying, and Chris appears to be genuinely unwell.
Chris marks the return address as 14 Branchland Court, thinking that's where he would be once the letter reached Spamton.
Chris's Response
“
"Not Even Hell Realm Shall Welcome Thee . . . For Repentance, Thou Had Thy Chances.

Greetings, █████ and Greetings Individuals of █████
Enclosed is a copy of my Prayer for your reference, enjoyment, and sharing in Neo Spiritual Christianity Enlightenments. By the time you receive this letter and Prayer, I shall have returned home to the Sonichu Temple, recorded and uploaded my vital message with the citing of my Prayer for all, and now being the safe point of no return as we Collectively Shift at better pace. I'll see y'all still alive, safe, and well on C-197 Earth.
Take Care and Be Safe and Well.
