================================================================================

Donation Request is a video Chris streamed on April 24, 2016. In short, Chris begs for money like a little child. With Barb being sued by Discover and Chris dropping hundreds of dollars on Lego and Vidya he mostly doesn't bother playing, finances are tighter than ever. Surrounded by an Aladdin's cave of expensive toys, Chris begs for more money for ... uh, essential bills. In this video, another Christorical artefact can be seen to have survived the 2014 fire; Lil' Chris can be seen on the end of a shelf on one of Chris's room's walls.
