Attempting to spread the word.
On Kiwi Farms a user called Gooda Cheese spread the word about the twitter account wanting to start a revolutionary civil war in CWCville. The trolling plan is to start a forum to talk about the "rebellion" because The farms and CWCKI are unlikely of their communities. They use a tactic of making tweets, trying to make Chris think that is civil
war in his imaginary town, but He didn't notice it.
It would still go though as would do force "joint assault" reporting it on both accounts.
Sock Puppets
The CWCVILLE thing has been going for a while and they are several other sock puppets made by CWCVille rebellion. It started with a account called
lexxi_foxxi who defended Chris while the "rebellion" was going on. Under more info, it seems be into
Communism and Revolutionary Socialism.[4][5] It was very confusing to see if it was serious or a gimmick account. Also it supported a post on IWD.
How every when Lexxi Foxxi stop tweeting saying it was all state propganda. [6]

Nobody cared about the "rebellion" that went on and they stopped trying. Even Chris himself, it only had very few people caring and they stopped in the couple of months. It unknown why they would try this anyway.
