Chris in February 2019
February was the second month of 2019. Chris made another video begging members of the TF2 Analysis crew to unblock him on Twitter, and a video of him attending an imaginary therapy session with Dr. Wolf. Aside from this, Chris also made a brand new Twitter account with the handle @CPU_CWCSonichu in order to bypass Twitter blocks from TF2 Analysis members.
