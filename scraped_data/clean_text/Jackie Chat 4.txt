================================================================================

This chat took place on 1 October 2010. We learn that Chris hates the expression "shot myself in the foot" just as much as he hates the word "naïve". Jackie also reveals that she stopped watching Family Guy because she felt that Seth MacFarlane began to inject his own stupid personal politics into the show.
[7:38 pm] CWC:
Hey, Sweetheart. :-* h
[7:38 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
hello ~ ~ ~
[7:38 pm] CWC:
I've just uploaded the new direct to Lars video; you can go check it out now.
[7:38 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
ooh!
[7:39 pm] CWC:
I call him a Jivin' Turkey.
[7:39 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
give me a sec to watch
[7:40 pm] CWC:
ok
[7:40 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
:-D
[7:40 pm] CWC:
You like that, huh?
[7:40 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i loved it!
[7:41 pm] CWC:
:) h
[7:41 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
thank you so much
[7:41 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
that'll really grind his gears
[7:41 pm] CWC:
LOL
[7:41 pm] CWC:
where did you hear that expression?
[7:41 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
not sure where it comes from, i've heard people say it
[7:42 pm] CWC:
cool; I've first heard of it from the Family Guy movie.
[7:42 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
oh. wonder where they stole it from
[7:42 pm] CWC:
IDK; I've been wondering that as well.
[7:42 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
they like to steal a lot of dumb stuff on that show.
[7:42 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
seth macfarlane cant seem to come up with anything original
[7:43 pm] CWC:
Sometimes the story plots are original.
[7:43 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i used to watch it when it first premiered when it was good, but nowadays all it is about is stewie being gay, that dog promoting gay marriage, or seth macfarlane making fun of christians
[7:43 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so i stopped watching it
[7:44 pm] CWC:
Like within the first season or two of the show.
[7:44 pm] CWC:
I see. Well, I still watch it; it is a funny show.
[7:44 pm] CWC:
They just showed the season premiere for the 9th season; a one hour special of a "Who Done It" Mystery.
[7:44 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
yeah, i guess its funny if you still think fart jokes are funny
[7:44 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
and gay jokes
[7:45 pm] CWC:
It's not just the comedy, there are a few good points throughout that I can relate to as well.
[7:45 pm] CWC:
Like Template:Dial Meg for Murder
[7:46 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
don't you have a problem with the scathing criticism of christianity the show promotes, though?
[7:46 pm] CWC:
While it tends to be a stereotype to prisoners; they do mostly get toughened up after their time there.
[7:46 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
seth macfarlane is a militant anti-christian
[7:46 pm] CWC:
I turn a blind eye to those parts.
[7:47 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but i thought that you had a major problem with people who commit sins like that
[7:47 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
?
[7:47 pm] CWC:
BTW, in case you missed the episode, he revealed that Lois came from a Jewish family; it does suit her though; her voice actress, Alex Borsteen, is jewish.
[7:47 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
of course i missed it, i've missed it for seven years because i stopped watching it
[7:47 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but like, i know you dont like homosexuality, but the show is a major supporter of homosexual rights
[7:48 pm] CWC:
I have my feelings against what people do sometimes, but they're going to do it anyway.
[7:49 pm] CWC:
I see those jokes as a hit on the gays, and I turn a blind eye there. Also, when two dudes making out is portrayed, I look away.
[7:49 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
what do you mean, a hit on the gays?
[7:49 pm] CWC:
a Comical hit on them; making fun.
[7:50 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
the show makes hits on christians a lot meaner, though
[7:50 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
seth supports gays but he thinks christians are all going to hell.
[7:51 pm] CWC:
I understand that. He only makes those jokes for the sake of comedy, so I do not hold it against him.
[7:51 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
you should look up his personal politics. he really, really hates christians
[7:51 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
thats part of the reason i stopped watching, because he cant stop putting his stupid personal politics into the show
[7:52 pm] CWC:
Well, that is his opinion, and he is welcome to it.
[7:52 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so arrogant of a creator to insert themselves like that so much in what was once an innocent, entertaining creation
[7:52 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well anyway
[7:52 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
thanks for sending me your interview today!
[7:52 pm] CWC:
sounds like me and my comics.
[7:52 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
resume i mean
[7:52 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i keep confusing those two words
[7:53 pm] CWC:
and I will admit I took it a bit far of myself then as well.
[7:53 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
how did the interview go?
[7:53 pm] CWC:
The interview went good; I left a good and delightful impression on the interviewer; who was the area supervisor of the restaurant.
[7:53 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well thats good!
[7:53 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
what kind of questions did they ask you?
[7:54 pm] CWC:
He informed me later of the manager's name, and told me that he has received over a hundred applications, and has already hired 40 people who are training at other locations.
[7:54 pm] CWC:
Let me recollect...
[7:55 pm] CWC:
He asked me about why I was let go at Wendys; I told him it was due to them having hiring too many people, and they must have thought I was an expendable individual, and I do not think I am expendable, so they let me go. ...
[7:56 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
is that what happened?
[7:56 pm] CWC:
With that, I told him that in a year, I see myself still working there for him and being their most valued employee.
[7:56 pm] CWC:
yes and no...
[7:56 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
?
[7:56 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
what do you mean?
[7:57 pm] CWC:
yes the Wendy's store continued to hire more and more people...
[7:57 pm] CWC:
no, because the manager then just didn't like me...
[7:57 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
are you sure nothing happened? its rare to find a manager who would fire a person just because they dont like them personally.
[7:58 pm] CWC:
I did a few things that made me look immature, like this one time, I was taking a bunch of garbage out to the dumpster, and I hit one of the bags on the back of my head...
[7:58 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
that sounds just like a simple accident. i doubt that would get you fired
[7:58 pm] CWC:
I washed off my hair, my hat and my shirt before returning to work; I later learned I could have just asked for a replacement hat and shirt. oops.
[7:59 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
how did you dry your shirt? were you just soaking wet when you walked out of the bathroom?
[7:59 pm] CWC:
Plus, there was this disagreement between me and one female employee; we did not see eye-to-eye, and she was mean-spirited.
[7:59 pm] CWC:
I shook off the shirt to dry it.
[7:59 pm] CWC:
I was not soaking.
[8:00 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
did you take the shirt off?
[8:00 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
when washing it?
[8:00 pm] CWC:
yes.
[8:00 pm] CWC:
I had the restroom to myself.
[8:00 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
what was your disagreement with your female co-worker about?
[8:00 pm] CWC:
nowadays, I would not do that again; I know better.
[8:00 pm] CWC:
essentially, she was a mean-spirited, mid-volume woman who gave me bad times with criticisms, insults and whatnot.
[8:00 pm] CWC:
And after those ceased, and things were calming down, the manager...
[8:02 pm] CWC:
was waiting for an opportunity to fire me...
[8:02 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
do you have evidence they didn't like you, or are you just assuming all this
[8:03 pm] CWC:
he got his opportunity one night after watching a family with a tired child crying; I did nothing to cause him to cry, he WAS tired. And I offered to get a top for their potato so they could take it with them.
[8:03 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
you must have done something to anger management. they wont fire employees for no reason.
[8:04 pm] CWC:
the manager thought I had done my Donald Duck voice for the child and made him cry, which was not the case.
[8:04 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
are you sure the woman and the manager weren't just telling you to do something, or annoyed that you had failed to do something?
[8:04 pm] CWC:
Because the next day, he gave me the pink slip.
[8:04 pm] CWC:
Well, it was back in 2001; I do not remember.
[8:04 pm] CWC:
all of what they said.
[8:04 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but you remember that they were mean-spirited well enough.
[8:05 pm] CWC:
yes, their attitude stayed with me.
[8:05 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but what you did didnt stay with you?
[8:05 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
they were running a business. you may have interpreted their attitude as being mean, but maybe they were just stressed from trying to keep the place running.
[8:06 pm] CWC:
I remember what I did; I'm just having trouble remembering some of them.
[8:06 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
either you remember what you did or you didnt.
[8:06 pm] CWC:
upon retrospect, you are right.
[8:07 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i only ask because you seem to assume people are being unfairly mean to you an awful lot. so i wanted to make sure you might not have done something yourself
[8:07 pm] CWC:
Also, I was only a busboy, and at times when there were NO tables, floor, garbage or trays to clean, I didn't stand around; I took a seat for a few minutes now and then.
[8:07 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
you usually arent allowed to sit at jobs like that
[8:07 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
there's always something to do in a restaurant.
[8:07 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
that might be it right there
[8:08 pm] CWC:
I've learned from all that, and I'm not going to repeat those mistakes again. I realized that after I got fired.
[8:08 pm] CWC:
The Wendys in Ruckersville often had few customers.
[8:08 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but you just spent a good chunk of time telling me your firing wasnt your fault...
[8:08 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so i'm not so sure you did learn from it
[8:08 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but anyway, did you get the job at mcdonalds?
[8:09 pm] CWC:
I did learn from my mistakes.
[8:09 pm] CWC:
I don't know yet; they will call me in a week or less; they don't open up until the 19th.
[8:09 pm] CWC:
they still have to sort out the other details, like a background check and such.
[8:09 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well good luck!
[8:09 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
background check should be fine, you dont have felonies or anythign
[8:10 pm] CWC:
At least he has my character references, including Elizabeth and Rocky.
[8:10 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
yeah, i noticed you had another reference named Tony Wayne?
[8:10 pm] CWC:
I pray he does not give the dang Cwcki a look.
[8:10 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
who is that?
[8:10 pm] CWC:
brb
[8:12 pm] CWC:
I'm back
[8:12 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
ok
[8:13 pm] CWC:
Tony, for a long time, was the Gym Leader at the Pok'emon TCG League at the Game Place. He was a family man with a wife, son and two daughters; Tyler was the oldest; Briana was the middle child, and Caitlyn was the youngest.
[8:13 pm] CWC:
Tony is also a Physics teacher at Albemarle High School.
[8:13 pm] CWC:
A while after I was kicked out of the Place, Tony handed the torch of Gym Leader to someone else.
[8:14 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
do you think he remembers you? its been a while since you've talked, right?
[8:14 pm] CWC:
YES, he will remember me.
[8:14 pm] CWC:
He and I had a few good conversations.
[8:14 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
how long ago?
[8:14 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
have you spoken recently?
[8:15 pm] CWC:
And I gave Tyler, Briana and Caitlyn a fun Christmas Present (the one before I was forced to leave).
[8:15 pm] CWC:
I made the three children their own custom My Little Pony figures.
[8:15 pm] CWC:
complete hair change and paint job.
[8:15 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
did they like them?
[8:16 pm] CWC:
yes.
[8:16 pm] CWC:
:) h
[8:16 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
what do you mean by hair change
[8:16 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
?
[8:17 pm] CWC:
I took out the original hair the figures had and rooted in bunches of thread strands to make new hair.
[8:17 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so anyway, i knew you spent a lot of time at the game place, but i didnt realize you were employed there.
[8:17 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
what was your hourly pay?
[8:17 pm] CWC:
Mostly brown or blonde or black to match the person the pony was going to.
[8:17 pm] CWC:
I was not employed.
[8:17 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
?
[8:17 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
your resume says you were employed there, though
[8:18 pm] CWC:
I was going to the League, and I was a Volunteer Assistant Gym Leader (and substitute Gym Leader).
[8:18 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
oh, so you were just there playing childrens card games?
[8:18 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
why'd you put it on your resume then?
[8:19 pm] CWC:
I still did a lot of work, making sure the people and children kept in control and did not cause chaos.
[8:19 pm] CWC:
Plus, sometimes, I had to put together their own playable decks from their scratch collections.
[8:19 pm] CWC:
It did get stressful.
[8:19 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so you were playing with childrens card games.
[8:20 pm] CWC:
I am into Pok'emon as well; I thought that was obvious.
[8:20 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
yeah i know you like pokemon, i'm just trying to figure out what work you did
[8:20 pm] CWC:
and it was NOT just for children; teens and adults play the game too.
[8:20 pm] CWC:
I did play the game.
[8:21 pm] CWC:
as well
[8:21 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i have a cousin with aspergers who LOVES pokemon cards.
[8:21 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
he mostly collects them though, doesnt play much
[8:21 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
likes the shiny colors, he says
[8:21 pm] CWC:
Has he thought of looking for a League to join, so he can trade and play.
[8:21 pm] CWC:
?
[8:21 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i'm not sure
[8:21 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
his mom is getting him more involved in sports now, he's kind of growing out of it i think
[8:22 pm] CWC:
I see.
[8:22 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so did the parents of these kids obtain your services as a babysitter then?
[8:23 pm] CWC:
during those two hours, you could have considered me a babysitter.
[8:23 pm] CWC:
as well
[8:23 pm] CWC:
two hours a week
[8:23 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
did the parents consider you a babysitter>
[8:23 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
did the game place consider you an employee?
[8:24 pm] CWC:
maybe, maybe not (on the parents); no T.G.P. did not consider me an employee
[8:24 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but you listed yourself as employed there on your resume
[8:24 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but really, you were just going to hang out and play pokemon cards once a week?
[8:25 pm] CWC:
Volunteer work is considered work just the same.
[8:25 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
you didnt say volunteer work on the resume, you said you worked there
[8:25 pm] CWC:
and I've just told you what I did there.
[8:25 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
yeah, you played pokemon cards
[8:26 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
thats not really volunteer work.
[8:26 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i mean, you go to the mall a lot and there are children there, are you babysitting every time you're at the mall?
[8:26 pm] CWC:
AND kept the children and teens in order and made sure there was little chaos.
[8:26 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but wasnt the reason you got kicked out of the game place because you were causing disruptions yourself?
[8:27 pm] CWC:
that, and Michael just plain hated me.
[8:27 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so again, you're assuming someone hated you
[8:27 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
just like the manager at wendy's
[8:27 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
why would he hate you? what reason would he have?
[8:28 pm] CWC:
the only reasons Michael could have hated me, was ONCE or Twice, I did get loud when everything was getting chaotic and confusing soo bad, that I'd just explode in a lout shout.
[8:28 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
what kind of shout?
[8:29 pm] CWC:
And there was that time with me writing that message about him loving Mary.
[8:29 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
see, there you go
[8:29 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
you did something bad to him
[8:29 pm] CWC:
just an "AAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!!"
[8:29 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
why would you do that?
[8:29 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
were children frightened?
[8:29 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
maybe thats also why you were kicked out
[8:30 pm] CWC:
Yes, that was established.
[8:30 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so you screamed at children, and you vandalized the bathroom wall
[8:30 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
is that right?
[8:30 pm] CWC:
And I was just soo stressed out, and things were too chaotic and lout.
[8:30 pm] CWC:
I did not write on the walls.
[8:30 pm] CWC:
I wrote that message on a small piece of cardboard.
[8:30 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
where was the cardboard
[8:31 pm] CWC:
it was on the side of a card-holding box.
[8:31 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
in the front of the store? on the counter?
[8:31 pm] CWC:
by myself, away from everyone at the time, and I put the box in the bin of Pok'emon stuff that stays in the back room most of the time.
[8:31 pm] CWC:
outside of League time.
[8:32 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so you vandalized store property with threatening messages
[8:32 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
how many other people were doing that, and screaming at kids?
[8:32 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
because if that was common and only you got kicked out, then it would seem like you were unfairly singled out
[8:33 pm] CWC:
JEEZE! this was YEARS ago; can we hold up on new questions until after I address the previous ones, please?
[8:33 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
what previous questions? i'm trying to find out why you got kicked out of the game place
[8:33 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
dont get so snappy with me
[8:33 pm] CWC:
After I shouted, it did become quiet.
[8:33 pm] CWC:
I guess the children were frightened.
[8:33 pm] CWC:
But I was trying to call order in the place.
[8:34 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
why were you trying to call order if you werent an employee?
[8:35 pm] CWC:
It wasn't store property; it was a cardboard box someone used and left behind.
[8:35 pm] CWC:
a league member.
[8:35 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
werent all the kids league members?
[8:35 pm] CWC:
No one else did any vandalizing or screaming.
[8:35 pm] CWC:
And I wrote that message that day, because I had brought my Wii, where before then it WAS okay to hook it up to their working flat-screen TV.
[8:35 pm] CWC:
On this day, Michael said NO, and I was very angry at him.
[8:35 pm] CWC:
Children were missing out on receiving a Magmorter, Electivre and Surfing Pikachu for thier Diamond/Pearl game cards.
[8:38 pm] CWC:
There was Chaos in the place; I was stressed out; I was clouded and could not think, so I exploded. Often I am a lot better than that.
[8:38 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
why were you there if it was so stressful to be there?
[8:38 pm] CWC:
Some of the League Members were Teenagers AND Adults.
[8:38 pm] CWC:
Most of the time it was NOT stressful.
[8:38 pm] CWC:
CWC (ChrisChanSonichu) is idle 8:38 pm
[8:38 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
yeah but still
[8:39 pm] CWC:
okay, I've answered the questions, please keep it one question at a time.
[8:38 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
sounds like mike snyder was mad that you were trying to be the boss of the pokemon game
[8:39 pm] CWC:
Yeah, okay, upon retrospect I can see that, so I agree with that statement.
[8:39 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well see? there you go
[8:40 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
you said you learned from what happened at wendy's, but you applied the exact same mentality to what happened at the game place
[8:40 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so do you agree now that mike snyder had a reason to kick you out?
[8:40 pm] CWC:
No, most of the time I was very civil, and it was mostly calm and peaceful.
[8:41 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so that makes it okay to scare children sometimes and boss people around?
[8:41 pm] CWC:
yes, I agree Mike had a reason, yet I still have issues against him for kicking me out.
[8:41 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
what kind of issues?
[8:42 pm] CWC:
it was not that serious; the shouts only happened TWICE; no more. And I was trying to keep everyone at peace and things calm.
[8:42 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
maybe he didnt want the shouts to happen a third time
[8:42 pm] CWC:
A), on the day I was kicked out, my mother came with me...
[8:42 pm] CWC:
and when we went into the back room, HE DID NOT OFFER HER A CHAIR AT ALL.
[8:43 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
why did he have to?
[8:43 pm] CWC:
And he would not allow me to get a chair from the inside area for her.
[8:43 pm] CWC:
SHE's an old woman.
[8:43 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
he had just kicked you out. its understandable he didnt want you going in the back area, isnt it?
[8:44 pm] CWC:
we WERE in the back area; I was getting a chair from the League Area.
[8:43 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well, he probably still had his issues against you
[8:43 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
for screaming at his customers
[8:44 pm] CWC:
Still, he did not have to relay it onto my mother; he could and Should have offered her a chair.
[8:44 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well you didnt have to try to boss around the pokemon game, but you still did
[8:45 pm] CWC:
B) he kicked me out before, but only for a short while.
[8:45 pm] CWC:
CWC (ChrisChanSonichu) is available 8:45 pm
[8:45 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so maybe the first time he banned you was a warning, then. what did you do after you came back?
[8:45 pm] CWC:
I was Assistant Gym Leader; I kept things in order when Tony was not able to.
[8:45 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
was one of the screams between the two bans?
[8:46 pm] CWC:
HE was my superior in the League.
[8:46 pm] CWC:
no.
[8:46 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
wait, you said you werent actually employed though
[8:46 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
either Tony was your boss or he wasnt
[8:46 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
and in any case, mike snyder was in charge of the store. he was hosting the pokemon league, so he would have been above tony
[8:47 pm] CWC:
well, he was NOT an employee of T.G.P. either; he was a Volunteer too, but he was a higher Volunteer, and I respected him as such.
[8:47 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but you didnt respect mike snyder, your host?
[8:47 pm] CWC:
Yes, I guess he was above Tony.
[8:47 pm] CWC:
but Mike had LITTLE to do with the League, Period.
[8:48 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
it was his store. he had everything to do with it
[8:49 pm] CWC:
he did not participate in any of the activities.
[8:48 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so what?
[8:49 pm] CWC:
Plus, he was one of the Coming in-an-out people; the League was in session LONG before he showed up.
[8:49 pm] CWC:
ever
[8:49 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so what? it was his store
[8:49 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
why does when he started working there matter? he was hired to be the boss. were you hired to be the boss of the pokemon game?
[8:51 pm] CWC:
Point is; he was not around long enough to get my respects, and I did not see him as a :"Presidentially Important" individual, like a Police man.
[8:51 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
why does what you saw him as matter? it was HIS store
[8:51 pm] CWC:
I was hired to be Assistant Gym Leader by the Gym Leader, yes.
[8:51 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so you were employed? how much did it pay?
[8:51 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
you're confusing me. either you were an employee or you werent.
[8:52 pm] CWC:
I was not payed.
[8:52 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so you werent hired
[8:52 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
hired = job
[8:52 pm] CWC:
It was VOLUNTEER WORK.
[8:52 pm] CWC:
Volunteers at the SPCA do not get paid, but they get HIRED.
[8:53 pm] CWC:
Vounteer = Job
[8:53 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
job = pay
[8:53 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
chris, if you were officially an employee of the pokemon league thing, wouldnt tony have stood up for you when mike tried to kick you out?
[8:54 pm] CWC:
Pay = Money; Money Varies; A job can have No Pay.
[8:54 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
no it cant
[8:54 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
a job pays money
[8:54 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
thats what a job is
[8:55 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
chris, it sounds like you are trying really, really, really hard to find a way to blame mike snyder for everything and absolve yourself of all wrongdoing.
[8:55 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
that stands in contradiction to your claim that you learned your lesson from what happened at wendys
[8:56 pm] CWC:
I do not mean to sound like that, and I understand blaming anyone does NOT absolve anyone of any doings.
[8:56 pm] CWC:
My mind has Matured more since then, and from all of the Troll Encounters.
[8:57 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but you still blame mike snyder for what happened.
[8:57 pm] CWC:
I wish to move forward from all this.
[8:57 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
you havent ever once just admitted "yes, i goofed. i screamed at children, and i tried to boss people around even though i wasnt an official employee. i understand those things are wrong."
[8:58 pm] CWC:
I Blame him for Kicking me out and being a Mean-Spirited Individual; I do not blame him for my own actions.
[8:58 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
how can you blame him if he did what was justified?
[8:58 pm] CWC:
Yes, I did goof up a lot.
[8:58 pm] CWC:
those details considered.
[8:58 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
if you steal a video game and a cop catches you and arrests you for theft, do you "blame" the cop for doing it?
[8:59 pm] CWC:
No. A) I would never do such a thing, but if I did, it would be MY Fault; no one elses.
[8:59 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well, isnt getting kicked out of the game place your fault then too?
[8:59 pm] CWC:
The "A)" was not required.
[8:59 pm] CWC:
yeah, I guess it was my fault I got kicked out the "Place" also.
[8:59 pm] CWC:
My own fault for shooting myself in the foot, metaphorically, a LOT in my whole lifetime.
[8:59 pm] CWC:
I am sick and tired of that expression, "Shooting myself in the foot."
[9:01 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
then maybe you should stop using it
[9:01 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
CWC (ChrisChanSonichu) is idle 9:01 pm
[9:01 pm] CWC:
Aside from "Naive" being my Least favorite word of all time, "Shooting myself in the foot" is my Least favorite expression.
[9:01 pm] CWC:
CWC (ChrisChanSonichu) is available 9:02 pm
[9:02 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but it accurately describes the fact that getting kicked out of the game place was your own doing
[9:02 pm] CWC:
My father used it earlier today after I had left the job interview; he claimed that expression on me for saying the manager of Wendy's "thought I was EXPENDABLE."
[9:02 pm] CWC:
He went and raised his voice at me and used the expression over and over because of that ONE WORD...
[9:02 pm] CWC:
Even though the interview was emotionally Positive,and I left a Positive Impression aside from that one word...
[9:02 pm] CWC:
He picks a fight with me for using that word.
[9:03 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but on the other hand, he lets you live in his house and pays off your rampant debts, so i'd say you owe him some breathing room
[9:04 pm] CWC:
*sigh*
[9:04 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
hey, i have an idea
[9:04 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
for one of your october videos
[9:04 pm] CWC:
uh huh
[9:05 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
now that you see that mike snyder wasnt to blame, maybe one of your videos could be you admitting that you got kicked out because of your own actions, and you recognize he wasnt at fault?
[9:05 pm] CWC:
that is fair. I will do that.
[9:05 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
:D h
[9:05 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
maybe if he sees it, he might be willing to lift the ban, too
[9:05 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i bet all he's ever wanted was an honest admission of guilt and an apology
[9:05 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
you should make that one of your videos this weekend!
[9:06 pm] CWC:
I doubt he'd ever lift the ban or even have an ounce of good will towards me after all that...
[9:07 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well, its worth a shot
[9:07 pm] CWC:
plus the more recent events of me going there personally and asking him to let me back in...
[9:07 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
yeah, but last time you didnt admit to being wrong.
[9:07 pm] CWC:
and taking a photograph of him through the store window to use as a dartboard.
[9:07 pm] CWC:
and getting caught heavily then.
[9:07 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
yeah, he might have interpreted that as threatening
[9:07 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but in any case, making this video will be good for you even apart from him
[9:07 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
it will be good to release your anger and your hate
[9:08 pm] CWC:
I guess.
[9:08 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
you should make that your first video tomorrow!
[9:08 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i cant wait to see it
[9:08 pm] CWC:
right now, I'm feeling tired from the discussion.
[9:08 pm] CWC:
Okay, I will make it the first video.
[9:08 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
:-D :-D :-D
[9:09 pm] CWC:
can I get away with NO costume for this one video out of 31?
[9:09 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
yeah, thats ok
[9:09 pm] CWC:
:) h
[9:09 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
for serious videos like this, you dont need a costume
[9:09 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
it would take away from the gravitas of your statement
[9:10 pm] CWC:
I agree.
[9:10 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
hey, werent you going to show the picture of Lars in a squash suit and then rip the picture up?
[9:10 pm] CWC:
I did that.
[9:10 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
it looked like you cut a lot out of the final video. was that in the part that you cut out?
[9:11 pm] CWC:
hang on.
[9:10 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
do you still have the uncut video? could you send it to me?
[9:12 pm] CWC:
Oh, shit! I did cut it out; I messed up in the editing.
[9:12 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
oops! :-)
[9:12 pm] CWC:
I'll delete this one, and fix it right away.
[9:12 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
just upload the whole thing
[9:12 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
or send the whole thing to me, too
[9:13 pm] CWC:
no, I'll reupload it after I fix it.
[9:12 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
ok
[9:13 pm] CWC:
I gtg, but aside from the discussion, I appreciated and enjoyed our talk.
[9:13 pm] CWC:
:) h
[9:13 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
me too :-)
[9:13 pm] CWC:
I Love You.
[9:13 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
love you too ~ ~ ~
[9:13 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
bye!
[9:13 pm] CWC:
:-* h
[9:13 pm] CWC:
Sweetest dreams.
