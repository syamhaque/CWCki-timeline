WelcometoBollywood is a video Chris uploaded on 30 October 2010. In this video, Chris performs Bollywood belly dancing, clad in his padded-out white muscle bra, to the tune of "Kajra Re"[1], from the 2005's Bunty Aur Babli. He attempts to mimic Aishwarya Rai's actions, but like all his endeavors, does it poorly and betrays a fantastic lack of preparation. He appears to be watching the film as he dances.
It is unknown how Chris can dance around in place for nearly 7 minutes, yet is incapable of even holding onto a bar to do pull-ups. Either that, or he simply used several thinly-disgused jump cuts to hide his inability to exercise.
In September 2015, Chris revealed that he was taking lessons in belly-dancing.
