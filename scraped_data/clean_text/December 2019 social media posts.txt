Hey, Everyone. Logging onto YouTube for another Fun Stream, Behind The Scenes Action, so come on up, and please donate; I am literally more than $25 away from being able to withdraw the funds from my AdSense.
Teen Troon Squad
8 December
I've just completed a lovely bunch of Ship and Goal cards featuring the art of the talented @PickinyFelliny.
Order NOW to gaurantee Delivery BEFORE Christmas, 2019. https://twitter.com/CWCEmmanuelle/status/1203912743633350658
TehFoxxoGuy replied, posting an image from the Chris with Teen Troon Squad video:
let that sink in
Chris answered:
Go ahead; that Is what happened that day, and they did not mind it much. To mock us makes you all Soo Neurotypically Hindered.
Edozis replied:
They were trolls Christine. You got trolled yet again.
Chris answered:
I Knew they were trolls, but they had Good Intentions, and they were genuinely Kind Individuals. I am not listening to your bull shit.

Chris loses his voice
9 December
Cold Virus update: my voice is shot. That grinds my gears and pisses me off. Continuing on with simple rest, meditation, positivity maintenance, and taking medicine, vitamins, enjoying chicken noodle soup, and drinking lots of water.

Making a kettle of tea with fresh lemon juice. I’ll enjoy it hot from the ol’ mug of my father’s.
10 December
Good morning. I am still recovering, the virus is being stupid, but I’m psychically pushing it away, yet it decided to attack my throat again. At least my voice is not shot again.
Princess Bride
11 December
I am looking forward to Discord in “PrincessBride” being uploaded on Thursday the 12th on #ILoveKimPossibleALot’s channel. It will be worth watching the whole video.
Chris explains his triggering
12 December
Hey, y’all. Update on this cold: it’s giving me nasal problems now, and it still lingers in the throat. It does not feel as bad as earlier.
Also, I have found the reasoning behind the Triggering from
@ProjectSNT’s redesign of the Chaotic Combo. There was a disturbance in their Dungeons & Dragons-like home dimension of CS-89, which is literally the main home of Plutia and Peashy in their CPU leadership over...
...Planeptune, there. Anyway, there have been a number of migrations of individuals and items from CS-89 into C-197 (Fated or forced). Even entire dungeon cave areas were being relocated via heavy magic from there.
I’m projected there, as a Cleric, working on analyzing and...
...finding the solutions before something really bad could happen to CS-89. This seems to be the right path, as I am finding less visual offense with Magi-Chan Sonola differences. Not triggering. Go figure a subconscious Trigger event being a call for help from another dimension.
[Magi-Chan Sonola image]
Anyhoo, I’m about to get some food for this body. I’ll check back later.
Buy more cards, please
12 December
Reminder to all #TSSSF Players and #Sonichu and #Rosechu fans: You still have time to order these cards to play the most fun Shipping Collectible Card Game in existence for delivery before Christmas. Come Place your Orders Now.

SNT drawing
12 December
I finally drew SNT, although it ended up being a chronicling of a chat she and I had about a couple of months ago. Also, alt-dimension Sonichus and Rosechus @ProjectSNT
has drawn is an idea for a #TSSSF expansion pack, if she would like to collab a bit on it. She has my email.
Chris surprisingly agrees with enablers
13 December
Eshcal:
And now you go to the real fact of the matter: two points. One: she can believe whatever she chooses. Two: The same tired things people like you have been saying have not only been %100 ineffective, but has done irreparable damage over years if she was delusional. Which she isn't
Thank you for understanding. ⭐️⭐️⭐️
Eshcal:
I think you are being a little overly dramatic there. She's dealt with toxic and harmful people for years, and can identify them with ease. I think she'd believe in the Merge without twitter, or other people believing in it, as these things aren't what the belief came from.
That is Correct. I not only Believe in the other dimensions and the Merge, but I Know them for Fact, because I have been there and Everywhere, Personally. I have deity-level powers and abilities. This has been proven before in this Very Restrictive 1218 Dimension. Open Your Minds
You don't say?
12 December
Finally! I can show off one of my Promo Cards that is actually linked with @ILoveKPAlot’s PrincessBride. I was asked to contribute a couple of Art pieces; the subtle one in the dungeon is a funny; I pray y’all enjoy the show.
😊
⚡️💙⚡️
IAMNOTCRAZY
12 December
I will add and reiterate: I am Not Delusional, all of this has been very much real and fully existent. I definitely would know on the contrary. I even was able to identify and overcome actual delusional illusions during the time of this cold. I have a very good idea of Real/Fake. Thank you, @Eschcal for your continued and genuine kindness, support and responses. You are very open-minded and spiritual; I see that in you. 😊⚡️💙⚡️
Nightstar video
12 December
I was only super happy and humbled to contribute and help.
I pray I get invited to help on other vids later on, including being Nightstar on #MLPFiMSeasons10to14. Later.
Chris corrects Kidasuna lore
12 December
That is not so. We have foreseen that marriage is not a mandatory option for getting you to Kidasuna. Remember, Jacob...

Cold update
13 December
Cold update: my throat is no longer feeling soar and my nose is feeling less leaky; feeling pretty good right now. 😊

Sonirisu triggering explanation 2
13 December
By the way, @ProjectSNT, I’ve found out what it was about Wild Sonirisu’s face and tail that was really bugging me. Turns out, he reminded me of one of the Rokat Grunts. Apparently, CS-89 was getting its magical items stolen. We managed to resolve the problem, and I can look at Sonirisu without even flinching anymore, finally. Go figure the ordeal that such an event was giving me warning over. Glad I investigated.
Chris journeys to Dimension CS-89
13 December
In response to ProjectSNT's redesigns of the Chaotic Combo:
I've had to personally journey to Dimension CS-89 to resolve the problem of their D&D Magic resources being stolen; at least I've leveled myself up as a Cleric, and I get to pull of a style similar to one that I like from #SoulCalibur. Another hefty mission for a goddess like me.
Chris apologizes for his reaction
14 December
I want to publicly announce that I am really sorry for how I reacted to @ProjectSNT’s redesigns, here. They are very good, and so is her video.

"Signs" of the dimensional merge
17 December
Check This Out! Yet another sign of Dimension Merge, as even @IdeaFactoryIntl is chronicling the CPUs’ efforts in making it happen. Yet, they should have heard of Scarlet and I, being the past and present CPUs of the Commodore Consoles and Cwcville.

Chris purchases more TSSSF cards, responds to JK Rowling's trans comments
19 December
Hey, Everyone. I just got the Nightvee & the #TSSSF Warriors For Andromeda Expansion Pack, and I set up this grid for the product photos on my shop page. Note: this was manifested with the combination of the #Sonichu Deck, and the Sonichu & Rosechu, Chris Chan, and Nightvee Packs and a few of the Promo Cards. It will be noted that only the one Nightvee Expansion Pack is the product in question. But, this works in showing an example of a Shipping Grid that could be made. Also, Note, the small Removed From Play pile to the right of the grid as well as how everyone is arranged. I made sure the Nightvee Warrior cards were the main focus and majority.
#TSSSF #Sonichu #Rosechu #ChildrenofKefentse

Also, at the risk of being blocked by @jk_rowling, I feel I, too, must respond to her recent act. I heavily and personally disagree: people Can have their physical gender changed; it has been proven and done before. And I, as a legitimate CPU and Goddess, personally know, too. I continue to be proud of being Trans, and for supporting other Trans and everyone else in the LGBTQ+. #TransRights.

Chris makes a Naco
21 December
Something different today for lunch: I’ve been re-binging #KimPossible on @disneyplus; so, @ILoveKPAlot, if you’re seeing this: two soft-shell tacos and an order of Nachos; I made a Naco. 😋
Ron Stopable is the Man! Nacos Rule! @tacobell
Super Yum! 😊

I will also comment that while it may not be obvious in the digital image, I used a lot of glitter and gel ink on this piece; it is really shiny in person.

TSSSF incarnations of Chris

In response to a fan commenting on the previous post:
Sonic was placed where he was fated to be, beside Sonichu and Rosey. And that is I and Christine Chan in the middle. Read the Flavour Texts on us two.

Burgerformer
28 December
Something different to bring fun: this is my Favorite out of the @McDonalds Changeables: C2 the Cheeseburger. He just has an adorable smiling face that reminds me of G1 Bumblebee. And he looks like he’s wearing a green sweater; what’s up with that? 😊
So Many CWCs
29 December
Responding to a fan art of Johnny Bravo wearing Chris' clothing (with Magi-Chan):
I’ve seen that one before. Right there: muscly-arm, bulky one in the back.
Also, so everyone knows: by “Different Version”, I mean between Human and Sonichu forms (although the Alicorn form is also a different one as well).
Again: #TSSSF #Sonichu cards Available Now on http://cwcvilleshopping.com
