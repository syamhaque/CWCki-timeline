Chris's letter to Cathy Weseluck is a hand-written letter Chris wrote on 20 August 2017 to Cathy Weseluck, a voice actress for My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic.
Chris tweeted her an image of the letter, apologizing for the unusual format of the message, and asked for her input.[1] Chris seemed to be hoping that Weseluck would act as his personal therapist, as the letter would be more appropriate for a proper therapy session.
In the letter, Chris described his embarrassing experience at wearing the unicorn cosplay to church. He also casually mentioned taking valium over it.

Dear Cathy W.,
I've had a day that started out happy and delightful. I felt like donning my pony ears and unicorn horn, and tail, to my church today. I've made a lot of people smile, and it was as normal as could be, with my sharing the joys from BronyCon 2017. Then later, during a bible verse reading, my church friend suddenly burst out in tears; I felt along with her (the hate bout in Charlottesville, VA last weekend).
Then, my pastoral counsolor [sic] (who was part of the choir this week) hands me a note. "Please remove your headgear; it's reminding us of Nazis" (specifically, the NOT Nazi Jesters who mocked the haters). I felt utter shock; I removed my head gear, and I tensed up. Fanning myself with the program, as I was feeling hot: I ended up closing myself and breaking out in tears myself. Being forced to remove what made me and most other people smile, feeling like not being able to calm a post-bouted crowd, the empathy for my friend and not being able to make her smile... just about killed my mood.
I sat there, fanning myself with my right, gripping the bench with my left, And paralyzed, I stayed a while longer. Then I left during the collection, with the plates. I took a rest and some valium after I got back home. I feel some recovered, but feel some mild headache now. Have y'all ever heard such a thing? Pony Ears and Unicorn Horn being reminisent of an anti-Nazi Jester? I've Never. And I meant no harm. What are your thoughts, Cathy?
Thank You for listening.
Christine W. Chandler
P.S If there's another method to "Ask Cathy", please let me know.
