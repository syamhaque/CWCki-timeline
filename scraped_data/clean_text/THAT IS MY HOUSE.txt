Do you realize...? Do... you... realize something? Let me tell you: If the Rebel Alliance sees those Death Star plans, that you put in the damn droid, they could destroy our base, and we would have to move out of it...?
THAT IS MY HOUSE, aka ECV 00193, is a video uploaded on 27 August 2009, in which Chris demands footage of his house be removed from the internet in a calm and concise manner.
Chris took down the video not too long afterward, only for it be re-uploaded by troll archivists. On 29 August 2009, an uncut version of the video featuring Bob was acquired by Vivian Gee and leaked onto YouTube.
This video is easily one of Christian's most infamous and popular videos, with a reupload of the uncut version with Bob cracking 1.9 million views as of October 2025. In January 2024, meme edits of the video began circulating on YouTube, often replacing Chris and Bob with fictional characters or placing them in alternative settings. In November 2025, Chris commented about the trend, saying that he still couldn't laugh off the incident and that it still stung him, and that he regretted that the house tour video was leaked.[1]
The video was even referenced in an episode of Smiling Friends; the show's creators previously mentioned being influenced by this video when they expressed wanting to get Chris a cameo role on the show.

Description
I was Already In Deep Enough, but THIS IS TOO DEEP! GET ALL MY HOUSE IMAGES OFF THE INTERNET!
I am counting on ALL FULL Positive Cooperation in this major matter.
Christian Weston Chandler, August 17 [sic], 2009
Uncut Version
“
Shut that goddamn thing off!
”
Bob Chandler, addressing his old foe: that goddamn Internet.
An uncut version entitled ECV 00192 was posted by Vivian on 29 August 2009, where Bob walks in and scolds Chris. This is the second and last time we see Bob showing any kind of parental authority over Chris. In Mailbag 25, Chris revealed that he lied to his father, telling him that he had gotten the house videos off of the Internet.
We also learn the real reason why Chris's parents are concerned about the tour videos: the fear that the Health Department of Greene County will discover the squalor of the Chandler household and condemn it. Unsurprisingly, in typical CWC fashion, Chris doesn't seem to care about that and is only concerned that he got in trouble with his parents.
Also noteworthy is the fact that this marks the first Chris video explicitly featuring another living, breathing person (as opposed to an inflatable person, made of plastic).
WARNING! This video features EXTREME levels of Tard Rage.

Transcript
[Chris races into the frame, obviously angry and upset; he begins speaking quietly, but gradually gets louder]
This does not even deserve a Captain's Log introduction... [dramatic glasses removal] because this is dead serious! The inside and outside tour I did A FEW MONTHS ago of my house, everyone on the Internet...
[Chris jumps up and suddenly begins to scream and yell in a fit of childish rage, flapping his arms as he puts louder emphasis on certain words, sounding somewhat similar to Gilbert Gottfried]
MY MOTHER AND MY FATHER ARE
ANGRY AT ME! They're BLAMING it at me! IT'S my fault,
I ADMIT IT!
it's my fault! I WANT everything a-
BOUT MY HOUSE OFF!THE!INNERNET!

Bob: Listen-to-me! [muffled by Chris's "OFF THE INTERNET!"] Listen to me.
Chris:
[his expression changes rapidly and slowly turns to face Bob] Yes...
Bob: Listen to ME.
Chris: Yes.
Bob: Shut that goddamn thing off!
[Chris sighs and turns off his TV, unaware or indifferent to the fact that his camera is still recording the conversation. Bob walks over to him]
Bob: I don't care what you do. [pointing at PSEye] You get all that stuff off of there. Tonight.
Chris: I'm working on it. [slaps hands to his side]
Bob: Go work on it! [points to the door, instructing Chris to go to the computer downstairs]
Chris: I am workin-
Bob: Do you realize...? Do you realize something? Let me tell you: If the Health Department of Greene County... sees those videos... that you put on the damn Internet... they could condemn our house, and we would have to move out of it...?
Chris: [sighs]

Chris: I'm working on it! I was making a YouTube vi—uh, a vid-dya for YouTube t-tellin' ev'rybody, "get the images off of the Internet". Y'know it's not...

Bob: [walks out of the room] I'll be up all night with you if I have to. You won't get any sleep until that stuff's off.
Chris: I'm working on it!
Bob: [from outside] Get in there and start!
Chris: I'M WOR-KIN' ON IT! LET ME DO THAT STUPID VIDEO SO I CAN TELL E'RRYBODY, IN MY COMMAND, TO GET EVERYTHIN'- HELP ME GET EVERYTHIN' OFF THE INTERNET-

Bob: ...and get it offa there fast!
Chris: I'm workin on it! I'm WORKIN on it! [Chris turns his TV back on]
So yeah, please, get everything off the Internet...
Now, NOW, NOW, NOW, NOW, NOOOOW!
[Chris stomps the ground as he yells like a 5 year old throwing a tantrum, the camera noticeably shakes; he then quickly calms down, then holds up the peace sign]
Curse the trolls, peace to everybody else.
The Greene County Health Department responds
In addition to creating many, many mirrors of the videos Bob wanted cut down, some more intrepid viewers actually did contact the Greene County Health Department. The Health Department did respond (3 weeks later) to one such letter, although they seemed indifferent to their living situation, citing that the Chandler's messes were firmly confined within their home and seemingly not affecting their community. They stated that their decision to live in a garbage house full of dirty dishes and animal feces was part of their inalienable rights as guaranteed by the US Constitution:
Dear Bob S:
Thank you for your interest in this situation. The challenge is to
clarify if the conditions at this residence are a risk to the public's
health or if they are personal risks accepted by the individuals that
choose to live there.
Public Health relates to the general health of a community. When
diseases can be transmitted from person to person or when the health
risk affects the community, regulations have normally been enacted to
address these public health threats. Even so, the individual's right to
choose is protected by the Constitution. We know smoking greatly
increases the risk of cancer and heart disease, yet individuals continue
to choose to smoke. Regulations are in place to minimize public exposure
to contaminated or mishandled foods, yet some individuals still choose
to eat raw hamburger. In the case you've brought to our attention, the
"deplorable conditions" you refer to appear to be confined to the
individual residence and are the choice of those that live there. They
do not appear to effect the health of the community. There are no
specific health regulations that address individual choices in private
living conditions.
We have contacted the building official to see if any building, zoning
of fire prevention laws apply and were informed that they did not. We
also contacted the Greene County Attorney to see if he knew of any
County ordinances that would be applicable. He did not know of any. We
also contacted adult protective services to make sure they are aware of
the situation.
Please contact me if I can be of further assistance.

This raises the question of whether Chris is properly informed about the risks to his health and all of his rights as a disabled person (especially the right to humane psychiatric treatment that would help him live on his own), although this probably isn't a matter for the Health Department.
