Twitch is a game-centric livestreaming website, which Chris joined in 2018. His first stream was on 16 March, in which he played Burnout Paradise Remastered. Despite it being a relatively easy source of revenue for Chris in theory, given that he could get payments from fans to play video games all day as he already did, he only used it sparingly, and has generally stuck to YouTube for his livestreaming needs.

Description
As expected of Chris, he put no effort into setting up his page, as his description is a copy and paste of his Tumblr description:
I am Christine W. Chandler, creator of Sonichu, Rosechu and the city of Cwcville, VA, as drawn in my Comic Book Series. And I am a proud Lesbian Transwoman. And this is my Tumblr; an expanion [sic] of my social networking; professional; I am still a work in progress, always. :)
Chris would later replace "Tumblr" with "Twitch" in the description, though the typo for "expansion" still remains.

PROTIP:
That disclaimer to "watch your ears" in the beginning isn't a joke. This is your first and only warning.

On 16 March 2018, Chris streamed himself playing the PS4 version of Burnout Paradise Remastered. This stream is notable in that he uses a headset while playing the game; sadly, it has either a really cheap/bad microphone, or Chris is speaking way too close into it (or most likely both), because the stream had continuous moments of ear rape courtesy of him.
A full copy of the stream is currently lost, but several viewers made clips of it that are still available on Twitch, and there is a YouTube compilation of many of the said clips.

Chris screeches at weens on Twitch
On 17 April 2018, Chris streamed for the second time, not to stream a video game, but to push the sales of his Transformers toys. It would later be alleged by the Guard Dogs that he did so while under extortion by the Idea Guys. Visibly agitated, Chris vowed to stream until everything he has on stock is sold, refusing to communicate with viewers, making random-access humor (i.e. making random noises at random), and even bringing in Barb to state how dire their situation is (before commenting that she used to be more flirting when talking to him). Despite this, the stream ended early due to the howling of his dogs.
Chris sold the Amnyfest Ring during the stream and thanked its buyer for the purchase. The sale would prove to be key in the ousting of the Idea Guys.

[52 minutes of Chris playing with various toys, demanding the audience buy said toys on eBay ("You're gonna go on eBay!! You're gonna pay me $100!! And NO HATING!!"). Simultaneously, he's telling the audience he's ignoring all their comments. All the while Chris is screeching and babbling in various shrill, cartoon voices. Barb makes a brief (coerced) cameo at 32:00, where Chris interrogates her about fruit]
31:57-34:18 – Chris Interacts with Barb
Chris: I’m streaming! I’m trying to sell my Transformers toys by playing with them and showing them off, but everybody wants to see… [Chris imitates a trumpet and turns the camera.] Barbara Ann Weston, everybody! Say hello to the lovely folks out there! You’re being streamed on live Twitch network! Say some nice- say some kind, supporting words to everybody, tell them how you’re doing. How are you, Barbara Ann?
Barbara: I’m doing fine.
Chris: Hm, so what’s going on with you, huh? Everybody wants to know! You’re the big interview talk! [Chris pretends to hold a microphone and puts his hand in Barbara’s face.] Talk what’s on your mind!
Barbara: I’m wressing.
Chris: And what are you doing with yourself?
Barbara: I’m entertaining myself.
Chris: What do you like to eat?
Barbara: I like to eat fish and chicken.
Chris: Hm, do you have any favorite fruits?
Barbara: Yeah, bananas.
Chris: You enjoy those bananas?
Barbara: Yes.
Chris: And… what do you like to drink?
Barbara: I like to drink, uh, chocolate milkshake.
Chris: And what kinda milkshakes are these?
Barbara: These are, uh…
Chris: [Chris whispers to Barbara.] Meal replacement.
Barbara: … delicious.
Chris: They’re meal replacement shakes. So, any other- you wanna give some kind, supportive words to everybody, like, y’know, uh, like,
I dunno… “Y’all do well, y’all do good, learn well, be educating, everything,” that sorta thing? Give us some wisdom!
Barbara: I don’t know any right now.
Chris: Come on… [Chris touches Barbara’s forehead repeatedly.] You got a lotta wisdom in your head! What are you doing to me?
Barbara: Be smart… Act smart… That’s all.
Chris: Okay. Thank you, Bob. [Chris leans in to hug her.] Love you.
Barbara: Love you.
Chris: [Gives Barbara a smooch on her head.] Give us a hug. Gimme a hug. Show em’ a hug. Give it- come on, both arms.
Barbara: Okay, let me go.
Chris: Wait a minute. [Chris chuckles.] “Turn me loose, what?”
Barbara: I’m thirsty.
Chris: Come on. Just say it once, “turn me loose…”
Barbara: “Turn me loose, like…”
Chris: You’re supposed to say “Turn me loose, you silly goose.”
Barbara: Turn me loose, you silly goose.
Chris: [Chris lets go of Barbara.] You used to do that more flirtingly! Anyway, there you go, people! [Chris attempts to put the camera back in place.] Barbara Ann Weston Chandler, folks! That was her live on this show and you will not see her again from the livestreaming! Now, back to our feature presentation!
