Sonichu #16 is the 18th issue of the Sonichu comic series. Chris originally designated this title for the Idea Guys comic, but later changed that book's title to The Awakening of a CPU AKA The Idea Guy Corruptions (and later again to Sonichu #13), and reassigned this title to a story about Count Graduon (itself originally assigned to Sonichu 14)[1]. The single, incomplete episode in the damaged comic was about Count Graduon's origin story, titled "Count Graduon, the Mighty Warrior!", and its cover was heavily based on Sonichu #10, originally created by PandaHalo.
Despite being dated May 2017 on the cover, Chris did not mention this book publicly in that year. In February 2018, he spilled brown paint over a batch of four pages (including the cover). Chris decided to cash in on this mishap, listing a set of the pages on eBay for $100. Two minutes after he uploaded Damaged original art for sale to advertise it, the set was purchased. No progress has been made on this issue since.
This is, by a pretty wide margin, the shortest "Sonichu issue", and it's likely never been a high priority for Chris, given how it's been pushed back in the Sonichu schedule twice.
