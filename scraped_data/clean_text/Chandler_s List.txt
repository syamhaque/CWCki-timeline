The time has come to start listing out the back-talkers who have been speaking bad of Chris Chan Sonichu within up to the past decade.

Chris on his "back-talkers".[1]
"Chandler's List" is the title given to a list that Chris had created to publicly expose his "back-talkers".
The brief saga surrounding the list began on Twitter in June 2020 when Chris said he will be exposing people who "talk smack and shit behind [his] back online".[1] He started this crazy crusade a few days later by listing the usernames of the supposed wrongdoers. He continued "doxing" almost a month later, this time by posting screen-caps of a list of people consisting of weens, a-logs, white knights and enablers, plus a handful of non-Quintet artists, gamers and YouTubers, including OneyNG, who has made frequent reference to Chris and Sonichu over the years.[2] Due to the proximity of his reemergence, it is heavily theorized in Christorian and enabler communities that Jacob Sockness has a role in making the list due to him pulling a similar stunt that failed in November 2019.

"Exposing" the trolls
Chris rather abruptly introduced his plans for this list on 2 June 2020, where he (roleplaying as Sonichu), complains about how he has been trolled and deceived over the years. He also claims that he has gotten better at looking into people's intentions.
Hey, everyone. Sonichu, still here. A fated moment is upon us, as Mama and everyone else had foreseen and experienced before. Pretty much a Let-You-Know for now, but over the past couple of decades, Mama Chris Chan has been Trolled, Bullied, Blackmailed, Deceived, and all that.
No freaking surprises. But in her developing abilities, especially further developed over the past few years, she has learned from seeing into everyone’s intentions, for good, bad or indifferent, and everything else from throughout the farthest reaches of dimensions, space, and all time.
So, with that, it comes to no surprise how often people often talk smack and shit behind Mama’s back online, yet they subconsciously mostly are genuinely concerned of her present well-being, as opposed to those few who genuinely want to see her fail.
With that, she even knows, personally, of those in the online communities, in addition to and aside from the Cwcki; there are literally those amongst her favourites in the Brony Community, some of the Analysts, in particular. She has been aware of those who wish to leech off of her success and misfortunes for their own personal gains, including @DHTDillinThomas and @ItsAllSoUgly, but she has been most kind with them and their doings, as theirs were a fated event that she had to witness for herself. Even amongst other individuals, of other Planet Dolan, Sonic Fandom, Lego, and so on into all of the communities, either themselves, personally, with an online anon alias, or with the help of their mod squad (even SNT, herself, would give the person behind that a piece of her mind for talking ill of her, out loud).
But, I digress. In the days to come, while only the truest haters and bad cynicals will find chaos in their minds, but everyone will be considered and exposed. Including [
], [
], [
], and you, [
]. Even Null will be cowering before the judgment of the good deities, including Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu, herself. That is all for now.
Stay Safe, and Zap It Up. ⚡⚡⚡

Reactions
Predictably, the list had the complete opposite effect of what Chris had intended, and brought a lot more attention onto him. This had turned out to be especially true since, along with random Internet nobodies, Chris had also listed several prominent Internet personalities.
Aftermath
Ultimately, this stunt from Chris proved to be entirely counterproductive for his intended goal of "exposing" the trolls, demonstrating that Chris still has not learned what a dox is, since all this accomplished was giving the people from the Unholy Quintet more exposure - something that many of them crave. The only thing this may accomplish is Chris having to deal with more weens typing “JULAY” or “Get a Job” to be on the next list: he also called the list a dox, despite only consisting of online handles with no personally identifying information.
One more thing to note is that Chris thinks websites that follow his antics are filled with lunatics who will dox anyone he mentions. It’s also confirmed that no one on the lists has been blocked by him, meaning that he accomplished nothing.
