================================================================================

Vanessa AIM Chat 1 is the first chat between Chris and Joshua Martinez, an old acquaintance pretending to be Vanessa Hudgens. It took place on 6 April 2009.
Summary
The chat starts with Chris seemingly apologizing to Josh for slandering and smearing him on Encyclopedia Dramatica. Somehow this evolves into him talking to Vanessa and eulogizing about God helping him find Ivy and her fixing his biological clock. Vanessa gets him to submit an audition tape for an undisclosed movie, which should be 30 minutes long. Chris fails to reach even one sixth of this length when presenting the tape.
Transcript
ChrisChanSonichu (9:57:22 PM): I felt soo bad saying the things I said back then; I was in error; not totally thinking too clear. But I have seen the light from our lord, Jesus, and my vision is more clear.
ChrisChanSonichu (9:58:28 PM): Listen, there is something I feel I should inform you. A lot has changed since we last talked; I had moved on, talked to a lot of people online (a lot of which were impostorous trolls). But about a month ago, I received a call on my cell from a sweet girl, Ivy, who was a fan of my work. We've been talking a lot on the phone; a dash of e-mails too.
ChrisChanSonichu (9:59:19 PM): I have learned that she is the one I have been waiting for; the girl I was praying for. Because she has done a major task I needed a True Sweetheart for; Fix my Biological Clock.
ChrisChanSonichu (10:02:20 PM): I had been sleeping at 6AM, getting up in mid-afternoon. Then I met Ivy; she asked me to sing "I Need A Hero" from Bonnie Tyler for her in a video. So I decided to up it and make a Music Video of the project on my PS3's EyeCreate program. It's currently on YouTube if you want to see it.
I spent 3 days and 2 nights working on it; getting little sleep, because I wanted to finish it as quickly as possible, giving it a lot of thought and effort. In the process, I crashed the 2nd night at 9 PM, and...
ChrisChanSonichu (10:02:34 PM): and awaking the next morning at 6:30 AM.
ChrisChanSonichu (10:04:02 PM): A TRUE MIRACLE. And I had heard from God soon after that Ivy was to be my True Sweetheart. So I'm afraid my Romantic Ways are set for Ivy alone. But I'd like it if Vanessa and I can still be friends, Vanessa. I still care about you.
Joshua (10:04:10 PM): send me the video
