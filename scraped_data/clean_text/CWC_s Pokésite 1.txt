“
CWC's Pokesite in construction!
”
-Chris, tumbling into the abyss of 90's website clichés
The site in question.
CWC's Pokésite 1, originally referred to simply as CWC's Pokésite, was a website with news and links on Pokémon created by Christian Weston Chandler. It was Chris's first babystep towards his long career of website-making. The page was launched somewhere between 25 April 1999 (when the domain was reserved) and 3 July 1999 (when Chris got the first replies in his guestbook, from his parents).
The quality of the site was actually relatively good; judging from the source code, it appears to be based on a pre-built template from AcmeCity's "HomeBuilder", and was possibly made under adult supervision as a high school project, since one guestbook entry was left by what seems to be a teacher. Chris lost interest in the project quite soon, and by the end of July 1999, it had already been replaced by the much more amateurish-looking CWC's Pokésite 2, with its notorious hand-crafted HTML.
The actual content of the website is lost aside from three pages.[1][2][3] The site did have a Spanish translation, El PokéSite de RWC, as a dead archive link of the site exists.[4] Fortunately for those who are interested in the uselessness of Chris's high school Spanish grammar, his translation of his second Pokémon site has been preserved.
