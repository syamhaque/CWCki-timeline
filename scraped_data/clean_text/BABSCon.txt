BABSCon (Bay Area Brony Spectacular Convention) was a My Little Pony convention held every spring from 2014 to 2025 in Burlingame, California, near San Francisco. Chris has shown interest in attending this event, possibly to fill the void left by the ending of BronyCon in 2019. He also planned to sell his TSSSF cards with BABSCon vendors, a truly exciting prospect.[3] He even planned to sell promotional cards only available at BABSCon.[4] The cancellation of the 2020 event due to the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on Chris, who became "possessed" by Sonichu as a result of a supposed "body swap" between the Chris of this dimension and Sonichu in his fictional universe, a fantasy that Chris committed to for nearly an entire year, before stopping in early 2021. The 2021 convention was canceled as well due to COVID-19, further propelling Chris into his world of delusions.
With his July 2021 arrest for incest, however, Chris ultimately missed out on 2022's and 2023's BABSCons, and he has since been banned from all subsequent editions of this event.

Begging
2017:
When BABSCon offered on Twitter to let people in for free by volunteering, Chris asked BABSCon to pay for the gas to drive to California on top of it.[5]
2020:
Since, of course, Chris would have to pay for travel, accommodation, and tickets, he needed a way to accumulate some wealth without saving, since he needed to keep spending his tugboat on toys and interest, he took to e-begging on Twitter, on which he estimated that he would require $2,000-$3,000, claiming it was fated that he would go.[6] One of Chris's loyal subjects Aly Hirschberg decided to start a fundraiser[7] to help fate out a little bit. Though, unfortunately, it would seem that once again Chris's begging was ill-meaning since Chris had said on Discord[8] that he already had organized tickets and accommodations, so the $2,000-$3,000 was actually for toys and video games.
Cancellations and bans
Both the 2020 and 2021 conventions were cancelled. Chris attempted to attend the 2024 convention, but was preemptively banned.
2020
Chris looked forward to attending. He considered purchasing a Meet and Greet session with Brony celebrities DRWolf and Silver Quill for $105, inviting members of The Place to attend with him. Several The Place members tried pointing out to Chris that he need not pay for friendship, but Chris continued to entertain the possibility of DRWolf and Silver Quill taking a liking to him.[9]
However, BABSCon did not take place in 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[10] This somewhat threw Chris's precognition powers into question, as fate was not permitting him to go. Chris was initially very upset about this, and had a rant on Twitter, explaining how the pandemic is actually just a form of C-197 eugenic culling on 1218 before the merge and would be over in one or two weeks, making the cancellation of BABSCon quite silly indeed.[11] Unfortunately, Chris's precognition failed again.
Luckily, just a CWC trip through your nearest portal will take you to BABSCon in C-197. Which went off without a hitch, due to COVID having been cured already over there. It's a shame they don't share the cure with us, but they're too busy having fun and horsing around at BABSCon 2020. Chris, in fact, spent a while in CWCville to go to BABSCon, during which Sonichu inhabited Chris's body. This also had the added benefit of making Chris able to answer and enact our prayers to him since he was in C-197 with his powers.[12]
In 2020 they ran BABSCon Online - an interactive BABSCon experience on Discord, with panels and gaming tournaments, and music concerts all designed to get those bronies around the world to lift their mane-donned heads from mourning and get to "rump-shaking". They even had voice actors Claire Corlett, Peter New, Brian Drummond, and Sunni Westbrook hamming up cold-readings of people's comedic submissions.
Chris, was seemingly ungrateful for their effort, pointing out that meeting in person would have been a better idea. With that useful insight, however, he does thank the team, if in a somewhat weak way.[13]
2021
In the wake of the 2020 cancellation, the BABSCon team started preparing for and announcing BABSCon 2021, which was to take place from the 2nd to the 4th of April 2021. On 29 December 2020 they announced that they would postpone one more time to 2022. Forty-five minutes after their announcement, Chris coped with the Dimensional Merge, relaunching and announcing it is underway again.
An online BABSCon 2021 took place between the 29th and 30th of May.[14] Chris did not make any comment regarding the convention.
2024
Emails between BABSCon and Chris, on display at the convention
Ever since leaving jail, Chris wanted to visit the 2024 BABSCon, which is visible in his Twitter likes and posts. On 8 March, however, Chris got the following response from the event staff:[15]
Regarding Your Attendance at BABSCon Events
BABSCon Chairs <chairs@babscon.com> Fri, March 8, 2024 at 6:55 PM

Hi Christine,
Thank you for your interest in attending BABSCon 2024. We are sorry, but we are unable to accommodate you at our convention due to potential violations of our Code of Conduct.
As such, you are persona non grata at BABSCon 2024 and future BABSCon events, and you will not be allowed to attend. To be explicit; this is a formal notification that you are banned from BABSCon events.

I see. That is a major shame, indeed. But allow me to ask, Why is it that you all feel and see me as "persona non grata"? I have committed no crimes, and any alligations were false and false witnessed. I may have a reputation, but part of that was based upon a portion of individuals who have long misunderstood me based on content that was blackmailed or coerced from me by deceptions of those respective fakers and haters.
I am a proper member of the LGBTQIA+, identifying as a Bisexual Transwoman. And my mental detail of High-Functioning Autism has been a focus of some that makes them see me as vulnerable, yet I am not. I have made my mistakes in the past from those manipulations, but I have learned. And I have long soul searched and discovered myself. And I even have more authentic friends now who appreciate and know me better than any of those online Toxic ones could ever. And even all of you there at BABSCon could not get me, either.
I was looking for an enjoyable, peaceful weekend with my friend that would have been more than very good and beneficial. But no, you dare deny us this simple pleasure as
Pegasisters of the Brony Community.
Well, all I can say is that you are in the wrong for letting others, demons, devils and those of the Toxic Irredeemable manipulate you into not allowing someone as Light Powered, Good and Righteous as I to be amongst you.
I am disappointed, and Karma will swiftly follow you and all who attend your convention this very month and this very year.
I am very much connected with the metaphysical and everything. I wish you would open your minds, souls, auras and hearts for the Light Powered and Good, of which is obvious you all need further authentic meditations and enlightenment.
For now, until after the modern day Babylon falls, I bid you good day.
Be Safe and Well.

Following this, Chris made a social media post saying:[16]
@BABSCon is not worth a grain of salt.
⚡️💙⚡️
The email exchange has been framed and passed around during the Mare Gallery party, making for a hilarious reading.[note 1]
Notes
↑ According to Twitter user mcmiag, who uploaded a photo of the email exchange and wrote "The stories about the Mare Gallery party @ #BABSCON2024 are true. They have the babs email exchange with Chris-Chan framed. They also have a naked asian nigga laying on a table that you eat off of, like the evil rich white ppl in movies do, deadass". The Mare Gallery Twitter account replied with, "This is all fake news". Another Twitter user asked mcmiag why the frame in the photo is broken, and mcmiag replied, "It fell off the wall, thats why he was holding it to show ppl"
