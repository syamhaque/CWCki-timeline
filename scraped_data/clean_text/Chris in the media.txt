Chris and Sonichu have occasionally made it to the attention of the media spotlight, in television, newspapers, magazines, podcasts and the Internet.
Chris's legendary status as the first mainstream lolcow also catches the attention of many Internet commentators and entertainers, who would often include him and his creations from as a tongue-in-cheek cameo to a major multi-part documentary.

Richmond Times-Dispatch
Main article: It took a talking bear to give the name a young boy loves
In 1993, the Richmond Times-Dispatch newspaper ran an article detailing how Chris changed his name from "Christopher" to "Christian". This was Chris's first known appearance in media.
Sonic the Hedgehog Watch & Win Sweepstakes
Main article: Sonic the Hedgehog Watch & Win Sweepstakes
Chris's second appearance in the media was a news report in 1994 chronicling Chris's first victory, winning a contest celebrating one of the Sonic the Hedgehog cartoons.
Chris Chan in the PokéNews
Main article: Chris Chan in the PokéNews
In 1999, Chris made his third appearance in a news report on the growing success of the Pokémon Trading Card Game. He was 17 years old at the time, and he was playing Pokémon cards with kids as young as 8.
Nintendo Power Magazine
Main article: Nintendo Power Magazine
Twice, Chris has used the magazine Nintendo Power to get himself attention. First was a letter Chris wrote telling Nintendo how he used a video game to cure his fear of talking to girls. The second time detailed Chris's Animal Crossing video, though there he was known as Sonichu, not Chris.
Shojo Beat
Main article: Shojo Beat
Chris sent a letter to an anime-themed magazine that got published in its November 2005 issue. In it, he complains about JERKS taking away all the pretty boyfriend-free girls and leaving him to be a lonesome virgin. A response was published in the March 2006 issue, in which the writer instructs Chris on the error of his ways.
Daily Progress
2002
20 years old.
In December 2002, Chris wrote to his local newspaper, the Charlottesville Daily Progress, sending a letter directed to Santa Claus. Chris was 20 years old at the time. The letter was included in the paper's 7 December 2002 edition.[1]
Chris's social isolation at the time is evident from his wish that Santa would help him find a "local friend". However, he was not yet searching for a boyfriend-free girl, something he would start doing very seriously just a few months later.
Dear Santa Clause;
How's everything at the North Pole?
Are the reindeer, elves and Mrs. Clause doing O.K.?
I have a few wishes for Christmas.
First off, I would appreciate it if you would send a special present to each of the following friends and family members of mine: Mom, Dad, my cousins Madeline, her sister, Joey, Matthew, Jonathan, all my Aunts and Uncles, and my old friends: Joshua Martinez, Kellie Andes, Tiffany Gowin, Brian Savart, Sarah Bevel, and Sarah Hammer.
As for me, enclosed is a copy of a wish list that I gave to my Mom (planning to get at least 1 GameCube and/or 2 GBA games). I would like an extra Game Cube or GBA game that Mom hasn't already picked out to give to me.
Please help my family and friends and I to have a Merry Christmas (All Things Considered).
Merry Christmas,
Christian W. Chandler
P.S. Could you also find a local friend for me, or make my pokemon, Somichu, real for me. Thanks a bunch
2007
Admit it, if you've never heard of Chris before, would you think that they were actually referring to a 25-year-old man here?
On 14 July 2007, Chris and Barb were mentioned in passing in a Daily Progress article about the opening of a new thrift shop.[2]
The line began forming outside the door around 2 p.m., three hours before the SPCA's new rummage shop in Charlottesville opened for a special sneak preview Friday.
By 4:45, nearly 50 people were waiting in line, while about 30 volunteers inside put the finishing touches in place.
"I've got my eye on the riding mower right there," said Barry Ross as he stood at the head of the line, looking through the window at a red tractor.
And right behind Ross, Christian and Barbara Chandler were waiting to shop. Christian wanted toys and video games, while his mother wanted to look for fabric.
2017

A decade later, on 16 September 2017, Chris was photographed by Daily Progress staff at a Cville Pride event.[3]
2021
Chris would make the pages of the Daily Progress yet again on 2 August 2021, this time in connection with his arrest for incest.[4]
Toucher and Rich
Main article: Toucher and Rich Segment
On 12 May 2009 Chris's antics became so famous that it sparked the interest of a radio podcast in Boston. The whole media furor was sparked by the "I Got A Fish" video. However, most of the show covered Chris's videos addressed to Ivy.[5]
Kevin and Bean
Main article: The Kevin and Bean Show Segment
One of Chris's Captain's Logs is dissected by the hosts Kevin and Bean. Notably, the video in question required a full two minutes dedicated to disclaimers, as well as censoring of certain unairable acts.
Web Soup
Main article: For G4s Web Soup
Once again, Chris's "I Got A Fish" video was briefly featured, this time on G4's Web Soup on 2 July 2009. While the segment lasted less than 30 seconds, Chris initially felt honored and used the opportunity to try to score some china, only to belatedly realize after he uploaded an entire video about it that shows like Web Soup are devoted to mocking people like him.
Save McIntire Park
Main article: McIntire Park
In July 2009, Chris briefly appears in the background of a news segment about saving McIntire Park, Charlottesville. Later, Chris receives recognition at a council meeting for drawing a large sign.
Slylock Fox
If you didn't know who Chris was, would you think anything of this?
On 25 September 2011, Slylock Fox & Comics for Kids, a comic strip about comic strips published by King Features Syndicate, featured a black-and-white image[6] of Sonichu in the "Your Drawing" panel. The illustration, which ran in thousands of papers nationwide, was accompanied by text, which read: "Today's terrific artist is Christian Weston Chandler, Age 9." The strip's author, Bob Weber Jr., admitted on the Comics Curmudgeon blog[7] that he fully believed that the "artist" was 9 (rather than 29) when he selected the drawing out of the dozens that are submitted to the strip every week.
Opie & Anthony
Main article: Opie and Anthony
On 27 May 2009, The Opie & Anthony Show on Sirius XM Radio, which was broadcast to 18.5 million units, did a commentary segment on Chris's video response to drinking his own cum and shitting his adult diapers. It is unknown whether he's realized that his autistic antics have technically been broadcast to low earth orbit.
Houston Press
On 12 July 2012, the Houston Press published an article on Rex Nabours III of defunct folk punk band Guwange and his attempts to raise money for sick children. Nabours was quoted in the article saying "I did a Christian Weston Chandler (the Sonichu guy) covers album earlier this year with the intent of giving any money I made off of it to Autism-related charities because the dude is basically blackface for autism".[8]
Failosophy
Featured pic
MTV's show Failosophy mocked Internet idiots like Chris. While the show lasted a mere 3 months due to negative reception, one of his Tomgirl pics memorably and unsurprisingly showed up in the 4th episode of the show, viewed by almost a million people. Jump to 1:22 for his appearance.

Chris, unusually, gave a response via Facebook.
I had no ill will against MTV. I enjoyed the women in "Undressed"; I like Daria; the dating game show was fun to watch, and to put them way at the bottom, Beavis and Butt-Head were so stupid, it became crazy-funny.
I have been the victim of Trolling/Cyber-Bullying for the past greater than five years. I get that whatever gets onto the internet is near impossible to remove.
And now I find that among the shit I was trolled of, this ONE photograph, which was originally taken for a WOMAN years ago, gets compared with a literal meat-head and a plush-head, and is made available on iTunes for two dollars!
From the one woman's words, Jamie Lee... I don't know what is worse, that she would not date me, or that she would put me in jail over a freaking couch. Lee, My Once Good Name was actually Jailed, because of the SET UPS those Anonymous, LULZy, Shit-Faced TROLLS. At least I was more clean, sexy and gung-ho than either of the ugly, grimy freak shows I was compared with.
If I did not have a very good day beforehand today, I would seriously be calling my Attorney on your damn show's ass.
He provided more thoughts on the scene in LoveYouLongTime E-mails, 2013-2014:
On the flipside and current topic, I had just learned last night from a random check on the Troll forum about "Failosophy" and their highlighting a photo of myself that was Trolled from me by Jacklyn the years ago.
*Spoiler Alert*. Jamie Lee would not date me, and she would jail me over the "ugly couch". The episode is online at MTV.com, and it is available for sale in SD and HD on iTunes. I am feeling really pissed off about this. I have alerted Rob Bell about it, and pray that Suing MTV or the "Failosophy" cast is a doable option. Nobody asked for my permission or made me sign a waiver.
I am feeling in between the good of my day yesterday, and the bad of Failosophy, so I am off and on on feeling good and bad right now.
Chris reached out to the show's host, Hasan Minhaj, to complain. Minhaj responded, saying that he had been told all the people whose photos were featured on the show had provided consent and apologized if that was not the case for Chris:
Yes, I agree the photo is definitely one of my better ones, among all of the rest similarly nude pics and videos. :( The White MALE was the one who used the word "marriage". UGH! And worse, the woman would not only Not Date me, but have me thrown in jail over a couch that my Aunt Harriet gave to me years ago. And not only is it a couch, but it is also a fold-out bed.
I have not yet heard a reply from Rob, but I will call him later today, and let him know about the emails, since there is the chance he was too busy to check.
And there is a small, possible light towards a resolution. I have found contact with the host of "Failosophy", Hasan Minhaj, on facebook, from the "Failosophy" page's about section. http://ww.facebook.com/pages/Hasan-Minhaj/41284651271 I have contacted Hasan with the following:
Hello. I was just made aware of your show on MTV, "Failosophy", when I had heard that a photograph, that I had taken myself, for a woman, fell into the possession of Internet Trolls/Cyber-Bullies, was featured and mocked on your show in the fourth episode alongside two old men with bacon and plushies. I have already been trolled and bullied for over five difficult years. What you are doing on your show is Promoting Trolling, and Trolling is Bullying. Not a lot of people take kindly to Bullying, and I do not take kindly to Trolling.
Tell your crew and crap-filled producers that for Promoting Trolling, you all will Pay unto everyone you have further emotionally damaged and embarrassed on television.
I am not a fan of "Failosophy", and I despise your kind of people continuing to Troll for the LULZ.
Sincerely,
Christian Weston Chandler,
Ruckersville, VA, USA.
He swiftly replied:
Thank for being in touch. That wasn't my intention at all. I agree that trolling is just a digital form of bullying. I was told that all the photos on the show have been signed off as ok to be used on air from the original owners/people who took the photos. I'm only ok with doing these jokes as long as the people who took them are in on the joke as well. If that didn't happen with your photo I am truly very sorry. Please accept my apology because that wasn't my intention at all. If there's anything I can do please let me know.
Best,
Hasan
I then replied requesting his more direct contact info, offering my email address and iPhone number, and that I would think it over and consult with my people (Rob Bell). I sincerely think there is a chance of a legal lawsuit, with a settlement. But those details are being discussed between me and Rob at the moment. But according to Hassan's reply, the photos do need to be signed off as ok for airing, FROM the Original Owners/People who Took Them. I took the photo myself, and was not informed beforehand, so chances should be fair to good.
I just have to wait and see what Rob says.
To this day, Chris has not followed up on this threat of legal action. The episode with Chris in it also remains available on iTunes.
OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes
The original storyboard initially made the reference more blatant
In the pilot episode "Lakewood Plaza Turbo", Carol tells her son K.O. to defend the plaza "to the extreme", a direct reference to the cover of Sonichu #0. This was confirmed by the show's creator, Ian Jones-Quartey, who shared the original storyboard, where it was "even more blatant".
K.O. was originally meant to finish the quote, saying "I will! Thank you mother!" It should also be noted that the person who discovered the reference, Parker Simmons, is also the creator of Mao Mao: Heroes of Pure Heart.[9]

New York Magazine
On 19 July 2016, New York magazine featured an article on its website, "Kiwi Farms, the Web's Biggest Community of Stalkers". The article was meant as an attack on Kiwi Farms, inaccurately describing it as a vague group across multiple websites instead a single forum community. However, in describing the site's origins and operations, it largely focuses on Chris himself and the "torment" he faced from trolls during his internet heyday. There is also a mention of A-Log and his fallout with other Christorians.
The article is notably one of the few pieces of positive press Chris has received since his rise to internet fame. In addition to attacking his trolls, the author, Margaret Pless, describes him in sympathetic terms such as "artist, gamer, and creative type" and fails to mention his horrific opinions, statements, or actions. Pless is also under the impression that Chris is legitimately transgender, and accordingly refers to him as "Christine" and with female pronouns.
Sonic Boom
Chris finally meets his hero.
On 10 December 2016, an episode of Sonic Boom called "The Biggest Fan" premiered on Cartoon Network. The episode features a character named Mark the Tapir that parodies the Sonic fanbase. Mark is depicted in the episode as a creepy, obsessive stalker who kidnaps Sonic and forces him to act out fanfiction that he wrote. While the character is likely intended as a general parody, he has many similarities to Chris in particular. He closely resembles pre-tomgirl Chris, and one scene seems to reference the "blue arms" debacle. Mark even orders an orange soda during one scene, though this is probably an unintentional reference.
Chris acknowledged the parody on December 13, 2016. He stated that he saw no resemblance between himself and the Mark character, and that he is "not mental or crazy like that at all."
The episode's writers, Doug Liebilch and Bill Freiberger, responded to questions on Twitter about the episode. Liebilch said that "He's not based on anyone specific. Just an obsessive fan character." Freiberger also denied that Mark was based on Chris, and unlike Liebilch, he knows who Chris is, stating "Mark is 100% NOT based on CWC.
He is a general fan type. We've done many blue arm jokes in the series. Not a clue."[10]

Sonichu makes a cameo in dodie's music video for "Monster", around the 45-second mark. He appears on a poster as one of the many monsters looking for love. The text on the poster (though partially covered by others) appears to say that he is "Looking for a boyfriend-free monster", indicating some familiarity with Chris's antics.

Paradise PD
In the Paradise PD episode "Top Cops" (12 March 2021), an image of Sonichu's head can be seen on the back of a fake Pokémon card. This was confirmed in a now deleted tweet by animator Perry Hull, who added it as an Easter egg after learning about Chris by watching Chris-Chan: A Comprehensive History. [13]
Nowhere Land
Nowhere Land album cover
The album 'Nowhere Land' by Jordan Owen is an 18-song long concept album, which acts as a dramatic retelling of Chris's life. The many songs include "Holding up to Dark", a song told from the perspective of Megan Schroeder; "Feed Us, Freak Boy", told from the perspective of the trolls; "Echoes Shaped Like You", a song about Bob's death; "It Was All a Dream", a song about Chris realising his high-school gal-pals were fake all along. The final 5 songs are all about Chris's affair with Barb.
"Weird Al" Yankovic
In July 2024, the music video for 'Polkamania' by "Weird Al" Yankovic features a brief 0.6 second cameo of a man with a Sonichu Medallion and a Sonichu Amiibo at its 3:01 mark. It is currently unknown if Al approved or sanctioned this easter egg.

Proposed media roles
Smiling Friends
Main article: Smiling Friends
In an interview with The Create Unknown podcast, Zach Hadel and Michael Cusack, showrunners of Adult Swim cartoon Smiling Friends, revealed that they had planned for Chris to be offered a voice cameo in an episode of the show. Chris was to voice the grease puddle in a brief one-off role in the episode "Who Violently Murdered Simon S. Salty?". However, contractual issues at the studio - which would have forced them to cast him in multiple episodes - cancelled their plans to offer Chris the role.[14][15] Later on in the season 3 premiere, they referenced a line from Bob Chandler in THAT IS MY HOUSE.
What would have been released had Chris not did it with his mother.

There could be no other choice to close out this list. Christian Weston Chandler, aka Chris-Chan, is like every horrible thing about the Internet made flesh. Lives with his parents, sponges off the government and uses the cash for PlayStation 3 games and sex toys, walks around the mall with his Game Boy looking for girlfriends, posts incoherent YouTube videos of himself humping an anime bodypillow and yelling “Oh, Julie,” the list will go on forever. C.W.C. is the ne plus ultra of Web losers.

“
It’s a little sad, and a little beautiful, and somewhere out there, Christian Weston Chandler is heating up his Hungry Man lunch in a supermarket microwave (because his kitchen microwave has been buried under old Christmas decorations) and playing his Nintendo DS, and maybe ogling a salesgirl from across the produce section before he approaches her awkwardly and uses a pickup line that he misread from the Internet, and I wish I could continue to see it all.

The website Wii U Daily (now known as Nintendo Today) has an article on the GameStop incident that occurred on 26 December 2014.[29] Chris eventually found the article, then proceeded to go on a long rambling on Facebook on why the writer should respect him and his terrible ways--even going as far to call the writer a horrible male, despite the writer being female.
Reddit
Main article: Reddit
There is an entire subreddit on the popular website Reddit entitled "r/chrischansonichu", which is predictably all about Chris and his shenanigans. However, it's marked as NSFW, making it difficult to find.
On 23 September 2014, the subreddit r/shittykickstarters linked to Chris's Kickstarter project for getting Legos.
On 1 January 2015, the Wii U Daily article about the 26 December 2014 incident was linked to another subreddit, r/rage.[30]
On 1 September 2016, a post that promised a new Chris story every day of the following month was submitted to the now-defunct r/CringeAnarchy subreddit.[31]
The subreddit's background image was replaced accordingly with the classic picture of Chris staring creepily into the void.
Design & Trend
On 30 December 2014, the defunct website Design & Trend also posted an article about the 26 December 2014 incident.[32] The article link was apparently tweeted 15 times, according to the website.
Sonic the Hedgehog Twitter
On June 10, 2015, a fan asked the official Twitter account of Sonic the Hedgehog (which has been verified and everything) if Sonichu will be playable in Sonic Boom: Fire & Ice.[33] Their response?
“
Maybe, but only if we give Sonichu blue arms, three scarves, and ultimately just redesign him as Big the Cat.
”
Two later posts also made minor mentions of Sonichu. The first was on March 9, 2016, in which Dr. Eggman attempts to cancel getting "Big the Cat facts" on his phone by texting his favorite Sonic character, but is told that his favorite Sonic character is Sonichu.[34] The second was April 29, 2016, where "Sonichu" is one possible name on a "What's Your Sonic Name" chart making fun of the "original characters" in the Sonic fandom.[35]
Crave Online Australia
Cosplayers as Christian and Sonichu at Supanova Sydney in 2015
Crave Online, a website showcasing various video coverage from games, films, sports, and others topics covered a convention in Australia called Supanova in 2015. A duo cosplayed as Chris and Sonichu, making a brief reference to Nintendo rejecting Chris's game proposal.[36]
The Jimquisition
In his review of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 3D for the 3DS, Jim Sterling gives a list of reasons why the original Sonic 2 was an all-time classic. In this list, Jim mentions that the game is "a great way to meet boyfriend-free girls," and also makes reference to the blue arms controversy.[37]
Gawker
On 5 May 2016, controversial gossip website Gawker wrote about deleted Wikipedia articles, including Sonichu.[38]
Return of Kings
Chris has an article and is commonly used as an example of an "omega" on the Kings Wiki, the wiki of the controversial neo-masculinity group Return of Kings.[39]

German-American ranter Zip Zap made a slight nod to Chris Chan when comparing a pedophile named Manglenn to him, even adding "at least [Manglenn] doesn't recycle his own semen... not from what we know".
Milo Yiannopoulos
On 20 January 2017, former editor of Breitbart News Milo Yiannopoulos spoke at the University of Washington. The event, called Cyberbullying Isn't Real, contained a segment where Milo comments on how George H. W. Bush, a World War II torpedo bomber pilot and the head of the CIA, was considered a wimp when he ran for president.[40] Milo then poses the question:
“
What will happen when we have the first presidential campaign featuring a genderqueer furry who has videos of himself crying on YouTube because someone insulted his My Little Pony drawings? We know, don't we, what the first social justice president will look like.
”
Milo Yiannopoulos, exhibiting a photo of Chris
A picture of Chris is then featured on the screen to illustrate Milo's point. Although there were no specific allusions to Chris, Milo gives an eerily accurate description of Chris's internet infamy, seemingly derived solely from the photo itself. Jump to 1:13:20 in the link.

Chris found the video on 20 March 2021 and left the following comment:
“
I have just learned of this particular presentation which saw me in comparison with George Bush, Sr., and dubbed in comparison with what the first social justice president would look like.
I feel partially humbled and honored to have been placed in such a pedestal, despite it also likely being a jab at my person like on MTV years before.
I am very well aware of the irony, potential mockery, and likely praise of this situation.
However, regardless, I am one who counts their blessings moreso over the negatives.
With that said, Milo Yiannopoulos, I am humbled by this past moment.
Thank you for featuring me in your presentation.
😊
I offer kind blessings and prayers to you.
⚡️💙⚡️
Be safe and well, you and yours.
”
Kotaku
In the Kotaku article What People Miss When They Use 'Autistic' As An Insult, writer Cecilia D'Anastasio points to Chris and Sonichu, along with the actions of trolls on 4chan and Encyclopedia Dramatica, as part of the reason "autism came to be associated with impassioned gamers." The article seemed sympathetic to Chris, though Cecilia acknowledged in a comment that many of his views are offensive and that she does not endorse them, but also claimed that "[Chris's] personal beliefs are not entirely relevant to my article’s main themes".
IGN
In a video by IGN, James Marsden, the actor playing Tom Wachowski in the Sonic movie is quizzed on his knowledge of Sonic trivia. One of the questions asked is if Sonichu is an unlockable character in Sonic Forces. Marsden guessed incorrectly.

Later that day, one of his Twitter posts was featured in an article by Alex Jones's Infowars website. The article was linked to on the Drudge Report. David Duke, former member of Louisiana's State Representatives and former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, tweeted the article. Chris himself tweeted the article on 10 November.
Daniel "Keemstar" Keem, host of the drama YouTube account Drama Alert, tweeted at Chris and alerted the Secret Service.
Sky Williams, a YouTube gamer with nearly a million subscribers, retweeted Chris's post and added the comment, "k so this shit isn't okay - can we report this?".

Incest charge
On 1 August 2021, Chris was arrested and charged with engaging in incest with his mother. Multiple media outlets reported on it.
Daily Mail
The Daily Mail reported on Chris' incest charges on 3 August 2021.[51]
Dnes
Bulgarian tabloid Dnes reported on Chris' incest charges on 5 August 2021. The article refers to him with his former male name and uses masculine pronouns to refer to him throughout, also describing him as mentally ill.[52]
Insider
The Insider reported on Chris' incest charges on 6 August 2021. Unlike other articles, the article seems well-educated and examines the history of Chris Chan back to 2007. Of note is that it includes the quote from Chris in 2016 saying he had dreams of fucking his mother.[53]
CBS-19
The local CBS-19 of Charlottesville posted a news item covering the story, quoting a news release from the Greene County Sheriff. The article noted that Chris was charged with incest and held without bond and that additional charges were pending.[54]

Newsweek
Newsweek posted an article, "Chris Chan Arrested for Incest in Virginia", quoting the Henrico County Sheriff, who stated that they were merely holding Chris until he could be transferred to Greene County. The article appears to have been partially created by bots, given the odd syntax used in places.[55]
Fox News' Tucker Carlson Tonight
On 7 August 2021, Chris's incest case was discussed by Fox News political commentator Tucker Carlson. Tucker spread misinformation that Chris was going to be sent to a jail for female inmates (the jail Chris was sent to, Central Virginia Regional Jail, is mixed-gender). Tucker references Chris's incest charge and his 79-year-old mother's rumored dementia while images of a deranged-looking Chris from recent YouTube videos appear on the screen. The segment then goes on to talk about crimes of MtF transgender inmates in women's prisons. Carlson refers to Chris as "Chris Chan" and simply "Chan", seemingly believing that "Chan" is his legal surname. He also calls Chris a "YouTube personality".

"Fake news"
Chris Jail Escape Hoax
Following a 4chan post falsely claiming Chris escaped from prison going viral on 28 August 2022, several outlets, most notable The Daily Dot[56] and USA Today[57] published articles debunking the claim, citing confirmations from Central Virginia Regional Jail and Chris's lawyer David Heilberg.
Pregnancy rumor
After Kiwi Farms spread misinformation and misleading captions about a clip from a November 2024 livestream, the rumor that Chris was having a child and that Flutter was pregnant went trending on Twitter. This lead to some outlets reporting on the baseless claims, most notably The Times of India[58] and The Daily Mail.[59] The rumor became so widespread that Chris felt the need to release a statement denying it:
Okay, all of this is starting to get out of control now. There is no pregnancy; I was speaking hypothetically in that live stream. I am so surprised how even when I say something hypothetical, it gets misunderstood. Thank you for your kindness.
I reiterate: there is no pregnancy with anyone.[60]
Video Games
McPixel

OK K.O.! Lakewood Plaza Turbo
An iOS/Android beat-'em-up based on the pilot of the Cartoon Network Show, OK K.O.! Let's be Heroes introduces certain characters with a short biography screen (including a quote). The one for Carol (the player character's mother) has her saying "Go out and defend our Plaza – to the extreme!" (clearly echoing the cover to Sonichu #0 and the pilot episode).
Worth noting is that OK K.O.! is intended for general audiences.
Heartbeat
