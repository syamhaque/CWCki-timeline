I have just realized something.
Now, I do not get internet culture or online celebrity references, clearly. But I have come to realize that a lot of media, these days, have such references within them.
Also, the way they and others are compiled,...
...it is like they have been composed by someone with serious Attention Deficit Disorder or mental handicap. Which, on the one hand, I support since it is allowing them to express their creativity as best they can. Yet on the other hand, it can be just all over the place and jumbled, sometimes.
The shows I like and have grown up with, even the "Saturday Morning" cartoons, they actually have substance, focus, clarity and quality in them.
But, while a show like #SmilingFriends can be seen as funny due to its wackiness, you have individuals/characters who talk faster than...
...the individuals in #DisasterousLifeOfSaikiK. Unless you are Excellent at Japanese listening, it's just hard to comprehend or keep up sometimes.
I'm going off-tangent, sure, but I feel like it emphasizes my point.
The better focus and quality is shown in #MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic...
...and #EquestriaGirls marks it as one of the finest examples of a good quality series. It's more grounded and focused with the love, care and soul put into it.
Point is: there are too many examples of "Random Access Memory" zaniness when there should be more focus, clarity and soul.
I'll even throw in that AI does not get that, sometimes, with the literal crap and too-many fingered media it gives.
If there were more quality media from us all of both halves of this very Earth than the incomprehensible, even AI could do better, and the rest of us would actually be thinking...
...and doing a lot better.
What young generation do we have right now that is finding their formative years watching a bunch of worse incomprehensible crap (created and generated) media all over YouTube.
Do you want to give the future generations more of the random "I got a fish, would you like to make a wish" crap, OR do you want to do something better than that?
Me, personally, I prefer Quality, Clarity and Insight that makes everyone think and...
...inspired to soul search and find themselves, so they're actually doing something instead of mimicking a low-functioning individual because it's funny for the "LULZ".
AND, if your individual takeaway from my think piece is "Hee Hee Hee. LULZ... LOLCOW..." then, Damn, do I feel sorry and pity for you.
WAKE UP!!! Stop being blank minded in survivor and observation mentality.

Transformers Reviews Approval Poll
3 November
10:17 AM
Posted to Chris's Twitter.
I've been wondering with my series of Transformer Review videos, how many of all of you actually like the videos, including the intros, review and/or ending movies, as opposed to liking them ironically and not liking them.
Please, comment your favourite moments below. ⚡️💙⚡️
I Actually like them 😃
I like them, ironically 🙂
I don't like them ☹️
The poll was open for 7 days. Unsurprisingly, "I don't like them ☹️" won with 64% of the votes.
Next full Light Powered Review video debuts November 14, 2025, and we have more vids and content planned out and conceptualized. ⚡️💙⚡️

The next full Light Powered Review video was actually released on 7 November 2025, however Chris did upload one on the 14th.
Chris is the Avatar, Bob's last words
4 November
10:49 AM
Posted to Chris's Bluesky.
An FAQ I often hear time and again:
"If you're the Avatar, why aren't you preaching more often?"
⚡️💙⚡️
Let's look at Jesus's developing life before he got into a church. He was a kid and a teenager; had to find himself in his own soul searching before he could really wake up to his calling.
Obviously, the gospels don't really go much into those details, with the exception of him encountering a devil and being tempted three times by them and resisting.
I've actually had a similar vision, once upon a time in a dream; told them "No". That was decades ago.
And like some of you, I was an incels; trapped under a metaphorical Master Poké Ball that was the old house/Temple in Ruckersville. How can one really soul search for themselves if they're not free to go out or be encouraged to think for themselves? Instead of often being crammed...
...in front of a TV or computer monitor, like an Otaku or similar.
AND in that constant decades long fog, as well as the fog of people's various comments online, I felt overwhelmed. When one is feeling overwhelmed, it is harder for them to think for themselves or soul search.
My Sweetheart Search, once upon a time, could be very well considered one attempt at my own soul searching under a disguise of finding someone to be my partner so soon. Yet, that was a wish that took a long time to finally manifest.
Regardless, I was long overdue to disconnect from society...
...and meditate and think, finding my connections with everything metaphysical and beyond, including meeting the various Gods and Goddesses, themselves.
My dad, Mr. Robert Franklin Chandler, Jr., was right in his last words to me:...
..."All around the world, everyone prays to their own God, but they are all praying to the same God."
This was, indeed, true. Pick a God, like from Greece, China or Japan; they do exist individually, but they all work under the one God of many names: Emanuel, Allah, and so on.
Obviously, I've met them. Time and again, I've repented for the mistakes I've made over the years, including how much of a jerk I was online.
As opposed to Jesus who was able to find himself more quickly, it took me longer. Not only did I need to disconnect,...
...but I also needed to really see myself as I was in a big mirror only I could reflect and resonate from.
The Dimension Merge is real, and it is completing. You all of little faith can hold your tongues and peace. I see the signs, every day.
I have and have had many a dejá vu momento from a portion of the numerous dreams and visions I've had over the decades.
Now that I've spoken the preface that may be esoteric to a lot of you, here is why I haven't preached, in your way, as much.
I Have been preaching from time to time in every video and thought I've uploaded or posted. It's not formal like a pastor, but it is so. I'm still consiously waking up and finding the paths, even when I work metaphysically, in and outside of my (human form) body. Isn't that just Prime?
But, yeah, I'm preaching in bits as they are meant to be told in divine timing. So, take the pieces I've said in the past couple of years, In Context, meditate and Think on that in your cosmos connections, respectively.
That is all for now in this divinely timed moment.

ChatGPT perspective
10 November
1:13 AM
Posted to Chris's Bluesky.
Hey, everyone. Just a little think piece for now.
I have bit by bit become more understanding of the internet culture and how it has affected me, as well as how it has become a reflection of a Lot of people, including the naive and younger ones.
I even asked #ChatGPT for a neutral perspective.
I have also become aware of how I am helping shape online behaviour at around a point of popularity and infancy of the social media. I feel okay and humbled with this story being used as a basis to set better standards on the internet.
Another part that I have realized is that over the years, the online trolls were trying to reinvent me due to their misconception of me being a Meme and not a Person/Individual, when I clearly am and have been a Person/Individual. The goal should be Restoration.
I still feel off with socializing online, and I have a somewhat easier time socializing in person or offline. Also, I appreciate the simple Q&As, and I like talking about metaphysical details, but with my scars, I feel hesitant when asked something about the events on the C-197 half of Earth,...
...because of the mixed reception and the inability to tell genuine want to know as opposed to curiosity or voyeurism type of mindset. I'm still a work in progress, but at least I know who and what I am moreso these days.
Without over sharing, I feel offering authentic kindness is encouraged.⚡️💙⚡️

Covid repeat
10 November
10:51 AM
Posted to Chris's Bluesky.
Hey. I'm only putting this up for everyone's reference.
So, the past couple of nights, rough sleep. Then the sample smell clued me into a likely Covid repeat.
In my experience, and I'll accept help in identifying the type it is, the first two or three nights, I feel a great energy surge...
...exhuming out from my Core area, identified as vertically right between the Solar Plexus and Heart Chara points. I can't fall asleep for an hour or two, then in these initial days, I remain functional. Yet, this time, I also felt caffeine-like crashes, so avoided caffeine, if you're...
...going through this. I feel the near death experience. In my imagination, I'm in a white void, considerably either the Heaven Realm, or the Core and Matrix of this very Universe, or even the Alpha/Omega Point of all existence. I get assurance and healing from the Gods, Goddesses, Angels and...
...Archangels, and I take the time to ground and remind myself of who and what I am and what I am to do. Even get some divine guidance, as well.
Right now, though, considerably a first, but it'll go away, I'm certain, but my tongue feels a bit weird on the top, the taste is similar to blood,...
...but there is none. Just bit into a strawberry creme pie; I still taste the strawberry and creme, no problem.
Anyway, all I need to is focus in telling me antibodies and white blood cells to target the virus in my Core and esophagus areas and not leave any virus cell living.
I keep on this focus and mindset in conscious meditation and prayer, and about three to five days later, I'm fully recovered.
But suffice to say, this s*** is a real b****, and as I have said earlier, Covid was a test at the start in humanity's evolution process.
It is sad to lose everyone who didn't survive. And that first year was in a Zodiac Rat year, so take that going forward, everyone: Year of the Rat; brace yourself for another level in our evolution where we are tested.
Anyway, I shall recover. Thank you.

Thought piece
13 November
12:07 PM
Posted to Chris's Bluesky.
I also offer a thought piece:
People often can feel overwhelmed when extensively in someone else's company for too long, and then find some solace when alone. That happens too often due to children, and even post high school graduate young adults, being around their parents.
The simple and direct answer is thus:
On the one hand, you have their personalities and habits to worry over and be aware of, which can block your sense of self. And on the other hand, the Soul Links and Bonding; the mix of energies and auras can shutter your own, resulting in not finding yourself.
The answer is always obvious and clear, and it should have been to me for a decade or two: go outside, explore and find yourself in nature and what intuitively guides you in the moments. Moving out of your parent's house, if possible, is recommended.
It still stands that one should honor their...
...parent(s) or legal guardian(s), but your own (spiritual) self care is important as well.
Also, do Not get on anything like Paxil or similar. I stopped taking fluoxetine about a year ago; I am finding and feeling my emotions and self more clearly these days. I've been on that s*** for decades.
I realized I was a more often with the flow and rather emotionally lacking while on that stuff. Too much serotonin really can do bad for your brain. I was dumb in continuing with the meds, and I wish I had stopped a lot sooner. Live and Learn.
Never let your kids take that s*** either, period.

#NoToPaxil
14 November
1:17 PM
Posted to Chris's Bluesky.
Hey, y'all.
Another thought piece on what I talked about recently. Call it an existential crisis, If you want, but I'm further realizing how I missed out on a lot under that Paxil influence for too long.
"Maybe if you'd move out sooner..."; It should be "Maybe if you stopped the Paxil..."
I realized in alternate timelines where we never asked for more refills of the Paxil after the initial prescription run, OR if I had Never been prescribed Paxil, Not only would I have not felt emotionally or mentally held back, but I'd be more well-spoken and actually have Felt more when I spoke.
Not gonna go into over sharing, but, apparently, as I have just been informed, I still had stopped speaking at 1.5 years old, but I started speaking again while I was. 5 Years Old; not 7; Five. So, update the Cwcki with that number.
I started speech therapy in 1987 between UVA and JMU.
The Paxil came into play in 1989; originally prescribed to address anxiety; That keyword I still remember. Until another better recall of the event comes in, I don't know the other reasons, outside of pharmaceuticals wanting to sell that s***.
Now, I'm expressing all of this, because Everyone should know and realize from someone's personal experience with extensive use.
So, of you're still taking Paxil, Paroxetine, Fluoxitine or similar, Trash them, right now, and never take them again. And tell this to all of your friends, allies...
...and families, and have them tell their friends, allies and families as well. And never even think about giving that shit to your children or anyone else.
As for I and the rest of you who have been taking Paxil or similar, by direct prescription, ask yourselves why did you start taking it? Being dumb as a child is an acceptable answer.
We (likely) did not know better and we're going with the flow of events out of our need and/or survival at the time.
If we were more mentally sound, or had known about this and actually were able to think about it, we could have passed that one test of resistance.
But, yeah, from at least my perspective, I let myself take it, because I was dumb, but I also felt insecure and obligated. I didn't pass that test.
But that does not mean no one else has to fail in that or similar moments. It is also the responsibility of the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) to know about things like these, so they would never do their children wrong like that, even those with mental or emotional handicaps.

I have a big question. I now we're all confused about something in our lives, I think, because medications depend on genetic factors and emotions. I'm not a doctor or an internet troll, I'm just saying.Certain things in experiences

Sometimes, yes. But for a lot, certain meds are meant to be for short term, because of negative side effects from longer term use. Look it up.

there's new footage to cover the additional set of lyrics, for one. Second, I realized I have one more segment to record and add, which will be worth the wait. And now all of you get to enjoy a bit of the newer footage being added. Son-Chu's GE mission will also be recorded; look forward to it. ⚡️💙⚡️

I like and appreciate the positive and constructive commentary from everyone for the videos and content I've made.
Although, I'd still like to find, rather it be from the intros of the review videos or the ending movies, and then some, what y'all liked.

I know the humor is sometimes esoteric, the old-man voiced First Punislav, in itself is a hoot, my humor is comparable to a Saturday morning cartoon, and the references are in there, as well, but it remains something good and fun that I had a good time putting together.
I am still working more with the #TransformersLegacyUnitedMerged videos. And I am looking forward to sharing the remaining new content I have in mind with all of you and everyone in the @Transformers and #Gobots community.
I recommend not making a "Watch and React" video of the set of review videos, yet. Wait for the full movie with the ending videos, and then some. There is still Son-Chu going back to the @GeneralElectric plant to foil the material theft that happened during the volcano events. ⚡️💙⚡️

Responding to comparisons of Trump and Chris
20 November
8:58 AM
Posted to Chris's Bluesky and Twitter simultaneously.
Hey, y'all.
I felt like I wanted to talk a bit about this, but I am aware of the comparisons between me and #DonaldTrump, in particular the way we phrase what we say and the ego. But there is a greater difference between him and I.
Even #ChatGPT recognizes this in its analysis.
With me, I am more emotionally open and blunt with raw honesty without filter or real bad intentions.
And Trump, he's a businessman; keeps it simple and repetitive, moreso than someone like who Jimmy McGill, a.k.a. Saul Goodman, portrays.
And I speak not only from emotions, but from my own personal experiences from my own interdimensional travels, and my inner self-explorations and realizations.
Point is, while Trump and I may speak similarly, he and I are still literal polar opposites.
I'll still add, though, that with "fanfics" like "A Girl Who Brought Down the World", in the warping of my personality and intentions, even as Christine Chan was portrayed in my books, you all, essentially, called how Trump would be as a president; y'all Manifested This. Manifested like a ritual.
And the voting between both of the inconsistent terms makes that even more apparent.
Maybe have a hard look at yourselves, as I have also, in my own astronomically unique way, have reflected you all and the subcultures that ended up spiraling quite a bit at my expense.
Yet I'm so unique, myself.

In Sonichu comics, you can make Sonichu or Rosechu president of the US, like an election scenario. If Chris Chan were president of the US, I'd vote for him.
Chris
Well, that's not really possible, and it never happened on the C-197 half. She was mayor of Cwcville, yes, but once she, formerly he at the time, had time traveled forward to around 2024, she saw what was to become of Me, as opposed to her. And that is on top of bringing back the vaccine and...
...preventing Covid from happening, at all.
With this personal knowledge and insight, she realized she was meant to be more than just a superpowerful Mayor of a prominent and integral city, but a literal Demigod, compared to me on a higher level than her.
Demigod or God, would either be fit to be a simple country leader when they take the whole world, universe and timeline under consideration?
No, not quite. Through the (immortal) vessel(s) of avatars and the one Avatar, they tend to act independently. Not tied down by a single government,...
...acting on Divine Timing, insight, intuition and wisdom that goes as far as the very Timeline's Core and Matrix, if not the Alpha/Omega Point of all existence. They all have the harder time conforming when they respectively and individually know better, deeply.
Similar to me, we act on intuition wherever we go. If we love with our destined partners, then we do. If we cause a riot to make a massive change to the timeline, we do. If we just make a great shift by physically being at a set location at the right moment, then we do.
I speak from personal experience of being in the divinely timed places and moments and making the shift. The numerous moments of Dejá Vu further confirm that right paths.
There are times we have to go with the flow to restore order, but we each have our own (immortal) lives to enjoy and be.
Besides, when the moments are right, I will speak on the platforms, such as YouTube or BlueSky. And I speak, even within what is considered mundane, such as my Transformers Review video series.
Seriously, though, I have not read anything of anyone disecting that deeply even on freaking Reddit.⚡️💙⚡️

Even if you and trump talk in a similar way, you two are literally opposed to each other's existence. Trump wants to erase trans identities and his current administration blames autism on Tylenol, whereas you actively want a world where we all coexist without conflict, "fictional" people included.
Chris
I want more than simply that. Not only the world where magic is fully restored, and everyone from both halves that have been long divided are together moreso and again, but also the more peaceful world where honesty and love is more common, even in politics and the fall of the irredeemable ones.
One could write a fanfic of me meeting Trump, these days, and the result would all likely end up the same: emotional and verbal clashes of morals and interests. Yet, the twist being Trump is likely swayed from something I said or the vibe from my aura resonating with him, at least lightly,...
...and at least considers making the change for the better, especially inspired by governments in other non-heavily violent countries that makes America better. He certainly has not been making it "Great", compared to times before his first term.
11:17 AM
fishyuniverse.bsky.social
How would it go, could you please tell us what would you said that would resonate with Trump being you two are polar opposite?
Chris
The possibilities are endless with the branching timelines from that very moment which, specifically, of me would resonate and move him. I can't say, much like when Jesus could not know the specific dates of Foretold events.
For the moment, it's up to interpretation, you should realize.⚡️💙⚡️

Songs in the Key of CWC @SongsInCWC
Hello friends. I am not coming back, I just logged back into my old account to share this, because this fucking slaps. @andywarski, a new intro song guy for you?
'Sobs in the Key of CWC' was made by MilkyMuse https://youtube.com/@MilkyMuse-w7w over on YouTube, and it's making fun of me but in a very kind and funny and not entirely untrue way lol.
Thank you, Milky Muse - it's nice to know what this feels like. There's a story to be told there I guess, of my sperging out and quitting. Thanks for doing it justice :).
He has another song on the channel called 'The Stalker Child's Reproach' which is also pretty kino; I'm sure you can guess the subject matter.
So I'm not coming back (I got a job doing AI slop for normies), but this Milky Muse guy might be your guy for future intro slopkino, if he keeps at it.
I'll be around in chat from time to time, but no more sector videos from me (definitely, this time).
And yeah, Andy - look up this Milky Muse kid, he's got skills. He currently has 1 subscriber, and it's me lol. But he deserves more, go subscibe! I'm hopeful that you'll have new intro kino, even if it's not from me.
Enjoy! Peace out, y'all. Be good.

Firstly, Hey. I only just heard of you and the content. Secondly, I am not a fan of the AI generated content being used to make a mockery of anyone. Especially in the video I just watched from your channel. And looking down the list to the oldest video, I'm still not impressed.
Now, before anyone gives me a hypocrite reply, I only used Suno, because while I do write my own lyrics, I am not a music writer, and I do not presently have contacts who could write music for me. I only used Suno for these few times.
At least I personally sang both the updated Sonichu theme song, as well as "Go, Transformers" in separate recordings on YouTube, as well in my Apple Music library cloud.
On that, I May make an edit where I put in the version that I sang into the music video, by popular request.
That'll be a separate video.
Point is, I'm still personally working in my projects, actually putting in the mental effort and time to do so. And I am not totally relying on AI for my channel and content.

I am sleep texting right now. If I come off as weird, that's okay. I bring greater wisdoms that should be shared and spread worldwide.
Empathy! Practice it Every Moment with others and yourselves, online AND offline. It will be worth it in the longer term with the present generation.
You young ones need to stop being dumb after being raised with bad video content that was in your background from the likes of awful memes at others' expenses, including those you refer to as "fictional" or even cartoon.
To give others respect and compassion is to do the same for yourselves.
I will likely forget I typed this out from this moment. So, take that under consideration if and when you leave comments.
I have been going through emotionally tough times, but I am further waking up and becoming even more aware.
Damned the Paxil, In part.
Also, I felt angry at the insensitive comments I read yesterday that made me feel forced-motivated to rush the music video edit. It took my afternoon away. I could have used it to finish and resume the commissions I was working on. Now, it got delayed.
I admit it was as much my fault in listening and taking it personally, as it was y'all's who left the comments with little consideration of my self-esteem in the moments when I have been feeling suppressed emotions fly out.
Stop acting like spoiled brats and start Empathizing and be Honest and Good
All right? Take care, and follow the Light Powered Path. I remain mentally sound, even when I speak verbose and esoterically. You just have to tune your deeper, soulful frequencies in to get better understanding.Psychic Powers shall be scientifically proven and consistent fact. Magic Returns.⚡️💙⚡️
Sonic Racing: Crossworlds realization
22 November
12:11 PM
Posted to Chris's Bluesky.
I just had a thought set and a realization while playing #SonicRacingCrossworlds online in the Son-Chu Ford Fusion-like car with Metal Sonic as the driver, since Team #Squidward was chosen at the time.
Now, I am not defending AI, but consider Autobot Bulkead, as well as Decepticon Soundwave. They're robots, but they have souls. And, yet, they both have created art in one form or another over the decades. Maybe, eventually, we get a bot who has a soul and equivalent of a heart (Spark, if you will).
[Posts Transformers GIF]
And they share their painting or music. Do we consider that something computer generated and mechanical? Obviously not, as individual bots like them actually have soul and personalities to create from and with.
From that, I thought of Metal Sonic while driving, thinking in sequence to villains, their backstory and motivation.
Then it dawn on me.
I have questioned why villains were more appealing than heroes. And, yeah, the answer is clear: relatable anguish, frustrations and emotions.
BUT the Hero is still able to be appealing for the same reasons. Is someone like Optimus Prime a static, boring hero? No. He's led a great amount of defensive battles and saw war damages and emotional scars time and again.
Autobot Son-Chu, as well as Sonichu Prime and Rosey Rosechu Prime; I know I didn't portray them as well as I should have, and I definitely should have emotionally branched out further in their backstories. But, they all have witnessed and defended many times in moments of battle and war.
And they often train themselves and their respective skills and abilities, so they can keep up. And they also Feel emotions.
So, to give this thought a valid point: Don't discredit the heroes as bland or boring; they still feel and have seen things; fought their demoms and so on.
Think on that⚡️💙⚡️

Obviously I don't think this is like those little bits in between on the DaVinci Resolve is divided by divisible by mmmm milliseconds as opposed to seconds, anyway give it 20 clic- 20 clicks. Just lots of fun, huh? Hey Lightning Bliss, you got a bit of a challenge if somebody is actually decent on editing. Getting a little better, ARRREEEEEEEEEEE YEP, ITS FUN ISN'T IT HA HA HA?
