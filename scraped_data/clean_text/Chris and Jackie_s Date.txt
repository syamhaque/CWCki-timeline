“
If it inspires me... if you really try your hardest... I will drive down to see you and pay for the hotel room myself. You won't have to pay a penny because I know you would have taken care of me in DC if you could have. I want to reward you because I know your heart is in the right place. And if you really, really show me how much it is... ;) I'll make sure you know mine is, too.

Jackie promises Chris hanky-panky for this video
Chris and Jackie's Date is a four-video series of a date between Chris (in full Tomgirl regalia) and Jackie, here represented by a sex doll, leaked on 24 February 2012. Their romantic date consists of dancing in Chris's room, a trip in Son-Chu to get some McDonald's, eating it and then making out with the doll in the McDonald's parking lot, and Chris's attempt at re-enacting a viral video in a dressing room at the Ruckersville Wal-Mart.[1]
The videos were originally leaked as one0612-hioghuyiogyo [SaveYouTube.com], two0612-vgiherqighbvpioerua [SaveYouTube.com], three0612-rqwehgiohcnracga [SaveYouTube.com] and four0612-hncu9tgohaeruxye [SaveYouTube.com], and data suggests that they were recorded on 11 July 2011. Throughout the videos, Chris speaks in an even higher pitch than usual, and enunciates in a revoltingly saccharine, babyish manner. Whether this is standard procedure for tomgirls or some sort of cutesy way of speaking to "Jackie" is unclear.
Background was provided when some Jackie emails were leaked:
“
want you to get all dolled up on the 4th. And I want you to get one of your blow up dolls and dress it up too- but as me. Print out my picture or draw a picture of my face and put it over their's. Put me in gorgeous clothes so I look every part the proud girlfriend of the hottest Tomgirl in all of Virginia. Show me around town, take me to McDonalds or Starbucks or the movies. Let's have a ball and strut our stuff! Do my make up and pretend I can do your's! Then I want us to end our romantic evening at McIntire Park, watching the fireworks together under the stars. xoxox :D :D

And now, Jackie-pie, I'm gonna go ahead and sweep you off your feet.
[Turns camera to sex doll] Even though right now, you're sitting down.
[Sets camera up on a table and picks up "Jackie," swinging her around and making his own music of la's and da's, occasionally throwing in random phrases as lyrics.]
[He stops dancing and kisses the sex doll's lips (where his duck has inevitably been) and sets her down. He comes to turn the camera off.]

Chris's ideal date
Transcript
["Jackie" is sitting on the hood of Chris's car, which is parked on his lawn. Chris comes by and sits down, making the car shake noticeably.]
Okay, so Jackie and I, we're here at the McDonald's parking lot... we are sitting on top our car, after-- and we just enjoyed some apple-dippers and a Happy Meal.
[Chris gropes the doll and moves it as a child would when making a toy speak and uses a shrill, high pitched voice while he pretends Jackie is talking.]
[As Jackie] It was really, really tasty, yes it was. And even better...my...my professor here...fed-fed me some of the apples...and I enjoyed that.
[As himself] Yes, it was very enjoyable. Very good... So Jackie-pie, what'cha wanna do now?
[As Jackie] I say we make out. And then see where it goes from there.
[As himself] Alright.
[Chris then proceeds to give "Jackie" a deep, open-mouthed kiss in the public parking lot of a McDonald's. He reaches past her and clicks an iPod or a radio. "California Gurls" plays. Chris then moves the doll so that he his legs are wrapped around it, its legs around him. He makes out with it for a few seconds before doing a strange, scissor-like sex act. He makes sex noises, switching between his voice and Jackie's. He kisses her again for a moment before returning to his strange humping. He then puts the doll on the hood of his car, turns the music off, and rushes to the camera.]
God, it's hot out here.

Here we go.
[Immediately starts humping the sex doll while making high-pitched moaning sounds]
[after 10 seconds, he turns the sex doll around into the doggy-style position before it goes off-camera, the blow-up doll going head first into his mold-coated bathtub.]
[Resumes shrill, sexual moans that sound like a whimpering dog while thrusting the doll's behind.]
[Continues moaning suggestively]
Yeah!
[Moans some more. He pauses to reach over to something (water):]
Whoopie! [tosses water into the air as if "Jackie" climaxes & squirts everywhere.]
[Sighs of relief, wipes shirt on face from the intensity and to remove Jackie-Pie's "cum" before turning the camera off]
