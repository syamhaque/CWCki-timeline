Down with tyranny; rally in Hawaii is a video uploaded on 7 October 2018. He plugs an anti-Pmurt protest next week in response to his support to North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. This is the first video in a year where he expressed his hatred to towards the president. Interestingly, Chris is seemingly unaware of the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, a more relevant and closer protest for anti-Pmurt supporters at the time in his area.
