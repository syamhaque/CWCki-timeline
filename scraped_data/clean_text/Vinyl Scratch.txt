Vinyl Scratch (also known as DJ Pon-3) is a minor character in My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. Owing to her unique role in the show, she gained a significant following in the Brony community through numerous fan productions. Given the lesbian implications of the character, Chris developed a fixation with her. In 2018, he saw fit to insert this intellectual property into his own comic book series.

What Chris wants
In the My Little Pony canon, Vinyl Scratch is a DJ who is usually seen as a background character in party scenes; it should be noted that both human and unicorn counterparts of her exist in the franchise. Not long after her first appearance, she became very prominent in fan productions, especially with an association to EDM music. She is often paired with cellist Octavia Melody, and is frequently implied to be in a lesbian relationship.[2] With Chris' outing as a "lesbian transwoman" in the spring of 2015, it should come as no surprise that Chris revered this relationship – aligning with the desired conclusion to his Love Quest.

What Chris would actually look like.
The earliest documented mention from Chris appeared in September and October 2013, when he revealed he was watching the I Am Octavia music video which showcases the Vinyl/Octavia relationship.[3][4]
Chris attended Cville Pride 2014 with Vinyl Scratch glasses. He likely got the glasses paired with this toy set.
On 18 October 2014, Chris watched the new Equestria Girls movie but was disappointed that Octavia had a voice actor while Vinyl remained mute.[5]
The infamous GameStop Incident saw Chris trespass in his local GameStop while using the glasses as a disguise.
Most notably, in August 2015, Chris attended OmegaCon, where he cosplayed as Vinyl Scratch.
On Halloween 2015, Chris shared a drawing of Sonichu and Rosechu dressed up as Vinyl and Octavia, respectively.[6]
Chris used components of a Vinyl Scratch doll to create the Christine Doll. He also interacted his doll with another Vinyl toy to act out lesbian situations.
In the midst of the Doopie Saga, Chris began to support Doopie on her Patreon profiles. This included an account for porn art requests, in which Chris suggested an artwork of Vinyl and Octavia flicking their beans.[1]
The banner for Chris' NightStar2891 sockpuppet account features Vinyl and Octavia.
On BronyMate, he answered Vinyl as his "Favorite Pony".
Following his (final) breakup with Jessica Quinn, Chris compared his severed relationship to that of Vinyl and Octavia. He also linked the aforementioned music video.[7]
As revealed in his leaked house tour video, Chris has a poster of the two ponies on his bedroom wall.
In late 2019, Chris used the 2015 cosplay drawing for his DJ Pon-Sonichu card, as part of his TSSSF trading card game.
