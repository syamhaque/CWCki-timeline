Hey everybody, Jesus Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu Prime here once again, and in this particular video I am pleased to announce... as well as the days of the old Pokésite, the Pokésite 2, and my Sonichu site, and even the short-lived, uh, Hot Wheels website I had... That was just... that was a little bit of fun.
Anyway, so... Right now, [Clicks on Microsoft Edge.] I have the new website! It's right here! It's right here on the home page. Officialsonichu.com! Yes! And I tell ya what, if the CWCki is willing to depart with the Sonichu.com name, I'll be- I'll be more than happy to take that and put it on here... but for right now, at least, it's this. This is the Cwclight website. My intentions for this is just to... put more... everything that's more direct from me... because let's face it, the other... C dub- the other CWC and JCWCS... Prime... I'm the Prime... websites, that, uh, think they know about me, and all the Christorians out there... They- 99% of them, they don't know me personally. They don't know my history, except for everything I've posted online, and I was, uh, all that too many theoretical exes and those trolls in the past... but that was so decades ago! [chuckles] Yeah, anyways so...
This is the website, this is the home page. You got a little rotating thing up here. I got a little- lil' scrolling rainbow in the background, yes. And it's linked to a shop, we're still going to keep the Etsy for, at least for the time being. But, you'll be able to buy the merch off of here and directly, pop it in the cart, check out, we tested it, it works. And then I'm having a little blog, just to- these are some of our blogs. We got a lovely thing going here... yep. And... I- I put a few ques- few answered questions on here, under the blog and then- little bit of a further bio for at least right now. [sigh] A few additional reads for you, at least into the, uh, details of Sonichus and Rosechus, just a few small things, not too many major mind-blowing... stories and details, but it might be.
We're offering website exclusives, like you know, things that, uh, were only available to me, just, uh, like for the moment we just have like a few CDs... there's a very, very old drawing, that, uh, is a real- one item thing, a real work of art, a classic. Yeah, anyway, I'm not going to spoil it right now, let you find out for yourself- But you have these exclusives and there- and there's more. Gonna have more of these along the way, and other offerings.
Then we scroll down, we got this- So yeah, we got links to my Twitter and links to my YouTube down here. You can feel free to subscribe and... we take major payments, on the shop part. And then yeah, going here to the catalog, this is... the store. We got the medallions obviously, we got the books... and you just got the lovely little thing going on- click them you get to the i- you go to the item page. And obviously you know add to cart... you know the drill, it's all good. All the good stuff... Yeah, the exclusives- yeah here's the little drawing, here's this one- And even some melted survivors from the house fire of 2014. Yeah, even poor Nathan Drake... and just a very few bundles right here.
[sigh] I'm just gonna skip ahead a little bit- So here's the contact page where you can contact to an exclusive web ad- to-we address, and, uh, we'll feature fanart from time to time, so feel free to submit your art... to this e-mail address, cuz you can't attach an image to here. And, uh, just you got we have a few arts that we've, uh, put on here so far- We got the arts down here, even some of them from the, uh, art contest as, uh, you've seen... and we're just gonna go to number- page 5, cuz you gotta admit, this right here, that's fun. That's really cool. That's cute. And then right here is just, uh, some people who, uh, left a photo on the Etsy store, so just our propers and shout-outs, feel free- just, uh, look through these on your own time, it's all good.
And then yep, big deal, blogs. I'll be putting bigger stories, I'm still gonna update on Twitter from time to time and all that. But... essentially, we're gonna out- outrank the competition- belittle the competition. No names will be said about those particular websites. But yeah, you, uh, you could access- this- this is the desktop version, there's a mobile version, look this up on your phone, you'll be able to read all this. It's just like obviously you... oh, yeah here we go... click on that, and then just, uh... yeah- The comments are accepted but moderated, you're able to leave comments on these blogs as well. So just keep it safe for work and appropriate, no curse- no inappropriate curse words or hate speech or whatever. [gulp]
And then I've answered some, uh, if- some- pa- just questions, and well, past frequently asked questions, some may be, some present, but anyway just, uh... the additional ones and, I did answer a few- I picked a few from... the one certain website... yeah. So yeah, you can read about this one. [hovers over Past Question: Sonichu book 12-9 confusion.] Just like you know, the, uh... the "Chris Chan" that Night Star interacted with in book 12-9, answered that more accurately now. Anyway, just, uh, click one of these and yeah, you're good to, uh, read what I wrote there.
But yeah, just essentially that's the, uh, website for now. We got a few plans in the works for this, uh, we're thinking about integrating one or two of the old websites under here. And of course, uh, adding more details under here, this'll be the- that's a big thing. Hm. Anyway, so that's just it for now, y'all take care and have a good safe night. Thank you, and bless all of you.
