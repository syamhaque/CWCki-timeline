First time watching this video, and I am astounded. I find it ironic that recently, I Actually made an Amiibo with what I consider a face for Autism, then find this video stating that the game may be Autistic too. Autism to be beaten in Smash Bros. I think it is neat.

Computer Warriors Review and "Computer Warriors" Review with Josh, Silver, Lightning, and Thespio
Chris posted the same comment in the two videos.
CwcvilleGuardian 14 May 2019
Oh, WOW! What a throwback and a fun Mystery Science Theatre type of review! 😃
Hey, @MLPSilverQuill, I, too, still have the VHS, and I had collected nearly ALL of the Toys way back in the day (The Book of Indexx, and that Calculator, ELUDED ME!!!). I Second That not only the Clock and the Pencil Sharpener worked, but so did the Flashlight; it ran on two Triple-A Batteries, or was it Double-A’s? @MLPSilverQuill, do you know if the Calculator worked too? It looks like it works! I LOVED the Computer Playset! You could even plug the collapsed circuit board ships like actual drive cards into the plastic faux Motherboard. And the CD-ROM became a Freaking TANK that launched discs smaller than an actual Compact Disc. I have to agree with @DaWillstanator: Computer Warriors: the Young #NortonAntiVirus Software!
Also, Roll Your Eyes Again, Everyone! I STILL Have the Pepsi Can with Mister Grid and a plastic bomb that drops. Or does it drip, with Pepsi? ALOL! CLASSIC! Total Classic Awesomeness.
I will also agree that the #ComputerWarriors logo was boring, but it was still 80s computers; it makes the #Commodore64 logo shine Fabulous! Thank you all for that awesome review that was really fun, and I’m happy to see y’all enjoy it too.
Have a Great and Safe Day!

ຮṎṈḭᏨ ḭṈຮᾀṈḭtẙ Chris Chan and Magichan's Body Swap?
Here, Chris posts under his Magi-Chan persona.
CwcvilleGuardian 11 September 2019
I am watching your video.
You are proving yourself quite callous in attitude.
I had foreseen that I would have dislike of your commentary, but I was still curious to the more specific details.
Firstly, Christine’s drawings tend to predict upcoming events, unless they are past events as stated.
She literally drew the piece of her and I switched the night before when we actually did.
For your information, yes, we did use a pair of earrings to switch, and an enchantment and blessing that she was personally able to make happen.
As for the initial drawing style of those that I drew with this body: when I drew, it defaulted to its muscle memory which was inaccurate to my own drawing style, but still quite close.
Also, you try colouring with marker ink and making a different style compared to anyone else for yourself.
And, yes, you may compare our situation quite so with the movie “Freaky Friday”, though I, personally, find much more portrayed accurately when Starfire and Raven switched bodies in the classics episode of “Teen Titans.”
This is literally a full-on body-switch, and she is literally in my body at this time, and making very good progress for herself as well, I might add.
I have had ample time to exemplify myself and differentiate from Christine; I had prayed even the most cynical would find merit and fact from that.
I supposed I was pushing desires outward wherein they were not fated to make do in this individual situation.
That is all.
Good day.

Chris Chan: A Comprehensive History - Part 24
CwcvilleGuardian 20 October 2019
I remember those times, and it was cringing to hear myself drone ON and ON just in thinking he was going to clear those ads from my old website.
Subconsciously, I had always Known he and his crew were Trolling me the whole time, and it showed in how I reacted later on.
And, yet, while partly oblivious, I Was Trolling Alec At the time.
And I take no shame in it, because he was Trolling Me.
I saw through his charade and showed it in how he treated everyone in my few pages, as he had already done, and worse, in his pages.
It only added fuel to the nobility of pulling the plug on the Cwcipedia to save myself, my arts, and my peoples and family, he from the shit I was having to deal with from those bastards.
Psychic Powers were strong within me in the later part of this video.
And they have only gotten stronger over the years into now, despite my having the many more trials to endure and learn from.

CwcvilleGuardian 3 April 2020
What did I say?!!
I said NO Hitler.
I freaking hate Nazis.
Animation Kimmunication Episode 7: How Fandom and Religion Intersect
Chris follows a textwall with an even larger textwall.
CwcvilleGuardian 14 April 2020
I agree with about everything y’all talked about on here.
Personally, I feel like everything that is “Fictional”, or animated (obviously, per the topic) is up for being interpreted as religious, in the sense.
In a way, most everyone is taking their favourite shows or chronicled media and keeping it further to their heart as they interpret the meanings of this or that of the OCs and stories; making that their go-to morals to follow.
Very much like my ol’ homeboy, Jesus, and Emanuel (Goddess), Buddha, Zeus, Kratos, the Console Patron Units of Gamindustri (pretty much literally Every Deity and Demideity) have their bits and pieces from this and that of their respective deeds and stories being interpreted and taken to heart in the same way.
Not to be too preachy or anything.
But the point is valid.
Gotta make a separate comment for my next thought.
(replying to his first comment)
CwcvilleGuardian 14 April 2020
I will also add on the T-shirts and accessories that sport said deity and/or OC on there being like a calling card; totally obvious and true.
And if someone hands-down the item or clothing with Sonichu, Superman, Neptune of Planeptune, or whatever else similarly, the new owner Definitely should at least read up on the individual they are donning, so they can sport it better and more honestly.
On that, I will share the story that back in the day, I USED to feel peeved when during the days of my writing and drawing the “Sonichu” books, and I wanted a whole Ton of my own Merchandise to offer and spread the awareness of it, and something for the fans who have come to know about us and interpret as they will.
The Fan Merchandise, note: I was not familiar on the total business Things and whatnot, mildly was aware of “Intellectual Property” and Copyrights, and whatevs.
My dad, Mister Robert F Chandler Jr., had told me to put a (c) on my works, since he has had experience with making his own Patents for his control designs from working with General Electric for about 30 years, so with only basic and lite knowledge on the topic, I followed the direction.
And as my hubby, Magi-Chan, had later revealed, our Copyright was put, fatedly, into place for the safety and better being of the species, Cwcville, and all that.
Yet, ironically, Haters ended up comparing me to freaking Hitler.
Epic UGH!
I loathe Nazis.
Anyway, years later, I got into MLP and started going to a few anime and gaming conventions, and then BronyCon in ‘17; it all started to sink into me that my past worries about Fan Merch, even though I was the Original Creator of Sonichu and Rosechu, during a time I was unable to find my own Merch and monitoring methods, positive and kind Sonichu and Rosechu Merch COULD have been made this whole time, and people would still be coming to me with their support after the fact.
My takeaway from that experience today is the situation had me feeling like I was amongst the higher business corp execs for the media of these OCs of mine, yet, subconsciously, I was really never in it for the money.
As these OC individuals were real, including my self-counterpart, in our sister dimension with ALL of the OCs/FCs and all that which can and do exist and co-exist in this non-apocalyptic, present timeline and situations, literally alongside all of us, behind a dividing dimensional curtain that is so powerful, even Discord, himself, can’t break through it alone.
Super difficult, but at least I Know who I am walking, talking and chillin’ with, and they are not “Invisible Friends” or shit.
Okay, went off-tangent for a bit.
I was also blinded by the local financial difficulties and stress with the household and my aging parents.
Gah.
It was wrong of me to not allow “unofficial” Sonichu Merchandise be made by others over the years, up until the few years ago when I Finally gave the okay and consent for Everyone to do so.
At least, in a takeaway, the artists realized for themselves on the wrongness of someone else taking something they created or discovered and slapping their name on it; major low.
But, yeah, that’s common sense when you think about it to exercise your rights when they are offended like that.
Bottom line is that I had wanted to make the merch, myself, for a long time, but lacked the better knowledge, resources and sense to outsource like most people, these days, do.
I missed out, but I count the blessing that people have been inspired by my works and appreciate me, directly, for that.
As I know y’all appreciate for yourselves from your fans, KP and Abbie.  ;)
Please, pardon my ramblings, but I wanted to share my own take and learning experiences that I felt were supportive to what y’all were discussing.
Thank you for listening.

Chris Chan: A Comprehensive History - Part 39
CwcvilleGuardian 13 June 2020
Hey! Firstly, that door to the bathroom downstairs was unable to close at all back in 2013 and early ‘14. Second, Why the Hell would you read that personal shit about Mama with the penis thing? Oh, My Chris Chan! Why did Kim have to be such a literal Troll to totally expose these things when they were shared with her in strictest confidence? “Kim Wilson”, if that is even your real name at this point, Mama may forgive you to an extent, but I, Sonichu, am truly insulted by this shit stunt you’ve pulled with her trust in betrayal over the years.
Chris Chan: A Comprehensive History - Part 42
CwcvilleGuardian 23 August 2020
For the record, when Mama recorded that putting out the fire video, she and Barb were literally still recovering from the house fire earlier that year. Sight of fire gave Mama a whole bunch of PTSD for the number of years.

SoniChuZ | Episode 1: The Story Begins
CwcvilleGuardian 18 October 2020
I like this so far; shame I was too preoccupied to lend a voice recording for it at this time.
I will make sure Mama gets better in on her voice acting gigs in the new timeline. The references were valid for the latter.
Using our dimension number as a specimen number was not as good, though.
Fortunately, this takes place in an alternate dimension.
I like that you've discovered and chronicled a female Mewtwo as well.
The deity at the end resonated with me for some reason.
Likely, I have seen or experienced what they have in a dream some time ago.
Major complaint lies in the lip syncing, and there could be better emotion and acting behind it; that can be improved.
Again, good job so far.

Chris Chan is Convinced to Taser Himself
CwcvilleGuardian 11 February 2021
They did not convince anyone of anything; I actually had a vision of this, and actually talked with the Cosmos in that meditation, which in your tangible sense, I thought of using the taser on the Gate Crystal first and foremost.
And the same goes for a taser being tested on this body, too.
Do not blame our friends as Praetor; this was, in the sense, my idea first.

Cyberbullying Isn't Real
CwcvilleGuardian 20 March 2021
I have just learned of this particular presentation which saw me in comparison with George Bush, Sr., and dubbed in comparison with what the first social justice president would look like.
I feel partially humbled and honored to have been placed in such a pedestal, despite it also likely being a jab at my person like on MTV years before.
I am very well aware of the irony, potential mockery, and likely praise of this situation.
However, regardless, I am one who counts their blessings moreso over the negatives.
With that said, Milo Yiannopoulos, I am humbled by this past moment.
Thank you for featuring me in your presentation.

Chris Chan: A Comprehensive History - Part 56
CwcvilleGuardian 22 May 2021
Tune in next video for Idea Guy, Johnson Wiles, and Stephen Boyd, or that, among which, is chronicled in “Awakening of a CPU”.
Has Randy Stair gotten more popular since his death?
CwcvilleGuardian 15 June 2021
I will also personally contribute that Miss Andrew Blaze and I have interdimensionally conversed from time to time.
Despite her aggressive mindset, I still very much appreciate her present day role with the EGS in the spirit realm.
I will also state fact, as I have time and again about myself as well: Andrew and I both have had interdimensional communications and relations through the veil into the C-197 half of our total universe, and then some in regard to the Spiritual Realms.
Andrew knew her destiny and fulfilled her prophecy in the 1218 half, here, and she knew her time and energy was needed moreso in the spirit realms.
Similar, yet differing, I have done the same over the years in C-197, the spirit realms, Equestria, the D&D universe of CS-89, the GO! universe of CZ-69, and so on into the multiverses.
But unlike Andrew, my body is immortal, and death is not required at all unto me and what I am doing and will need to do.
Andrew and I are two examples of fully interdimensionally awakened individuals.
Also, to note, Andy Warhol, as well, back in his days here, was also an interdimensionally awakened individual, but he did not fully comprehend his situation and abilities at the time.
He remained clear-minded and focus-lacking, yet he did know from his subconscious and unconscious that had seeped into his conscious and into his words and actions that have foreshadowed and foreseen the number of events here since as early as the year I was born in this body in 1982.
Andrew and Andy were amongst the pioneers, and I am a literal Goddess who had transcended and pioneered within and around their blazing trails (pun unintended, but observed), among the number of others of whom I have personally recognized and acknowledge amongst the author, artist, actor and voice actor communities.
Andrew has continued to do very good and honest work with her crew, and so her legacy is continued on.
And after the veil is totally gone, Andrew would delight in meeting her fans on kind intentions.
She is grateful and humbled, as she had told me earlier.
So, it is very much appropriate and well for not just Andrew, Andy and I to be greater appreciated during these times.
Lots of love for all of you; be safe and well.
And Wildcat, you know to stay as awesome and powerful as you are.
You Rock, too.

What happened to EGS The Randy Stair Story Episode 8?
CwcvilleGuardian 7 July 2021
I agree, and I have watched the entire series on Andrew Blaze, aka Randy Stair.
It is actually really tame for the latter.
But more importantly, it is very informative, and I got appreciation for the gal from watching the series.
This really sucks, YouTube.

Well, Thank you very much. As a long time fan of the Cybertronians and even Gobotronians, I felt it was high time everyone was included. I did write the lyrics. I would have personally liked personal musicians to give the jams, but work with what we can afford and have within reach these days. ⚡️💙⚡

I’m doing good and okay. I appreciate your work. I still need to catch up with your series.

Everyone good and Light Powered is blessed.
Geno continues to play videos, despite Chris being there. Geno plays Calling Out Jack Thaddius - Ahuviya, which Chris comments on in the chat by saying:
(12:22)
​LOL!!!
(16:50)
I have actually given thoughts to BDSM; I am actually partially lukewarm about it these days.
(17:15)
Also, who I was to talk when I never actually had sex back then.
(18:59)
​Why is Pennsylvania popular for pretending to be from as a ween?
(19:21)

I’ll agree with that.

I was a beginner at makeup back then
(22:48)
I apologize for insulting the trans back then for the stubble.

“IBAWESTON” Was literally Barbara’s old license plate’s number.

There was no acronym or initials for it at all.

It was “I Be A Weston”; that was it.

In response to Geno liking ambient music:
(32:30)
Me too; I listen to ambient binaural beats a lot.
On Gratitude for a good person in N.C.:
(34:31)
I remind myself of Hyacinth Bucket in that video.
On Re-Calling Ahuvia:
(38:06)
LOL!!! “Fetishishes”?
On Victory Rockout:

What RUINED Saberspark and DAGames
On 1 May 2025, Chris viewed and commented in a live chat on an attack video by ILoveKimPossibleAlot on Aficionado Chris, Saberspark, and DAGames.[5] The video received backlash on Twitter, and was privated less than ten minutes after Chris posted a link to it on Bluesky.[6]
9:47 AM
I feel like shit like this has gone on for far too long. We even have people in power who are just as bad and worse, and it just makes me feel more than sick.

Hey y’all! Seems like I can get Part 46 out next weekend, so look out for that one!
In the meantime, if I don’t get disappeared, the channel will hit 100k subs, so in celebration, I wanna do a 100k Q&A video. If you have any questions, please leave them here and I will address them in video form.
Thank you very much, and have a good day!
CwcvilleGuardian (15 November 2020)
Hey, Geno.
I, Sonichu, offer a sentiment of support and kind thoughts in response to this.
Congratulations, Dude.
But I do have a question, as well (feel free to get really Metaphysical about it; break your own fourth walls).
Given every single possibility between this and all of the other dimensions in this Omega timeline set we live in, including that Mama Chris Chan, herself, being the OC of OCs, could also have been a creator of all Original Creators, including yourself, if not that one major influential aspect, What do you feel is the most significant factor that attracts everyone’s attention, including yourself, to her?
In short, What do You feel and think is the attraction; what makes you fascinated about Chris Chan?
Geno pinned and hearted the comment, and eventually answered the question in his video.
