“
I truly feel that women should only be portrayed as they truly are individually; strong, powerful, smart, beautiful and equal as human beings. And when anyone draws a true woman with a dick, they have broken not only the legal law, but God and Jesus' law to the extent. But I digress.
”
Chris, on the Sonichu Girls website, expressing his disgust towards women being drawn with penises.[1]
“
There Was a time before I realized mine being a female soul trapped in a male-born body, when I was homophobic. But I became better aware of these kind and open-hearted people, and learned how understanding and compassionate they are, and with that, losing the homophobia, I felt more at peace with myself and those around me.
”
Chris after transitioning.[2]
Sylvana, a prominent example of a "hermaphrodite"
Hermaphroditism is the biological condition where an organism possesses reproductive organs and/or gametes of both sexes.[3] The term was also once used to refer to people who were intersex.
Chris, however, specifically applied the term "hermaphrodite" to refer to any person that he perceived as being "female" or of an ambiguous gender, but with a penis and secondary female sex characteristics (such as breasts). This included transgender women that hadn't received bottom surgery, as well as intersex people that he perceived as being female. In essence, Chris used the term the same way some people would refer to such people as "shemales", "dickgirls", or "futa". Like with a lot of other things, Chris's understanding of trans and intersex people came from the media he's consumed. His initial understanding of such concepts mirrored those of many other people during the late 2000s and early 2010s. Chris had seemingly conflated transgenderism with intersexuality, believing that both terms referred to the same thing.
Chris more often than not used the term "hermaphrodite" as a pejorative towards trans women, under the fear that they too can make him gay, due to their supposed ability to subvert his straightness. During the Classic Era, Chris was also noted for being peeved by his female characters being portrayed as "hermaphrodites", being portrayed with penises or as trans women. For these reasons, the way Chris used the term can be thought of as the transgender equivalent of "homos". Chris has also used the term "homo", as well as "transvestite" and "lady-man", as demeaning terms towards trans women that he he didn't deem authentic, and refused to respect the identities of.[4][5] These past attitudes of Chris's however, are far overshadowed amongst the CWCsphere by his recent, more vocal support for trans people on social media.
Chris similarly used the term "intersex" to refer to the same thing, but in a less derogatory manner, using the term on himself when he began transitioning,[6] as well as for the characters Rosechu and Sylvana, both of whom had penises at one point or another.

Past Transphobia
“
I Do Not Care Much for Transgender People or Hermaphrodites, but I do not discriminate them as individual people
”
Chris[7]
“
I have given thought about the transgenders and transvesites; I do not feel comfortable with them….[D]icks are dicks, and I do not care about them, except for my own
”
Chris[8]
Chris "embarassed" with being portrayed as the Dark Magician Girl, complete with hairy legs and chest.
Though it has taken him years to fully articulate his views on transgender issues and topics, Chris has also shown an aversion towards trans people, particularly trans women, viewing them as something that could potentially subvert his straightness around that time, similar to his past attitudes towards the "homos". Considering his distaste for being seen as a homo himself, as well as him expressing his longing for vagina, it would only make sense that at the time he'd be repulsed by the idea of a man being attracted to what he viewed as another man posing as a woman, or a woman having a penis, theories which Chris had proven correct many, many times.
Also like with the homos, Chris believed that hermaphrodites had the ability and desire to make him gay. When telling people to play with toys that would be appropriate for the opposite gender in order to understand them better in his Future Message, Chris also alluded to believing that when one "forgets" their true, original gender, they would wind up becoming gay themselves if they strayed away too much from their assigned gender at birth.
“
Also keep in mind that, while you're playin' with these things, you should keep in mind of what your true, original gender is. Because, uh, it's like you worry about that girl you want to take on a date—YOUNG MAN!—or, uh, likewise, you feel more comfortable to approach that boy—by just saying "hello"—that you've been checkin' out from a distance—YOUNG LADY!—and hopefully in due time or now, each and every one of you will stay straight.
”
Chris, after telling men to play with My Little Pony dolls, and women to play with Transformers.[9]
He has also claimed that he even found the prospect of a woman who was seducing him being a hermaphrodite worse than if he was catfished by a man, as evidenced when he called out ShmionSonozaki, where he questioned if she was a "pretty woman", before bringing up the possibility of her being a man, or "worse", a hermaphrodite.[10] Ironically, Chris had also stated that he'd rather get a sex change operation before ever becoming a homo,[11] which led to questioning from trolls.[12] Chris has also seemed to agree to the notion of transgender women being seen as authentic women, but was just discomforted by them.[8]
Chris's discomfort with "hermaphrodites" was exploited, and became a well-known means to troll him on several occasions, usually by depicting some of his female characters as transgender, or in one case, attempting to hook him up with a trans woman. Liquid Chris has even parodied Chris's use of the term "hermaphrodite" in one of his videos. [13]
An edited version of a porn drawing Chris made that Sarah May manipulated him into making to get his site back.
A heavy target towards this method of trolling was the character Rosechu, who was depicted countless times by trolls as being born male, due to being designed with a male Raichu tail, putting the straightness of Sonichu himself into question. Trolls have noticed that all instances of this made Chris particularly angry.
When Chris had first discovered his ED page, and noticed Rosechu drawn with a penis, he tried to dispel the rumors of her being a gay man by creating an entire episode for the Sonichu comics, the infamous Episode 17. In that episode, Chris drew Rosechu naked on many occasions, putting great emphasis on the fact she had a vagina. This of course wouldn't stop trolls from continuing to troll Chris in this manner, making more art of Rosechu with the offending appendage, and declaring Rosechu as a trans symbol, in order to anger Chris further. Chris's insistence to the contrary had only made Rosechu having a pickle to become more of a meme amongst those aware of Chris's story.
Chris was manipulated by Sarah May to edit a drawing that he made with Rosechu wearing a strap-on dildo, changing it so that she had a penis instead, with Sarah claiming that he can get his website back if he did.[14] She lied. Chris has also received a number of replies in the Mailbag praising him for his supposed portrayal of Rosechu as a trans woman, leading to one of the most well known instances of Chris's wrath.
“
And also, Rosechu has always been a woman! If you look on page three of book number one, it says right there that that Raichu was a girl! Quote unquote, GIRL. RAICHU! And Sonichu has been straight the whole time! He's always been straight! Rosechu's always been a woman...! [long pause] UUUUUURRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRGH!!
”
Chris[15]
Despite Chris trying to claim that he always intended Rosechu to be born a girl Raichu, even slapping together a collage to try and claim she was born with a blunt tail, trolls have pointed the obvious out, seeing through Chris's obvious lie. Chris had deleted such comments that point this out, adding more suspicion.[16][17] Despite all efforts Chris had made to deny Rosechu being trans, one fan admitted the obvious, and told him that all he had to do is mention how in his world, this gender difference never existed, and Chris rolled with this.[18]
Chris also created the character Sylvana Rosechu, who was originally a female Rosechu that has the ability to shape shift. In Sonichu 8, Chris introduces the lore that Count Graduon had granted her her ability to shape shift under the condition she be born intersex, and loses her ability to give birth. From there, she was able to give herself a vagina or penis at will, often while seducing other characters. Trolls and observers have speculated that Chris gave her this ability as a way of symbolizing his frustration with all the times he's been catfished by trolls, especially when she "trolled" Chris in Sonichu 10, though this is conjecture at best. Chris said himself that trolls had "inspired" him to make her a "hermaphrodite",[19] that Count Graduon had "forced" Chris to make her have a penis under said troll influence, [20] and proclaimed he intended for Sylvana to be "all female" when she seduced him. This indicates that it is more likely he was manipulated in some way to make her like this, exploiting Chris's stressor. Chris said that Silvana was his least favorite character to work with for this reason,[20] and also stated that fans can draw her naked, just so long as she's drawn with a vagina.[21] The infamous drawing of Silvana masturbating was also created as a commission from Sarah May, bribing Chris to do it to get his website back.[14]
One of the most infamous examples of Chris's former transphobia was his encounter with the troll sweetheart Bailey Jay in the CWCipedia's Mailbag. There, the troll behind the Bailey persona had seemingly taken note of the other instances of Chris being catfished, and decided to put Chris's self-proclaimed "straightness" to the test. In the first message that she sent to Chris, Bailey claims that she had a hard time finding men to fall in love with.[22] After Chris replied, calling her "cute" and "pretty", she sent nude photos of herself to Chris, revealing she had a penis.[23]
“
OH MY GOD!!! UGH!!! ARE YOU REALLY A HERMAPHRODITE?! I'm sorry, but that naughty picture just really shocked me and made me want to throw up. *deep breath* You do have a pretty face, but what happened just now is just like the movie, "The Crying Game", or the Thanksgiving episode of "The Cleveland Show".
”
Chris[23]
Chris showed very conflicting feelings at the revelation, still calling Bailey "pretty", but also being unnerved at her being trans. Chris then apologized to Bailey when she expressed having her feelings hurt, and in the same post, Chris also rambles a couple of times about being "straight", as assigned by God, obviously being defensive about the previous comments he made towards her.[24]
Several other trolls took note of Chris's reaction to Bailey, as well as a portion of
Sonichu 10, where Chris is seen getting "trolled" by Silvana by being seduced by her, disguised as Meg Griffin, and they began asking him more questions about "hermaphrodites" in future Mailbags, such as in Mailbag 37.[25] In Mailbag 39, another troll asked Chris if he had sex with Sylvana, who at the time was portrayed with a penis, and asked him he'd want to have sex with a "shemale".[26] Chris angrily replied that he never had sex with her, and that he'd never have sex with a hermaphrodite, proclaiming he had intentions of retconning her ability to become one.
“
Second, to answer your questions. 1) No, I did not have sex with Silvana; ONLY MAKING OUT. When Silvana takes the form of an ALL-Female individual, its dick is GONE. 2) I would NEVER CARE to have sex with a Hermaphrodite.
”
Chris[26]
In Mailbag 43, another troll suggests the idea of Bubbles Rosechu being a trans woman after she claimed she'd "hit that" following her name being changed to Kitty in the Asperchu interpretation of the Chaotic Combo. Chris had deleted this statement, and replaced it with two other ones, calling Alec Benson Leary's recreation of the characters "unapproved".[27]
Even after he began transitioning himself, and requesting that other people respect his new identity, Chris has still shown several instances of transphobia.
When he tried to "expose" Jack Thaddeus, he was tricked into believing that Jack was the lolcow Ahuviya Rotem Harel, who was also transgender. He used this fact as something to "expose him" for, as well as making fun of him for going through a sex change operation in order to chase after men.[28] Even after Chris wishes Jack luck with the operation, he also claims that he won't be a part of "femdom", and calls him a "homo".[29]
Chris also refers to trans women as "fake women", and uses the term "trannies" a couple of times,[note 1] in a 23 April 2014 conversation that he had with the troll gal-pal LoveYouLongTime. In the conversation, which is about his Love Quest and the the women he's chased and had to sort through, he still expresses the belief that these "trannies" still have the intention of chasing after men and making them gay.[30]
During his encounters with Francine Ouzuo, Chris was noted for several instances of gatekeeping. In one of the videos addressing them, Chris expressing feeling angry at her, declaring that she "is no woman", claiming they have no "female soul", and calling them by their "male" name for this reason..
“
Anyway, pfft, aside from that [stress sighs, grunts] I'm really pissed off at Jeff. I'm going by the, his male name, because he is no woman. No female soul whatsoever, regardless, [places Amiibo off-camera once more] regardless of the fact of having his balls chopped up, [in falsetto] sounding like a high pitched choirboy now! [returns to normal voice, clears throat]
”
Chris[31]
When Francine had been distributing unofficial Sonichu merchandise, and believing that Francine had created the fangame Christian Weston Chandler's Adult Chronicles, Chris tried doxing her, and called her a "lady-man".[5]
Defenses against his Effeminancy
See also: Gender dysphoria

Before his transition, Chris tried to maintain his "straightness" by acting like what he thought a stereotypical man acted like, showing insecurity of his more effeminate traits. This was likely a result of the aforementioned fact that he believed that one straying away too much from their assigned gender made them gay, which meant that Chris believed that he's proving to the trolls that he's gay by showcasing his femineity, and so took every possible opportunity while recording himself to subvert it by feigning masculinity.
When Chris was forced to admit that he was gay by a group of trolls, he held up an action figure of Optimus Prime, who he deemed as a symbol of masculinity, throughout the entire video.[32] Chris had also greatly exaggerated his physical prowess, usually to appear more powerful than his trolls or to impress his gal-pals. These attempts included him recording himself performing feats of strength, threatening his trolls, or outright exaggerating and/or lying about the sports he was proficient about in online dating sites or towards said gal-pals.[33] In the comics, Chris also often portrayed himself as a barrel-chested hero, and often times appeared muscular when he went shirtless.[34]
Despite all of of Chris's efforts, though, they were completely overshadowed by his penchant for crossdressing, something he was very defensive about. The earliest known instance of this recorded is with the "muscle bra". Chris has stated that all men should wear "muscle bras" to cover their chests by law, being uncomfortable with seeing the chest of a man. At the time, Chris appeared to refer to such coverings as a "muscle bra", due to the masculine connotation that came with it, not wanting to making it appear he's promoting men to wear women's clothes. Chris then bought himself one of these bras to control the bouncing of his moobs, and came to enjoy it. On 28 April 2011, Surfshack Tito also leaked a set of photos, which highlighted Chris's eventual gender transition. Even while the facade was on its last legs, Chris still tried to assure people that he was a heterosexual man who was just "in touch with his feminine side".
Chris, after transitioning, has ironically become one of the things he once winced at the thought of. However, from doing this, his gender dysphoria became much more apparant, and he had an inverse perspective on his presentation, now wanting to eliminate all masculine traits of himself, including his penis. Chris only appears to view those who have a vagina as "fully female", regardless of their chromosomes. This also seemed to be a driving force of his that led to him taking such drastic measures on himself, and expressing self-loathing on himself for being born male. Chris has also expressed interest in getting gender reassignment surgery on many occasions.
Trans Men
“
Would you date a transgender person?
”
Another question from OkCupid.[35]
“
As long as she was born female and was still female (or a tomboy)
”
Chris's answer.[35]
Overall, Chris has always had a much better relationship with trans men, even respecting their new identities and pronouns on practically all occasions. However, this could be because, even after transitioning, he viewed them as simply butch gal-pals, showing the same possessive behaviors and entitlement towards them as he does with any gal-pal.
Sometime in late 2014, when Chris was asked if he would date a transgender person, he replied that he would, only on the condition that they were biologically female, likely in reference to them being a trans man. When asked if he'd do the same to a trans man who got surgery, however, he denied this, stating having seen images of trans men getting gender reassignment surgery, not liking the results.[35]
“
I have Image Googled females who went under the surgery; I did not like the results at all.
”
Chris
Another prominent example of Chris showing this mindset is his interactions with the voice actor of Vinyl Scratch, Nowacking. Before Nowacking's transition, Chris replied to many of his tweets, especially when he started posting about dating on his Twitter. When talking with him, Chris went on long tangents about his online life, and his experiences with trolls and weens. Weens led by Michael Hirtes then tried to convince Nowacking to block Chris, which caused Chris to believe they were responsible for Nowacking blocking him. Chris continued to try contacting him through multiple sockpuppet accounts. Even after Nowacking's transition, Chris still tried to redeem himself in his eyes during BronyCon 2018, presening him with comics and toys, to which he showed no interest to. Even after all of that, Chris still tries to keep contact with the voice actor to this day.
Chris had shown similar attitudes towards Lukas Simpkins, a trans man from the group dubbed the "Teen Troon Squad". During their interactions with Chris, Lukas talked about Chris's lack of boundaries around them being "rapey", mirroring his inappropriate advances towards some of his gal-pals.[36] After they left him abruptly, he had shown bewilderment at this, and has since then tried to regain contact towards them as late as September 2019.
Shifting Stance on Trans People
Chris's Facebook profile picture in March 2017
Nowadays, despite his far more obscure history with regards to trans people, Chris is widely known as a trans advocate, making many social media posts about the rights of trans people, and implementing trans characters in his comics. He's shown such sentiments since at least 2015, a year after he openly transitioned. On social media, Chris was noted for often times agreeing with prominent transgender figures.
Before officially transitioning, when Chris had declared himself a tomgirl, his stance towards his characters being transgender also shifted more positively. The most prominent example of this being Robee (formerly Robbie, now Roberta), who was initially written as being the youngest son of Sonichu and Rosechu. Chris decided to write an about Robee's transition in Sonichu 12, making it the main focus of the story "To Be or Naught a Tomgirl", which showed his decision to do so during his childhood, his evolution, and eventual transition. He similarly made Cera Rosechu and Christine Rosechu into tomboys. He also showed his support to the trans community by starting up a new band, Robee Sonee and the Tomgirls, consisting of the three of them.
On 16 April 2015, Chris had found an article on a recent episode of Ellen DeGeneres' talk show that dealt with transgender rights. There, Chris states that trans people should use whatever bathrooms best aligns with their gender identities.[37]
Chris also follows LGBT News, which sometimes covers transgender-related topics. In May 2017, he commented on a post from them which linked to a theoretical article about a possible surgery for trans-women to become pregnant.[38]
“
Ah-Ha! I Knew it! I can eventually be a mother! :)
”
In a 26 July 2017 tweet, during Donald Trump's first presidency, Chris reacts to Trump's ban for trans people in the military, comparing Trump to Scrooge McDuck from DuckTales.[39]
@realDonaldTrump How dare you Trump?! Quell your Phobias and Paranoias already! Cheapness is a Terrible Trait too. Invest Back into what you've taken from. 😠
Also, you will Never be as rich as Scrooge McDuck, because aside from the money, he Actually gets L💖ve And Respect from His Family & Friends
A screenshot from Chris blocking Caitlyn
Being a self-proclaimed "Lesbian Trans Woman", Trump's anti-trans policy would only naturally serve as being one of several things that made Chris despise him, even when a lot of his other policies during his first term didn't affect Chris personally. Chris had also blocked Caitlyn Jenner, a transgender media personality and athlete, on 7 November 2024 due to her supporting Trump, who had around that time expressed plans to pass anti-trans legislature, and afterwards signed executive orders that affected transgender people at a much larger scale.[40]
Outside of Sonichu and Rosechu's children, Chris has gradually come to terms with Rosechu being depicted as a hermaphrodite, albeit somewhat hesitantly at first. This was ironically due to troll influence, primarily from the Idea Guys. On 6 December 2017, Chris confirmed that she was indeed, born male, and that she had gotten a sex change operation prior to the events of Sonichu 8, allowing her to birth children. One of the Idea Guys explained how they were able to convince Chris of this.[41]
“
I pretended to be both Sonichu and Rosechu, who borrowed my computer. All it took was a little knowledge on Sonichu and Chris believes he’s talking to his “children”.
Basically Rosechu admitted it when she told Chris she evolved from a male Raichu.
”
Idea Guy[41]
Following this, Chris made a poll on Twitter, asking fans if Rosechu should remain a trans woman, or get retconned back to being a woman at birth.[42] More than half of the fans voted for Rosechu to be trans, which caused Chris to delete the poll.[43] Chris finally fully accepted Rosechu being trans, portraying her as such in Sonichu #0 HD.
Chris also appears to be on good terms with the transgender Twitch streamer Keffals, infamous for her feud with the Kiwi Farms, which in itself used to be a site that focused solely on Chris. Keffals decided to get herself involved in Christory, likely with Chris reaching out to her. Chris's relationship with Keffals can be seen with the posts from him that have been uncovered in the Catboy Ranch Discord server, as well as an interview that she had with Chris.
Prior to this, Chris had expressed his opinions on Keffals' feud with the Farms in volume 8 of the Goddess Logs. There he rants about Null attacking her "immensely", and took solace in the site temporarily being taken down.[44]
On 5 February 2025, Chris had expressed favor towards trans women playing in women's sports, posting a GIF that promoted this on Twitter, and replying to a post that pointed out that Trump made it illegal.[45][46]

Notes
↑ It should be noted that the term "tranny" wasn't universally recognized as a slur at the time, and instead a common term for trans people. This conversation was also before he openly transitioned, where he also referred to himself as a "tranny".
