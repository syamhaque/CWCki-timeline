“
The couples of the world kiss,
But unfortunately for few,
They are interrupted by their parents.
”
Chris, in a love poem he wrote in High School exactly nine years before. GodBear could not have planned it better.[1]
Bob Walks In is the most famous of the Julie cybersex chats, in which Chris is caught mass debating by his late father, Bob.

What Chris imagines Julie looks like...
At the time of this particular chat, the Chandler family home only had one computer, and it was in the kitchen. This means that every time Chris wanted to engage in cybersex, he would be doing it in the middle of a place where people prepare food, and probably wouldn't want navy dripping all over it.
On Valentine's Night, 2009, Chris was on an e-date with his then-sweetheart Julie, and once again engaged in some hot furry sex, similar to the night before. Chris was moaning sexy, sweaty nothings into the microphone as he furiously pounded his bent duck. Unbeknownst to Chris, trolls were tipped off that he was mass debating and were dedicated to having Chris experience an awkward moment that would require Bob to see his son stroking his pickle, yelling like a horny slow-in-the-mind. Four calls were made, the first three failing as Bob told them that Chris was "sleeping" (even though Chris was screaming "JULAAAAY" at the time). Miscreants agent Bryan Bash provided the final call, stating "OH MY GOD, CHRIS MADE A VIDEO ON YOUTUBE AND SAID HE'S GOING TO KILL HIMSELF! YOU GOTTA STOP HIM!".
Within seconds, Bob dropped the phone, ran up the stairs, and walked into his son's most intimate moment, being justifiably horrified. In a rare moment of parental authority, he threatened to punish Chris by "cuttin' the Internet down right now." Chris, used to having things his way throughout his whole life, was appalled, confused, and no longer aroused. The recording ends after Bob's many futile attempts to shut down the computer finally succeed.
This can be considered the pinnacle of the ongoing CWC saga, as it represents a moment where Chris actually feels negative repercussions for his Internet behavior. It contains many memorable lines and is the height of emotional drama.
Julie's side of this erotic scene can be read here.
Prelude
The following is Chris's phone sex session with Julie prior to Bob walking in. Throughout this whole audio, Chris bangs into stuff and whacks his keyboard while mass debating and making slurping sounds, suggesting Chris fails at performing even imaginary cunnilingus. If you value your sanity, it is advised that you do not read this transcript because Chris's session is supposedly sexy, but in all fairness, just isn't.
Chris Gets Started
Hey, Julie! Zlkavszka. Ah yeah, good, you're on me. Alright, alright... you do that, mmmm. [Two Windows beeps and several licking sounds] Oh... [rustling, possibly taking off clothes; five rapid Windows beeps] Ooooh...! Oh-ho-ho! Alright, yeah, I'm [indistinct] clothes.

(faps even harder, colliding into objects) Mmm... I was kind of expecting this myself. (faps even harder) Yeah... So do I... mmmm... (fapping is quite loud at this point) Ahhhh! MMm... (phone rings) Mmm... Mmmm... I love you too, Julie... you are, you are...
It's very good. Mmm... Ohhhh yeah, it's awesome... Awesome. Ah... ah yeah... (fapping speeds up) Mmm... Go ahead, be rougher, rougher... Mmmm... Ahhh... MMm... Oh yeah... mmm... Oh yeah, yeah...

C'mon Julie... mmf... ahhh... mmm... mmm... oh yeah...
(Bob walks in at this point, about 17 minutes and 56 seconds in. Chris stops masturbating.)
