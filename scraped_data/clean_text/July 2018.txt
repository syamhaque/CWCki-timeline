“
I am only going to say this Once for those who may think me as delusional, crazy or shit like that. I am Not delusional, crazy, or anything of the sort.
I have my own magic powers that I am still learning about for myself from my family and allies.
I’ve already talked with psychiatrists and therapists years ago, so any new such meetings would be a very moot point.
”
Chris, 22 July.
