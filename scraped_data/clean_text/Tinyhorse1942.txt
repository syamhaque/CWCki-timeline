TinyHorse's profile Likes list, liking a tweet by Chris's main Twitter account
tinyhorse1942, aka TinyHorse, is a Twitter account suspected to be a sock used by Chris for evading blocks on his main account. The account was created in March 2021. Posts strongly resembling Chris's writing style appeared in January 2024. The account name is derived from Caden Peck's online handle tinyhorse01, possibly meaning Caden gave the account to Chris. It is used mainly to follow several of the current and previous TF2 Analysts, ProjectSNT, Nowacking and Gleamy Dreams, all of whom have blocked Chris's main account on Twitter, as well as several Finnish learning platforms. Nowadays, it has devolved into another channel of the typical anti-G5 protests.

I’m having doubts about my content. What would you guys want to see if we continued it? Or what do you like about it?
TinyHorse
Personally, I saw your passion light up when it came to Discord and John DeLancy in the views of that which is good out of the chaos and bad.
I’d say explore something unique that is you from that and what else you find that feels right with you; something animated.

Block Arguing
3 February
TIShadow6 and Jasper Pie comment about blocking Chris's main Twitter account CPU_CWCSonichu. TinyHorse is defensive over the blocks.
Shadow
Well, that was a second of utter fear to have this morning.
ANYWAYS,
Day 2 of @HarmonyPonyCon
[posts an image of CPU_CWCSonichu following Shadow's account]
Dennison
did you block them?
Shadow
I did, yes.
TinyHorse
Why?
What did she ever personally do to you?
Do you actually know her personally enough to warrant such an action?
It’s Like in that DJPon3 song, “Don’t judge somepony that you don’t even know.
In this business, it don’t matter if you’re music’s fast or slow.”
If you only blocked her for simply her following you or even just the “Drama”, well I gotta say that is just disappointing.
[posts a gif of a cartoon rabbit shaking its head]
Jasper Pie
I blocked him too.... guess he "forgot."
TinyHorse
Why?
Jasper Pie
Why did I block him or why did he "forget?"
TinyHorse
Why did you block her?
And forget what?
What did she ever personally do to you?
Do you actually know her personally enough to warrant such an action?
Jasper Pie
I found her behavior to be inappropriate, she made me feel very uncomfortable at a convention where she stared at me and tried to follow me, and I really just didn't want to get involved in the drama.
TinyHorse
Have you ever thought that she might have been a fan who recognized you after having watched some of your videos?
I know from one convention I went to, I actually saw TheLostNarrator in the vendor hall, but I was having a tough time recognizing. TLN might have felt that with me.

While I am sure that people have taken their dislike of G5 too far in some cases, it for me hasn't been able to hook me in the same way G4 did. If you enjoy G5 that is perfectly okay and well within yours and all others' right and no one can take it away from you.

The character designs of Tell Your Tale may take some getting used to at first, compared to Make Your Mark, but one thing they do well is reflect and keep consistent the divergent sizes and physiques of the new Mane 6, when that sort of variety seemed rather limited in G4. #MLPG5

Have you not realized G5 is literally Russian Propaganda; do not even acknowledge #MLPG5.
There is evidence on the MLPG5 website.
Russian Fliers for even Pony Life Preceeded English Fliers.
Everything #MLPG5 needs to be destroyed and trashed like Russian Vodka.

Okay we get it, you hate watched something you already didn’t like, there’s still no need for more videos like this. Like literally, there’s like so many videos giving hate or negativity to G5. Can we move on? 😔
