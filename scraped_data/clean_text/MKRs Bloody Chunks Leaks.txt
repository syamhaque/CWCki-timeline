On 27 January 2020, a Kiwi Farms user by the name of "MKRs Bloody Chunks" leaked chats between several Watchmen members and Chris from both the Arbitarch and The Place servers.[1]
Ugh, Incest
Unknown date
So, last night, on fated instinct, as you all may have read, I typed up the think piece on the relationship between myself and Christine Chan with Sonichu and Rosey, and how we are not biologically their parents, but we still had the had in creating/chronicling them, respectively. And all that was to dispute and cease the, ugh, Incest bullshit.
And that the two of them refer to us as their parental figures as we were recognized as their guardians, in addition to and aside from Magi-Chan being a guardian over all Sonichu and Rosechu kind, and I being the central most Sonichu out of the entire species.
And I've had to think on explaining the reasoning of them referring to me and Christine Chan as their parents, in a respecting sense of our roles we play for and in their lives.
And then, Dillin (Gah), goes on to make a video with the subtitle, "My Mistake, You're Not the Father." That pissed me off.
