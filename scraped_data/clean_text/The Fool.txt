Invitation to The Place
“
don't worry this is far too autistic for me to care about
I just want to shitpost about chris
”
The Fool on why he left The Place.[1]
Naught brought up the possibility of inviting The Fool onto The Place on 24 April 2021 after mentioning The Fool's interest in Tarot.[2] When The Fool was eventually invited, he occasionally talked to Chris about his various fantasies.
On 21 June 2021, The Fool tells Chris to cherish his personal belongings after Chris admits to being so stressed out at a reminder of him losing his copy of Sonic CD to the point of crapping himself.
Knights of CWC
The Fool had interacted with Chris several times when they were on the Knights server. [1] When The Fool joins the Knights server, the WCT also explains to him the reason why he splintered from the Watchmen, citing the behaviors of the appropriately named Toxic Trio.[1]
When Chris joined the Knights server, The Fool decided to post a comic layout guide for Chris to implement, commenting that it might be interesting even though Chris doesn't draw comics anymore. Chris responds to this by stating that he still does make comics, having drawn over 100 while "in Soinchu's body", and that all of them would be completed by the time the Merge happens.
On 12 July, Kyle informs The WCT about Jacob Sockness' plan to attend Everfree Northwest in disguise with the intent of meeting Chris there.[3] In turn, The WCT warned Chris about this.[4] To combat this issue, The Fool suggested the idea of Chris having bodyguards attend with him at Everfree, those of which later being Bella and Fiona. The WCT agreed to this arrangement, which sparks discussions about strategies to keep Chris safe at Everfree. The Fool also saw further support for this idea when one of the Knights suggested that Chris might not recognize Sockness due to his facial blindness.[5]
Outside of these plans, The Fool has also complimented Chris's art, which he has posted on the Knights server, several times. On 19 July, The Fool comments on TSSSF cards that Chris made for Null, calling them lovely, as well as two art pieces he's made for the convention.[6] On 22 July, The Fool and Anaxis complimented a drawing Chris made of The Last Supper.[7]
The Fool has also commented on Chris's rage over G5 toys.[8] Though on the first layer of the server, he seemingly congratulates Chris for his "hard work" in stopping Hasbro's wrongdoings, he mocks these efforts in the second layer.
Espionage
“
should I play dumb and go like "where'd chris go???" in the place or is that too on-the-nose
I'm so tempted to tease them
yeah fuck it I'm gonna do it, I don't know if they know my role or not but I'm gonna play dumb just to see if it's funny
”
The Fool planning to fuck with the Watchmen.[9]
Out of revenge from getting doxed by Naught, The WCT wanted to take down the Watchmen, dox Naught back, and replace the group with his splinter group, the Knights of CWC. Having already successfully swayed Chris away from the Watchmen after his interview with him, having told him all that the Toxic Trio did to enrage him,[10] The WCT also discussed plans to create a thread on the now defunct Kiwi Farms splinter lolcow.org, exposing the Watchmen.[11] In the background, MKR and Kyle were trying to win Chris back after he left The Place, adding an extra layer of complication to The WCT running his newly formed group.
Since Chris left The Place server and joined the Knights server, right as the latter was being set up, The Fool served as a double agent for The WCT to check what was going on in the server following The WCT getting banned, and also give him advice on posts and threads he'd be making on the Kiwi Farms and other sites.[12] There, he feigns being in the dark about Chris leaving The Place, and acts concerned for him leaving. Back on the Knights server, where they discuss how the server should be set up to accommodate Chris, The Fool continued messing with the Trio, and leaked screenshots with them from The Place and elsewhere, including the conversations he's had with them regarding Chris, onto the Knights server's second layer.[9]
A part of this included him telling MKR that she could win Chris back by guilt-tripping him.[13][14][15] The Fool had purportedly made suggestions to MKR out of genuine concerns for wanting Chris to have a good relationship with MKR, feeling pity for MKR. However, The Fool also suggested to The WCT that he tell Chris to block the Trio, which WCT did in a voice chat with him.
After Kyle and MKR had stated that WCT had lied to Chris in his interview,[16] telling him that the WCT had said worse things about Chris, The Fool also tells The WCT that he should be honest and share the full conversation that he had with Naught, noting that Chris liked WCT's honesty. The Fool had been considering telling Chris about this, but he opted not to because he thought that this would mean telling Chris he was being manipulated as an omniscient goddess.
Incest Drama
On 5 July, The Fool joined a voice chat about Chris's "Older Lady Friend" with Chris and the Knights.[17] When Chris gives vague ideas to The WCT about who the "Lady Friend" was, The Fool states that Chris found his "replacement Barb", seemingly unaware just who the "Lady Friend" actually was.[18] The Fool later expresses disbelief that Chris was actually having sex with his mom after Anaxis shared the first Incest Call leaks on the second layer.[19] When The WCT begins interrogating Bella about her role in the Incest Call, The Fool also joined a group chat set up by WCT, Regarding Chris, where they continued the discussion with Bella.[20] There The Fool continually poked holes in Bella's lies about the situation.[21] The Fool eventually was convinced, floored by Chris's affair. He then advocated for this new information to be put on the CWCki.[22] Following various chats from the Knights Server and the Regarding Chris group chat getting leaked, one of the Mean Girls leaked DMs of MKR interrogating The Fool.[23] This caused some of of the spread of gossip surrounding The WCT, with the group's leader Spooky Bones accusing him and another one of the Knights, Para, of covering up for Anaxis.[24]
