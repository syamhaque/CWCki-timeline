Troll disclosure: This persona was created, appropriated, or otherwise used by trolls to manipulate Chris. Though this identity is contrived, the CWCki may treat it as if it were a real identity because it was to Chris. (It's also funnier that way.)

Bob Walks In
Main article: Bob Walks In
During Valentine's Night, 2009, Chris was having erotic phone sex with Julie. While this was going on, the Miscreants were calling into Chris's home in an attempt to get Bob to go upstairs and have an awkward encounter with his son during phone-coitus. After four attempts, it was Bryan that finally got Bob to run up the stairs after frantically telling him Chris uploaded a video where he described that he was going to kill himself.
The Hookers
Main article: Hooker incident
During March 2009, after Chris failed to win over Emily as his sweetheart, Bryan decided that he would assist Chris in his quest to lose his virginity by sending over a group of prostitutes to his home. Clyde later made a call to Chris about their visit and recorded their conversation. At the end of the call, after Barbara joined in, Bryan joined in and asked if their refrigerator was running. When Barbara went to hang up the phone, Bryan made a joke about using the Poké Flute, which may be in reference to Barb's nickname Snorlax.[1]
2009 Leaks
From mid to late 2009, Bryan was able to successfully obtain and leak a handful of things that Chris’ private information. Beginning in June of 2009, Bryan hacked into Chris's YouTube account and found a message that Chris had sent to Seth McFarlane. Three months later, in September of 2009, Bryan got a hold of one of Chris’ most infamous smut drawings, known as
CWCRockin4Way.jpg. After another two months passed, in November of 2009 Bryan leaked a handful of Chris's calls. These include the Father Call, audio between Chris and Kacey's dad, the Kacey and Liquid Call, and conversations Chris had with Jack Thaddeus.
Additional Trolling
Bryan Bash briefly participated in the 8th Mumble chat. While Mr. Roboto was speaking with Chris, Bryan interrupted him and asked Roboto if his name was "Nice Russian Guy"?, to which Roboto corrected him.
