In 2011, Chris became a girlfriend-free tomgirl.

2011 was the third and arguably one of the darkest years since the discovery of the Internet's favorite lolcow, Christian Weston Chandler. In 2011, Chris turned 29. The year started out in the shadow of Chris's sixth declaration of leaving the Internet. In spite of this, Chris took refuge on the PlayStation Network, which has allowed the occasional bit of new material to surface, like the revelation that Chris really does enjoy wearing women's clothing.
Two major events punctuated the later half of the year. The first was the death of Chris's father Bob in early September. The second event occurred a month later, when Chris and Barb were both arrested for multiple offenses, including trespassing, assault and failure to stop at the GAMe PLACe. Chris and Barb were bailed out two days later. Barbara appeared in court on the 31st of October, Chris on the 7th of November.
They went back in front of the judge in April 2012. As a result of these events, many of Chris's observers decided to let Chris be, leaving 2011 to be the third and final year of organized trolling.

Not much happened this month. Just as it was expected of him, Chris bought LittleBigPlanet 2, and spent most of the last half of the month playing it. On a more interesting note, Chris's pseudonym JenkinsJinkies was outed, and his exploits on the Trollin Train forums from July-August 2010 were made public.
February

This month saw the release of several of Chris's LittleBigPlanet 2 levels, including CWC's Collector's Case Tutorial and the Autism Tutorials.

Chris in March, becoming a Tomgirl
An old pile of phone calls way back from the Liquis/Kacey saga was released to the Internet at the beginning of the month. Meanwhile, Chris began experimenting with crossdressing, beginning the largest metasaga since Chris's discovery.

Trolls use the PSN security breach as a cover to leak revealing pictures of Chris showing off his "Tomgirl" side.
May

The PSN came back online, and Chris immediately deleted the "I am Tomgirl." quote. However, he later joined the Tomboys And Tomgirls of Virginia forum, where all TRUE and HONEST Tomgirls and Tomboys hang out.
June
Main article: June 2011
Chris changed his PSN quote to "I No Socialize Online", published a Flipnote and changed his voicemail message a few times. He also continued posting on the Tomboys And Tomgirls of Virginia forum, revealing some of the most disturbing stuff to date.
July

After months of minimal activity, Chris's internet presence increased markedly during July. His participation in the Tomboys And Tomgirls of Virginia forum was discovered, after which Chris publicly announced his true identity to the other members. Chris also created a new Facebook account, contradicting his prior claim regarding online socialization, and logged back into his long-dormant YouTube account. Chris made several videos for Jackie (Chris and Jackie's Date, Who's Your Brony?, Forgot the Glitter‎ and Cakefarts) which weren't leaked until February 2012.
August

August began with Chris and his tom-pals planning vengeance against the CWCki. Soon thereafter, Chris broke his lengthy internet hiatus by returning to YouTube and uploading a series of videos throughout August in which he claims to have information on the true identities of a number of trolls, including Surfshack Tito and Jack Thaddeus. These videos called for each troll to first upload a video of their own apologizing for their crimes against Chris, and then leave the internet forever. An earthquake and major hurricane hit Virginia during this month, but unfortunately, this did not stop Chris from uploading videos.
September

Chris in September, at Mal-Wart
September began with Chris on a high, having unmasked Jack Thaddeus, Alec Benson Leary and Thorg, and forcing Surfshack Tito to leave the Internet. Sadly, on 6 September, Chris's father Bob died, and his funeral took place on 11 September. After that, nothing was heard from Chris.
October
Main article: October 2011
On 18 October, Chris tried to sell an old TV (presumably Bob's) on Craigslist for more than $250, suggesting that the Chandlers' financial situation has only gotten worse since Bob's death. An incident occurred at the GAMe PLACe on 28 October, leading to the arrest of Chris and Barbara.
November
Main article: November 2011
Chris uploaded pics of Michael Snyder onto the CWCki, and appeared in court to be charged with trespass, misdemeanor assault and failure to stop at the scene of an incident.
December
Main article: December 2011
Chris and Barb were tried on 15 December 2011. It was a blue C-Mas indeed. However, he still didn't get a pretty girlfriend for Christmas.
