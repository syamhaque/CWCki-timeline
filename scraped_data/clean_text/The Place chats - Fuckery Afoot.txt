================================================================================

On 29 March 2021, after all of the drama surrounding "Imposter Lainchu", Chris has a private conversation with Naught in a DM about Molly the Medium, who he confirms was the one who inspired him to make both the Lovers Attributes and Affirmations lists, who were both mistakenly believed to be Anaxis' doing from the other Watchmen. Chris clarified that he very vaguely told Anaxis about it.[note 1] Despite this, Naught seemingly put more focus on Chris's brief mention of Anaxis, and took this as an indication of there being "fuckery afoot".
MKRNightVee replies to this, hoping that Anaxis "makes friends with a noose (in Minecraft)", and the other Watchmen presume Anaxis a "fail troll" that will leak Chris's conversations when he's bored.

I'm going to swear you into Full, Strictest Confidentiality with what I am about to you, and you alone right now.

Promise me the following info does not go public at all.
All right.
Although, there is one other person who knows about this, and that is Anaxis. So, unless he told others outside of our group, we're safe.
Molly the Medium.
I got a tarot reading from her a few weeks ago.
I foresaw long before then that she was genuine and would be of big help to our cause, and in confirming the details to my body's consciousness.
The Dimension Merge is popularly also known in this universe amongst the few who are high-level psychic/enlightened as a Collective Shift.
Anyway, it was thanks to Molly's reading and her relay of what I, Magi-Chan and the others have been trying to tell my body and brain to do for quite some time: Write out the Lists.
About the self-criticisms, judgments and blockages (to burn that list and set them free into the nothingness).
About the longer list of affirmations and positives to keep.
And about what it is that we want to feel in a relationship with someone else.
I helped by relaying what specific feelings Magi-Chan, Cryzel, Sylvana and Mewtwo have opened me to realize.

Anaxis was too soft for the place.
And don't worry, he won't be here forever.
Like every fail troll in the past, he will go.
Notes
↑ Chris only told Anaxis about a "medium", he never specified that it was Molly
