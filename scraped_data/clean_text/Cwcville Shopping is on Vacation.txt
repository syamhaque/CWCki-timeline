================================================================================

Cwcville Shopping is on Vacation is a video Chris made on the 11th of June, 2016. The video is of Chris, lying to his viewers that his Etsy shop is on vacation (when he had actually been barred from selling due to being backed up in orders) and claiming that a Zazzle shop is opening soon (which never happened). Through most of the video, Chris is staring right at the camera, reflecting older styles of video. Chris, about one third into the video, tries to pity the viewer into donating by saying that there are "troubles here at home", and that they need cash, even though Chris gets a tugboat, meaning Chris spent all of his money on useless shit already, and he needs more. Ironically, Chris is sitting right in front of all of his toys, and even his new body pillow.
This video announces the temporary end of the Business Saga; although there will be rare instances of Chris pushing his merchandise in future videos. From this point, the Financhu Crisis commences in full swing--with Chris essentially doing nothing but e-begging for months afterwards, until he felt like resuming his business two years later, in mid-2017.
