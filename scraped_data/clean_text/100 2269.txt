Manipulation Disclosure: The views Chris
expresses may or may not be his own. Many of Chris's videos were orchestrated behind the scenes by trolls putting ideas in his head or goading him to act out; the majority of these interactions was never released to the public.
100 2269 is the second of three videos Chris uploaded on 7 October 2010. In this video, Chris has his Gitar of Fail out again, but this time actually uses it to play The Beatles's "A Day in the Life" on The Beatles: Rock Band, warbling tunelessly along with the track. He mentions Jackie at least once in the video, saying he will "turn her on". Chris is wearing what appears to be a poorly made replica of Paul McCartney's Sgt. Pepper costume, crafted in construction paper. He is oblivious to the fact that John Lennon sang more in this song than Paul McCartney, along with not knowing that "turn you on" at the time the song was written meant to introduce someone to drugs. He's also oblivious to the fact that he looks, thinks, and acts like the man who killed John Lennon.

Transcript
[In a bad Cockney accent, instead of a bad Scouse accent which would be more accurate] Hello loves, good evening there. I'm Paul McCartney and I'm going to sing you a song. It's "A Day In The Life". And it is a good day. In the life. Yeah. It's a day for livin', it's a beautiful day over here in Virginia. Rock on England!
[Mic effect] Good evening, loves.
[Starts playing on the gitar]
I'll read the news today oh boy
About a luucky man who made the grade
And though the news was. b... rather sad!
I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in the car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure... he from... House of Lords... the Lords
I saw a film today oh boy
The English army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Haa..ving read the book
I love to tuuuurn youuu oon...
Woo...
[Chris misses many notes in the solo]
Woke- Woke up, fell out of bed, dragged a comb across myy head...
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I had a tickle...uh...huh...huh (?)
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
and Somebody spoke and said...eh...uh
Aahhaaahhhhhahahaaaaaaahhh
I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you on
Yeah Jackie, I'd love to turn you on too girl. [Chuckles]
[Plays to the end, pointlessly hitting the whammy bar]
Longest note you've ever heard, huh? I wish it would end already... Jeez, will ya end already ya dang note?
[At 5:23 a high-pitched feedback noise can be heard, which lasts till the end of the video.]
[Goes to turn camera off]
I'll spare you the sentiments.
