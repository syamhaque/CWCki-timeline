================================================================================

"It's Raining Dykes" is the 8th track from SPARKLE like you mean it: ROBEE'S BALLAD by Robee Sonee and the Tomgirls. It is a cover of the song "It's Raining Men" by The Weather Girls, except Chris replaces the word "men" with "dykes", before spending the rest of the song trying to justify his stupid rewording.
It is worth noting that "It's Raining Men" is often considered to be a gay anthem.
The clumsy "Yikes!" rhyme is likely a reference to the South Park episode named "D-Yikes!".

The street's a place to go,
'Cause t'night for the... the first time,
Just about half past YIKES!

Rough and tough and strong and swee-ee-eeeeeet,

(A brief period of Chris just fiddling with the mic, then the song cuts out.)
