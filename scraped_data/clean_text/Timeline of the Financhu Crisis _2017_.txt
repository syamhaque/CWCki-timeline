Chris implores people to buy his $1,000 stamp album, because he had already spent the money from selling the totem. He also states he will mail it later in the week.
14th - Barb begs, claiming she needs money to pay an overdue power bill, while wearing the $400 necklace Chris had bought her a week before. Six hours later, Chris records a 23-minute video of him playing with expensive toys. He also explains that he had used part of the Totem sale money to service his credit card debt.

18th - Chris begs to Cole for the second time this month.
19th - Chris's Paypal account is in the red by over $1,450, because he had failed to ship the Sonic Totem; as a result, the buyer filed a dispute and eBay or Paypal placed a temporary hold on the $1,500, pulling it from Chris's account.He lists six Sonichu drawings, from 2014, at $2,000 for the lot.Then, he digs through 10 to 20 bags of wet, moldy clothes, left over from the Destruction Of Chris's House three years before, and finds The Classic shirt.

What Cole would have seen if he had clicked on the Paypal.me link Chris tweeted to him while begging this month.
What Cole would have really paid.
5th - On eBay, Chris halves the prices on two listings: his stamp album (again), to $250; and a collection of Sonichu drawings from 2014, to $1,000. He begs people to buy on Facebook.
5th - In a jaw-dropping display of hypocrisy, Chris mocks Cole Smithey on Twitter for requesting donations on Patreon.
5th - Chris claims his bank account is in the red for the second time in a week due to the auto-pay for one of his bills, echoing the exact problem Barb claimed in the previous month. Chris's Monthly Tugboat had deposited $1,300 to him two days beforehand. He also realizes that The Classic bidder won't be paying for it.
8th - Over the course of a week, Chris had spent $90 on six new PS4 games, even though he had said his bank account was in the red. PSN allows Paypal for purchases, so Chris was either lying or being financially irresponsible by using his Paypal to fund the purchases instead of transferring the money to his bank.
8th - After 561 days since the last update to the Sonichu comic, which he had been paid over $1,000 to do, Chris resumes work on it. He requests donations and pledges to his Patreon for his effort. A day later, he had gotten zero new pledges.
10th - Chris again halves the price on the Sonichu drawings, to $500, and begs for a sale, stating, "my mom and I could do with some more money, please".
11th - Chris links to his new Paypal.me account and begs for financial help.
11th - Barb is allowing her bank account to be in the red after a mortgage payment. Less than a week after mocking Cole for not reconciling with Barb, Chris begs him for money, asking for $1,000.
14th - Another livestream of Chris drawing Sonichu comic pages is recorded, clocking in at 1 hour and 38 minutes of footage. Chris begs for $10 donations or pledges to Patreon in the video description.
15th - Chris records himself using Photoshop for an hour and a half. He begs for his audience to "PLEASE DONATE BIG NOW!" It should be noted that he filmed himself surrounded by expensive electronics, such as the PS4 camera and laptop (possibly a newly-acquired one, as it had not been mentioned by Chris before).
16th - Chris tries to beg from Cole again, still asking for $1,000.
17th - The Chandlers pay the first half of the 2017 property tax for 14 Branchland Court, costing them $606.83.[8]
19th - After announcing that Sonichu 11 pages will be ready in a few days, Chris begs for handouts. Later that day, he discovers that his cat, Sorbet, had been seriously injured and takes him to a vet.
24th - Chris begs for handouts on video, claiming to need money for food and mentioning that he was charged $160 for Sorbet's vet bill. He demands for donations to be at least a dollar and suggests a $10 minimum. An hour later, he uploads another video, angered at having received a donation of less than a dollar. In the second video, Barb appears and joins in the begging, requesting money for meal replacement shakes.
25th - Chris links to the first of the previous day's videos on Facebook and begs again. He also deletes the second video.
