Chris's accurate depiction of his MySpace - his only friend is Sonichu
MySpace is a social networking website founded in 2003, known for its dominance on the Internet in the 2000s, and its declining zombie-like state ever since the 2010s. Chris created an account to attract boyfriend-free girls during his battle against Mary Lee Walsh.[1] He seems to have created an account in early 2004. Chris had two accounts, presumably because he forgot the password to one of them. His first account was "sonichu," where his name was Chris. It was last accessed in October 2005. His new account was "sonichucwc," where his name was Chris Chan. This account got hacked by the Man in the Pickle Suit in the events of 11 September 2008 (NEVER FORGET). Some additional information is available, thanks to early research and hacks.
Three archived snapshots of Chris's pages have been preserved. The first is of his "sonichu" account as it was frozen on 17 October 2005. It is reproduced below. It is brief, optimistic, and - for Chris - relatively inoffensive.
The second snapshot is of his "sonichucwc" account; Chris had last accessed it on 4 July 2008. We see that Chris treated his MySpace page the same way he treated his Sonichu website, adding more and more material over time until it became cluttered and bloated. This page is also reproduced below. It shows Chris in the immediate aftermath of rejection by Megan Schroeder, and the page is full of self-pity and desperation.
The third snapshot is of his "sonichucwc" account when it had been last accessed two months later, on 4 September 2008. This page is not reproduced in its entirety, but the few changes he had made since July are noted. In particular, Megan was no longer a "favorite gal-pal," but his mood was improved, and a lot of self-pitying language had been expunged. Also in evidence is his futile war with Encyclopedia Dramatica and the growing awareness of trolls to his existence.
Because we have four versions of his sweetheart requirements, these have been grouped together to illustrate his changing mood over time. Chris was forever tweaking this, looking for the magic formula which would unlock a Boyfriend-Free Girl.
Chris stopped using the site in late 2009, as MySpace began to gradually wane in favor of Facebook and Twitter, although he seemingly logged in a final time around 2015 and changed the account's display name to "Brock Samson". In addition, almost all user-generated content was permanently deleted after a site redesign in 2013, leaving both of Chris's profiles practically blank, and a server migration in 2019 caused the remaining user generated content from before 2016 to be lost as well, leaving them completely blank.[2]. Six equally long-abandoned accounts remain in his "connections" list.

Gotta catch 'em all!

Movies: I like a lot of different movies, but my all time favorite is Mary Poppins.
Television: Family Guy, old cartoons, old-time TV shows like I Love Lucy

About Me: I'm young at heart. I'm currently writing a comic book, and I've written quite a few issues so far. I am a bit shy, but I would enjoy the company of a beautiful girl who likes some of the things I do. I also like to have fun when I can, and I don't really like to be alone.
I graduated from high school on the Honor Roll, and I am doing very well at PVCC. A lot of men make false promises to their girlfriends, but I am totally different. When it comes to what I can offer, I can seriously promise care, respect, empathy, and love. I think that (most) girls deserve the world, and I would do my best to give it to them.
I haven't had the best of luck with girlfriends in my past. There was a lot of lying and backstabbing done to me, and I'm looking for someone who is honest and will love me for me.

Hey, thanks for the add! Does your Commodore 64 still work? My brother and I loved ours but it finally gave out some time while we were in high school. I think the neighbor's son broke it, but he never confessed! Hmm...

Chris Chan's Interests
General
I enjoy drawing, listening to music, playing video games and Pokemon or Yu-Gi-Oh card games. I also like anime, creating with Lego pieces, My Little Pony, Transformers, and I love my parents. And sometimes, I work on my website at http:sonichuchandler.tripod.com/cwcson.htm. As for my video game systems, I have a Commodore 64 computer, NES, Game Boy, GB Color, GBA, GBA SP, SNES, Genesis/Sega CD/32-X, Game Gear, Sega Saturn, Sega Dreamcast, Nintendo 64, PS2, PSP, Nintendo Gamecube and a Nintendo DS.
I would feel a lot better when a woman who is interested in me is the one who does the "Date Asking." In short, I feel that I really need a "Sadie Hawkins" situation.
[Image] My two favorite Ponies; Waterfire and Star Catcher. :)
[By 4 September 2008, he had deleted all images of ponies and indicated that most of his time nowadays was taken up playing Guitar Hero.]
Music
All types of music, as long as it has a good tune. :) But I Really Like Britney Spears (no matter what they all say)! My favorite song from "Air Britney" would be E-Mail My Heart. And, in comparison to my 3-year old situation; wishing, hoping and praying that a Boyfriend-Free Girl would Personally Approach My Heart. I have my own set of songs that I sing too. So, I, Christian Chandler, am Number 2 on my Top Favorite Singers List. 8-) I also like: Backstreet Boys, Puffy AmiYumi, Excel Girls, The Steel Angels, N*Sync, C&C Music Factory, Daft Punk, Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Louis Armstrong, M2M, Hillary Duff, Jennifer Lopez, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Christopher Cross, Vanessa Carlton, Monica, Mariah Carry, And Others.
Here's one of the songs I sang, Yellow is a Mellow Color

About Me:
*Please be sure to read ALL of the "Who I'd Like to Meet" section.*
Heeeerrrreeee's...
Christian
Weston
Chandler
PLEASE NOTE, IF you, the single woman, are Honestly, Seriously Interested in starting a Sweetheart Relationship with me, ..Look Me Up In Person..; I do not feel comfortable with starting a relationship over-the-internet, period. As long as you live in or within 25 miles of Ruckersville, VA, that is the distance I feel most comfortable traveling to meet up with you.
I am young at heart, because I enjoy the seemingly child-like things I do like playing with Sonic the Hedgehog, Yu-Gi-Oh, Pokemon, Legos, My Little Pony, and drawing cartoonishly. I am also creator of my Electric-Hedgehog Pokemon, Sonichu. I have been drawing and writing comic books, and I've drawn/written quite a few issues so far. I have graduated from Manchester High School on the Honor Roll, and I have graduated from PVCC with two Computer Aided Drafting & Design Degrees May, 2006. I am shy, but I would really enjoy the company of a pretty girl who likes some of the things I do, with a few opposite traits (excluding smokers and drunks). I also like to have fun when I can, and I don't like to be alone. I would prefer Person-to-person encounters/chats instead of over the internet, but please feel free to send me a message or comments.
I would also like to mention The Sonichu Group is open for suggestions and comments. Thank You.
I would also like to take this moment to mention The DVD of my life: Christian Weston Chandler... Yep, I'm On T.V. :) You may learn more about it in my About The Author Section on my Sonichu Site.
Not to brag, but I took two seperate [sic] HTML classes, and then learned more around the net. I highly reccomend learning HTML. Although HTML word processors and Generators spells out the details of a page in a nutshell, it really helps to know the language so you can jazz it up more your way later (in the Notepad or in the Profile/Group Editor). Learning to Know is Past Cool!
I SO Need a Cute Girl to make into a Sweetheart-Soulmate from the ground-up, because I DO NOT WANT TO BE ALONE AND SAD in the Long-Run.
Also, did you know that male/female couples live longer than a single person; I heard it on the John Tesh Radio Show.
And I HAVE A DREAM... I dream that I will become a Good Father for my future, daughter, who I will lovingly name *Crystal*, alongside my future Sweetheart/Soulmate (my future wife/her mother). :)
[The three short paragraphs above had been deleted by September 2008.]
I would feel better when a woman who is interested in me is the one who does the "Date Asking." In short, I feel that I need a "Sadie Hawkins" situation.
When getting my attention, please approach me and say Hi. Do NOT flirt from a distance; I will not be able to notice a long-distance flirt due to a thing called "Tunnel-Vision" (and High-Functional Autism). [Note: Chris set these last four words in a very small font size. By September he had deleted these last two sentences altogether.]
A lot of men make false promises to their girlfriends, but I am NOT among those JERKS. When it comes to what I can offer, I can seriously promise care, respect, empathy, and love to my Sweetheart. I Feel that Girls/Women deserve the best of our world, and I would do my best to give what I can of it to my Sweetheart/Soulmate.
I have not had the best of luck with my search for a Sweetheart-Soulmate in my past. There was a lot of lying and backstabbing done to me, and I'm looking for someone who is honest, caring and will love me for who I am.
These are my attemtps so far for custom ponies. They both are the same, but they were each made differently. The one on the left was made first, sculpted from Crayola Model Magic, then I glued some of my own hair for its mane and tail. Then after learning some newer tricks from CustomPony.com, I did a better job with the newer Cheroki-Chan (shown on the right). For rooting new hair in the mane, and pushing the trimmed roots inward, I highly reccomend getting a rehairing/rerooting tool, like the custom one sold by plat_drgn on eBay (I got one, and I was very satisfied). As for Paint, I reccomend acrylic paint (over enamle) which you can get at your local Wal-Mart, as well as small-tipped brushes.
Also, check out my new group designed for the people who make their own Custom Ponies and those who like to look at them.
And on that note, I would like to give props to Adult Swim's Seth Green for his Custom Ponies of different emotional colors; good job.
[Embedded Adult Swim video]
[By September 2008, all this pony nonsense had been deleted, probably because he associated it with Megan too closely.]
I can be reached through the Playstation Network through the Playstation 3 game system. My PSN ID is ..Sonichu..; I am open for friend requests over the PSN, as well as possible live chat with Playstation Eye, or headset.
[In September he added: "**Also, I play Guitar Hero, if you get lucky in an online search in GHIII, GHAerosmith, or upcoming GHWT, you may be challenged my well-self-taught Guitar Skills.**
"My stats are linked to my profile on [address].
"(I am More often reachable through the Playstation 3 and Playstation Portable)"]
Also, if you have a Nintendo DS, and the right game, I'm Wi-Fi capable. Here's my info for: Animal Crossing Wild World
You have to regester my Friend Code for this game in order for you to come visit Cwcville, Virginia.
Name: Chris
Town: Cwcville
Friend Code: 0558-9666-5003
I've punched in a few already, but I'm open for more (female) players. Also, if anyone read the "Crossing Guardian" in Nintendo Power Volume 179 (May, 2004 issue), I was responsible for the "Cwcville" documentary that took up majority of that page. 8)
[Chris then provided contact information for playing Mario Kart, Tetris, Star Fox Command, and Mario VS. Donkey Kong with him.]
Please Message me if you have added me to your Friends List. Thank You.

This is just Sonichu, Rosechu and me.

Chris's top friend on MySpace was "Chris's Future Sweetheart." Yes, he created a placeholder account for his top friend. He actually used this image.

Comments
The following are the non-spam comments which have been archived. Much of this was the result of Chris hitting on local women. When browsing through this list, it's instructive to know that Chris was discovered by 4chan and SomethingAwful around 26-31 October 2007. The trolls swoop in quickly.

Who I'd like to meet
[This section went through several iterations, not surprising since Chris has never been satisfied with his list of sweetheart requirements for the entirety of his Love Quest. Here are four variants, ordered chronologically.]
October 2005
Someone with a happy, positive personality, young at heart, very pretty, 18-23-years old, lives in, or around, the Charlottesville or Ruckersville (both in the state of Virginia) areas, smoke-free, non-alcholoic, white and does not already have a Boyfriend.
I'll treat you to a soda and a chat!
October 2007
“Here's the list of the Characteristics of the girl/woman I would like (remember, I AM Flexable on most characteristics, and these ARE NOT REQUIREMENTS. But ONLY if it is Bold, then that is required).
-18-24-Years Old
-Boyfriend-Free
-White
-Within 20 Miles of Zip Code 22968
-Under 230 Pounds
-Smoke-Free
-Non-Alcoholic ("Socially Drinks" is also Acceptable)
-Caring
-Pretty
-Cute
-Default Language = English
-(Hopefully) a Virgin
(Fooly Cooly knowledge optional (I'm not talking about the Anime))
-Under or equal to 5' 10"
-Open-Minded
-Young at Heart
-Employment Optional
-Graduated from at least High School (College Attendant is Cool)
-Fun-Lovin'
-Sweet
-Charming
And that about covers that. Please also check the "I Wouldn't Feel Comfortable Around" Blog as well for the SOLID Turn-Offs.”
July 2008
In a Nutshell...
I have been searching for a Girl with a happy, positive personality, young at heart, pretty, 18-25-years old, BOYFRIEND-FREE lives in, or around, the Charlottesville or Ruckersville (both in the state of Virginia) areas, smoke-free, non-alcholoic and white, whom I can make into a Sweetheart/Soulmate from the ground-up, for the past enduringly greater than FOUR-LONG-YEARS
**You do not have to meet ALL the listed Characteristics; they ARE NOT REQUIREMENTS, and I am Flexable.
**And Please be sure to check my blog, "I wouldn't feel comfortable around..." for the qualities that would Turn Me Off.**
I am Very Easy to find in public; I usually wear my Sonichu Medallion.
I will treat you to a soda and a pleasant conversation. That is, if you will allow me the pleasure.
I would feel better when a woman who is interested in me is the one who does the "Date Asking." In short, I feel that I need a "Sadie Hawkins" situation.
Not all the twists and turns of my Autistic worked in my favor, but I don't let it get me down. I will keep on waitin' hopin' and prayin' till I find my Sweetheart.

The Hanna story[3]
The exact date of this post is unknown, but it was sometime between 30 March and 2 April 2005.
One day in March, 2005, I now go to Fashion Square, on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, with my Nintendo DS, GBAVideos, GBAJukebox, my Sonichu Scrapbook, and I've brought up some courage to start saying "Hello" to the girls I find very pretty, and possibly Boyfriend-Free.
Earlier this week, a girl, who shall remain nameless in this story, finally noticed and approached me. I was hoping for a moment like this. And she asked me to have a beverage with her and talk about things. I was very ESTATIC, and my SHATTERED Heart had a speedy recovery back to 100%; We had a nice "Mini-Date," I maintained Eye-Contact, I was very attentive, and I took notes about her. I thought she was very pretty, I enjoyed her charming wit, and I found her to be a very nice and lovely girl. But, later on, as I was figuring out steps for future dates, I learned from a couple of Gal-Pals, that I have previously made at the Shopping Center, that my new girlfriend was not serious; she was setting me up for a prank. I could not believe it at first, so I found and asked her myself. Unfortunately it was true. I was shocked, and my heart was re-shattered down to being 15% intact.
Lousy, Stupid, Jerkops![4]
21 July 2005
Current mood: rejected
To those who are reading this, today, I was at the new Target store, across from Forest Lakes, just hanging around, not bothering anyone. And, from out of the blue, these two Manajerks asked me to leave, because they said that I was loitering; I was NOT! I was there hoping to find an 18-23-year old, Boyfriend-Free girl, like I usually do. Then, from out of the blue, after I told them off, they came back with two Jerkops! I was slightly intimidated, but mostly annoyed and ready to strike back on them. They asked me to leave, and never return. I did not want to leave. I would have left peacefully, in fact, I was ready to go, but I had one thing to say to them. And, during the middle of my speech, they chased me, pulled my pants, and pinned me to the floor. As I struggled, they handcuffed my wrists and legs, and they hog-tied me! Not only did I felt humilated from being the victim, but I was angry at them! Not only for handcuffing me, but once again thwarting my efforts in trying to find a Boyfriend-Free Girl. They drove me to the county jail, but fortunately, they did not keep me there; I was released to my family. But now I'll have to go to court in the future. So now, I feel very miseable, sad, lonely and rejected.
One more thing... OUCH!”
I wouldn't feel comfortable around...
5 September 2006
Current mood: thoughtful
**Note: While I truly appreciate the attention from the women who live out of state (Virginia) and those who show-off in front of an EyeToy... I'm sorry, but if we could not personally meet within 20 miles of 22968, it's a big no-go.
It has come to my attentive mind that a few women who may be attracted to me are those of whom I would not feel comfortable around. So to avoid later confusion, here's a list of characteristics I would REALLY not feel comfortable around...
-SMOKERS
-REAL DRUNK ALCOHOLICS (Gone to "Moe's" often?)
-Current/Previous Mothers (I support them fully, but I would not feel comfortable walking into a previously-made family; I would feel more comfortable starting fresh and having my own child(ren)).
-Real Ugly Women.
-Currently Over 230 pounds.
-The low-functionally mentally-handicapped.
-The seriously physically-deformed.
-Autistic (high-functionally or otherwise)...
Although I, myself, am High-Functionally Autistic, but that's beside the point.
-Medium or Dark-Chocolate.
-Police-Women.
I apologize if I have touched any nerves that may cause sadness; I'm just being honest. But don't fret, if you fit under any of these conditions, you can still help me by spreading a good word about me among the 18-24-year old, Boyfriend-Free set. Thank you for your consideration. Have a nice day.
I like the African Americans as equals.
The exact date of this entry is unknown, but it was sometime between July and September 2008.
Current mood: calm
I do not feel black people as "intolerable"; on the contrary I've had a few black friends growing up (mostly female). I like black people as equals among the worldwide population. I, myself, am part Cherokee, so I am likely to have a black ancestor among the tribe (it is uncertain in mine, and my father's (as he is the Cherokee parent of mine) knowledge, but I accept the theory). In short, I have no problems with black people.
As for the worldwide MALE (all nations and colors) Population, I can tolerate male acquaintances, but due to the proven fact that ALL MEN have taken ALL the WOMEN, leaving me none visibly to choose from, I am not particularly fond of 99.999999999999996% of the fully Male population (with the margin of exceptions of the few male acquaintances I have, my father, the current US President, and the few respectable males.
It is also proven that Majority of the Male Population are arrogant, ignorant of others' feelings and emotions, rarely give full thought to their actions before executing them, testosterone driven, more for danger than Peace. A lot of women will likely have the same feelings against the Males they encounter. Yet among all the women, they find the FEW among the males who are the opposite of the traits I have just listed, and they accept them for not only their potential husbands, but their True Emotional supporters and providers.
I have grown up with MOSTLY Close Female Friends, so I understand the negatives, and I, as one of the few accepted among the women, reference one, Anna McLerran, who currently resides in Salt Lake City, Utah, she and I, we were very close, she accepted me, she feels comfortable around me, she is confident with me, she shares her emotions openly with me, and above all else, she emotionally supports me and loves me as a friend. Check among the females in the Manchester High School (Chesterfield County, Virginia) Class of 2000 roster; most of them remember me as an honest, good-hearted person.
But in my current search for my Sweetheart, my God-and-Lord-Commanded Dream calls for a pure, pretty daughter, and she did [sic] appear unto me black. So to keep within the Godly rules of my dream, and I've been raised old-fashioned by my father, my Sweetheart has to be white.
So, I reiterate, I am not prejudiced, I am only acting on the word of God my Lord, and I would feel terrible if I acted against that word.
The Sonichu Group
On 21 September 2006, Chris founded a MySpace group, "The Sonichu Group." He announced its opening on his Sonichu site with great fanfare, saying "ALL Sonichu Fans are Welcome to Join for FREE." He added, "Members of the Local Sonichu Fan Club of Charlottesville, Virginia are encouraged to join and post any suggestions for the group or CWC's Sonichu Site and whatever else, in this new MySpace Group."
The group homepage stated that "Sonichu Rocks!" Chris wrote, "This is IT, the Group dedicated to my electric-hedgehog Pokemon, Sonichu. You may post any and all nice comments about him, and empower his popularity." He issued the "First Offical Sonichu Group Bulliten" a day after its inauguration. He linked to his comics, and also took the opportunity to plug his dumb DVD. As with all of his other internet sites, he used the group to rage at Adam Stackhouse in August 2007.
Chris also opened a forum, starting with a "Suggestions" topic. As one might expect, the forum was moribund until suddenly it wasn't. By September 2008, familiar names like kawaiikitsune, PandaHalo, and Julie could be found among its members. The actual forum discussions appear to be lost, and Chris shortly moved on to other venues for hustling his hedgehogs.
Chandler's List
On 19 May 2009, Clyde Cash discovered three text files on Chris's site. One file is a list of Chris's MySpace friends, whom he classified as JERKS (males), smokers, drunks, "more to love" (fatties), etc. The other two files are correspondences with young ladies on MySpace who lived near Chris in 2005. The list is presented verbatim with added links and minor adjustments for formatting.
