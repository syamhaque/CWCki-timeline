GHOST HUNTING WITH CHRIS CHAN
Copitz: What's up guys, we're here at the DeJarnette sanatorium. Uh- I'm here with Christine Weston Chandler.
Chris: [holding his hand up] Yo. Yo!
Copitz: AKA Chris Chan, and we're gonna be exploring this place searching for ghosts.
Chris: Ruffalo! (?)
Copitz: It's gonna be pretty epic if I do say so myself.
Copitz: [laugh]
[jump cut to a chain-link fence]
Copitz: Do you think you can fit through here, Christine?
Chris: I think I can manage.
Copitz: Alright.
[Copitz's backpack gets caught on the fence]
Chris:
Whup-up-up-up-up, you're caught. [Chris helps unhook Copitz's backpack from the fence] There you go.
Copitz: Thank you.
[jump cut to Chris grunting and struggling to make it through the broken fence gate]
[jump cut again to Chris entering the front of the building through a large broken window. The scrape of broken glass on the floor can be heard as Chris steps through]
Copitz: Nice job.
[Jump cut to Chris and Copitz wielding flashlights inside the building's dark interior]
Copitz: So there's a bunch of different levels to this building.
Chris: [in a strange voice] I see dead people. I think the ghosts are comin' after me. [laugh]
[camera pans to the wall Chris is illuminating, showing graffiti that says "Fuck you!"]
[jump cut to a very short time later; Chris and Copitz are walking down a hall]
Chris: Christian, come here.
[jump cut to Chris displaying his wrists]
Chris: I got quartz- uh, lightning quartz on my wrist.
[the camera zooms in; the video becomes fuzzy before focusing the close-up on Chris's gloved hands]
Chris: It might take a- more than one try, but I'm able to do it on the first try often times, [lifts his arms up, his forearms crossed at the wrists] but I'm gonna make it grind in here. [pulls his wrists against each other, making a loud click.] Ah.
Copitz: Should I stand back?
Chris: [trying again, another click is made] ahh, sometimes it [unintelligible]. [click] Ahh, I can do this, now I can do it [click]
[pan to Copitz]
Copitz: What are you trying to do?
Chris: Tryin' to make it light. I know I'm able to do it.
[pan to what looks to be Lee- though it may be another person- while Chris is finally able to get his rock to make light]
Chris: THERE it is!
Copitz: Aw nice, nice.
[cut to a hallway with bright light at the end of it]
Chris: [observing artwork of hot air balloons on the wall] Well, that's a nice picture, with all the balloons there. [reading graffiti on top of it] My balloooon. I like this picture.
[jump cut to Chris]
Copitz: So this is- uh- this is- uh, DeJarnette sanatorium.
[jump cut to Copitz, his face illuminated by his flashlight]
Copitz: It's where- uh, Joseph DeJarnette- um, did his work. He's- uh, known for being a pretty famous eugenics doctor, and he's known to still roam the halls. As a ghost, obviously.
Chris: Wha' was 'is name?
Copitz: Closed down waaay long ago- his name was Joseph Dejarnette.
Chris: Joseph. Hello, Joe, what do you know?
[jump cut]
Copitz: Do you believe in ghosts?
Chris: Ehh, I've met ghosts- so, yes.
[jump cut to outside]
Copitz: It's a nice view. Alright, the stairs are over this way.
[jump cut to back inside the sanatorium]
Copitz: The next floor.
[jump cut to Chris and Copitz looking at graffiti that reads "HeLP! Im TRA- pped on the ToP flooR"]
Copitz: What does that say?
Chris: [attempting to read the graffiti] I'm trap-red on the top floor.
Copitz: I'm-
Chris: Oh, "I'm trapped on the top floor".
Copitz: This isn't the top floor!
Chris: Sorry, I di-
Copitz: How'd they get here?
[jump cut to more graffiti]
Copitz: [reading the graffiti] "No Obama!"
[quick jump cut]
Copitz: What do you think about our current administration?
Chris: Ahhhh... Trump sucks. That's enough said right there.
Copitz: Think so?
Chris: [slightly distorted by reverberation due to his volume] We can replace him with anybody, but I know we'll replace with Lisa Simpson 2000(?) after the dimension merge.
Copitz: Oh, by- Lisa Simpson will be the next president?
Chris: Yep.
Copitz: Oh, okay.
[quick jump cut]
Copitz: You think everything in cartoons will come true?
Chris: [sigh] It's all- everything that's already been... presented on media has already comes (sic) true. In the sense over there, in our sister dimension, C-197
Copitz: Ohhh, okay.
Chris: But as for future determinations, that's still to be determined.
[jump cut to swastika graffiti on the ground]
Copitz: Check that out.
Chris: [on top of Copitz] You know, the swastika used to mean good luck.
[jump cut to a dark room]
Copitz: Alright, here it says [reading graffiti] "Joseph, come out"
[quick jump cut]
Copitz: I don't really want him to come out, to be honest, because he's dead and ghostsnn' are a little scary.
Lee: Not the geese, man.
Chris: Ahhh, the only- you're only scareda' ghosts because you don't have much knowledge about them.
Copitz: Oh, my mistake.
[jump cut]
Chris: I think I can hear something.
Copitz: Uhh, I'm gonna go this way [laugh]
Chris: Yeah, I feel something.
[jump cut to stairs]
Copitz: Alright, let's go down, let's go down.
[jump cut to Chris and Copitz walking down the stairs]
Chris: At least I got good cell reception in here, I'll give you that.
[jump cut to graffiti that reads "Pots 4 sale]
Chris: [unintelligible, talked over by Copitz]
Copitz: [laughing] Pots for sale? Is there- is there a pot dealer in here?
[jump cut, rumbling can be heard]
Lee: Got some people.
Copitz: Hello? Hello? Who's there? Hello?
[jump cut, no more rumbling]
Copitz: We're friendly!
[camera man laughs]
Lee: Yeah. We're not ghosts!
Copitz: Can you hear us?
[quick jump cut]
Copitz: [quietly] Ah, whatever, I don't think we're ghosts(?)
[camera man laughs]
[jump cut]
Chris: Don't worry guys, I think Magi-Chan Sonichu has us protected.
Copitz: [on top of Chris] I can still hear them.
[jump cut to Copitz's camera pointed at a small unoccupied room with a boarded up window which has a hole in it]
Chris: Follow my lead. We're calm, we're cool.
Copitz: Let's see- [walking into the room] let's check out this little peephole.
[jump cut to a close up of the peephole]
Lee: Maybe we can kick it open.
[quick jump cut to the camera focused on the external landscape]
Copitz: I don't wanna do that. It's clearly professionally boarded.
[jump cut to junk]
Copitz: Lookit this.
Chris: It's a mess alright.
[jump cut]
Chris: [ghost sounds] Ooooooohhhh
Copitz: [laugh]
Chris: Don't worry, we mean ya no harm, spirits.
[quick jump cut]
Chris: As long as we don't bodder dem, dey won't bodder us.
[jump cut to a small room with one large, tall window]
Lee: Well, if all goes to [censored] sh-t, we can climb outta here.
Copitz: Yeah...
[jump cut to the dark halls of the sanatorium once more]
Chris: We mean no disrespect or dishonor-
Copitz: [on top of Chris, agreeing] Absolutely not.
Chris: We're juuust chronicling.
[Chris's phone rings, spooking the other ghost hunters]
Chris: That's my mother. [to Barb] Heyo.
Barb: Hello! Okay, bye.
Chris: Bye-bye. [to the other ghost hunters] It's okay, that was just my mother calling me.
Copitz: [on top of Chris, most likely referring to when he was supposed to return home or contact her] Definitely before six.
[unintelligible whispering]
Chris: Y'all's mothers were concerned about yours as well. Y'all when you were... e- I mean no offense, thank you.
[jumpcut]
Chris: You know what's weird? I kinda got a similar- this reminds me of after that housefire in 2014 at ho- at my home
Copitz: Oh, yeah-
Chris: Just ennering and exiting all the time, so- it's like, I kinda entered familiar territory with the way everything is around here.
Copitz: For sure, I remember that.
[jumpcut]
Copitz: Oh, there's some nudity on this wall.
Chris: Oh. [illuminates the graffiti on the wall, which manages to somehow be lower quality than ShecameforCWC.JPG] [laughs] Jeez.
[jumpcut to a well-lit room]
Chris: [singing terribly] Have some fun haunting around those spooky trails.
Copitz: [on top of Chris] Here. [receives an unidentifiable item from Chris] [joining in with Chris] Hopping around the spooky trails.
Chris: [scatting] Booby-da-do-ba do-ba-do-bah-da-boo-bu-da-duh-do-duh-do
Copitz: [dances]
[jumpcut to just outside the sanatorium]
Chris: Thank you all for your hospitality, our phantasms of the spook. May you all rest in peace. Continue to rest in peace.
[quick jump cut to Copitz]
Lee: I wonder who those people were?
Chris: Huh.
Copitz: Yeah, I dunno, we might'a scared them off 'cause they didn't say anything to us.
Lee: They thought we were ghosts. [unintelligible]
Chris: That's the difference between knowing and not knowing.
[piano music begins playing]
That's the difference between knowing... and not knowing -CWC 2019
Chris: If you don't know who was there, does it confirm whether somebody was there or not? You hear footsteps, but was there actually people? Or was it the spirits?
Copitz: It coulda' been the spirits, man.
[quick jump cut]
Chris: All is not known until all is learned, so seek your knowledge and learn well; keep a cool, calm head.
[jump cut to Lee taking a selfie with Chris; piano music stops]
Copitz: Welcome to jamrock.
[jump cut to Chris and Copitz walking on a hill; wind can be heard in the background]
Copitz: I know you said Ted Bundy is going to be coming back in the merge as well...?
Chris: Uhh- oh, in his Sonichu form, eventually. [quick jump cut] And since he... reincarnated, he definitely made sure he amended his ways. [quick jump cut] I assure you that he's a good guy.
Copitz: Okay.
[jump cut to Chris and Copitz walking down a trail side-by-side]
Copitz: So- I mean, Christine, you can see- you can see why some people might think that [quick jump] the whole CWCville stuff- that, like, it might just be... part of something that you drew, and it might just be in your imagination?
Chris: Ohhh yeah, no, [quick jumpcut] we create something and it ends up there, it's not imagination, you literally have psychic connections and links to right over there.
Copitz: Yeeeah...
[jump cut to near a road, cars passing by]
Chris: Kick the can! And I missed. [kicks tin can] There you go. [laugh]
[jump cut to 4 in car, Copitz driving, Chris in passenger seat, Lee and Unnamed Cameraman in backseat]
[Chris drinking Gatorade while side-eyeing camera]
[jump cut to Chris talking to his mother on phone]
Chris: Hi Mom, checking in. I don't know if you wanted to, uh, wait 'til after I got home to fix dinner or whatever. I'll see you later, love you.
Copitz: Let's do a beatboxing contest, okay? I'll go first, you ready?
[starts beatboxing decently]
Copitz: Alright your turn, Christine!
[Chris starts beatboxing horribly]
[Copitz adds interjections and drum noises]
Copitz: Christine on the mic!
[Cuts back and forth between Chris and Copitz beatboxing]
Chris: Honey, I got one more.
[continues beatboxing badly]
[Copitz joins in for a duet]
[jumpcut]
Lee: When do you think the dimensional merge is happening?
Chris: It's very soon, within these- within the coming days.
Lee: I'm unfamiliar with what that is, what is that?
Chris: Where the dimensions of - where our OCs exist and coexist and -
Copitz: [clarifying for those in backseat] Original Characters
Chris: - reside, and here, where everybody will get to see the OCs.
Copitz: I'll have to see to- to believe it, really, honestly, but I'd like to- I'd like to learn more about the way that you - that you think about it, like the psychological aspect [Chris: maybe] if that makes sense.
[jumpcut]
Lee: There was a theory going around that you were having like very specific dreams due to some of the medications.
Chris: Well, it's hard to confirm or deny that, but I feel like I can s- I feel like I can say it's... quite a bust. I mean most of my dreams remain neutral, and my nightmares. I have my good dreams, but I'm a lucid dreamer.
[jumpcut]
Copitz: So you were talking about Lisa Simpson as President, how do you think - what do you think that's going to be like?
Chris: I don't know which President compare it to really. I mean, I'd like - I would like to say Obama...
[jumpcut]
[Chris makes honking noise]
[Copitz honks the car horn twice]
[Chris laughs]
[jump cut to "Damian Marley - Welcome To Jamrock" playing and Copitz singing along]
Lee: [recording Chris on his phone, loud music and Copitz singing makes it hard to hear] Christine, sing!
Chris: What?
Lee: Sing along!
[Chris sings nonsense]
[jumpcut]
Copitz: If you wanted to ask - access the, what's it called? C-
Chris: C-197
Copitz: C-197. If you wanted to access that right now, could you do it?
Chris: Oh yeah.
Copitz: Would you like to try it? I don't know if anybody's ever seen you do it before if you-
Chris: Okay, well, hang on I'll-
[Chris closes eyes and makes a concentrated face]
[slow fade transition, presumably a few seconds have passed without Chris talking]
Copitz: Christine, can you still hear us?
Chris: [In a more distant voice] Yes, I hear you.
Copitz: Are you in C-197?
Chris: Yup.
Copitz: Do you think I could have a conversation with one of them through you? Like you could tell me what they're saying and you could tell them what I'm saying?
Chris: Uh, Sabrina is telling me, "Say hi to- Hi Selmy - Hi Christian! It's nice to talk to you!"
Copitz; Hi Sabrina, tell Sabrina I said hi.
Chris: Oh, she hears you through me, so it's like a conduit.
Copitz: Oh, okay. Could I speak to, uh, maybe, like, Lisa Simpson or somebody?
Chris: Okay, well, I'm gonna have to move my soul all the way over to Springfield. Well, I'm talking with Homer right now, she's not - she's not home right now.
Copitz: Can I speak to Marge?
Chris: She's coming in! Hi, Marge! She doesn't want her... speech put on the Internet.
Copitz; Oh, okay.
[Camera zooms into Chris's deeply concentrated face]
Chris: But she will say, for everyone... to remain on their best behavior and to be kind to each other. She will not stand for... crass and rudeness.
Copitz: Oh, of course not. Yes, wise words, Marge. Thank you.
[quick jumpcut]
Chris: [sigh] Ugh, fwoop tired, I've gotta come back here.
[Chris opens his eyes and acts like he's returning to our dimension]
Chris: Blech. I had to come back, I got - my brain got worn out.
[jumpcut]
Copitz: Alright, let's do our outro here. Ay. Alright guys, we had a great -
[Black screen with words "*camera runs out of battery*]
[interrupted by laughter from both Copitz and Chris]
