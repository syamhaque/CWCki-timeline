You know what, I HATE ME TOO!!! is the gallery Chris added to his own Encyclopedia Dramatica article in March 2008,[1] in a bizarre attempt to presumably either show humility or appease the trolls, who according to him, would delight in seeing examples of him "suffering".
Instead of showing situations demonstrating his real-life adversities and shortcomings, Chris posts various scenes from his comic book subjecting his Mary-Sue character to various misfortunes. How this amounts to self-deprecation only Chris knows, since Chris sees mild inconveniences like doing chores or being told not to loiter as great trials of adversity. Scenes in his comic where he's anything less than immaculate, he considers ultimate acts of humility.
What Chris fails to understand is that:
Most people, autistic or otherwise, can tell the difference between fact, fiction, and ex-cathedra proclamations.
Readers/viewers actually prefer that fictional characters have some weaknesses – those in the industry call this "depth".
In particular, ones that are generally a bit more believable and less crippling than what's seen here.
It is presented below exactly as it originally appeared on ED; all spelling errors, odd grammar and other such mistakes seen here are Chris's own.
You know what, I HATE ME TOO!!!
And it is shown in the following clips:
I let myself get taunted and jeered to the max.
I Called Myself a FREAK!
I had my head rubbed vigerously against a rough carpet.
And it left me shedding Tears of Blood.
I set my ASS ON FIRE!
I was given the worst wedgie of my life!
I crashed full-speed into walls!
I got DRENCHED in Soda, turned bad from the accident.
I was piled on by a bunch of Jerkops.
I led a comet into a path of my self-destruction.
I was gripped by mattalic digits by my head.
And I dropped myself.
I had major headaches.
Not to mention being BEAT UP Numerously.
Grossed Myself the FREAK OUT!
I let myself fall into an ABYSS.
I ignored myself.
Drew myself Stupidly.
I've worn myself unconsious.
And I served myself on a Silver Platter!
