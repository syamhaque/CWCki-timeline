THAT IS MY LINK!!!
This article contains link(s) which have been cut down by the Internet Lumberjack or which have otherwise crashed into slumber due to stress. Please help the CWCki by replacing or restoring these links.
CWCki's American readers helped pay for this. Anyone else suddenly feel like cheating on their taxes?
One of their most valuable customers.
This is a catalog of Chris's video game collection, based in large part on a spreadsheet he sent to Shigeru Miyamoto in order to show how dedicated he is to video games. He surely is. The actual Excel file contains more information about each game that Chris listed himself for some reason, like the number of players for each game. Some games are obvious (every Sonic game, and almost every Pokémon game), some are surprising (Barbie Game Girl), some are bizarre (Powerpuff Girls: Relish Rampage Pickled Edition), and some are outright embarrassing (Pooh's Party Game: In Search of the Treasure, Learning with the PooYoos).
For whatever reason, Chris's game inventory also includes demo discs, game peripherals (such as his PSEye), and other things that can't really be considered games (such as Game Boy Advance Video cartridges, a concept that failed to appeal to a majority of American consumers... except for Chris, apparently, who bought several of them). God only knows why Chris felt it was a brilliant idea to send a Nintendo executive a list of games he has on competing platforms, or to send a list of imports to a game company that practically invented region lock-out to prevent games from being imported.
The bulk of the list is only accurate to around the time of the Miyamoto Saga, in January 2009. Luckily, his public PSN profile and other sources of information have made it possible to get a clearer picture of his ever-expanding game collection since then. Xbox games and hardware were conspicuously missing from the initial list, but according to his eBay sales, he most likely owned one at some point, and in later years he would acquire an Xbox One.
Many trolls conservatively estimate that Chris and his family have spent at least $30,000 on video games in his lifetime (including $1,000 from a 1994 shopping spree), roughly 3 times the amount of Chris's annual income – your tax dollars at work. In 2010 alone, Chris spent nearly $3,500 in downloaded games and other PSN content, and the toll continues to rise. A January 2015 leak by a Nintendo employee revealed that he had made 585 purchases on his account, in Nintendo video game products (including hardware, software, DLC, etc.) in a span of 4.5 years. This leak also showed that Chris's addiction to buying video games has worsened hard over the years, and wouldn't stop even when his family was in dire straits.
After the fire, many of these games are presumed to have been destroyed or otherwise lost, but no final verdict on that matter has been given. It's also unknown whether or not the Chandler household is still in possession of any remaining games following Chris's arrest for incest and subsequent move to a new place.

Chris (barely) lets go
Chris has very occasionally sold off some of his games to earn money. This occurred most frequently throughout 2010, but (perhaps unsurprisingly) hasn't happened much ever since.
In early August 2010, according to his e-mails with Jackie, Chris sold off "12 NES, 3 SNES, 6 Genesis, 9 Game Boy and 6 PSOne Games" at a local pawn shop, hoping to snag some spending money and get around his father's iron grip on his finances. (He actually attempted to sell 23 PlayStation games total; all but six were refused due to their poor condition.) A couple of weeks later, he went back and sold off more NES and SNES games, as well as his Super Nintendo console and a few accessories for it. Between both trips he pocketed a little over $80, but the extent of what he got rid of is not fully documented.
On 31 August, he made a third trip to the pawn shop, selling off his Nintendo 64 and all his games for the console. Total proceeds: $40. At the same time he tried to sell his 16-bit Sega consoles and games, but failed, since his Genesis was apparently malfunctioning.
Around the same time, Chris also made a couple of trips to his local GameStop to trade in some of his collection. In early August, he gave up "9 PS3, 2 PS2, 3 PSP, and 4 DS games" for $50 in store credit, which he immediately plowed back into a pre-order for more games. Later, around the end of the month, he traded in several Game Boy Advance, GameCube, and Nintendo DS games for $100 worth of GameStop store credit. In both cases, it's not clear exactly which titles he let go of.
In October 2010, Chris dropped by Plan 9 Music, a music store in Charlottesville, and sold them "7 PS3, 2 PSP, 4 Gamecube and 1 Wii game" along with several movie DVDs, although as usual he did not specify which titles. He thereby earned $48.75, most of which went directly into his stomach and Son-Chu's gas tank.
In the Clyde and Tito PS3 E-mails, Chris mentioned the pawn shop trip to his enemies. A few weeks later, Clyde Cash obtained three of Chris's old games and his Super Game Boy from the pawn shop and uploaded pictures of the loot here on the CWCki. The pictures show that at one point, Chris labeled his games with his name and birthdate (which now serve as a TRUE and HONEST certificate of authentication), and that his copy of Dr. Mario was kept in less than satisfactory condition.
Clyde's haul.
Note how the sticker label is peeling on the corners. This isn't a common occurrence.
A rather surprising title that Chris once owned.
The Nintendo Seal of Truth and Honesty.
LOOK AT THAT DIRT GODDAMN.
The original label was apparently damaged, so Chris tried replacing it. It shows.
Goo Gone is an alien concept to Chris.
Oddly enough, in August 2008, Chris auctioned off a pink LeapFrog Leapster on eBay, and received $29.99 for it. The Leapster is a handheld edutainment video game system marketed to children ages 3-11. It was released in late 2003, which means that Chris was at least 21 when he bought it. He may have bought it because there was a Sonic X game available for the system. The game, which involves answering math problems to advance, is appropriate for 5-7 year olds, fitting considering Chris's arrested development.
Despite these attempts, and owning current generation systems (such as the PS4 and Nintendo Switch), Chris often returns to his older consoles. After the fire (presumably) destroyed much of Chris's video game collection, he repurchased many of the games, sans ones he already purchased on the Wii Virtual Console and PlayStation Network.
Games bought during the Financhu Crisis
Chris's habit of wasting money on games continued even during the Financhu Crisis, a time of self-inflicted financial hardship for the Chandlers, in which Chris regularly begged for money. These purchases are denoted with *FC* in the notes section of the lists below.

Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)
Half of these NES games are on his 3DS Virtual Console (VC), while the others are physical copies for Chris's actual NES console (that he probably rarely plays).
