[7:26 pm] CWC:

[7:27 pm] CWC:
:-* h
[7:27 pm] Jacklyn Romy:

[7:27 pm] CWC:

[7:28 pm] Jacklyn Romy:

[7:28 pm] CWC:

[7:29 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i'm doing good. hectic day
[7:29 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
still lots of homework
[7:29 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
how has your day been
[7:29 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
?
[7:29 pm] CWC:
okay, and getting better. ;) h
[7:29 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so your computer is back in commission?
[7:29 pm] CWC:
yes
[7:30 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
do you know what the problem was?
[7:30 pm] CWC:
BTW, do you know of any good DLC of Windows XP install cd software?
[7:30 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
hey hang on, i havent even seen your videos yet!
[7:30 pm] CWC:
I have a better idea of it.
[7:30 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
give me a couple minutes to watch them, then i'll come back, ok?
[7:30 pm] CWC:
ok
[7:31 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
:-D brb
[7:31 pm] CWC:
enkoy
[7:31 pm] CWC:
enjoy
[7:32 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
ahahahah!! i love the clyde cash one
[7:32 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
ok, i'll just keep talking to you as i watch the other two
[7:33 pm] CWC:
okay.
[7:33 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
ahahaha! thats alec benson leary you're mocking in the third one?
[7:34 pm] CWC:
Actually, I'm mocking BOTH A.B.L. and the Brown-Striped "Christian Chandler"
[7:34 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
yeah, it was a little confusing at first, but i see you're jumping between the two
[7:34 pm] CWC:
I'm surprised the trolls did not get that, as I had read it in the Cwcki update portion.
[7:35 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
its kind of confusing
[7:35 pm] CWC:
or rather, I'm impersonating C.C. 2 impersonating A.B.L.
[7:35 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
you probably should have made one video for each of them, but its still good
[7:35 pm] CWC:
I can understand the confusion.
[7:35 pm] CWC:
yeah.
[7:36 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
what inspired you to mock alec benson leary?
[7:36 pm] CWC:
Obviously, his drawing style; him portraying me dying a gorey, horrifying death.
[7:36 pm] CWC:
etc.
[7:37 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
whats wrong with his drawing style? i thought it was ok
[7:37 pm] CWC:
he draws Blocky-Style.
[7:37 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
what do you mean?
[7:37 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
it doesnt look pixelated, if thats what you mean
[7:38 pm] CWC:
don't you see how from his drawing style, the characters look like a bunch of lopsided hexagons, squares, etc.
[7:38 pm] CWC:
?
[7:38 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
?
[7:38 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i didnt get that impression
[7:38 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i think his art style is pretty consistent and professional looking.
[7:39 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but why did you attack him? Isnt he the one who you made peace with a long time ago?
[7:40 pm] CWC:
Actually, I felt a lack of an idea for today's video; I "pulled a rabbit out of a hat" with another mockery video.
[7:41 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well, it was a big hit
[7:41 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
you really put passion into it, i can tell
[7:41 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but why would you attack your friend like that?
[7:41 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
hello? are you there?
[7:41 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
CWC is unable to receive offline IMs. 7:42 pm
[7:43 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
hello? are you there?
[7:43 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
CWC is unable to receive offline IMs. 7:43 pm
[7:43 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
CWC (ChrisChanSonichu) is available 8:00 pm
[8:00 pm] CWC:
I'm back
[8:00 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
chris?
[8:00 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
hey!
[8:00 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
computer trouble again?
[8:00 pm] CWC:
Yes.
[8:00 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well, i hope it doesnt interrupt our chat agian
[8:00 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i felt like you got snatched away from me again
[8:01 pm] CWC:
I was waiting for your next input, when my computer suddenly turned askew with colors and froze up.
[8:01 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
ah.
[8:01 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so anyway
[8:01 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
about alec benson leary
[8:01 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
what made you decide to troll your friend like that?
[8:01 pm] CWC:
I can't make any promises on it allowing me to stay on or not.
[8:02 pm] CWC:
I never said he was a friend; he's more of an acquaintance.
[8:02 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
oh. well, i thought you two buried the hatchet
[8:02 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i saw the video from way back when where you apologized to him for murdering him in your comic
[8:03 pm] CWC:
anyway, it was just something I've been holding in for a while, and I felt like letting it out.
[8:03 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
why were you still angry? i thought you sorted out all your feelings when you talked to him
[8:04 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i listened to the recordings the cwcki has. he was very cordial and gracious, seemed like you two were striking ground together
[8:04 pm] CWC:
We did have it sorted out, but I still have my feelings of offense from his work.
[8:04 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
(dont get jealous, but i thought his deep manvoice was kind of sexy... lol)
[8:04 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
why were you offended? he was just drawing a comic
[8:05 pm] CWC:
It just really bothered me.
[8:05 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
you brutally murdered him in your comic, wouldnt that kind of make it even
[8:05 pm] CWC:
how do you think it makes me feel that people like him want to see me dead.
[8:05 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
what???
[8:05 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
when did he ever say that? he was trying to make peace with you
[8:06 pm] CWC:
in his drawings; he drew me being killed.
[8:06 pm] CWC:
how do you think that makes me feel?
[8:06 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
you drew him being killed. so doesnt that make it even?
[8:06 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
why still be mad?
[8:06 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
and you killed him after you talked to him, and found out what an honorable and charming man he was and how nice he was trying to be
[8:07 pm] CWC:
I never really considered him charming or all that honorable.
[8:08 pm] CWC:
the only nice thing I can really say about him is that even his style is flawed, he can put together a comic book story well.
[8:09 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
yes, i thought his stories were gripping and his character development quite deft and enthralling, i'll agree with you there
[8:09 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but still
[8:09 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i'm curious why you are still angry when you already got even.
[8:11 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
chris?
[8:12 pm] CWC:
I was thinking.
[8:12 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
ok, thought your computer dropped again
[8:12 pm] CWC:
no, I'm still here.
[8:12 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
:-D
[8:13 pm] CWC:
I think I have other things of angst against Alec that remain in my subconscious, even though I know I've buried the hatchet with him and all that.
[8:13 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
isnt that kind of dishonorable?
[8:14 pm] CWC:
?
[8:14 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i mean, if you still had problems with him, maybe you should talk to him instead of making this inflammatory video
[8:14 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i mean, alec benson leary is no clyde cash. whereas clyde is a lewd, moronic cretin with no creativity, alec benson leary was just an artist with an eye towards artistic greatness
[8:16 pm] CWC:
I guess it was a bad move to mock him the way I did after all things have passed and we've moved on, but I said what I felt.
[8:16 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well, i can understand that. :-)
[8:16 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
maybe you should talk to him again though
[8:16 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
it might be cathartic
[8:17 pm] CWC:
I have a LOT to say to the trolls, individually preferably instead of as a whole group, after all the shit I have gone through from him.
[8:17 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but he isnt a troll, though, i thought
[8:17 pm] CWC:
cathartic? New Word to me.
[8:17 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
cathartic = healing to the soul
[8:18 pm] CWC:
Yeah, but I still had my feeling and opinions.
[8:18 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but...
[8:18 pm] CWC:
ah.
[8:18 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but he isnt a troll. why treat him like one?
[8:18 pm] CWC:
I will make an apology to Alec in my next video.
[8:18 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
ooh! i know!
[8:19 pm] CWC:
How did you like me portraying Paul McCartney?
[8:19 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
in your last apology video to alec, you said you would draw replacement pages for the end of Sonichu Issue 10, to replace that awful bloody trial
[8:19 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but you never did.
[8:19 pm] CWC:
yes, and I will eventually.
[8:19 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
you should draw those pages now and show them in the video! or send them to alec
[8:20 pm] CWC:
yes.
[8:20 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
:-D :-D :-D
[8:20 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
do you have any ideas for how you would replace the trial scene?
[8:21 pm] CWC:
just completely remove it.
[8:21 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but you said you'd replace it
[8:21 pm] CWC:
It'll still be a number of pages divisible by four.
[8:21 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but you said you'd replace the pages, not just cut them out.
[8:21 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
it doesnt have to be long! you could make like ten pages.
[8:22 pm] CWC:
I had an idea for putting in a page or two of Slaweel in Jail, trying to create a spell in a witch's brew and fail, with a passing by Guard making a witty comment.
[8:22 pm] CWC:
then she says the guard, "Shut up."
[8:22 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
how about this: draw asperchu and sonichu together, and they shoot clyde cash with a combined asper-ha-me-ha attack
[8:22 pm] CWC:
NO
[8:22 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
??
[8:22 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
why not?
[8:23 pm] CWC:
That idea is not cannon to the series.
[8:23 pm] CWC:
or at least how it originally was.
[8:23 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
???
[8:23 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
you decide what canon is.
[8:24 pm] CWC:
canon in this sense means to be relative and matching.
[8:24 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
here's what you said:
[8:24 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
"Anyway the trial, and the execution will be replaced with pages that are more accurate to the stories"
[8:25 pm] CWC:
Yes.
[8:24 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so that statement means the trial wasnt canon
[8:25 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well, you know that alec and asperchu arent trolls, they arent your enemies. so you owe it to them to replace that trial with something that shows you have nothing against them
[8:25 pm] CWC:
Actually, anything having to do with specific cyber bullies/trolls were never canon to the series.
[8:25 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
the asper-ha-me-ha was just one suggestion, but you could show them do something else together
[8:25 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
?
[8:25 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but the majority of the series is about you and sonichu attacking trolls
[8:26 pm] CWC:
I can do a simple handshake between Sonichu and Asperchu.
[8:26 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
mm, more than that, though
[8:26 pm] CWC:
what?
[8:26 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
needs to be at least a few pages. enough material to offset that giant trial
[8:27 pm] CWC:
Sonichu is hesitant to coming to the terms with Asperchu, like I am.
[8:27 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
sonichu is a comic character. you draw him
[8:27 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so its really all your feelings.
[8:27 pm] CWC:
yes
[8:27 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but regardless, not only do you know that you owe this to alec, but you stated specifically that you would do it
[8:27 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
and you never have.
[8:27 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
you said you dont think alec is honorable, but you havent honored your promises here
[8:29 pm] CWC:
I lost the inspiration to draw, and I have really no place to put the pages online without the Trolls attacking them and trying to take me down AGAIN.
[8:29 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well whether you lost the inspiration or not, you still owe it to him. if you owe money on a credit card, you cant "lose the inspiration" to pay your bill.
[8:29 pm] CWC:
They've hacked into my websites the number of times.
[8:29 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
you dont have to post them anywhere. send them to alec.
[8:29 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
or send them to me, i can make sure they get to him
[8:30 pm] CWC:
what, you know his e-mail address?
[8:30 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
yeah, its on his website. and the cwcki knows it too
[8:30 pm] CWC:
oh.
[8:30 pm] CWC:
I beg your pardon.
[8:30 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
no biggie :-)
[8:31 pm] CWC:
I have his e-mail address, and I can access it easily as well.
[8:31 pm] CWC:
I have a bunch of his e-mails saved in my AOL saved mail folder.
[8:31 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well, i think 10 pages of material is a good amount. i think your trial was longer than that, but a 10-page chapter would be good
[8:32 pm] CWC:
I will think on that.
[8:32 pm] CWC:
I have to come up with something completely different to extend it to ten pages.
[8:32 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
you should draw some tonight or tomorrow
[8:32 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
just draw various ideas, it'll get your juices flowing
[8:32 pm] CWC:
I'll draw some ideas in my head, and I'll come up with a good idea soon.
[8:33 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i think it would be better if you draw on paper
[8:33 pm] CWC:
yes, but they are drawn in my head before on paper.
[8:33 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well, yes. but putting them to paper accelerates the creative process
[8:33 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
since its easier to visualize something when you're using your eyes
[8:34 pm] CWC:
I will come up with something good enough to make ten pages long to make amends.
[8:34 pm] CWC:
I agree.
[8:34 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
yay!
[8:34 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
you can do it over the next week or so. shouldnt take long
[8:34 pm] CWC:
okay, sweetheart.
[8:34 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but anyway
[8:34 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
your clyde video got me thinking
[8:34 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
are there any other trolls you'd like to mock like that?
[8:34 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i think you could do a good job with some of them
[8:35 pm] CWC:
yes.
[8:35 pm] CWC:
Allow me to name a few I can remember.
[8:35 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
okay
[8:35 pm] CWC:
I've just mocked "Christian Chandler" in Pennsylvania.
[8:35 pm] CWC:
And then there's Jason Kendrick Howell...
[8:36 pm] CWC:
the "Black Man in the Pickle Suit"...
[8:36 pm] CWC:
Jack Thaddius...
[8:36 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
that tito guy was big, too
[8:36 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
right?
[8:36 pm] CWC:
Yes, "Surfshack Tito" as well...
[8:37 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
you should make one for each of them
[8:37 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
interspersed with your other videos!
[8:37 pm] CWC:
And I want to attack Daniel Mimms as well; he and his buddy, Lucas, started the whole mess rolling with that photo they took of me that Friday Night with me in my green/purple stripe shirt.
[8:37 pm] CWC:
CWC (ChrisChanSonichu) is idle 8:37 pm
[8:38 pm] CWC:
interspersed?
[8:38 pm] CWC:
another new word
[8:38 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
meaning, in-between
[8:38 pm] CWC:
I understand.
[8:38 pm] CWC:
have you read about Mimms on the Cwcki?
[8:38 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
yes, a little bit
[8:38 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
he took a photo of you, right?
[8:39 pm] CWC:
he and I were buddies; we played the TCGs together, between Pok'emon, Yu-Gi-Oh, and even Ultimate Fighter System (U.F.S.), and we were Gamers too; we were in line for the release of Super Smash Bros. Brawl for Wii.
[8:40 pm] CWC:
And then to take THAT photograph of me and be among the trolls, was a Major Blow to me. :_(
[8:40 pm] CWC:
I thought he and I were friends.
[8:40 pm] CWC:
and to do this and that....
[8:40 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i saw a photo of him on the cwcki, wearing a green afro wig. you could wear one like that
[8:41 pm] CWC:
I just wanna punch his lights out.
[8:41 pm] CWC:
yes.
[8:41 pm] CWC:
I can make a fake 'fro
[8:41 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
hey, do you have a bicycle?
[8:41 pm] CWC:
yes, but it is soo tucked away, I can't get to it.
[8:41 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
where is it tucked away?
[8:41 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i'd love to see a video of you riding around outside on your bicycle.
[8:42 pm] CWC:
in our workshop, or at least used to be a workshop; now it's another storage space my hoarding family filled to the brim. :( h
[8:42 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
oh...
[8:42 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
you cant dig it out at all?
[8:42 pm] CWC:
yeah...
[8:42 pm] CWC:
no, there is just TOO much stuff in the way inside the workshop, as well as OUTSIDE in front of the door to the workshop.
[8:43 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well, you can still make my hiking video, right?
[8:43 pm] CWC:
hiking video?
[8:43 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
yeah, i asked you about it in one of my recent emails
[8:43 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
didnt you see?
[8:44 pm] CWC:
I'm sorry; I think I lost that one.
[8:43 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
oh
[8:44 pm] CWC:
but you can fill me in on that detail right now. :) h
[8:44 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well, what i wanted was for you to record yourself hiking in the blue ridge mountains
[8:44 pm] CWC:
I can do that; I just have to plan for it.
[8:44 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
yay!
[8:44 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
maybe this weekend?
[8:44 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
like, i want to see an entire video of you walking along a hiking path.
[8:45 pm] CWC:
I can't make any promises, but I will plan for it.
[8:45 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
that video would be like an hour long, i suppose, or more.
[8:45 pm] CWC:
for YouTube? their limit is 15 minutes.
[8:45 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but i'd love to see you do it! you can comment on the wonders of nature you see around you as you walk
[8:45 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
doesnt have to be youtube. you could just upload it to mega-upload and send it to me
[8:45 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
or it can be broken up into segments for youtube too, if you want
[8:46 pm] CWC:
segments for a shorter video would be better.
[8:46 pm] CWC:
out of the whole.
[8:46 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well, i'd still love to see the whole unbroken video
[8:47 pm] CWC:
plus, the battery life of my camera will not last a whole hour.
[8:47 pm] CWC:
I know that.
[8:47 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
how long does it last?
[8:47 pm] CWC:
I think it lasts between 15 and 30 minutes.
[8:48 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well, tell you what. get to the mid-point of the hiking trail, and then start recording, and just record until the battery ends
[8:48 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
because i want to see you at the top of that trail! :-D
[8:48 pm] CWC:
okay, we'll see.
[8:48 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
you can do it this weekend!
[8:48 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
yay, i'm so excited!
[8:49 pm] CWC:
anyway, how did you like me as Paul McCartney?
[8:49 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
actually, didnt watch that one yet
[8:49 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
because it was like 6 minutes long, decided to wait til we were done talking
[8:49 pm] CWC:
oh.
[8:49 pm] CWC:
well, a word of warning, there's mic feedback at the end of the video.
[8:50 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
ok, i'll keep an eye out for it.
[8:50 pm] CWC:
or an ear.
[8:50 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
lol, yeah
[8:50 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
CWC (ChrisChanSonichu) is available 8:50 pm
[8:51 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
hey, i was wondering
[8:51 pm] CWC:
yes?
[8:51 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
have you thought any more about my SSI question from the other night?
[8:51 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
since you said you needed some time to think about it
[8:52 pm] CWC:
I have thought it over some more; I have not come to a conclusion yet.
[8:52 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
oh.
[8:52 pm] CWC:
but I remember you want me to tell you why I feel I need or deserve it.
[8:52 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well, not need, but deserve. but yeah
[8:53 pm] CWC:
I promise you I will have a full-thought answer for you on the topic very soon.
[8:53 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
okay! i look forward to it
[8:54 pm] CWC:
cool.
[8:54 pm] CWC:
going back to my computer for a bit...
[8:54 pm] CWC:
I've learned that there are two possibilities for its ailment.
[8:54 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
oh?
[8:54 pm] CWC:
a corrupted file on its HDD, or a major flaw on the motherboard.
[8:54 pm] CWC:
or possibly both.
[8:55 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well, if its the HDD, you can just reformat it
[8:55 pm] CWC:
After I've downloaded and burned the Windows XP install stuff onto a CD-R, I will have the HDD scanned and the corrupted file deleted.
[8:55 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
hey, you really like sonic games, right?Sonic 4 is coming out soon, isnt it?
[8:56 pm] CWC:
a Reformat means a COMPLETE Removal of EVERYTHING on it; I'd lose ALL of the programs installed, my tunes, photos, videos, etc, saved on it.
[8:56 pm] CWC:
yes, I am well-aware of it.
[8:56 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well you have a bunch of spare hard drives
[8:56 pm] CWC:
I just don't know when it's coming out.
[8:56 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but i was thinking of something else for a video...
[8:57 pm] CWC:
a few extra 5 inch, Notebook, SATA HDDs; my PC's HDD is a 5 inch, IDE HDD.
[8:57 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
Chris, for Sunday's video I want you to celebrate the release of Sonic 4 with me. I've got a cousin who LOOOOOOVES Sonic. He is also very very super autistic. Go figure! Anyways, I want you to make a video of yourself transforming into ChrisChan-Sonichu (you know, blue like Sonic xoxo heehee!)
[8:57 pm] CWC:
I do not have any extra IDE Drives.
[8:58 pm] CWC:
I can do something like that. :) h
[8:57 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
JUST like they do in Sailor Moon! download some Sailor Moon music, spin around and transform into your ultimate form! Throw glitter in the air, blow bubbles, and turn blue! Since Halloween is approaching, you could pick up some blue face paint at the Dollar Tree to paint your body with! I want you to look EXACTLY like your beautiful creation!
[8:58 pm] CWC:
I will work on that for you this weekend.
[8:58 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
Like cosplaying!! I do not want you to transform into Colossal Chandler. I want you to stick to your original Chris-Chan-Sonichu form because Sonic 4 is a celebration of the ORIGINAL Sonic design, right?? So let's enjoy it together!! I am soooooo excited to see my chunky monkey man alllll sexy and blue and shirtless! mmmMMM! Make me proud!
[8:58 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
and this time chris, a challenge: DO NOT use all construction paper, please! Use your imagination and lots and lots of face paint!
[8:59 pm] CWC:
Anyway, after the scanning and removal of the corrupted file, if the computer is still having the trouble, it would be safe to conclude that it WAS mainly the Motherboard, and then I'll look into a new computer where I can move the HDD into that from the old one...
[9:00 pm] CWC:
or I'll see if I can replace the motherboard with advice from John.
[9:00 pm] CWC:
face painting, okay. :) h
[9:00 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
body painting ;-)
[9:00 pm] CWC:
body paint too.
[9:00 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
yay!!!
[9:00 pm] CWC:
listen, sweetheart.
[9:00 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
hmm?
[9:01 pm] CWC:
the "chunky monkey" comment; I feel discomfort in being referred to by that.
[9:01 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i'm sorry sweetie! i only used that because its my favorite flavor of ben and jerries
[9:02 pm] CWC:
I do not feel good hearing remarks or comments that have relation to my gut.
[9:01 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i didnt mean it to mean that. i'm sorry! :-(
[9:02 pm] CWC:
I like that ice cream too.
[9:02 pm] CWC:
it's okay, I just wanted you to know. :) h
[9:02 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
its because i think you're just as yummy... ;-)
[9:02 pm] CWC:
Sweeeeeeeet, just like you. :-* h
[9:03 pm] Jacklyn Romy:

[9:03 pm] CWC:

[9:03 pm] CWC:

[9:03 pm] Jacklyn Romy:

[9:04 pm] CWC:

[9:04 pm] Jacklyn Romy:

[9:05 pm] CWC:

[9:05 pm] Jacklyn Romy:

[9:06 pm] Jacklyn Romy:

[9:07 pm] Jacklyn Romy:

on making the trip to the Blue Ridge; I have gone on there before, but it was with my dad and his Seinor Pass.
[9:10 pm] CWC:
I'm just not sure about going there by myself.
[9:10 pm] Jacklyn Romy:

[9:11 pm] CWC:
I haven't done it before, and it is soo high.
[9:10 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
