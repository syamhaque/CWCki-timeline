yeah well every prime has their origin and sometimes it takes them a lot
longer to actually find themselves and mentally and emotionally get their together so be patient with them they
are manifesting and doing
Hey what's up everybody on YouTube jesus Christ channel Sani Prime here once again and today we are starting on wave
three of Transformers Legacy Diet Burge starting with the origin form of
Christian Prime or just Christian as she was known before she came prime or her
original name CC82 so here we are and there she is and
first and foremost always we'll take a quick look at the packaging so right up front we got a really impressive front
cover art i mean look at that aura she's got that rainbow glow going on look
she's even analyzing that matrix under the microscope and it's glowing it's so
beautiful i mean look at this look at it look at it it's so gorgeous and
inspiring yes anyway yes transformers Legacy Transformers Legacy I merge that
was when my tongue stopped working for a moment is she is a Voyager class
classif and uh on this side of the bot you got the uh lovely artwork of
CC82 with uh that rung gun going all the way to the uh that's the front of the
bots and uh let's uh the camera a little bit so you can see the top and uh yeah
just Christian Chan or and CC2 and
Christian Chan in Cybertronian and it's actually got a bit in quality isn't that nice and then on
the side of the box you got the uh lovely half of the poster art and uh h
there's something different about this as opposed to the uh bottom half of the uh other art of the other poster arts on
the other boxes so h maybe they actually got a good artist to actually do this or
something i don't know there's something I just I can't quite put my finger on it
all right so yeah we got that going on and then so yeah there's the uh top the box and uh there's the bottom with the
words things and barcodes and uh on the back of the box you got your obligatory process does this that and the other and
you got a little rung gun you mean you got more of one and just look at that action pose and scan the matrix and uh
everything and uh that's basically it for the
packaging and moving right along so here we have CC82 in her origin form she was a
microscope are you surprised yes because she was very smart and she was very
studied in everything cyberronian and metaphysical and so on so of course
she's going to have something quite inspiring and mental and good to go so
let's get a closer look and uh look at the uh details so yeah you got the uh
microscope and uh top going on right there and yep little bomb with the uh
little tray right there for the specimen and uh the uh base you got that going on
got all And then the sides you got the little faux dials on there and then there's the back there's some uh sticker
detail on here and there that's a bit more obvious in robot mode and that's aside from the allot symbol right there
yeah so anyway yeah and then just essentially yeah there's the top of that and then there's the bottom um it's a
microscope but I it doesn't really roll but it can slide like microscopes can
slide hooray for sliding gliding fun
microscopes so moving right along for comparison well we'll just uh get a few
prime comparisons out of the way first and foremost so here she is with Prime just a truck i mean kind of
like Well there you go and here she is with the Studio
Series Hot Rod so you can see that there i mean hardly a contest microscope
car and of course uh here she is with uh Chris Chan Prime her future self in her
updated glory i feel like the differences will be more clear in robot
mode and here she is with in a group shot with Sonchu Edelina Silver Prowler
Armorat Bumble and even Jetness guitar mode all right and here she is with the
combiner team of Autobots from Clickfield Wave Roll Out Armorats and Chapper
and here she is with the Decepticons we have so far the first Punis lab the first SAV and Decepticone
Collector and of course here she is with her best friend forever Mr
rung bit off center but you know there she is with Mr
rung and here she is with a couple of her other p other microscope and details
so here she is with the times return perceptor see that's what's going on
right there that's a considerable mold made if you'd like and here she is with
studio series perceptor and uh I'll get to the uh comparison between the those two
perceptors as well but I feel like just between the two the times return version
the big winner in comparison let me shrink
everything yeah all right so there you
go all right so now let's go over the accessories she comes with and she comes with quite a few so for starters she
gets her uh little gun so as we're talking about she has her own little headmaster because she eventually became
a headmaster and separate herself from her robot body and uh she comes with uh
not one but two little rung partners huh
we'll get to for details upon why later but just to give you this
uh but just to give you this quick comparison boy pause and boy was that
awkward that my right arm had to go off screen in front of the camera just to reach for the other one oh and I got to
get the big rung as well all right what three two one go all
right so yeah for comparison so here's this uh rung with the uh pink rung that
came with her future self Chris Chan Prime and here's the little rung
with the big rung you know what let's just I'm going to just uh lay these right here so you can see the comparison
get this out of the way been a funny day but oh well it's been a funny day but oh
well needs a little bit better come on yeah oh well work what you got work
what you can do all right so get the camera back up where it was so yeah we
got you get those and um you also get some lovely little effects parts you get
these two little zappy effects parts right there they'll plug into the uh
little rungs right there we'll have a blouch moment in a while and I am reminded of another detail but
anyway but yeah you get those little effects parts and of course she comes with her uh headmaster right here that's
uh definitely different from the from the future self let's get a closer look
and uh look at the details oh yes perfect focus yes all right so you got
some lovely detail over the place on this little robot body here and of
course the uh Yeah there's the upside down face right here and um for comparison uh here
is that little headmaster with Soni right there that comes with
Sonu and here she is with the G1
headmaster all right so anyway so there's lot Oh I forgot the one most one
of the most fun important accessories so you get you also get the core of the
Matrix right there all nice and done in gold paint with lovely little
translucent uh blue center that lovely little gem right there which eventually
she does get her own matrix of leadership albeit from herself count from an alternate timeline that uh well
it ended up shortly after but anyway so we can incorporate these so you got options so of course you can uh take the
little headmaster here and do this as well but what you mainly want to do is uh have the little matrix you plug it in
right here got this little groove right here that this little bit right here is going to
go into you just tap that in there that'll hold that in place and there you go she's scanning the core of her matrix
that she had just imported and what we like what the instructions tell you to do and what I like doing is you take the
two rungs and you put them on the side it's like uh she's got her own little conductors going on but yeah then this
is just the basic part where these little parts come in so one up here and
one up here and you got your electrifying moment yeah all right but you do have an
option for storing you do have options for storing the gun in this mode you can pop into the little port on the
microscope if you really wanted to or what I like doing because I feel like it's a bit more arrogant there's a that
5 mil pre on the back just plug it in right there and just like if you have it
directly looking at you you hardly know it's there it's just that's just pretty
cool all right but anyway so without further ado let's get down to transformation shall we let's let's
can't really get spin out of the microscope but all right so first
transformation go ahead get this out of the way so we'll transform one of the two little rungs and uh just get that
split the legs and uh pull the arms out from behind there and then you rotate
this bit and and there you go you got your you got your little rung guy and we'll do
the comparisons a little bit later in the robot mode so anyway let's get closer look at the details of the little
rung and just you got a lot of details in the face and the uh orange not the
orange some grays a little bit red so you got that going on and there's the
back just big old backpack right there articulation articulation wise what we
got so nothing at the head the arms can do a full 360 and they can go in and out on that ball joint and uh you got
uh you got waist rotation as well so legs they can go forward that far and
back that that far but farther if you want to if you get the backpack out of the way so
[Music] outward about that far you got a little bit of rotation with that uh ball joint
there attached to and nothing at the knees nothing at the feet so there you go that's this little rung this little
rung guy so we'll do that comp robot comparison later right now let's
uh get her into get this one into her secondary alt mode so yeah she does have
a second alt mode as opposed to microscope and this is quite simple so you're going to rotate the uh microscope
part like this and if you want to keep that in place you got this uh part right
here that you can flip out and now just hold that right there now you want to take the legs you got a little tab that
goes in that slot right there you pull that out and you just uh rotate this around a little bit and you just rotate
the leg until the peg is angled so it can go into that side and just plugs in right there and
second verse is just like the first unpack the uh leg from there rotate that
around rotate that bit get plugged into the shoulder right here and uh also you
also definitely recommend you want to just uh pop this pop this up a little bit so you got
this being upward so then uh you can take her tight master flip out the arms
forward i forgot about my articulation on tight master so yeah head can rot head is on a ball joint wiggly waggly
can do a full [Music] 360 silly day I've had anyway look up a
little bit down some arms can move up and down and uh a little bit outward and
legs can go can go move forward that far back that far and you have that uh
backwards and forwards knee joint right there anyway so just get the little tie
master in her seat position pop into that uh groove right there so she could
be manning the uh big cannon
and make sure I got that yeah I think in this instance I like I feel better with
that not using that just this works a bit better and then don't have to wait further adjustments
there's another one for the uh blooper reel that ends up being published on the uh final video but anyway there you go
there you have CCA2 in her tank mode you know it's
decent little tank mode it's good and everything and uh yeah so pretty much a
lot of the details you've seen before obviously and clearly and just that's uh the kind of
reverse yoga pose going on right there yeah but of course uh what we like doing
I'm going to put the little rung back in the weapon mode for this
because we can pop them onto the sides
here and there you go there's a bit of triple force going on right there oh articulation but yeah so you can rotate
you can pull you can ro angle the uh you can angle the cannon as you like
out there if you don't pull it off and it rotates so you got that going on and
you can slightly angle the uh tank upward if you dis if you dislodge the joint right there but yes of course and
you got the tank mode right here all right and here she is
with Prime
with Hot Rod
with Christian Prime and uh of course
uh with her big wrong
partner all right so here is uh here she is with uh the Quickville Autobots Sonu
Bumble Lumba Prowler Silver Omarats Atelina and Jet in his guitar
mode and here she is in the group shot with the combiner team uh Roll Out
Chapper Farshot and Wave here she is with the uh Decepticons we have so far
punlat the first that SAV the first and Decepticone
Cracktor and of course times return Perceptor in his
tank mode there you go and that's not the
ending that's not transition period and of course with
Studio Series Perceptor that
didn't yep so there you go all right so let's get down to
transformation once again shall we let's There you get an easier spin in the tank
mode all right so let's remove the two rungs in the side
here and uh take the talking master out of it uh the seat position I'll go ahead
and just uh pop it into head mode just obviously arms to the side then bump it
over and around chin there you go that's ready to go all right so then we take the uh legs
split them from the side rotate get them angled outward and then rotate them downward you take this blue piece that's
the extension part you rotate that in flip the foot out second verse just like
the first pull that down rotate make that that's forward then rotate this out
pop the leg up go ahead and take the camera you can leave this on here if you want to but I kind of feel like um I
like actually having it uh off but of course when I have it in robot when I
have this in robot mode I'll uh when I have it in robot mode I'll
have it stored on the back which I'll get to in a little bit so I'll just for now leave it on just put it back here
like this i'm leaving it like that so you can take the arms out rotate the fists out then you rotate them upwards
get the arms rotate it down like that same thing on the other side push this down take the chest plate put that in
place this little belly button piece put that in place and then of course missing a head there's the
head getting there secured okay
yeah yep actually yeah that's another detail so I'll go ahead and do talk about this as well see you got that 5
mil port right there and of course that peg that'll go into the slot right there what I like doing in regards to the uh
cannon and storage I like to put it on the back like that but we'll go into other options in a little
bit all right yeah it can make it a bit heavy come on you stand can you stand
because it's normal darn this table i'm going to take
the camera i'm going to take the scope off and put right here for right now make it easier all
right and but yeah there you go there you have uh CC82 origin form Christian
Prime Autobot in her robot mode and she does really good in the robot mode and
you got all the lovely little details and everything going on here so let's get closer look at the details
not on the belly button eyes up there whoop eyes up here so
yes so yeah um focused as possible um
well anyway so here she is in her robot mode and she's got love she's got lovely little face features though it's like
it's not so clear with the as in tell with the camera but anyway yeah she's got
hochromeia right eye green left up blue and she's got pinks and blues on her
head and she got all kinds of pinks and blues all over by lots of good sticker
detail and couple of silver ones on her shins and just uh give you turn around
and we'll go at the back so there's the back as well
yep so yep there you go all right so what we got for
articulation i'm going to tell you not sure we can see everything with the camera so yeah typical with high
master and master heads and the ball joints they got your wiggly waggly wiggly waggly she can only look up a
little bit she can look down a little bit head can do a full 360 arms can do a full 360 they can move in and out you
got bicep rotation and 90° of bend there at the elbow no wrist rotation but the
hands can move anywhere now we're doing a transformation no waist rotation legs
can move forward that far back that far when you don't have the backpack on
outward she can do the full splits and then some if you want to use that transformation joint and then some it
just It looks really weird looks really weird but still fun and uh you got thigh rotation legs you got full range of leg
movement right there and you have a toe joint you can go down can't really go up
too much and there you go all right so let's run through the
accessories once again so you can definitely uh got the gun so you can
give her this gun and uh you can give her one of the
rungs in one hand and if you really want to feel like you could uh store one on the arm right now and uh yeah she can
bang bang bang bang and all that good stuff oh of course duh i feel dumb take
this it I should have done this in the first place you can have that she could be holding the two rungs or Yeah here
you go here you go holding her scoping cannon so yes she can do pew pew bag and all
that epic excellent good stuff all right so as I just made pretty much
clear you have the 5mm ports on either forearm you can plug these or the other
or this gun in and mainly well like I said I like
storing the microscope on the back in this hole and uh you got the little five wheel
port right here so you can store the other gun on that as well or one of the two rungs or you do have this option as
well you have this slider it's slide it all the way over
here it's tight on my copy and you have this 5 mm port right here and you can
take this and store it back here like that and maybe probably a bit more
elegant if uh this way so that's a thing
if you want to do it if you want to do it and uh also you can take the uh
little mattress core you have a slot right there it's not a secure hole but
it'll sit in there tap that slide in but yeah you can tell it's not secure like
that and yet if you put the Titan master in there that sits more secure that's not
falling out what's up with that h Well here's a scary moment if you really want
you could take that core end
well core head that's scary like shockwave and as
I mentioned earlier these two rugs are blouch compatible yes they are so we could take our lovely little blue shoes
here we can even take the little ladyb blue shoes which I do like they're so fun and good and I'm going to do it this
way where they're on something they're on the arms like that as supposed to ho them because if the she holds them in
her hands and she's not able to flex her elbow like that to get holding upward
right so I feel like this works better anyway so you could do it with the uh full
blush if you really wanted to but in this case I want the full want the
little lightning bolts as well so yeah so we'll just take this off we'll go with just the uh smaller
portions uh plug one in here and
uh in here and uh in here and uh actually yeah let's do I'm
going to be more symmetrical like this put the one of the lightning bolts here and plug the other little lightning bolt
there you stay on there you stay on
there yeah there you go there there you go this will work all right i'm going do this so you can see the face as
well come on stay up stay up all right but with this we can do a big old origin
Christian Chad
[Music] CC82 an all powerful prime origin
blush and now for comparison here she is with her BFF Mr
wrong as you can see right there
with prime yeah that's a bit of a height
difference right there isn't it and again she was she was young she
had not become a prime yet here she is with Hot Rod
and here she is with her future self Christian
Prime here she is in a lovely dynamic group shot with Sonu Silver Etselina
Prowler Armorat Jet and Bumba Lumba
and here she is in that dramatic pose alongside Wave Fireshot Chappet and Roll
Out and I'm thinking Wave right there is being very judgmental about the haters and the fakers in the audience that are
watching this right now so yeah here she is with the Decepticons we
have so far pun the first SA SAV the first and Decepticon Corrector
and I suppose we'll do a bit of a side byside comparison putting her in the center ring and here we have CCA2's rug
with her future selves run partner and big rung as well as Sani in
comparison and now for a sidebyside comparison here she is with Titan's
Return Perceptor and with Studio Series
Perceptor and uh just as I mentioned earlier it's like night and day between
the Titans Return and the Studio Series and the clear winner between the two is
just Titans Return i
mean they don't rotate on that shoulder i mean you could do that that don't work
you could do that just what's up with that that's not in the show that's not the comic book you do like the sidearm
right there but that don't work but then yeah you can rotate this
so yeah there you go and that was another detail I forgot
to mention if you have this on the thing you can ro on the here you can rotate
that as well and yeah you could use that slider and yes you can get rid of the
overshoulder cannon so there's this lovely little comparison
as well so there you
go so yeah this here is CCA2 Autobach Christian origin form and
yeah she's quite the very decent figure not without her flaws of course like there's like a little bit of a like a
bow it's going to be easy to uh knock back over and uh some connectivity issues and like wire two of the ports
that little matrix just uh doesn't want to stay connected in the uh big gun for
that bit of storage so that's a flop and a bit of a bust right there but oh well but still just an all round decently
good figure and just I do like this part i'd like to like the mode and uh yeah of
course she is definitely the bot that uh was not only a technician a scientist but she was quite the metaphysical
spiritualist type of individual and that continuation she got her promotion and
got her mates of leadership yep so anyway so there you go
now I picked this up from Target and you're going to find these popping up in your Walmarts as well as the big bad toy
store Entertainment Earth and all the other fun good places check out GameStop all that and uh so yeah this is the
start of wave three for treasure services except merge and uh this is this here is uh
CCA2 Albach Christian Prime origin form and this is Jesus Christ son saying
remember you don't stop playing because you grow up you grow up because you stop playing be geek be crowd
and that is going to be just
prime geek be proud you know what's coming
up oh hello Chris so I see so what's this lovely little project you got going
on here well Optimus Prime needed a few more Autobots so the cause and actually
making a few more i'm This is my first one i'm making for the team and I'm thinking about dubbing it after that of
which I found out of that of which I got my name from the avatar of all existence
just importing a bit of the old Allspark energy for the well of all sparks in the center of Primus
[Music] itself oh my
goodness oh my goodness chris your spirit is so successful it's alive
alive yes it is or rather he
is uh hey can you hear me are you
functional uh yeah I think so um uh wow
okay uh arise Sonu welcome to
Cybertron is that where I am uh
uh are you my mother in a way yes but I prefer you
think of me as your fellow Autobot autobot okay i see i am going to
need a whole bunch of data and understanding i shall teach you personally as will my best friend here
my assistant Rug right here good evening soju it is very nice to meet you uh yes
it is very nice to meet you as well Brung okay
well I don't know where to start i feel a little bit hungry yes though we shall
get you some food and nourishment free up an air John john huh huh is that
anything like a
pineapp pineapp huh yes I think so in my meditations and connections with the uh
planet Earth i do believe that is a a specimen of food from there and I'm thinking I
see reason to believe that not only did I name this Autobot after the very first
Sonichu of all existence that I have become aware of but I think I've brought in the soul of a Sonichu from
Earth oh I think you might be right okay
um I don't really know what you're talking about lady
[Music] uh Sonu and what was my name again i have
dubbed thee Sanchu oh okay well then I guess I feel a little
better all right so shall we go get you some air John please lead the way i thought we
have a lot to learn about where I am now even the future leader of an Abad team
with such the circumstance could only have the appropriate name of which I had
discovered and dubbed him and you know what to quote Optimus that's just
prime and I'm good with
