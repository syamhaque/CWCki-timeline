Michael Hirtes's response to Chris's money demands.
Minor Update, Handouts! is a series of two videos uploaded by Chris on 24 May 2017. In the first video, Chris begs for handouts, flaunting the recent comic pages as reason enough to donate to him and alleviate his monetary problems. He demands that donations be at least a dollar, possibly because any amount lower than a dollar would be negated by Paypal fees.
Of course, trolls responded by donating amounts lower than a dollar. Less than an hour later, Chris uploaded a second video, exclaiming his annoyance regarding receiving a single-penny donation. Once again, he exploits his mother by exhibiting her as an additional incentive for his audience to donate to him.

Hello everybody, this is Christine Chandler coming to you live from home once again.
Just pretty much uh... this video is another plea for money because... we're really broke, and my mother needs more of her meal replacement shakes right now... [sighs] thought I got enough to last throughout the rest of the month. [mumbles]
Anyway, but obviously, as y'all have... may have noticed, on my Facebook, I have been... I have made... completed a bunch more pages for book 11... here, screencap that. [camera pans to a panel from the book]
[reads out Silvana's speech bubble with a Russian accent] Ugh, kaputniks! Ze Internet trolls! Ugh, kaputniks!
[shows off a few more pages and mumbles] Anyway, we're also uh... previewed... also, uh, I did three more pages today, I'll upload those onto my Facebook later, just check that. Another little bonus, Sandy has a male name. [laughs]
[camera pans back to Chris] But anyway yes. My mother and I... we need a lot more money please. So please donate to the link below... no less than one dollar. No change. We want dollar amounts. And definitely... from each person... the recommended amount that the link suggests. Please, please, please. We need the mah-ney, for more food. [sighs] Another week and a half to go. [sighs again] God... and Sorbet... the vet bill's a hundred f- sixty dollars... [puts on glasses and sighs for a third time] Anyway, please help us. [raises up hand] Thank you have a good day.
We Said Donations No Less than $1.00, US, Please
This is Barb's sixth appearance during the Financhu Crisis, where she can be seen relaxing on a filthy mattress/sofa of some kind. It is another look into the hell that goes on at 14 Branchland Court.
The video starts off with Chris angrily asking for donations to be no less than one US dollar. He then points the camera at his decrepit mother and directs her to say that they need money. Near the end, he asks her what she needs and she simply looks at him, dumbfounded. He says she's been needing shakes, referring to drinks designed to supplement nutrition, helpful for seniors who cannot easily chew food.
Barb appears to be extremely frail in this video, as well as in April 2017's EMERGENCY HOME UPDATE, when she knew she was being recorded. However, it should be noted that in her appearance between those videos, Live Game Stream - C-Log 04142017, when she walked in on Chris's livestream without realizing he was recording, she is mobile, able to walk up and down stairs without assistance, and demonstrated cognizance when she informed Chris that they were out of cat food and directed him to buy more with a specific bank account.
Given her history of manipulation, it's possible that her actions in this video were exaggerated for pity.
Chris was heavily criticized for how he treated Barb in this video, with some people considering it to be elder abuse. Despite the evidence towards the contrary, Chris deleted this video shortly after uploading it, but TheCWCvilleLibrary was able to save it.
