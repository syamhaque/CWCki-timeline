YOUR TAX DOLLARS AT WORK!The contents of this page have been bought with taxpayer money!
Live Game Stream - C-Log 04142017 is the first Captain's Log video since July 2016's Update 20160718. In keeping with his recent demeanor, Chris appears demented and tries to sound female. The video is very long and extremely tedious, consisting mostly of Chris trying to talk up his merchandise while playing with expensive Transformers toys (having uploaded a begging video the same day). Despite having appeared to be at death's door in the other video uploaded on this day, Barb finds the energy to shamble into frame and berate Chris about cat food, providing surcease of the seeming eternity of looped PS4 music and Chris's gibbering. The video concludes with yet more incoherent Transformers trivia punctuated by an abstractly motivated attack on Trump and his daughter, followed by a reminder to watch Chris's thrilling reaction video to SNL.

Transcript
Good evening, this is Christine Chandler coming to you live from home once again, but for the first time in a long time this is Captain's Log, stardate zero-four, one-four, two-zero-one-seven. And I'm trying -- in a different format, obviously, I've got a microphone attached to my head, but hopefully this time my voice'll be louder than the music that I'm still forced to have to block out. I figure on something different for tomorrow's video where I commentate live reactions to watching the Trump episode o' Saturday Night Live. In the meantime we'll start with some of the-- the pleasant news, about something good. And yeah, just knocked over the gate behind me that was laying against the wall, pfft.
Anyway, so let's talk a little more about Son-Chu. The Autobot figure that you could win, for a limited time. And the stamp album's still available as the last automatic win for, ya know, da figure… an’ my Sky [runs out of breath] – m’ self Skylander figure, m’ self Skylander card, and… [gulp] T-shirt! Look at da previous video, respectively, for… dat!
So ayway, I’mma talk bout de additional features you get… with dis thing. Where– [turns to the right to look for something] talk about, de silver gunnn! Alright, so ‘bout de – inititially, you would get, de Silver Gun’s… .y’know… [plays with toy] just ‘s I said in da review video… so we’re goin’ [snaps something] whoop… mmrrr… [tries to attach to toy] get in ‘nere, get in ‘nere!! Get in ‘nere. Soop… there you go. [re-poses toy] And… da face of da Mark 1 version of Autobot Son-chu as I had designed back… so many years ago, during da days when Armada was still on the air. And… obviously dis becomes… [more playing with toys] his shield! Because… when he was an Escort, his roof was the shield. But his roof isn’t so long… isn’t so wide right now, so we had to give it… we had to make a lion out of it. And this is not a lion! I’m not a lion. [playing] Zoooom! Babboombaboombaboombaboombaboom. [voice becomes much more childlike as he plays] And a course… da pipes! Da pipes… da go… in robot mode dey’re like dis, but you gotta swup ‘em round when you… doin’na vehicle mode, udderwise… dey… drag ‘em off the ground. Just way they’re curved! So ayway… m..n.nn… [makes strange noises while playing with Son-Chu]
Soooo, let’s talk about the additional things that you get… .first off is I have st… sh… done the stuff I’ve shown in the last… pitcher on ma Facebook post, dis’ll be my face if I was an Autobot! [shows to camera, childlike voice again] Zoom in! [paws own face] Hope you all can see that okay. ‘s two cameras on this thing, so I’m just going with whatever. B’ayway, comic book canon, so you still have me as human, and uh… then I transform into… my Sonichu form, and then I go… and then I tell Son-chu, “hey par – hey Autobot friend, let’s g – let’s… g’bine forces!” And he says [deep voice] “Alright.” [back to childlike voice as he plays] So, addishally he go… open his neck ho’ and his head… will go down. He’s not a Titan Master, in da books, alright? An dis ashually works for real in… on da ashuall figure, I show ya. See? His… with the arms being wide enough, he ashually can… sit… tucked… like dat! [holds figure up, head falls out] [sigh] Why you misbehavin’ now on me, ‘vall times? [tries to fix toy] Come on. Come on… get in’nere… shtay in’nere. Shtay in’nere. You SHTAY! [high voice] You SHTAY! [holds up toy again, head falls out again] It works most’a da time. [sigh]
Ayway so… beside from that, dat closes on top, annnn… .so… I climb up around him and I… [childlike voice again] get ready to do a homing attack, and I Sonichu Form, and den I become my Autobot face! A-den… with da neck hole, being above his head, while his head is down ‘nere in da chest ‘n his body somewhere, VOOP! My head is on top of his head! Nyahaha! Joke! But… nothing sexual, o-kay? Leave it a‘dat.
[begins playing more with toys] So… first time I’m attached to Son-chu in dis way, s’like a… kinda a biddofa a God-master, ‘cause [cartoony voice] I AM GOD OF DIS DIMENSION OF CWCVIIIIILE, VIRGINIAAAA! Hey wait! First is, da rocket pack! As you seen in… various photos on Facebook! It look like a bob-sled! I had to des – I like da better design, dis way. O-kay? So, dis goes, onto his back, into this… [shoves at camera] that slot! Right dere. De middle piece! Goes dere. An… dis part, nyep, goes into his… bwoott! Goes into his bwooott! [means “butt”]
Aight, and… dis fin, dis spoiler here, goes on… top dere! And… you got wings! [his voice is disturbingly high pitched] Dey’re also guns! Dey go… on eedder side! And first time I attached to him, my Cherok – my Cherokian powers… t’sup bring all this force… into dat reality! [cartoony voice] So now… Son-chu can fly! But still… .there’s something that… only I ca – that he can only – da his body can do, only while ma head – while I’m attached to him. De Psychic-Normal and Electric attacks, of the – of my Sonichu form, for one thing, so [up goes that pitch again] dooowwwww, as a robot, Son-chu’s body can… .summon thunderbolts! ‘N thunderrrrrr! From da sky! Hyper Beam and… .levitating Psychic Attacks! Aaaaaand… .I pull out a lil bit of electricity and… he gets a sword! Alright? Yes it’s the [mountain dew?!!] Sword from Voyager Prime but, it works! [squeaky] It works! Lightning sword! [waves toy’s arms around]
And also sumthin’ else fun you can do with this sussessory, you can atta – which, you can do between Chromedome or Breakaway times… return figures… [does something to toy] looka dat! Makea look like… [up with voice pitch] ligh’nin comin throuuuugh! Da barrels of dese cannons an’nen… make it look like a taser gun! [makes shooting noises with mouth while moving toy] Electric taser attack! A’ere’s something I like-a do with de… silver guns, on dis t’ing… [adjusts toy] Now dere’s something kinda [cancer?!] about him dere! And… ba-boom, ba-boom, ba-boom ba-boom, ba-boom, ba-boom, boom boom boom! Aright?
[actual baby talking now] A we’p just put da wings back on ‘ere, because we’re gonna da FUN! Part… We’re y – now… we fly! [air whoosh with mouth, Mickey Mouse voice] Fly out from… da rocket pack! We flyyy! I belieeeeeve I can sooooaarrr… … [breaks piece off of toy, normal voice] an ‘nen ‘nat happened. His… [resumes Mickey Mouse voice] I wann’ned to put my haiiiiir into the wind! And lift my face up so I can see where I’m goin’, I BELIEEEEVE I CAN SOOO-OOO-OO-OOAR.
[adorable cat meowing] And dat would be Sorbet, meowing. [Sorbet says meowwww?]
Yeeeeeanyway, so, dat’s all de addishional features for Audobot Son-chu and… mm, unless I can get… a few more of dese swords, I have to get… .find something, or some – or somewhere, or somebody wit’ 3-D scanner printer… or if I can download 3-D scanner app to my phone, a better one, than S-Scan… 3D… like all the around photos and whatnot… sum’ better than that one, cause I tried it, it don’t work for me. Ayway, scan ‘nat, annn… also da bobsled! Ayup!
Unless I find somebody who can… put through da 3-D printer, who can do it for me imme’iately, I def’nly need to scan and print da bobsled, rocket pack! And by da way, when I ‘ttached it all, mm… [moves toy] dat to da side dere… [baby talk] my headmaster… my Titan Master self, me! I can ri – I can ride on it, like dat! Bit odd, but… you can see my… oh, my face. [plays with toy] Dey in dere, dey in dere! You stay! And… spoiler, goes inna hole, inna middle, right dere. ‘long with da [fire?] dat was in da back, dis sword goes dere! And… d’wings! Onna side! See? Dere’s my Titan Master Vehicle dat makes a big buncha add-on for Son-chu! [part of toy falls] My way, dese uh… dese two guns, wings? I got ‘em offa Shapeways. An ‘nat’s where I’m hopin’ to get 3-D Printer result of [holds bobsled thing] this, after I do a susessful scan of it. And I don’t have any CADD software on my laptop, cause if I – udderwise, if I did, den I probably would be able ‘a do this myself. Plus it’s been a few years since… got dat… diploma’n got dat degree and whatnot. [raspberry]
Whatever. So…[resumes childlike voice] talking ‘bout da Son – talking ‘bout, master da Son-Chu ratio, ‘dis’ll be…ashually first gif, I was standin’ next to Son-chu as a real-life Audobot, outside here [gestures to a window presumably], that’s about right!

More than a month ago, I got free – I got offer for free LGBT [??] includin’ dis bracelet [shows bracelet], all I had to do was pay $2 shipping, and dis bracelet also got dis necklace [shows necklace] so…yeah, they’re jis…lil inexpensive things, that all I did was pay shipping for. They were free! So…[wags finger] no allegations, no suspicions dere.

We mashed [managed] to get a little flow for de minimum…money amount for de…electric company, but…rest ‘a the month! I hate da second half of da month!
