================================================================================

A combination fan and personal chat with Chris from 28 December 2008.
Chris briefly answers a few mundane questions from his fans (as delivered by BlueSpike) before settling into a "private" chat with his sweetheart PandaHalo.
Summary
In the fan-chat portion of the transcript, Chris reveals the unthinking nature of his religious faith ("I believe; I just do"), also notes that he believes in astrology, states that he would play himself opposite Britney Spears in a movie about his life, attempts to quash any accusations of pedoforkia by insisting that the Chaotic Combo's members are 19 years old, dodges a question about the collapse of his relationship with Megan Schroeder, and mentions that he got a copy of Bee Movie for Christmas. He also expresses his fear of seeking gainful employment in the outside world - if he were married, he says, he would be the "House Husband."
When PandaHalo arrives, the conversation takes a turn for the bizarre. Chris briefly mentions his pants-shitting problem (nearly a month before he would reveal its full magnitude in a chat with Clyde Cash) and spars with Panda over his curious unwillingness to have cyber sex with her. (Perhaps his duck was temporarily out of commission at the time.) He mentions that he's learned a great deal about how to relate to the world through Family Guy, and also cites the comedian Red Skelton as a role model for his attempts at social interaction. Naturally, there's a lot of whining about stress and online bullying as well.
Chris's mystic inclinations make an appearance in this chat. Asked why he wants a daughter so badly, he explains "It was fortold [sic] unto me in multiple dreams."
Panda appears to cope with Chris's idiocy by unleashing a series of profane, Tourette's-like outbursts. Chris is happy to accept her explanation when she says she is simply letting off steam with random bursts of vulgarity, and does not consider the implications when she says things like "FUCKING CUNT RETARD WITH AUTISM YOU FUCK SHIT DUMB CUNT DOG FUCKER."
Of particular note is Chris's comment at 21:35, in which he states that he hasn't "borrowed [his] mother's [bra and panties] for years." While it might be construed as a poor choice of words on Chris's part rather than a tacit admission of past cross dressing, the later interpretation seems much more likely in light of recent revelations
The Chat
21:08 <@canine> he needs to get his ass in here

21:10 <%ChrisChanSonichu> Hey.
21:10 -!- mode/#sonichu [+o ChrisChanSonichu] by canine
21:10 <%BlueSpike> I have questions for you, my friend.
21:11 <@ChrisChanSonichu> shoot.
21:11 <%BlueSpike> Maybe by the time we're done, Panda will be back.
21:11 <%BlueSpike> There are many, many paths to god--Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hindu, Shinto, et al. What path do you take, do believe it is the right path for you, and--most importantly--are you one to believe that what the Christian god said in the Bible is the only truth and only correct path to god? What about Christianity causes you to believe this?
21:13 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I was Baptized in a Christian Methodist Church; I believe; I just do.
21:13 <%BlueSpike> I see.
21:13 <@canine> oh, ok, that's respectable
21:13 <%BlueSpike> Next question.
21:13 <%BlueSpike> Speaking of Star Wars, which is better: Original Trilogy or Special Edition, and what's yourfavorite episode?
21:14 <@ChrisChanSonichu> Original; IV
21:14 <@canine> oh, that's mine too
21:14 <%BlueSpike> That's mine too.
21:14 <@canine> :)
21:14 <%BlueSpike> Please describe how your dream marriage would be. How would you support your wife and daughter? Who would clean and take care of the child? Who would pay the bills?
21:16 <@ChrisChanSonichu> in a nutshell, a simple, happy marriage; I would be the House Husband; I would open the oportunity to bring the bacon to my wife; me; I would manage the bills.
21:17 <@canine> oh, cool
21:17 <%BlueSpike> Before your MySpace account vanished, we noticed that you were into astrology (one of our own--a Virgo--is really into it, btw), going so far as to have a Tarot.com AstroStats widget on your profile. What do you think of astrology overall, and how much knowledge do you have on the subject?
21:17 <@ChrisChanSonichu> Astrology is okay; I read my horoscope daily, and a moderate amount.
21:17 <@canine> what is your sign?
21:17 <@ChrisChanSonichu> Piscies
21:18 <@canine> oh, me too
21:18 <%BlueSpike> Cool.
21:18 <%BlueSpike> Next question.
21:18 <@ChrisChanSonichu> February 24
21:18 <%BlueSpike> When are you going to create the second episode of Sonichu in LBP?
21:18 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I do not know; the inspiration for that has not come to me yet.
21:18 <%BlueSpike> I look forward to when the level is published.
21:19 <%BlueSpike> If the story of your life or Sonichu were made into a big Hollywood movie, what famous actor would play the role of yourself? What about any other actors/actresses that come to mind for other characters?
21:21 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I would play myself, as well as the voice of Sonichu; Britney Spears, Jim Carrey...my mind is blank.
21:21 <%BlueSpike> Cool!
21:21 <%BlueSpike> I hope someday that movie is made.
21:21 <@canine> sounds good
21:22 <%BlueSpike> Next question:
21:22 <%BlueSpike> What do you think your life would be like without Sonichu?
21:22 <@ChrisChanSonichu> for one thing, I may not have become internet famous, other than that IDK

21:25 <@canine> or, change it to: I know this is a tender subject, so feel free to pass on it, but, how did the ED page destroy the relationship between you and Megan Schroeder? What happened between you two? Are you still in touch?

21:26 <@canine> that's fine
21:26 <@canine> What would you do if your child was male? What would you name him?

21:26 <@canine> ah
21:27 <@canine> a fan asks: I have heard rumors that the Chaotic Combo are around the age of 4. Is this true?

22:10 <@ChrisChanSonichu> it's not like I asked to be famous without having to leave my home, but it all just fell into my lap, and I guess the stress of all that popular weight weighs heavily on my emotions.
22:10 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I may.
22:10 -!- Guest is now known as Guest8445
22:11 <@ChrisChanSonichu> and with that heavy weight, it may have hindered my inspirations.
22:11 <@ChrisChanSonichu> and the hate on the internet contributed to that as well.
22:11 <@ChrisChanSonichu> it's a LOT to deal with daily.
22:12 <@ChrisChanSonichu> even JUST THINKING ABOUT IT, without having to look at it on my screen...
22:12 <@PandaHalo> must suck being infamous
22:12 <@ChrisChanSonichu> or even when I don't have to think about it, I know it's out there, and I have to deal with that stress on my head.

22:18 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I will make a video of my gratitude soon,
22:19 <@ChrisChanSonichu> and I did make a not of my gratitude on Sonichu.net.
22:19 <@ChrisChanSonichu> *note
22:19 <@PandaHalo> but no video :(
22:19 <@ChrisChanSonichu> okay, I will make a video tonight.
22:19 <@ChrisChanSonichu> and I'll upload it tomorrow.
22:20 <@PandaHalo> thank you
22:20 <@PandaHalo> i appreciate that
22:20 <@PandaHalo> did you hear about ryan cash?
22:21 <@ChrisChanSonichu> yeah, don't remind me of Ryan; suicide over my brief moment proclimation of stopping Sonichu in response to the hate; it hurt me emotionally. That was worse than that child locking himself in the closet after watching Optimus Prime die in the Original Transformers Movie.
22:22 <@PandaHalo> of course it was worse.. he died
22:22 <@ChrisChanSonichu> yeah.
22:22 <@PandaHalo> you should mention ryan in your video
22:22 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I will.
22:22 <@PandaHalo> make a tribute to him or something
22:22 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I will.
22:23 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I'll go now to work on that.
22:23 <@PandaHalo> okay :)
22:23 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I'll talk to you later.
22:23 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I Love You, Sarah.
22:23 <@PandaHalo> bye christian weston chandler
