I`m sorry for the lack of mic audio in the Destiny Stream is a video Chris uploaded on 24 March 2016, apologizing for the silent video CWC`s Destiny Start. Ironically, Chris's Controller Pad was the one that caused the problem. Despite knowing this, he replugs it into his controller, which cuts off the audio yet again, and causes the PS4 to begin attempting to load The Playroom, put up a facecam, and create numerous graphical artifacts. Chris also has a noticeable stubble going on.

[Chris is standing in front of his makeshift Amiibo painting table, which is cluttered with art supplies. A picture in picture showing the same visuals a second time is in the top right. The video starts with Chris already mid-sentence.]
-Of which I've uhh- just realized that apparently my... mic in my camera has been- have been temporally disabled. I didn't realize that I should have unplugged [Chris raises his right hand to show a PS4 Type Pad controller attachment] the keypad from my controller, because apparently, you know, it has a little headphone [Chris moves the Type Pad and controller together, fumbling to connect the two; he continues talking while doing this] thing that goes into the jack on the controlerr-r-
[The audio from Chris's microphone is instantly cut off as he finally manages to connect the Type Pad into his controller]
[The screen rapidly flips between the no video symbol and Chris's room until finally resting on Chris's room]
[Chris motions silently, failing to realize that connecting the Type Pad had once again muted his audio]
[After a small amount of time Chris removes the Type Pad and audio resumes just as Chris ends a sentence]
-st. I should have just- I should have just unplugged it in the first place, that's why, okay? Yeah... So again I apologize for that, I'll just remember for future stream broadcasts I'll just leave this thing unplugged I mean it's a great thing to have, you know, for... [Chris reaches down and raises a PS3 controller with a keypad attached] similar to what we originally had for PS3 with the keypad that was on top... They could have done something wi-[Chris placed the PS3 controller down] they could have done something like that for this you know... just have it not be on top of the uhh- [Chris motions to his PS4 controller] touch pad, could have done it similar. I don't know maybe hooked it to the uhh- USB port there [Chris points to the USB port on the bottom of the controller] to keep it in place, [either Clover or Snoopy bark in the background] that's beyond me and whatever. Okay, well that's just t' let 'chall know. Thank you and have a good day.
