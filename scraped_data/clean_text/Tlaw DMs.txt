Dungeons & Dragons
I've played in a group for a while. On the back burner, I am also considering becoming a DM for a game, where the situations begin from Cwcville, and my group travels around taking out thevarious bosses and collecting necessary items and gadgets.
Oooo pretty darn cool
We have a campaign running where i dm but we need like 1-2 players to get it running
I might consider joining. I like being myself, and I already have my stats laid out. I'm a Cleric/Ranger.
Chris shows the card again
All right. I will look into the Homebrew shortly enough, and gather my stat sheet to clue you in.
Also, here's my D&D self-counterpart in Sonichu Form:
Shweet. We are level 3 atm but go pretty high leveled
Did I show you this card already?
Ooo acylyn might suit yah then. They are avatars of justice that have a human form and an angelic form
I believe so
I am literally interdimensional all of the time, so I can get confused at times.

Hmm. It's 10:37 pm, Saturday here.
Damn, it's monday
Garfield's least favourite day of the week
But still can be a good start for a good week for you.
Yeah, rip. I got the holidays though so I'm happy haha
😊
I will talk with you some more later. You have a lovely and safe day.
