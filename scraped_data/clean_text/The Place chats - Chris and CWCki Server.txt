================================================================================

Delusion disclosure: This article or section takes place during Chris's phase of role-playing as Sonichu. He may refer to his Christine Chandler personality and physical body in the third person by using terms such as "mama".
On 10 August 2020, Chris posted in the Watchmen Discord server The Place about the Discord server Official CWCki Server. Chris noted that either Val or Naught had been encouraging him to interact with the CWCki Server and mentioned he was unsure about what to say to its members. Val volunteered to help gather questions, saying the staff wanted an AMA.
While browsing the CWCki Server, Chris discovered a leaked letter which he had written for Kai, and had told Kai not to share, the Sonichu Journal Pages, that Naught had leaked to the CWCki Server. Chris complained about the leak in The Place, to which Val blamed Kaiyosh's server for being insecure.
Chat
Chris (as Sonichu)
Hey, @Val, I have a question that I’m directly asking you, but also will have it open for everyone else here to comment as well.
Somewhere, either on text or Discord, I believe Val or Bis said something along the lines of “You have a lot of people on the Cwcki server who are willing to serve you hand and foot”.
I get and appreciate their kindness and loyalty, but in the larger events and things to do, I feel unsure of their varying abilities; I am unsure of what to say to them or ask of them to do.
So, @Val, I’ll likely come up with something later on, but to ask you: What did or do you expect me to say to or ask of them?
Also, to note, for the short answers or topics, I tend to answer publicly on Twitter.
Kyle
We know at least that people care not to see things end sadly. But that's a low baseline to set anyway. Sometimes people just care.
Val
Ok I'll gather some questions the staff wants an ama
General questions and insight
Kyle
That's good reasoning. But important to note, owing nothing and feeling no obligation, this is something invaluable.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Off-topic, I just took a look on the Cwcki server; I found the pages of the letter I wrote into Kai’s book and sent privately to him via text; Seriously?!!
Did he REALLY post those online somewhere?
What’s the deal with that?
Val
His server isn't secure
First thing I warned him about
MKRNightVee
He still refuses to speak to us too...
Chris (as Sonichu)
That letter was meant ONLY for him; he was not supposed to share those pages with anyone, and especially never to share those online.
Oh my Chris Chan! This is just further chaos.
Naught
Or an opportunity........
Kyle
He seems like a dumbass, so there's that.
Chris (as Sonichu)
I’ll bite, Bis.
How so?
Naught
There's been a lot of miscommunication and willful misunderstanding of information therefore I believe this is an opportunity to get everyone that matters in the loop
Chris (as Sonichu)
Yes, Kai is a bit of a dumbass, but he is a good kind of dumbass, and his powers and abilities have been personally confirmed, witnessed and experienced by me.
Yeah, everyone that matters in all of this.
MKRNightVee
I like that idea, its hard to trust outsiders
Kyle
I don't like the idea of "a good kind of dumbass". It's a good way to weasel out if you're letting these things slide and can't plan steps for improvement.
Naught
It's time to stare off into the field Lenny
Chris (as Sonichu)
Oh, please.
Naught
No one suspects the quiet person he refuses to engage on any level
Chris (as Sonichu)
Not “Of Mice and Men”
Naught
Well first thing that came to mind
[Naught posts a reaction image]
Chris (as Sonichu)
I’m using this in lieu of a simple sigh
Kyle
If someone is deficient in some manner, we'd want them to improve. So yes, we do expect more from them. In this case, literally anything.
Naught
I wasn't referring to you but of Kai
Chris (as Sonichu)
I got that.
Naught
I will keep emphasizing this as many times as need be but not everyone is as genuine honest forthright as you (edited)
Kyle
You don't hire someone hoping to replace yourself, but it's good management skills to have people with potential who work toward that, failing either. That's not a good sign of someone who'd do well given opportunity.
Well, replacing yourself not being a primary goal, especially not with someone showing traits making them unqualified.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Who said anything about replacing myself?
Naught
There's been a lot of miscommunication and willful misunderstanding of information therefore I believe this is an opportunity to get everyone that matters in the loop
There's a thing called pronoun confusion when an individual mixes up the Me Myself and I it gets confusing linguistically
Chris (as Sonichu)
Fine, brief and inform everyone online about all of this.
Or whatever
Kyle
Just a good way to hire is to try to make sure everyone is as useful as possible, a litmus test for that is hiring people as capable as you are.
Chris (as Sonichu)
That I get.
But let me ask you all:
In this Dimension 1218, and how lack of socialable Mama has been, and that she has had much, much room for improvement in being able to socialize with others, offline and online (moreso skilled old-fashioned offline than online),...
On her own (on my own), at this present time, without any help from Magi-Chan, me, or anyone else: do you really think she is capable of actually finding anyone by traditional means who was as “skillful and capable” as she is? (edited)
Kyle
I guess that would say something for outsourcing.
Chris (as Sonichu)
No shit.
Naught
I'd say it depends on what kind of outcome you're looking for
Kyle
Something like the adage, "no news is good news"
Chris (as Sonichu)
This brain is feeling even more overworked and tired right now, it’s hard to process all of this.
Overwhelming
Val
I'm arrogant; I believe I know better then others because most of the time I do. Yet the more I compare myself to other's or my earlier self.
The further I fall into analysis paralysis.
Kyle
Why things might warrant working through, more than just saying if other people aren't skillful or capable.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Which is amongst the reasons why we all were fated to get together on all of this.
Consciously, in 1218, other than all of you in our group, and the few select others of importance, I’m not sure who else is of “matter” to bring into the loop.
You all know what is and has been going on.
Kyle
Maybe more as a reason of personal offence, least taking things personally means I don't see things as within and without, failing there being a reason for that.
Chris (as Sonichu)
It’s easier for y’all to brief everyone y’all know in confirmation that do matter in all of this.
It’d be difficult for me to do so, especially late in the day and during the night when the brain is feeling prone to drained and Chris-Core is harder at work with everything all around here with everyone else.
Kyle
I don't like the assumption that people don't matter, why I don't promote myself, but I'm still sure of myself. It's just me.
Naught
I'm willing to stick my neck out
Chris (as Sonichu)
Probably the reason for my getting the individuals on the Cwcki server involved at this point and briefed.
I need to meditate and ponder this further.
Val
Tetris?
Kyle
I like the idea of not tripping over myself. Honesty doesn't demand being forward, but it does mean the expectation of doing no wrong.
Naught
It's just relaying data in a concise manner instead of 3rd 4th 6th hand info from a YouTube vid

Chris (as Sonichu)
Bis, Val, y’all are up on filling the Cwcki server individuals in on the details as you will.
Thank you.
