Megumin: You currently have -1,843,811 slime.

!revive
ENDLESS WAR BOT
Geysers of fresh slime erupt from every manhole in the city, showering their surrounding districts. ChrisChanSonichu1982 has been reborn in slime.
ChrisChanSonichu1982: You were gunned down by DoopedyShmoople.
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
!revive !GoddessProtection !GoddessHealing Seriously? Don't simply put me down, because I wasn't fully on this server. In any event, I am immune to the attacks you all may put upon me. As it will be made more clear in the Chronicling, Arizona of C-197 shall be totally cleansed of this slime. It has infected too many minds as it stands. We, the CPUs and Superheroes and everyone else together will cleanse all of you of its influence.
I am outtie 5000. Later. !MachSpeedDash

!infiniterevive Your petty games no longer have effect in C-197, or any Arizona in any local dimensions, including this one, in any timeline. The Endless War is over. The slime is all dissolved.
