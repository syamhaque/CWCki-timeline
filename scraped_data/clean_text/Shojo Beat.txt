November 2005 issue of Shojo Beat
Shojo Beat was a manga anthology magazine (specifically geared towards young girls) published from July 2005 to July 2009 by Viz Media. Chris sent a letter to them, which got published in the November 2005 issue.[1] In it, he stated how he related to the lead character of Absolute Boyfriend, particularly with her initially having trouble finding a sweetheart. He also used the comparison as a way to complain about how he can't find a boyfriend-free girl.
A response letter from "Eris" was published in March 2006.[2] It offered some very good advice on how he shouldn't only look for "pretty girls", and manages to eerily predict how Chris would fuck up his future relationships with women.
Chris's published letter managed to offend his then-gal-pal Megan, who voiced her discontent via an email to him a few months later.

OH BOY
Riiko Izawa in Absolute Boyfriend sort of has the same problem I do: She can't get a guy, and I can't get a girl. Here's my sitch. All the pretty girls are already paired up with some jerk, thus leaving me with none to choose from. Also, nobody can tell, off the bat, a paired-up girl from a Boyfriend-Free Girl. At first, it's equally hard for Riiko to find a Girlfriend-Free Boy, but then she is granted this wish where she gets a Girlfriend-Free Boy (although he is a robot) delivered to her doorstep. Lucky girl. I'm 23 years old; one would think I'd have gotten a girlfriend by now, but no, I haven't. I'm stuck in the situation where if my parents should pass away, I will be a very lonely virgin.

PRETTY, SCHMITTY
In your November issue, a guy was complaining about how he couldn't find a girlfriend. Why is he only looking for "pretty" girls? There are plenty of girls who are not supermodel gorgeous whom he could date. It's not the outside of the package that counts, but the inside. A girl can be pretty on the outside but might be mean and self-centered or have other problems, whereas another girl could be "plain" or even "ugly" on the outside but quite a beautiful, kind, intelligent person on the inside. If more guys would think about what qualities they look for in a girl, and make sure those qualities don't just focus on her outer appearance, they might just find a girl to go out with. Otherwise, many girls will think, "Why bother? He'll just leave me for the next pretty girl he sees."
