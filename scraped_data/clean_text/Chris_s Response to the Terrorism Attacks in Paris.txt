The post in question.
On 13 November 2015, Paris was attacked by a group of terrorists representing the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in a series of shootings and bombings, killing 130 people, injuring countless others, and plunging France into a state of emergency. Countless other nations and individuals joined together in condemnation and homage. In a display of 'empathy', Chris decided that he would create his own show of grief, albeit two days late, loaded with references to Sonichu and Amiibos, and put it up on Facebook.
He also compares the real-life atrocities committed to the acts of a cartoon villain, suggesting that he either wasn't paying full attention or, more likely, could not understand the substantial difference. He also ends up sympathizing with ISIS and pledges that the terrorists should just stand down and become friends with each other, possibly thinking that an organisation dedicated to establishing an extremist totalitarian Jihad across the world would really listen to a single American citizen with autism. The return of the dreaded stress is ever prevalent in Chris's musings.
However, it is possible to discern a mote of kindness and compassion in Chris's passage, even if it is horribly misguided and vague.
Transcript
The text is printed on a colorful background, and poorly scanned so that the sentences run off the image on multiple lines. A poorly-photoshopped and small photograph of the French Tricolore can be seen in the top left corner, and the text is layered on top of a much larger drawing of Sonichu and Rosechu in front of the American flag in uppercase. (This image was reused from page 25 of Sonichu 9, during the sequence where Sonichu claims that people calling Chris gay are an insult to America. That's nice to know.)
IT IS VERY SAD THAT FRANCE WAS ATTACKED BY TERRORISTS YESTERDAY ON THE 14TH. WHERE WAS I WHEN I HEARD THIS WAS HAPPENING? I WAS LITERALLY BEGINNING WORK ON THE BONUS ROSECHU FIGURE, AT HOME FOR THE PERSON WHO BOUGHT THE FIFTIETH SONICHU AMIIBO FIGURE RECENTLY. IT DOES MAKE ME FEEL DISPONDANT [sic] WHEN I HEAR SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD SUCH CHAOS IS HAPPENING, ESPECIALLY REMINISCENT OF SIMILAR ATTACKS ANYWHERE BY THE RANDOM CARTOON VILLAIN, LOOKING TO GATHER ENERGIES AND POWER FOR THEMSELVES, AND THE HEROIC CHARACTERS DO WHAT THEY ARE ABLE TO STOP THEIR ATTACKS WITH SUPERHEROIC, AS WELL AS NORMAL, ABILITIES. BUT LIKE SONICHU, ROSECHU AND MYSELF, WE ALL STAND TOGETHER, COMBINING OUR HEARTS AND SOULS IN THE EFFORTS TO SHARE THE LIGHTS OF FRIENDSHIP AND LOVE AND COMPASSION THAT THE VILLAINS HAVE BEEN OVERLOOKING THAT HIGHLIGHTS THEIR VIEWS ON OTHER PEOPLE OF THIS WORLD AS MIS-GUIDED. AND I FEEL THE TERRORISTS, REGARDLESS OF COUNTRY, ARE MISGUIDED WITH PARANOIA AND FEAR OF OTHERS. IF THEY ONLY UNDERSTAND THAT WE CAN ALL COME TOGETHER AS CARING AND COMPASSIONATE, THEIR ATTACKS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN NEEDED. WHAT GOES ON IN THEIR MIND WITH SADNESS AND MENTAL FRUSTRATIONS AND LACK OF BETTER OPTIONS AND IDEAS, IS MOST UNFORTUNATE. I WISH THOSE PEOPLE WOULD REALIZE AND BETTER UNDERSTAND THAT ON THIS PLANET EARTH, WE ALL ARE STILL MANY OF INDIVIDUAL AND FRAGILE HUMAN BEINGS AND PEOPLE. TO FRANCE, MY PRAYERS GO OUT TO THEM AS WELL IN THEIR RECOVERY. AND MY PRAYERS OF MORAL GUIDANCE AND MORE COMPASSIONATE IDEALS GO OUT TO THE ATTACKERS AS WELL, BECAUSE, THEY, TOO, ARE PEOPLE OF THIS EARTH.
