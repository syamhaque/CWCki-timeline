"For Kacey II" (officially "10252009 For Kacey") is a video Ian Brandon Anderson posted in which he ONCE AGAIN attempts to win Kacey's heart from the real Christian Weston Chandler.
Amazingly, Ian has a better picture and sound this time around, due to him using his Kodak camera instead of his malfunctioning PSEye; there is a major drop in the frame rate and visual quality, though, but it's a whole lot better than listening to Ian Headroom again. However, this is somewhat negated by his manner of speaking; Ian appears to be very nervous, and his speech impediment is extremely prevalent.
