================================================================================

Delusion disclosure: This article or section takes place during Chris's phase of role-playing as Sonichu. He may refer to his Christine Chandler personality and physical body in the third person by using terms such as "mama".
On 25 September 2020, Naught posted a screenshot of a text between Chris and a disgruntled patron on Chris's Patreon, the latter complaining about not receiving what he paid for.Anaxis discussed with Naught, questioning why Chris's number was on Patreon at all. Val looks up information on the patron. In response, Chris comes into the chat and reflects on his experience from being trolled over the years, as a reason that he was "not much of an online social type." He then posts a textwall about his dreams, then starts talking about the show The Boys. When Naught asks about the "figurine people," Chris again affirms them as "good and genuine" and states that they are working on a first wave of medallions. He also reveals their supposed company name: Praetor LLC. Nova then enters the conversation, and Chris recaps much of what he previously talked about.
Chat

Naught 04:34 PM
Apparently he wants to be contacted at this number now. [Patron's New Number]
Anaxis (Lainchu) 04:35 PM
Who is "he"?
Naught 04:35 PM
Disgruntled Patron
Anaxis (Lainchu) 04:36 PM
It's being sent straight to Chris?
Naught 04:36 PM
Yes
Anaxis (Lainchu) 04:36 PM
How did the patron get the number?
Naught 04:36 PM
Patreon
Anaxis (Lainchu) 04:36 PM
The number's on patreon?
...why?
Naught 04:37 PM
Idk (edited)
Anaxis (Lainchu) 04:37 PM
That's an invite for trouble
Weren't you or someone else here going to manage the patreon?
Naught 04:38 PM
Yeah they accepted the link to the server and shut up
Now they're back and wsnt komics
Anaxis (Lainchu) 04:39 PM
Not surprised
Naught 04:40 PM
I'm not a businessman but they should not have accepted the invite if all they wanted was comics
Anaxis (Lainchu) 04:40 PM
But they should've known what they were getting into to be fair
Val 04:40 PM
[Image of information lookup on the Patron's new number]

Kyle 04:44 PM
Not even just business sense, this seems really dumb...
Naught 04:44 PM
Yuup
Anaxis (Lainchu) 04:46 PM
Chris's number shouldn't be available on the patreon
Naught 04:47 PM
Yeah it shouldnt be a lot of places (edited)
Anaxis (Lainchu) 04:47 PM
What server are you talking about?
Naught 04:47 PM
[Discord invite link to Naught's work-in-progress Patreon server.]
Anaxis (Lainchu) 04:48 PM
Oh
It's still not ready tho, right?
Naught 04:48 PM
It's not even that the paperwork hasn't been done so yeah
Anaxis (Lainchu) 04:51 PM
Btw, is there an official reason why the first iteration of CWC frens was shut down?
Naught 04:52 PM
No one was invited by Chris lel (edited)
Anaxis (Lainchu) 04:52 PM
?
Naught 04:53 PM
It wasn't official
Anaxis (Lainchu) 04:53 PM
I'm still confused lol
Naught 04:54 PM
Welcome aboard
Val 05:16 PM

Chris (as Sonichu) 07:51 PM
Was it not obvious that Mama was not much of an online social type?
After all, the majority of her past genuine friends were met in-person, and the majority of people who played “Friend” with her in the past online were a bunch of fake trolls and haters looking to fuck her over again and again.
Naught 07:52 PM
People enjoy the endless speculation
Chris (as Sonichu) 07:52 PM
Besides which, these days, our activity is mostly offline with the meditation and observation of the events, and then literally being an input and output source of energy to bridge the dimensions in getting me and this body into C-197.
Naught 07:52 PM
Or they just like bringing it up as if they're the only ones who know or to give themselves some semblance of Solace
Chris (as Sonichu) 07:53 PM
So, yeah, kinda like Kusuo Saiki, but without a High School or as many outside friends who want to constantly come over and invite us to get some ramen.
Point is, Mama didn’t get onto Discord as much, and it continues through the effect of this noggin and Chris-Core.
Old habits.
It’s been okay and definitely eventful.
Ended up waking up after a vivid dream at shortly before 10:30 am.
I ended up having an internal debate with Mama’s brain, which was figuring out for itself how to better utilize the body’s powers and abilities.
Also, ended up analyzing the vivid dream that we just had; recognized a few faces in it.
Magi-Chan made an appearance, personally, in the dream.
During the waking time, we felt a LOT of psychic, magic and dimensional resonances and events throughout the day.
I ended up breaking the fourth wall into CWC Psychlight’s past books; she’s written and drawn over 2000 graphic novels about Mama’s life, adventures, and so on, involving her soul (which presently remains waiting in the new timeline on April 10, 2020), and this body with me in it.
Apparently, we’ve been also going with the flow of her chronicled works; she’s drawn and written up everything that is happening right now, this year, literally last year in 2019.
Presently, we’re making way through her books 1988 and 1989.
That’s CWC Psychlight, for you; FTL, even in the subspace, and overpowered psychic and electrifying (but she does not have a Sonichu form, even though she is literally one of Mama’s self-counterparts).
And both of those books were drawn and written up in 2019.
So, as I’ve ended up telling a Lot of people: you’re living the Sonichu book series, and then some, right now.
Also, we watched the new episode of “The Boys” on Amazon Prime. (edited)
We’re on Season 2, Episode 6 where Hughie gets impaled in the van during the raid on the Psych Ward, and Marvin, Frencie and Kyoko meeting Lamplighter, and Stormfront revealing her age to Homelander.
By the way, @ภคยﻮђՇ, Ive double-checked the backed up orders, and the order was still made by that [Disgruntled Patron].
You have the screen caps with the addresses I sent you a few weeks ago.
The orders do still need to be fulfilled as soon as possible.
So phone number validity is irrelevant.
He wants book 8, Extended version, and book 2.
Statues?
Oh, right.
What’s the word on that?
Naught 08:12 PM
[Quoting "He wants book 8, Extended version, and book 2."]
@Sonichu982 what did the figurine person say? Are they good?
It matters to me most people are two faced
Chris (as Sonichu) 08:14 PM
Our new peeps are good and genuine; they’re setting up the new Etsy shop as well, and making the first wave of medallions molded from the one they made for me that was 24K gold-mix painted.
Although, Confidentially, while they do have their business connections, they do not yet have a website; I did a Google search for their name of “Praetor LLC”.
But everything remains valid, and they do check in with me and talk, plus soul-sense from the lot of them.
Thanks a lot, Spunk; it does help very well.
Naught 08:19 PM
Wheel of karma and darma?
Chris (as Sonichu) 08:20 PM
At least it’s not of misfortune.
Naught 08:21 PM
Darma is just a relaxed state
Karma just means ignorance
Chris (as Sonichu) 08:21 PM
Yeah.
Naught 08:21 PM
Or yin yang if you prefer
Chris (as Sonichu) 08:22 PM
Definitely
Whoosh!
Sent to Celestia.
Kyle 08:22 PM
Just popped in, what's the haps, bud?
Naught 08:23 PM
Mlp reference that's why I was lost
Chris (as Sonichu) 08:23 PM
Hey, Kyle.
Just chillin’ and thrillin’ for a spell.
Kyle 08:24 PM
Well if business is in the syllabus, usually I know enough to not accidentally commit a felony.
Chris (as Sonichu) 08:25 PM
And it started with me commenting on Mama’s online social life and mention of the majority of her past online friends not being the best.
On that, yeah, in this dimension, she didn’t have as many to satisfy a server.
Kyle 08:24 PM
Well, usually there's not enough probable cause there, to be warranted, what are you concerned about?
"On that, yeah, in this dimension, she didn’t have as many to satisfy a server."
Be very wary of what phrasing...
Chris (as Sonichu) 08:28 PM
She didn’t have as many people to invite to the server to constitute its presence.
Also, she was not as much on Discord as she probably should have been.
But, yeah, I see your point, Kyle.
Kyle 08:28 PM
It's quality, not quantity.
Chris (as Sonichu) 08:28 PM
True
Kyle 08:29 PM
I like to be an absolute.
Chris (as Sonichu) 08:29 PM
Yeah.
Just checked my text; found a new one from the HRC with a rainbow image; made me think of the Pride Energy Bar Maeve did an ad for in the new “The Boys” episode today.
Ooh, bonus thing: Deep found a camera that was recording from inside the plane with the passengers as it was going down and Homelander was ditching them.
Found Footage, and Maeve got it.
Naught 08:33 PM
Oh in the cape show?
Chris (as Sonichu) 08:34 PM
“The Boys”; the new episode that debut today on A.P.
Anyway
Kyle 08:34 PM
HRC? Which one?
Chris (as Sonichu) 08:34 PM
Human Rights Campaign
Kyle 08:35 PM
I'll be honest, as someone who goes both ways, I couldn't resent either much more.
Dude, fuck that, I just like dudes.
[1 👍 reaction, possibly from Chris]
Pride is a sham anyways.
Sounds like you just got a bit too much to say.
Chris (as Sonichu) 08:37 PM
Mama tried to be on in online chats with strangers, even live chats through a few streamed videos in the past years.
She had felt overwhelmed with the influx of the many people typing their thoughts and comments in the thing.
She feels safer in a smaller type of chat room where the responses were not coming in too fast for her to catch up as she typed her extensive, digressive thoughts.
When Mama leaves a comment or thought, she typically leaves a lot of thought as possible in them.
Kyle 08:38 PM
Well, marketing is a real science.
Chris (as Sonichu) 08:39 PM
Just to comment on her behalf: Mama’s noggin has a general, basic grasp at marketing, but when that topic is brought up, the associated feeling is “Whoop!
That flew right over my head.”
Naught 08:41 PM
Advertising
Chris (as Sonichu) 08:42 PM
That topic is easier.
Partly because of the number of ads Mama had watched and seen over the years, and the “TV Talk” that can even at times make her able to sell just about anything with gusto.
Kyle 08:43 PM
More than advertising...
Social science I tend to accept because it's not humanities.
If you're going to look at humanity to know it, you've gotta be pretty fucking smart.
Chris (as Sonichu) 08:46 PM
Yep.
Kyle 08:46 PM
Fuck welfare economists, they're all fakers.
Deleted User 08:46 PM
Sup, I'm still in school.
Chris (as Sonichu) 08:46 PM
I’m listening to Silver Quill and Sweetie Bloom on YouTube in their stream right now.
Deleted User 08:46 PM
Hey guys.
Chris (as Sonichu) 08:47 PM
Hey
Kyle 08:47 PM
Generally being smart you can dissect and replace.
Gah, shit, I don't know all that much, just enough to move the world.
Deleted User 08:48 PM

Kyle 08:48 PM
Thinking, thinking...
A lot of sci-fi geometry paradoxically likes empty space.
Naught 08:50 PM
Rock formations
Kyle 08:50 PM
I just have some experience in art appraisal.
I fucking love architecture.
Chris (as Sonichu) 08:52 PM
Speaking of sci-fi, Rosey, Cryzel and I watched “Mr. Nobody” recently.
It was done well enough to explore the number of timelines that branched from that one moment of 7-year old Nemo in February, 1982.
But, to not really end it on the timeline that ended up after he took that middle path between mom and dad, felt like we missed something from that.
