“
Whether or not you've noticed NONE of my original female characters have....breasts. I just don't believe in giving animals that kind of human quality.

SHE DOES HAVE BREASTS. Megan Schroeder DREW THAT WAY.

Megagi La Skunk (pronounced [mɛˈgɑːdʒi], "meh-GAW-jee"[1]) is one of Megan Schroeder's furry-inspired characters, who first appears alongside Megan as her Sailor Fighter "partner" and later begins dating Bionic the Hedgehog. She has outlived her creator's presence in the comic, similar to Jiggliami, except Megan was (probably) not a troll a far greater troll than Blanca.[2]

Creation
An example of Megagi's change in personality.
Megagi was originally called Spunky Skunk;[3] the reason why Chris changed her name is unclear (although most likely due to his obsession with Megagi's creator, who happens to have a similar name). She also did not have breasts in her original drawing[3] or first appearances in the comic,[4] but Chris added them in later for unknown reasons.
Given her name, color scheme and species, she likely constitutes a homage to (or plagiarism of) Tiny Toon Adventures character Fifi La Fume. She may also be based of the Sonic character Fang the Sniper (Nack the Weasel), given her color and design. (The Archie Comics did have a skunk character, Geoffrey St. John, but Megagi has nothing in common with him aside from species.) Funnily enough, her colors are also the same as those used to symbolize bisexual pride.
Megagi used to have a somewhat different personality from the other female characters; she seemed to be the tomboyish type, and Chris described her as being like an "Army Soldier". In Sonichu #6, she calls Chris out on his shit,[5] and she chews him out for ogling Megan when he should be saving the day. Although the rough-and-ready tomboy archetype is not exactly original, it was at least different from the typical Rosechu who just liked shopping. However, in Sonichu #9, she gets watered down just like the rest of them – girly and no personality – and later on in the comic she is further reduced to being Bionic's personal cheerleader.
Fictional biography
Origins
When Megan drew the character, she wrote the words "Parody Island" next to it.[3] This appears to refer to the place where she lives, which was renamed by Chris as "Parodyse Island".[6] Along with three other unnamed individuals, she serves as protector of the island. She's described by Chris as being physically strong. Her scent attack is of lesser power, but is still potent.[7] It should be noted that said scent attack was never seen in the comic itself.
According to her CWCipedia page, she came "from a mysterious land far, far away with her partner Megan Schroeder".[8] However, it should be noted that her CWCipedia biography was not authored by Chris.[9]

THIS IS WHAT CHRIS ACTUALLY BELIEVES.

Turning on her Sailor Fighter partner
In a series of increasingly vitriolic Facebook posts directed at Megan, Chris claims to have talked directly with Megagi, who has some particularly nasty things to say about her original creator. Whilst Chris is known to believe that Sonichu and the other comic characters are real to an extent, it's still somewhat unsettling to see it weaponized to justify threats and slander.
“
By the way, I have checked with Megagi La Skunk; she feels deep distrust in you. We mutually agree that you should have never been born, even if it meant she would never exist.
”
Chris, in an open letter to Megan on Facebook
