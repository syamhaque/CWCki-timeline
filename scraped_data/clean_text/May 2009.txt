================================================================================

On 12 May 2009, the wedding comic is leaked.
On 15 May 2009, the Ivy Saga comes to a close.
On 29 May 2009, Chris shocks the Internet yet again with his naïve narcissism.
May was the fifth month of 2009. As the month began, Chris still held a very strong belief in his relationship with Ivy, spending the first few days uploading several videos specifically dedicated to her. However, things quickly went south, as an attempt from Joshua Martinez to swindle Chris out of his money set off a chain of dominoes that would eventually result in Ivy breaking up with Chris. Because of this disappointment, during the last weeks of May, Chris began resorting to other ways to find a girlfriend. He starts going out in public again, and also posts an ad on Craigslist.
This period is also noted for Chris making a number of appearances in the mainstream media, being discussed on popular sites like Fark and at least three different radio shows, thus making him open for the grand public.
Events of May 2009
Sometime this month (between 4 to 14 May) - Chris's relationship with Ivy ends due to a complicated series of events:
Josh decided to troll Chris once again by conning him out of his money. He sold him a PSP at an inflated price, claiming it had special features, in trade for Chris's old PSP, which he wanted to give to Vanessa Hudgens. Chris wrote him what became a bad check (allegedly, Ivy told him to cancel the check for the PSP, but Chris refused to return it fearing it'd upset Vanessa).[1]
Chris was told by Rocky to inform his parents about this event.[2] Bob, who at this point had been hiding troll information from Barb, felt this was the final straw, and decided troll activity was getting serious enough to warrant police attention. They agreed to go to the police with Rocky Shoemaker to talk to them about Josh. However, Rocky blindsided the trio by asking the police to investigate all of Chris's trolls, including Ivy; this went against Bob and Barb's wishes, who wanted to only deal with Josh and take on the others at their own time and pace.[1]
Ivy, angry over this fiasco, told Chris she was breaking up with him over his betrayal. Chris, unable to accept things were over, repeatedly called Ivy for two days straight, only stopping when she and her dad called Bob to get Chris to quit it.[1]
