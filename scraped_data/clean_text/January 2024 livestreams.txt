Highlights
7:25: Chris refuses to talk about his house burning down, which happened "because... well y'all know."
Also he misses Bob, who is still in C-197 in Sonichu form.
12:57: A ween asks why Chris was on the Jeffrey Epstein list, and Chris responds that it is "beyond [his] conscious knowledge."
24:40: Chris says he has enjoyed "Love on the Spectrum," a Netflix dating show for autistic people.
25:17: The game prompts Chris for his name, and he attempts to enter "Christine" as his first name before realizing there isn't enough space for it.
Instead he settles on "Christ Chan."
Amusingly, this later causes NPCs to address his character as "Chan-kun."
43:35: An NPC leads Chris's character to a cluttered room, offering a place to stay.
Chris derides the room as "a dump," completely missing the irony.
49:20: Chris criticizes a donor who asks him to switch to the English dub, but caves in and changes it, then realizes he lost progress because the game wasn't saved.
52:15: Chris brags about playing God of War in hard mode, and getting the platinum trophies for it.
54:30: A ween asks Chris to pronounce "vinegar" very slowly, but Chris doesn't fall for it, going out of his way to make the last two syllables not sound like the N-word.
56:49: Chris contrasts his in-game character's prison outfit with his own.
1:12:26: Everywhere is for lovers.
1:14:30: Chris has difficulty finding the ringing phone in the game even though it's right fucking there.
1:30:43: When asked if his wives can see the world around him mentions Silvana, Cryzel and after a long pause, Flutter.
1:33:57: One of the NPCs experiences a headache in response to a supernatural event, which Chris interprets as proof that even neurotypicals can be affected by psychic phenomena.
1:37:59: Chris reminds us that he's a fan of Monty Python.
1:50:30: Chris sneezes and blesses himself.
1:52:00: Chris does an impression of Navi from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, somehow managing to sound even more shrill and annoying.
2:09:33: After closing out the game, Chris talks briefly about Phoenotopia Awakening and Raji: An Ancient Epic, two games he picked up at "that weekend... It would have been a nicer weekend if... well, I'm not placing blame but just to say, suffice to say, I'm disappointed in some individuals."

this as a dream you're in the presence of our Master stand up straight welcome I am delighted to make
your acquaintance this place exists between dream and reality mind and matter it is
a room that only those who are bound by a contract may enter I am eigor the
master e he looks like an eigor remember it well I summoned you to speak of matters
it involves your life as well Joker and the
Penguin know your place inmate who do you think you're talking to still this
is a surprise the state of this room reflects the state of your own heart to think a
prison would appear as such you truly are a prisoner of fate in
the near fure future there is no mistake that ruin awaits
you worry not there is a means to oppose such a fate you must be rehabilitated
rehabilitated toward Freedom that is your only means to avoid
ruin do you have the resolve to challenge the Distortion of the
world yeah I do allow me to observe the path
of your Rehabilitation ah pardon me for not
introducing the others to your right is carolene to your left they serve as wens here
nope especially since I was not in the prison I was in the county community jail is to protect inmates we are also
your coll ators that is if you remain obedient I shall explain the roles of
these two another occasion now then it seems the night is
waning it is almost time take your time to slowly come to understand this place
we will surely meet again
eventually there go the alarm clock now hurry up and go back to
the next
day looks like you're
up well then let's go introduce ourselves properly to the staff about your transfer the school you're
attending is in the ayama district it'll take a while to get there by train the transfers are a real hassle
too poke dollars I'll drive you there but just for today although I'm start at
something else from your perspective men aren't usually allowed
in my passenger seat this this guy
talk daytime
do me a favor and behave yourself all
right don't get me wrong I don't care what happens to
you then you got some issues to work to man just don't cause me any
trouble to reiterate just so we're clear you will immediately be expelled if you
cause any problems in my opinion you're nothing but a liability but we had our
circumstances to consider consider might have gotten away with in your homet and if it were for
those Bing kids if you are thrown out from our school there will be no place for you to
go keep that in mind this is the teacher in charge of your
class I'm sadao kawakami here's your student ID
be sure to read the school rules any violations will send you straight to the guidance office and if by chance you cause any
problems I won't be able to protect you at all that is your promise yes principal
kobayakawa Kaya Kawa mhm he is responsible for all his
actions
but really though why me find your focus candidates put on v OB if you want to in
addition to what you have going on right here it was a sudden transfer and your
class was the only one that had an opening if you're done explaining things
mind if we get going I got door to get back to sakuras on please keep a close eye on
him don't let him cause any trouble outside well I'll be sure to have a
serious talk about the situation he's in come to the faculty office when you
arrive at school tomorrow I'll show you to your
classroom everyone's giving you the cold shoulder that's what having a criminal record
does to you turns out your past follows you wherever you
go by the way if you get expelled now I won't hesitate to kick you out got
[Music]
it school never this guy reminds me of jet just in the face look not so much
the attitude though come on we're going
home what a Troublesome situation The Fad teacher I can't believe they push
someone with a record on me a male teacher would be better suited for this why in the world was someone like
that admitted here who knows it was the principal's decision I was told that it's for the
the school's reputation I would have thought that my volleyball team has contributed more
than enough to cover that that's certainly true be careful decent story though then
again if anything were to happen I'd kick out a student like that right
away I keep wishing that he'd just end up still that isn't something I should be saying as a
teacher well I should be returning to practice yeah go at your
football all right the tournament's coming up isn't
it oh not yet but I'll find it soon
enough what was that guy's name again maybe not with you but it's a
possibility I may play that game but yeah thank you for the a fan
art I'll just be I will be sure to look for that on Twitter
later fan art having such high expectations placed on You by others is
quite a problem in
itself we'll have to work hard to make up for the track team
too yes that's
true why did it have to be my
class traffic's not moving at
all you're taking the train starting
tomorrow so how was it the school I mean you think you can manage I'll check that
later you brought it on yourself
though still you were expelled once already to think you'd reenroll at a
different one it's not like anyone will be sympathetic with you they say I show a little empathy if
that's what it was like at school people might say stuff about me in the future too what a Troublesome kid I've taken in
they're caught in the traffic jam
I was asked to do it and I just happened to agree to it emotionally distant I've
already been paid for it too after all and now back to today's top stories
topway train has derailed severely affecting acoss all
of another accident another so that's why it's so crowded
there's been a lot of those lately in fact there was a real sad one just last month it happened before you
came here if I remember right the girl that passed away was only 15 why okay her
parents have got to be just all traffic around shabuya station
is being redirected due to the accident so drivers should expect jam-packed
streets come bumper bump the bumper the bumper the bumper the bumper the
bumper I've heard Turkey Tom it's a possibility but that's to be confirmed may I can't we're bu the prop
traffic later the will atat number one
please wait behind
woo hey what's going [Music] on
well I'd say he's been
possessed oh no ler
[Music] l
well the train has stopped AC ACC to the police the
engineer's life was not iner desp his injuries aftering even he could not
expain his high speed he was possessed no further comments were made police are
still looking for a plausible motive it's less of an operating accident and more of a crime of the company and the
government site inspectors apparently reported all of this six months ago the deterioration of the tracks and the ATC
seems a railway company in the Ministry of Transport both turned a blind eye to the truth no way they can hide this will go
all the way to the top now on to our main story the main story derailment
accident as well as other recent incidents of unknown motive concern is spreading among the general just what
could be causing such a drastic change so suddenly in these people it's got be strange twist the F that's what you're
thinking correct oh well are you free you and I
haven't gone for a drink in a while thank you sir but I have another meeting to
attend to
did you ask for me is it a case not quite I want your opinion on
something sure your judgment is quite often correct though can we discuss this
over Sushi perhaps you are making a student work late after all conveyor
about only

of Basics this the most basic of jokes knock knock you're the most basic of
jokes that's right as I thought you're natural
at this it leads all the way outside yep then we just got to get that metallic mesh off and a one and
a well oh oh crap the enemy didn't hear us did
they seriously we're finally getting out here not half hard you should wait on
celebrating until you actually get out now get going but what about
you there's something that I still have to do we're going our separate
ways you better be careful too see you yep all right bye
cat those two seem useful especially the frizzy-haired one if my judgment's
right
oh they made it through did we make it looks like you
did you have returned to the real world welcome back huh returned does that mean
we got away I don't know what to think
anymore what was all that anyways that castle and and kamosa and that weird cat
yeah what you said earlier hell's going on what's with the yelling are you students of shujin cutting classes are
we huh no we were trying to get to school and we ended up at this weird
Castle what hand over your bag you better not be doing any
drugs why would you think that are you his
friend something like that then you should go to school take him with you y
like I'm trying to say I don't know what's going on either we passed by shuj on our way here there was nothing out of
the ordinary about it if you spout any more nonsense I'll contact your school
is that what you want these J cops couldn't come on say
something uh that's not what I
meant wait a sec is that guy for real let's just move forward fine I'm
going the minister of Transport announcing his
resignation things are going as planned huh he's got some SCH going up that
reminds me S
Now launch time is this for
real I'm sure we came the same way what's going on here that's exactly what
I wanted to ask you we received a call from the police the damn cop snitched on us after
all H it's rare not to to see you alone where were you roaming around until this
time uh a Lal Castle so you have no intention of giving an honest answer
what's this about a castle this guy again you seem so
Carefree Sak quite a difference from when you did morning practice for the track
team shut up it's your fault that how dare you speak that way to Mr kashida
there's not much leeway left for you you know he's the one that provoked me do
you really want to be expelled in any case you'll have to explain yourself follow
me what this is [ __ ] come now I should have been more considerate too let's just say that
we were both to blame well if you say so still you're coming with me it's
undeniable that you're extremely late
F by the way you're that new transfer student
correct
y have we met somewhere um actually oh
wait I'll give him that one that's right I remember now well
I'll overlook this just for today I'm sure you've heard from the principal but cause any trouble and
you'll be expelled understand
yeah at any rate hurry up and go to the faculty office I'm sure miss kawakami is
tired of waiting tired of waiting good luck trying to enjoy your
new school life uh this guy this guy I don't like his
Vibes and the days roll on and the days roll on and the days roll on and the
days roll on the days roll on yeah the school turned into an old
castle a talking cat are you hallucinating from an overdose I won't
put up with you if you're simply joking around I'm going to have you continue
the story the one who received a calling card from the Phantom the was an Olympic
medalist an alumnist from Shuan Academy oh yeah teacher suu
kamoshida it all came out in his confession he was guilty of everything abuse I was right violations but there
should have been no connection between the two of you since you had just transferred why did you target
him that's unacceptable try and recall it once again all right well safe Point
coming
up that's something with that
story you I'll just add this I feel like that's okay for
now fire okay well I got that question after it comes up let everybody read that at
the same time but yeah that'll do for
now [Music]
yep oh I got these two recently on recommend on well this one was a recommendation but then I intuitively
picked this one that's a good little sides scrolling type of game and then this one it's very it's uh like God of War
but it's based in uh I forget the language like why like keep the words of
the day I think of it
anyway I feel like it's it's a decent game from this from the start at
least but yeah at least I have those now little souvenir for that weekend it
would have been a nicer weekend if well I'm not placing B but just to
say suffice to say I'm disappointed it in some individuals especially those
that just don't accept future present tense so don't want to accept what is
fat right now ah yeah I think I got this from a goodwi at some point a long time
ago unfortunately as long as I'm able to tell I make sure I observed at least all
the super chats I don't see any more popping up but for now I think this will do all yall have a lovely safe night and
there's your popular request next time when might do another popular request or
