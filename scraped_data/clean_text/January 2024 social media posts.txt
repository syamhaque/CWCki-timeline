CosmicKeyframe's poll
11 January
CosmicKeyframe on blocking Chris
CosmicKeyframe tweeted a poll asking about which pin design to make. A follower replied asking for Misty, a character from the G5 series of My Little Pony. Chris then entered the conversation to angrily complain about the Misty pick, claiming that G5 doesn't exist. CosmicKeyframe then blocked Chris over his tweet.[1]
CosmicKeyframe Productions
Question to all: What should be the next MLP pin I put into production?
Im putting the cheesepie pin into production already, but which one of these designs should be next (obviously they wouldnt have this level of shading, theyre pins)
poll below!
Baja ⭐
I would probably like to see Misty's main mane now since it's revealed :)
Chris
Absolutely Not!
Go with Muffins.
G5 does not exist, and such products that promote them at all should be shelved completely.

Complaining about Twitter blocks
13 January
Well, Key, and everyone else who have blocked me on Twitter, among which, all of you were some of my favourite fellow artists, analysts, humorous, vastly intelligent and insightful individuals, and all of you also heavily spiritually, energetically, and aura resonated with me as those of whom I could relate with.
I could go further into detail, but not on a public Tweet.
But at least a number of all you understand.
I mean, in empathy and in role-reversal, if I was receiving heavy traffic due to a comment from you, and due to your various respective followers, you all know what I would have done.
***I would have simply ignored them.
I don’t have my notifications on for commentary.
And, Key, remember your “YouHate” panel from BronyCon 2019?
Well, I learned from that and let the attention be the blessing, regardless of the mixed reception.
And I will add, as a close friend of mine have told me, that I feel all of you in the Brony, Artist and Entertainment communities can understand and appreciate,…
Yeah, no one understands you are innocent and that you released because of innocence. Also understand that many people have dragged your reputation, so people are afraid to get involved with you, because they don't want people following them and doxxing them. And with the current socio-political bullshit happening, any prominent figures in media could get cancelled for it.
It isn't fair, but realize it isn't because of you. Society did this. You're wonderful.
They are right, and all of you, my fellow artists, chroniclers, Bronies, Pegasisters, and so on who are relatively famous, all of you should not let this Minority of the World who are the Toxic and Darkest-Sinning individuals wreck your mental and emotional health, and that goes heavily the same for the Socio-Political details and Society in general.
I appreciate and respect all of you as individuals and fellow creative types.
And I will close with this: Do not block me on Twitter because of my mixed Followers, just Ignore that peanut gallery and let the Cosmos, Universe and us Deities and Deity-Level individuals see Karma and Justice done upon them as shall be and just.
Thank you.
⚡️💙⚡️

The message from a "close friend" is incredibly similar to the description of Setting the Record straight - there never was any sex involving me in 2021, it is likely that the description of the video was based on the message. The message has highlighted portions, here is a guide to Chris's highlights from June 2021.[2]

Ai Fairouz voiced Arcee again in the Japanese dub of the most recent episode of Earthspark.
She previously voiced her in ROTB's Japanese dub.

I am still really flabbergasted that they made Arcee take a Classic Car alt mode that doesn’t suit her normally.
Botched YouTube link

Chris attempted to link to the YouTube video Focused, Divine Guidances - 01142024 but instead linked to his YouTube Creator Studio's URL of the link, which leads to an error page.

Kyle Satwon
Hey Chris, I was actually meaning to ask this but: Why did you put Jesus in your name? If you were Jesus, wouldn't you know that you coming back would be a sign of the rapture?
Chris
Only to those that are being left behind in the shift where they leave this timeline and end up in an alternate time that does have the apocalyptic outcome.
Otherwise, for the majority that are good, light powered, righteous and neutral and neutral bad open for guidance. ⚡️💙⚡️

Block ranting
17 January
Ren Ryghts ⚡️💙⚡️
That’s it. I’m calling out @Dimonddogdawg . They are stalking my posts with a fake screenshot someone made of me saying I’m a troll. I know they’re doing this just so Christine will block me again. I’m not dealing with this. Please get a life and leave me AND Christine alone. ⚡️💙⚡️
Chris
Hear, hear.
As long as I have tolerated and put up with the downsides of being famous with the Toxic, Darkest Sinning minority of the world stalking me and all.
Enough is enough.
Mark and heed my words, if you do not cease this unrequited hatred, you will be dealt harsh karma.
Show some compassion and empathy; what if you were the ones being stalked wherever you went extensively, needlessly tormented, and your name ruined in social circles and closest friends and family?
What if everyone blocked YOU because of rumors and false witnesses upon you?
What Can you do from behind your computer screens and limited spaces and abilities?
Nothing, and that would bother you to darkness and back.
I’ve been literally everywhere, every when, every how all at once.
Now is the time for this unrequited, needless drama that is long outdated to cease and desist.
And I am seeing to that personally and metaphysically.
Nobody else and I will have to suffer that kind of torture anymore, and those who instigated will be given one last chance to follow the Light Power, Good and Righteous Path and redeem themselves.
I can only help those who are open-minded and open-hearted for that Divine Plan guidance.
⚡️💙⚡️
Unknown blocker, part 2

A repeat of as the crowds stormed upon me as I carried that cross over two millennia ago.
It is not right to curse my or anyone’s name, and it is also wrong to disturb one’s #LoveAndPeace with the needless drama spawned from darkness and demons from any doubt and lack of faith from rumors and misconceptions of I or anyone.
That bunch of #RumorHasIts is to be ceased now.
Leave I and everyone else at peace.
As for the cited individual, I did consciously forget her name, but it was clear that their balance was disturbed regardless of the prank comments that I never made at all, and they shall never be made again by anyone.
My apologies to them for the stress from the drama.
I, as well, am very tired of the drama from the Toxic, Evil Darkest Sinners and those misguided by those very toxic ones who need to cease and follow that which is Light Powered, Good and Righteous.

I have said that and made that very clear and direct.
That was a ploy of Isabella Janke.
Norm DePlume
Yeah, but why did you admit to doing it and brag about it?

MLP G5 FAQ
21 January
Okay, everyone, I will answer the FAQ as brief and direct as possible with mentions, and This will Absolutely be the ONLY post I make Anywhere online mentioning MLP G5 with images, so pay attention.
I foretold #MLPG5 was not only going to be awful, but I also foreknew it was to be the Trigger of WWIII, as well as a major decline for @Hasbro
.
They Still have the chance to redeem themselves on undoing G5 and resuming #MLPG4 (to Season 14, Episode 26) and #EquestriaGirls.
#MLPG5’s premature existence prior to #MLPG4Season14Episode26 on Animated Media on TV and Streaming Services is a major damage to this Timeline.
Had G4 and Equestria Girls continued on, and without #PonyLife at all, WWIII would never have happened, and a whole number of other bad thinga, in general.
MLPG5, as is, is a disguise over worse things and reckless greed in the Board Rooms and Executives; Epic No Good.
Even the #BronyAnalysts all agree how awful, misguided and maligned G5 was.
And with that only emphasized and further proved my point.
My deal with G5 has absolutely nothing to do with the art style or quality; my deal was and is that (This) #MLPG5 just Does Not Exist nor Belong at all in this Timeline and Universe.
And it is better to just not only Ignore it and Boycott #MLPG5, but also Not to have ANY media from any artists or chroniclers, in and outside of @Hasbro online.
Also, the MLP Live Stream Episodes on #MLPOfficial on YouTube, please fix the thumbnail on your recent Equestria Girls live streams; you’ve been using the wrong one on those for days now.
And I still continue to not watch, read nor acknowledge Anything #MLPG5 in positivity until only After My Little Pony - Friendship Is Magic, Season 14, Episode 26 is aired on TV and Streaming Services with All of the canon and continuity-level episodes, specials, and even a movie that is not “A New Generation” within all of that preceding it on TV and Streaming Media in Animated Glory with the original cast, staff and Animation Programs used originally, period.
I do not care if you consider this a “TLDR” statement, but it is Divine and Metaphysical Fact, period.
So, Heed My Words.

Advice on Barb cosplaying
21 January
Levon
@CPU_CWCSonichu what are your thoughts on people who do cosplays of you?
Chris
That’s cool, but don’t cosplay as Barbara, unless you cosplay her as she was: a valuable financial employee in a business suit and in her 40s.
Don’t cosplay as her being old.
That’s rude to all elderly individuals in general.
MLP G5 anti-view proof
22 January
[Continued from an earlier tweet chain]
Chris
To personally demonstrate that I have never ever watched, read or even learned anything of #MLPG5, here is a synopsis from my consciousness without accessing anything online or in the Cosmos or Akashic Records:
The white Pegasus, Zip, was it?
I peg that one for being a wild one who gets in too much trouble to boot.
The orange one, was that one a unicorn at all?
She’s essentially a mental blank slate, period.
The blue unicorn, does she really like tennis?
Fizzy looks to be a spaz with no credibility.
Why is there a dude among them?
He looks like he gets caught doing something wrong a lot.
I really do not know any other names than Pipp amongst them.
They follow a new princess with no precipice behind her at all.
And the show is just awful as fuck, popularly verified by my fellow Bronies on YouTube, and I base that only on their video titles without watching them at all.

Chris lies that the older girlfriend he had described to Null in July 2021 was Fiona, despite that Chris's claims to Null involve the older girlfriend being over 50, and Fiona having been 19 at the time.
[Continued from an earlier tweet chain]
Nyquil Cigarettes.
Then why did you buy a book on how to have sex with disabled people? And who was the older girlfriend you were bragging to Null about?
Chris
That girlfriend was Fiona, at least in wishful thinking at the time.
Chris
And for the other question, why wouldn’t I when the world is all mentally disabled in one way or another, even the neurotypicals.

The title of the first episode of that shit was “Roughing It Up”.
I have not engaged with Anything #MLPG5 whatsoever.

How do you think explaining things from the show showcases a lack of engagement with it? Listing things about the show does nothing but imply you’ve engaged with it
Chris
Clearly, I gave wrong information about it, because I clearly hardly know anything about it, specifically.

Sure, I’d go to a convention free as a bird if nobody had intentions of seeking photos with me for online bolstering or worse.
Also, it is just plain wrong to false witness someone while they are attending a convention and they have not done anything wrong, period.
How would you feel if you were at a convention, and suddenly someone tells lies and rumors to the organizer, and booted you out?
It is not cool to do that to Anyone just for kicks or whatever.

Sympathizing with blockee

Brass Scribe @ Not Texas
Am I Horse Famous yet mom? I'm a part of the Retro_Horse blocked club too.
[posts a screenshot of being blocked by Retro_Horse]
Chris
Blocked by anyone is not a good club to be in at all, especially if it is you they have blocked when it was others who have bothered them that they should have blocked instead of you.
And that guy Definitely has bad issues to the point his aura is nearly dark.
So, yeah, you’re better off not having him to deal with.
Donatello Sonichu

Chris
The debut of Donatello Sonichu in colour, with his mother and father, of course.

Carrie Krueger
@CPU_CWCSonichu Donatello Sonichu implies the existence of Raphael Sonichu, Michelangelo Sonichu, and Leonardo Sonichu.
Chris
No.
There is no Raphael Sonichu, Michelangelo Sonichu nor Leonardo Sonichu.
Bubbles and Blake only have one child.
Contest addendum
31 January
[Continued from an earlier tweet chain]
Aso, I feel need to add to the Contest: In addition to the Sonichu and Rosechu and Sonic fandom artists, we Are looking for artists from the #MyLittlePonyG4 Brony community, as well as the #Transformers artists.
Hence why the theme is mainly mainstream and diverse.
For the art must suffice very well.

Because, after all, in Cwcville and all around the Earth and Universe, it is more than just the Electric-Hedgehog Pokémon, you know.
