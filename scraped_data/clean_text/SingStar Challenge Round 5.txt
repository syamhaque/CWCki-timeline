Can I smell yo duck?
”
Ian sings the final song, requested by CChanSonichuCWC, "Smell Yo Dick", but changes the word "dick" to "duck" in each instance, therefore disqualifying him. However, in the information section of the video, Ian claims to be sorry for all that he has done to the real Chris and Kacey, and says that they are both his close friends. In both of the "Smell Yo Dick" videos, Ian manages to pronounce roughly 10% of the lyrics, with the other 90% being incoherent babbling, implying that Ian made virtually no effort to learn the song before singing it.
Transcript
Hello, Chris. Well, I have been uh, mistaken, I have been in error, and I humbly apologize from the bottom of my heart. I did you wrong, I did Kacey wrong. But still, she had to know. That why I communicated in the first place. But she still cares about you, man. At least 'n that's you, you real lucky guy to er, get that. Even after lying to her like that for all of the time. But still, dude. My humblest apologies. Let's just hope we can put this behind us and please dude, please. Stop pretending to be me. It ain't worth it! It's not fun! You're gonna get yourself in jail, man! Identity theft is a serious crime! 'Specially after what you, the hefty bill you put up. Counterfeited my driver's license, with your picture on it. Counterfeited my high school diploma. Counterfeited my Piedmont degree. You've really got yourself up a big bill man. I hate to see uhh-d, I um, I mean, I will personally seen it, but I was talkin' to Kacey, she cares about you very much man. I just hate to break up the relationship between you and her. Especially one so HONEST, so TRUE. She loves you, man. I wuhh... things to make me feel bad. If you have to, if you end up going to jail after all this. So please dude, come clean. Yes, your name is Chris Chandler. That's it. No "-tian", No "Christopher", No "Ricardo". No "Weston". That's you man. So please man. Take off that paper medallion. Stop sellin' the fake merchandise, come clean, please. Come clean and I'll be right. Between you, between me, between Kacey. The whole world. Anyway I'll leave that up to you, as you sing "Lift Up Your Eyes" as I sing this track. Alright.
[Chris dons a brown longsleeve shirt, and his orange Parappa the Rappa beanie. He wears a pair of sunglasses directly above his regular glasses.]
Alright. Let's do this thing. Smell yo duck. From Riskay.
["Smell Yo Dick" from Riskay begins playing. Chris mimes listening to a phone call during the song's intro, then sings along, badly. He replaces the word "dick" with "duck", violating the rules he thought up for his own contest.]
[Chris takes off his prescription glasses, and the eyeglasses fall in front of his eyes. He pushes them back up, and again they fall down. He repeats the process two other times before they stay.]
The cards are on the table. You hold your hand. It's your move. Whatcha gonna do? Stop the charade, live freely, happily, or continue on and might end up in jail. Whatever you do, think about it while you sing "Lift Up Your Eyes" man. *sigh* Chris, you ok. You got your guitar playin'. You got more languages than I took. But still man, you need to quit pretendin'. With somebody you're not. [sings, awkwardly] God loves you by, your own name. Don't go makin' it look like someone else's. Especially with ID. Fake duhplomer and all that. Whatchyou gonna do, she gonna smell yo DUCK. Go ahead. Sing.

next THE Christian Weston Chandler's FINAL SingStar #5 Song. Lift Up Your Eyes, The Planetshakers
After being caught by the real Chris replacing every instance of the word "dick" with "duck", Chris is given four hours to sing the song TRUTHfully or face disqualification. Chris obliges, takes down the original and replaces it with a new version, then uploads the original just so the other can see his original message
Transcript
Well, I told you not to, and you did! And now you-you ad-libbed, you changed the so--and you are disqualified. No, wait, I take that back; I will rescind your disqualification, if within the next 4 hours, you record the true and original version of the song, no. changes. Hmm...or else, I won't even have to sing your song, because I will be the winner by default. And I will be crowned the TRUE and HONEST Christian Weston Chandler. Peace.
And, you didn't even do the introduction to the song, and do you know how many words you missed?! You were not, you were-you will sing-you are, you are supposed to sing all the words, and you're supposed to have it memorized, or else, that's-that's what the contest-this is about, the lyrics. Hmm, so you will do it right! Peace.

Transcript
Alright, Chris, we'll do this another time. But remember the nice words that I had said to you earlier, and I meant it from my heart. Remember...those words...I said to you. Can't say I didn't warn ya, Can't say I wasn't nice. But, I'm warnin' ya, dude, be goo- try- do the right thing. Okay, DJ Quest, do it!
[holds his phone to his ear in silence through the intro, like before]
[sings "Smell Yo Dick" (very badly)]
[throughout the song, Chris gets more and more uncomfortable each time he has to say "dick"]
[at 3:32 he seems to gag or lose his breath]
[at 3:47 he makes another gagging noise]
That's what you GET! I did the word. I SAID the word. Now lay off! Remember my words, I'll re-upload that video, so you can hear those words again, and again, and again...aside from the song. Fort-unfortunately I deleted it from my "EyeCreate" program, so I can't edit it. Now sing "Eye- now sing "Lift Up Your Eyes", and THINK about it. Go ahead, Chris.

Well, here it is Ian, last song of the competition. I'm almost sad is over. Then I remember how much of my identity you stole from me. Mmm. And I'll never get it back. Alright-well I already have it back. But, uh...you'll never take it.
[CChan sings Lift Up Your Eyes by The Planetshakers, in a very Ian Brandon Anderson-like way]
[At 2:08 he comments mid-song, "Tryin' to steal my girlfriend?" which is likely part of the reason Ian wants to disqualify it.]

previous THE Christian Weston Chandler's FINAL SingStar #5 Song. Lift Up Your Eyes, The Planetshakers
next Ian, Talking Time is Over. The REAL Christian Weston Chandler is SICK of Your Lies. Come CLEAN.
This version was made after allegations made by Ian Brandon Anderson about differences between the video and song lengths in the previous video. The Real Chris ended his version about 3 to 4 minutes into the 10-minute song, as despite having an instrumental build-up the song just repeats the same bars over and over again. Nevertheless, he obliged, sang the complete song and noted the length of it.
Transcript
Hello Ian, [sighs] I said I'll sing-I'll sing your whole song but it's just the same thing over and over and over again you know? I mean, I don't see what's the point. You got some kind of secrets plan to troll me again? You know you troll me so much.
[Chris sings, again in a very monotonous sound. Occasionally, after singing "And the Lord God almighty" he adds "and Jesus and the Mall Conductor Bear".]
[At the end, he yells "Holy, Holy, Holy" in a manner similar to the infamous JULAAAY cries]
Mmm, yeah that was a pretty long song. Mmm, I agree.
