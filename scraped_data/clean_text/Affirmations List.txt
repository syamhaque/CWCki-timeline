“

Chris
On 12 March 2021, Chris wrote out a list of positive affirmations about himself as part of a self-love project. He posted the three-page-long list to the Watchmen server The Place. The list is a thoroughly delusional assessment of his character traits and abilities.
The project also involved him writing out a list of self-criticisms and blockages. Chris never posted the list and stated that he would burn it, but claimed that it was two pages long- a surprising length considering that the affirmations list absolved him of just about every fault imaginable.

Explanation
Chris posted these excerpts to The Place explaining the project.
I will be writing out a list of my past and lingering self-criticisms and judgments, as well as a counter-list of affirmations to better motivate and remind my body and brain that it is safe to utilize its powers and abilities.
Anyway, so @everyone knows my plan in this self-love project: I start off by going from past to present of my concerning faults and listing each one as I come across them. In recent meditations and self-explorations, I have found a number of good and crucial ones to add onto the list.
After I complete the writing of that list, (edited)
I will, on another sheet, write a list of my positives and any other affirmations. I will also be reading down the first list, and for about each concern, I address that with an appropriate counter-positive or counter-affirmation that I will write on the second list.
And after making positive I have addressed all of my concerns, self-criticisms, judgments and blockages,
I will burn that one list in a metal trash can, sending it off into nothingness.
BUT
For the sake of the majority, I will confide a photograph of the blockages list to a few highly-trustworthy individuals, so in turn, they will know that they have all been addressed, that they were the deeper concerns of my past that the majority of individuals in this universe do not fully comprehend, because they pretty much only have been scratching the surface of me, and optionally, of their discretion, share with others, publicly in terms that they can better understand. (edited)
Six hours later, Chris posted about his progress and shared the affirmations list.
Just finished my affirmations list, after going through the self-criticisms list; I will likely add more to the affirmations list. As I have foreseen, the positives outweigh the blockages.
The blockages took up two pages, affirmations Three.
I'm keeping and expanding on the affirmations list. And I am going to burn the self-criticisms list in a metal trash can, sending them into nothingness.
