================================================================================

Lynchburg (pop. 79,009 in 2020) is an independent city in the Commonwealth of Virginia. It lies at the center of the Lynchburg metropolitan area, which includes Lynchburg and four neighboring counties. Chris has frequently been spotted in the Lynchburg area beginning on 20 July 2023, seventeen days after the last time he was seen in Chesterfield County.
Big Island (pop. 300) is a census-designed place 18 miles (29 km) northwest of Lynchburg, in nearby Bedford County. In June 2023, Caden Peck purchased a house in Big Island. In August 2023, a business partner of Caden[1] registered an LLC there called Realty Plus LLC.[2] Currently the house is co-owned by Essential Estate LLC, Realty Plus LLC, and Caden Peck.[3] Chris's car has been spotted at the house, and Chris was since shown to be living there.

Lynchburg
Chris has been spotted in public in Lynchburg multiple times, beginning in July 2023 and often in the company of Flutter. In Setting the Record straight - there never was any sex involving me in 2021, Chris says that he first met Flutter in Lynchburg.
P.O. Box
In November 2023, Chris provided a P.O. box address for fans to send fanart and gifts to, listing it as:
P.O. Box 3037
Lynchburg, VA 24503
United States.[4]
In November 2024, Chris stated that the P.O. Box was "closed due to a miscommunication" and directed fans to send stuff to 14 Branchland Court, his former address, instead.[5]

House

On 26 June 2023, a 5-bedroom, 4-bath property in Big Island was transferred to Caden Peck and Essential Estate LLC for $235,000.[6][7] It is located about a two-hour drive from Ruckersville. The notice of sale was publicly posted in an online newsletter;[6] months later, after Chris advertised his P.O. Box with an address in Lynchburg,[4] Kiwi Farms users connected the dots and doxed the house. A Google Street view of the house dated October 2023 depicted Chris's Chevrolet Aveo parked in front, covered with a tarp (but leaving a wheel visible which matches confirmed photos of the car).[8]
The house has security cameras in place. In May 2024, after a stalker, TwistedFreak, pulled up to take photos of him in front of the house, Chris tweeted photos of the security monitor showing images of the stalker's car, and warned that, while he would not be releasing the license plates, he could report to law enforcement if the stalking did not stop.[9]
Chris has made several photos showing off his place and is recording his YouTube videos and livestreams there (with a digital background effect hiding most background objects). A door seen in Medallion Moulding Q&A and windows seen in a photo Chris posted to Twitter[10] matches room photos in a real estate listing for the house.[11][12][13]
Chris seems to be paying rent for living on the property. In a January 2024 interview, Chris mentioned that he was renting the place he's in.[14] Knowing his notoriously poor money management skills, only time will tell if Chris will continue to responsibly pay for his living space.
Visits
On 27 November 2023, Discord user Ike drove to the house and took photos, posting to the Official CWCki Server.[15] In these photos the car is not covered with a tarp, but the front and rear license plates are both covered.
On 19 May 2024, Reddit user Conscious_Box_ drove to the house and took photos. In these photos the car is not covered with a tarp, and
the front and rear license plates are not covered.[16]
On 22 May 2024, Kiwi Farms user TwistedFreak drove past the house, recorded a video, and took a picture.[17]
I haven't kept up with Chris much since the whole Barb situation. I knew he was out of jail but didn't know much else.
Drove through Big Island today to go fishing. Saw the Sonichu license plate on my way there and coming back around. I was able to snap a pic on the way back.
I'd imagine Chris frequents the gas station nearby, as there's not much else around the area.

On 29 May 2024, TwistedFreak made another visit and took two photos of Chris's car, this time with Chris himself in front of the house.[18]
Good afternoon Kiwis.
I present to you Day 2 of #Crishing - a Twisted Freak Production.
I come bearing answers to two long debated questions:
1.Does Chris read Kiwi Farms?
2.Does bullying work?
After less than a week of being publicly shamed on KF for his antisocial parking behavior, Christopher has changed his ways. See pic:
That was from this morning. On my second trip of the day #Crishing on [House address], I spotted a wild Christopher outside of his paper mill goon mansion:
So much for that airport fit, back to dressing like a 5 year old girl apparently.
After snapping that pic, I flipped a U-Turn and went to H&H Mart. After laying down a doozer in the bathroom, I saw Christopher getting gas at the gas station. I didn't notice him until I was already in my car. Rather than startle him with a camera in his face, I managed to snap a picture of him leaving:
On 28 October 2024, Reddit user RedditHaterBoy13 posted a picture of Chris's car in front of the house:[19]
Was headed to the blue ridge parkway though big island and saw the mighty chariot parked on the side of the road
I drove through the area a couple months ago and saw the car but didn’t find out until recently that he lived there

Bedford
Bedford (pop. 6,657) is an incorporated town in Bedford County, 19 miles (31 km) southwest of Big Island. Chris was spotted shopping at a Walmart in Bedford on 16 September 2023 and was spotted again at an undisclosed parking lot in Bedford on 19 September.
Visiting Chris
Just like with his previous address, visiting the Big Island house is highly discouraged. Regardless of what Chris has done, he still shouldn't have to contend with his trolls at his own house. It must be reiterated that harassing Chris at his own house is not only the paragon of ween behavior, it is also a criminal offense. Not only will this probably result in you getting arrested, but Chris is now using security cameras and can catch and easily report you if you're caught stalking his property. Again, we shouldn't have to be saying it at this point, but do not visit Big Island to troll Chris.
The only exception to this is if Chris personally invites you over to his house, but the chances of this happening now are extremely slim.
