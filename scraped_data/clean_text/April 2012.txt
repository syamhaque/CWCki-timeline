Chris in April 2012.
Chris thinks he's losing weight.
April was the fourth month of 2012. The fallout from the 28 October 2011 incident continued, as well as some activity from Chris' Facebook page. This month is particularly notable for it seeing Chris finally lose his virginity, to a woman "from the backpage". However, this largely failed to lift him out of the funk he was in at the time; it seems that finally getting some china did not solve Chris's deep-seated problems like he expected it to.
