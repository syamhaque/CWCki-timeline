Yep!
And right after this page is a past-drawn artwork, followed by the six pages with the song, "Love Is Love (Not You've Been Pwned)", the two Thank You Pages to all my Patreon Pledges and other supporters (Only Offline in the book), and then the poetic letter to myself with the drawing I made for Remembering Pulse, 2017, a few months ago.
Make Your Pledge Now to get a copy of Sonichu #12 for your collection, as the Book Of The Month for November, 2017 for Everyone.
Thank you all again for your support and continuing support.
Stay Tuned next week for the first number of pages for Sonichu 12-9 SPECIAL: Miss Night Star!

Sonichu #15 Cover!
17 October
This Goodness Will Be Here after the next Two Books, as Sonichu, Rosechu and I will Renew Our Love and Dedication to the Book Series, with perhaps a "rehashing", but Not So!
It will be a Retelling of the Classic First Three Episodes, BUT with More Details; More Commentary and Dialogue from Sonichu and Rosechu as the events took place since when Super Sonic fatefully collided with the Pikachu, and with the Chaos Energies, the prime Sonichu and Rosechu came to be.
It's the Full Sonichu and the Full Rosechu Stories; it's also a Love Story, "so, baby, just say yes".
You All will NOT be Disappointed!

*She Just shared her transformation with me!
Awesome!*
Delay, needed some me-time
31 October
Update on new pages
I sincerely apologize for the delay, but I have six new pages drawn up.
I’ve been having some me-time, due to some mental quandaries; nothing too bad or worrisome.
I am colouring these pages, and will have them uploaded soon, as well as Sonichu #5 on Tapas on the same day, of course.
Thank you for your patience.
Happy Halloween.
