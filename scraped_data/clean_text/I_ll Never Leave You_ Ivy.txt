================================================================================

"I'll Never Leave You, Ivy" is the fifth song off of Christian and the Hedgehog Boys COMEBACK!. It is Chris's version of "Wuthering Heights" by Kate Bush. Said song is notoriously difficult to sing thanks to Kate's high-pitched and fluctuating vocal style (which you can naturally hear in the background while Chris drones away in his signature monotone), so it shouldn't be a surprise to anybody that Chris is unable to retain the spirit of the original song.
Ironically, the title "I'll Never Leave You, Ivy" turned out to be correct, because Ivy dumped Chris before he had a chance to leave her.

Lyrics
[sung over Kate Bush's "Wuthering Heights"]
Out on our winding, front lawn
We'd stroll and grace our green
You have a great flare like my emotions
Heart felt, so happy.
Please never leave me
When I would've felt unwound and lost
I cared for you, I loved you, too.
Bad dreams in the night
You told me not to give up the fight
Leave behind my autistic, autistic, autistic shell...
Ivy, it's me, I’m Christian, I've come home and I'll never leave you in any way
Ivy, it's me, I’m Christian, I've come home and I'll never leave you in any way
Ooh, it gets dark! It gets lonely,
While you are not by my side
I pine a lot. I find the lot
Falls through without you.
I am still here, love
Sweetest Ivy, my one dream
My heartsweet
Too long I roamed in the night, before I found your sweet voice
I'll leave my past,
We remain here at Ruckersville, Ruckersville, Ruckersville Home
Ivy, it's me, I’m Christian, I've come home and I'll never leave you in any way
Ivy, it's me, I’m Christian, I've come home and I'll never leave you in any way
Ooh! Let me have it.
Let me grab your soul away.
Ooh! Let me have it.
Let me grab your soul away.
You know it's me--Christian!
Ivy, it's me, I’m Christian, I've come home and I'll never leave you in any way
Ivy, it's me, I’m Christian, I've come home and I'll never leave you in any way
Ivy, it's me, I’m Christian, I've come home and I'll never leave you in any way
[At this point, Chris begins singing at a volume barely audible over the song.]
Ivy, Ivy, Ivy
Ivy, Ivy, Ivy
I love you, Ivy
My sweetest Ivy, I love you, I'll never leave you in any way
Oh Ivy, I love you, sweetest Ivy, and I'll never leave you in any way
