The Tomgirl Pictures are a series of pictures taken by Chris that were leaked by Surfshack Tito on 28 April 2011. These are most notable for highlighting Chris at the beginning of his eventual gender transition.
According to Tito, the cross-dressing was apparently Chris's reaction to someone advising him to get in touch with his feminine side. Emily gave a somewhat different explanation, stating that what kicked it off was someone suggested to Chris to be a tomgirl since being a guy was too hard.[1] Both explanations fit with signs of late-onset gender dysphoria.

Tito's Introduction
Chris decided that being a man was too much work. It often involves stressful activities such as getting a job, excercising,
and supporting a family. The role of the man was too stressful for the life of Christian Weston Chandler.
He decided he would take the route that was easier for him. The path that he was so familiar with in Highschool.
The manchild felt that he could identify being a lady seeing that he has had vast experience of hanging out with girls
in the cafeteria. Chris decided that being in touch with the femine side would be the truth key in his quest.
But wait! Does that make him gay?
Not in Chris' lifetime it doesn't. Thanks to 3 months of dry spell and constant hours of TV have deluded him. Based on the archetype you would see on movies and video games, you would learn of the "Tomboy", The girl with boyish next to dykish features would allow her to be swarmed by the opposite sex with her short hair and her appreciation of the Dresdon Dolls.
"If a girl could do it, So can a boy", Chris thought. Thus he has coined the term "Tomgirl". A man in touch with his feminine side, and totally heterosexual.

Several of these images are reversed left-to-right, possibly because Chris took them with the front camera on his DSi or 3DS (Which, like most front-facing cameras, flips the image so that the picture matches what the user sees on the screen, as though the user were looking into a mirror). It should also be noted that picture taking occurred in at least three different places. Pictures TG3 and TG4 are taken on the Downtown Walking Mall. TG12 and TG19 are taken at the Fashion Square Mall and the rest taken in his home.

Chris previously drew on the Charlottesville Free Speech Wall in Chris's Big Night Out II.
Chris matched the color of his high school ring with his new pair of sandals.
Left ear buccaneer, right ear queer.
Not the first time that Chris has covered his face in pickles and white goo. Also, he's using the Plush Breasts as a pillow.
You just know this picture will be used in the paper when Chris finally kills someone.
Not even white knights can say anything to defend this...
I wonder what Fred Phelps would say about this....

"Would you fuck me? I'd fuck me. I'd fuck me hard. I'd fuck me so hard."

He made himself into a sweetheart from the ground-up.
GOODBYE HORSES
The PlayStation Move SharpShooter doesn't make the look any manlier.
A pillar of heterosexuality, and that's TRUE AND HONEST
If he wears this and claims to be straight, I'd hate to see him when he comes out of the closet.....
