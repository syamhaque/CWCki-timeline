Dillin Thomas is a YouTuber who created videos centered around the Sonic the Hedgehog series, sometimes making videos on particularly off-beat members of its fandom. His videos on Chris often involved him reading this very wiki and commenting on it. He has also taken part in exploiting Chris's imagery by selling a shirt featuring Sonichu and Rosechu.
Taylor is a commissions artist.[1][2] As late as July 2021, the two were a couple.[2] Chris has had some interactions with both of them.

ProjectSNT
Chris DM'd Dillin to talk about ProjectSNT on 23 December 2019.[3] Dillin made a video on the subject,[4] however eventually closed his YouTube channel.
Sonichu and Rosechu shirt
On 2 February 2020, Dillin listed a "Sonichu and Rosechu Valentines Day" shirt on Teespring and announced the sale on Twitter.[5] It featured artwork drawn by Taylor.[6]
Chris responded to Dillin's tweet, mentioning he wanted one of the shirts in pink.[5] Dillin then asked Chris to DM him and gifted him one of the shirts.[7]
During the Jail Saga, Chris had on the shirt as he was being arrested for incest. Dillin then sold more of the shirts on Redbubble under the title "Chris Chan Arrest Shirt".[8]
On 18 August 2024 a user named Skippy asked where they could buy the shirt that Chris wore on his arrest.[9] Dillin began quote tweeting asking if he should begin to resell it.[10] The next day he listed the shirt for sale on Teepublic seemingly without Taylor's permission.[11]

Merlotchu commission
Taylor's design of Merlotchu
At some point prior to the Jail Saga, Chris and Taylor were to collaborate on designing an OC named Merlotchu, a job Taylor had been commissioned to do. With Chris jailed and unable to contribute, Taylor designed the character herself.[12]
Anger from Chris
On 30 July 2021, in the wake of the Incest Call being leaked, Dillin direct messaged Chris to ask of its legitimacy; while Chris at first attempted to drown him out in a paragraph of pseudo-religious nonsense, Chris being Chris eventually confessed to everything despite having no real reason to do so.[13] Afterwards Dillin leaked the conversation.
Angry over the leak, Chris called Dillin a "minor traitor" in a jail letter from November 2021.[14] In the October 2023 video Setting the Record straight - there never was any sex involving me in 2021, Chris ranted about both Dillin and Taylor. He called Dillin abusive to her, without elaborating,
and claimed to have given Taylor support and kindness during a past livestream. According to Kiwi Farms user MosileZ, Taylor felt mainly uncomfortable that Chris was still thinking about her, and also thought it funny that Dillin was being called out by Chris.[15]
