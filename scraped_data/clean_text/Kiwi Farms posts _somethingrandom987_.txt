Chris's DMs
27 November 2020[1]
Hey guys, its been a long time since I said anything on this website but I am going to go ahead and cut to the chase.
Some of you all know me as the writer for the SNT Vs. Sonichu series of Fan Fictions in which I have been working on for the past 2 years now. I know during those 2 years I have been called out by Chris more than twice and even Chris read my fan fic during a live stream I believe a few months ago.
Recently, I started working on ending the trilogy and I started on SNT Vs. Sonichu 3 with multiple people giving me feedback on my work so I can improve myself as a writer. Today, while I was doing laundry, I get a direct message from Chris-Chan herself. The only way I think Chris found me is because she is on ProjectSNT's Server and I am also a patreon supporter. I have been posting Updates to my fan fic there. Christine today contacts me and below I am going to share the conversation I had with her. I am a little surprised and confused that she is reading the second installment of my fan fic and is enjoying it. But again, she is pretending that the Christine I project in my fan fic is not the same Chris in real life. Also she pretended to be Sonichu while talking to me. You can see the conversation I had with her below.
