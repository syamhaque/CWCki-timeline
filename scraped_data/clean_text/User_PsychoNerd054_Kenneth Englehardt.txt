Is [Chris] genuinely delusional? The only one who could answer that for sure is CWC herself.

Kengle being delusional, February 2022[1]
Kenneth Erwin Engelhardt (born 1960),[2] affectionately nicknamed Kengle by Christorians, and also known as Sailfish and OnionNull,[3] is an autistic,[4] Muslim Sonichu fan, a former Facebook white knight and an enthusiastic jail correspondent with Chris, as well as the owner and proprietor of the Onion Farms, a splinter forum based on the Kiwi Farms. He has also bought several of Chris' eBay items, and sent him some sardines after Chris's house burned down.
He made many responses to Chris's Facebook posts, which Chris sometimes found to be annoying. In May 2018, Chris listed a spare license plate on eBay. Since license plates may be considered DMV property, Kengle asked Chris if he got permission to sell it from the DMV, which prompted Chris to ask him to stop, to which Kengle agreed. Two days later, somebody suggested to Chris that his donations dropping could be Patreon taking a 50% cut, which Kengle said was outrageous. This prompted Chris to call Kengle outrageous and tell him not to comment on his posts anymore or Chris would unfriend him, but he told Kengle that he is still allowed to donate to his Patreon if he chooses. Kengle, having finally had enough, told Chris that friendships don't work like that and said goodbye, suggesting that he was done with Chris.[5]
Not too long after, Kengle replied to Chris's tweet begging for money:
Have you considered a project manager? They can help with work layout, publicity, the bottom line and so forth.
Chris replied with:
If I had even remotely Knew of such a Manager YEARS ago, I seriously would have done that sooner. Eeyup.
After Chris went to jail for incest in 2021, Kengle has become one of Chris's most avid pen pals. He has posted many of his letters from Chris to the Onion Farms, often without Chris's explicit permission.
What inspired Sonichen and Rosechen? Like many people I came across the well known Sonichu comic series by Christian Weston Chandler. The idea of drawing a webcomic inspired me on developing my art skills.
Did Christian Weston Chandler collaborate with you in developing Sonichen and Rosechen? No. I have always been the sole creator of Sonichen and Rosechen.
Is there any official connection between Sonichu and Rosechu & Sonichen and Rosechen? No. Sonichen and Rosechen is completely independent.
Is Christian Weston Chandler aware of Sonichen and Rosechen? Yes, he has been aware of it for a long time. However, exactly how long is not known.
What was the historical relationship between Christian Weston Chandler (Sonchu and Rosechu's Creator) and Kenneth Engelhardt (Sonichen and Rosechen's Creator) in a brief paragraph? Shortly after Christian placed a follow button on his Facebook page, Kenneth along with many other people began following Christian's public posts. There was a period of initial hostility during late 2013 when a Facebook block was in place from September till the end of the year. However, connections were not entirely cut, there were a couple of scattered communications during this time. At the beginning of 2014, there was a reconciliation via a third party with the block coming to an end. After the tragic fire at Christian's house in 2014, there was a care package consisting of several board games, sardines, trail mix, and white tube socks that was mailed out with Christian publicly thanking Kenneth on his timeline. Relations between the two parties improved significantly after a series of private communications between Christian and Kenneth during the summer of 2014. After a very brief Facebook connection in July, the two parties reconnected officially on Facebook on October 14, 2014.
How does Christian feel about Sonichen and Rosechen? Initially hostile to Sonichen and Rosechen, this perception has eased up. While there has never been an official statement by Christian concerning Sonichen and Rosechen, the best guess is that his position is sort of a guarded neutral stance.
Is Sonichen and Rosechen connected with Sonichu.com or kiwifarms.net? No. It is not affiliated in any capacity with the cwckipedia and never has been.
What position is taken by the Cwckiforum in regards to Sonichen and Rosechen? Based on various threads posted in the forums by the administrators/moderators, the present official stance is hostility and there is a ban on both the author as well as the web-comic.
What is your position on the Cwckiforums/Sonichu.com? Their mission statement is as follows: "CWCki is a wiki dedicated to Christian Weston Chandler. Its mission is to serve as the ultimate repository of information about Chris, both to aid trolls in trolling him and to inform the Internet at large of Chris's singular grotesqueness" I don't agree with their purpose. The philosophy behind this website is just plain wrong.
Are Cwcki-forumers/chaners allowed to follow or friend you? Yes. An official stance by the forums doesn't necessarily reflect the opinions of individual forumers, Membership on the forums is not necessarily a bar to following or friending me. For the most part, I don't see significant differences on my friends list between forumers and non-forumers.
