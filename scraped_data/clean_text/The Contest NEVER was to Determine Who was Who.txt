================================================================================

On 15 August 2009, in an amazing turn of events, the false Chris, Ian Brandon Anderson, revealed the purpose of the SingStar Challenge. It never was to determine who the real Chris was. It was all just for fun, which is why the video is titled The Contest NEVER was to Determine Who was Who. Despite saying so, he says that there is time for the judges to change their votes on who was the winner. A performance of "So Need a Cute Girl" ensues.

[Ian shows his ring] Haah, I'm doing this new video to, uh, s- clear a record.
The Singstar Challenge was NEVER to verify which one of us was the real Christian Weston Chandler, because everybody on the Internet knows that I am, that he's the impostor. They should quit encouraging him... And I wish that he would quit his stupid, damn, dirty game. I don't know what the heck is wrong with his head. [his voice gets higher] He ain't right! He don't even let me get a word in edge-wise! He just keeps going on and on AND ON AND ON AND ON AND ON AND ON AND ONNNNNNNNN! Worse than my father!
[sighs] Anyway, it was just basically a fun thing. Only for fun. It never was meant to determine who was who! But just to play it safe, I am going to give y'all the big sample.
[camera cut] Again, the contest was only for fun, never to determine who was WHO. Because everybody knows dang well. Anyway, here is the classic, of which that has been in my heart, that made women realize there was a guy still out there. A virgin, waiting.
[Ian, once again, plays "So Need a Cute Girl"]
Hey, look at me!
I'm sitting here sad and lonely
Without a fire,
But a desire
To not hear you say, you say
"I want it that way!"
As I see da ladies walking
Along one by one,
I never wanna hear,
"I have a boyfriend!"
Tell me why
I'm stuck as a virgin with rage
Tell me why
I so need a cute girl my age!
Tell me why
I ain't ever wanna hear you say,
"I have a boyfriend!"
And I have no fire,
But a desire
To not hear you say,
"I have a boyfriend!"
Tell me why
I'm stuck as a virgin with rage!
(Tell me why)
I so need a cute girl my age!
Tell me why
I ain't ever wanna hear you say,
"I have a boyfriend!"
Why do all of the jerks
Get all of the pretty girls? Yeah!
You may not notice,
But you should know
That I am a lonesome heart!
And I have no fire,
But a desire
To not, to not, to not
Heeeaaar…
Don't wanna hear you
Stuck as a virgin with rage!
So need a cute girl my age!
I never wanna hear you say,
"I have a boyfriend!"
Tell me why
I'm stuck as a virgin with rage!
(Tell) me why
I so need a cute girl my age!
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say,
"I have a boyfriend!"
Tell me why
I'm stuck as a virgin with rage!
I so need a cute girl my age!
Tell me why
I ain’t ever wanna hear you say,
"I have a boyfriend!"
Never say it now!
Compare that, to the original, that got bootlegged, wrongfully, from a copy of my DVD. Have a good- have a nice day. Peace.
[camera cut] Oh, and also, there is still time, and it is optional, for the judges to change their votes.
