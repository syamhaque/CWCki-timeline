A Chat Between SNT and Chris Chan
Goal
Checkmark
Win this Goal when: SNT and Chris Chan, with the Sonichu keyword, are shipped together on the shipping grid.
In C-197, I had a fateful encounter where I was sent to thwart another Eggman scheme, but I eneded up meeting the one-and-only SNT. She and I enjoyed a pleasant conversation. I even pointed out her inhabitual attraction when it went off: I was immune to it. Also, she was still grasping the concept of communicating with Courtney, being an OC of hers, and so forth. I offered my insight and thoughts. She felt better. And then we took down Eggman. -Chris Chan Sonichu.
