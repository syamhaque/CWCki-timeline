"And when you put it all together, there's the model of a charmless man!"
"Girls And Boys" is the fifth track from SPARKLE like you mean it: ROBEE'S BALLAD by Robee Sonee and the Tomgirls. It is a cover of "Girls and Boys" by Blur.
Chris seems to have chosen this song as a Tomgirl "ballad", but not only is the song too upbeat to be a ballad, he also apparently not noticed that it also endorses homosexuality, bisexuality and pansexuality.

Lyrics
Street's like a jungle
So call the police
Following the herd
Down to Greece
On holiday -
Love in the 90's
Is paranoid
On sunny beaches
Take your chances looking for
Girls who are boys
That like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they girls
Who do girls like they boys
Always should you be someone you really love
Avoiding all work
Because there's none available
Like battery thinkers
Count your thoughts on 1-2-3-4-5 fingers
Nothing is wasted
Only reproduced
Y'get nasty blisters
Du bist sehr schön [pronounces it wrong]
But we haven't been introduced
Girls who are boys
Who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls
Who do girls like they're boys
Always should be be someone you really love
Girls who are boys
Who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls
Who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone you really love
[long pause]
[mumbles and stumbles]
Girls who are boys
Who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls
Who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone you really love
Girls who are boys
Who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls
Who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone you really love
Girls who are boys
Who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls
Who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone you really love
Girls who are boys
Who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls
Who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone you really love
