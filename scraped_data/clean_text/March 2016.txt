Chris in March 2016
March was the third month of 2016. The month kicked off with Chris buying a PS4, claiming to have received it from a fan. Chris then started making several videos with said PS4. Other than that, two more Arthur Spatchcock interviews with Chris were conducted, Chris uploaded a director commentary on the 2011 Autism Tutorial, and livestreamed a poorly-done Q&A video this month. Meanwhile, Barbara went to court and had to pay nearly $5,000 due to not paying her debts.
♪ Chris is back, all right! ♫
