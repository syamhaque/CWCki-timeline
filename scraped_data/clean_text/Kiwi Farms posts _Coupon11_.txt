Introduction

Hey guys, it's Coupon11. I'm the founder of project cwc islam and I run the PO Box that I sent and received letters with Chris from.
I will transcribe the letter so it can be posted in the CWCki.
Obviously it looks like Chris is not open to Islam. The project is over. Pretty disappointed, I thoufht this could be the one thing that changes his life. The turning point of christory. But at least we found out his opinion on it for the very first time. It has been an honor to contribute to Chris chan knowledge.
Time to update this page. https://sonichu.com/cwcki/Chris_and_religion
EDIT: Never mind, someone else transcribed it.
Chris and Religion

Someone needs to update the Chris and religion article on cwcki, now that he commented on islam
I didn't give Chris any heresy in my letters. I told him the truth and any heresy he makes up is his own doing.
Michael's Existential Crisis
13 October 2021[3]
I grew up a very messed up kid. I relate to Chris Chan in a lot of ways. Looking at my pre-conversion life, you'd think I was 100% destined for prison or suicide. You'd think I was gonna become a serial killer or the next Elliot Rodger or something. Then on a day in 2021, just when I was about to lose all hope, God intervened and saved my life.
I had always struggled with existential questions. Why does this reality exist? Why are we conscious and not just biological robots? Is love real, or just a chemical reaction in the brain that compels us to breed? Is this universe just a meaningless joke of needless suffering and unfairness? What's the point of accomplishing anything if it's all gonna be gone when I die, and when the universe dies?
Well, everything you do has eternal value. If you do good deeds, you increase the odds of getting an eternity in heaven, where you can play with cute girls forever. If you learn science, it doesn't just go away when you die. You transcend to the afterlife and remember everything you did in this world.
you might say, heaven and hell are just fairy tales because we're scared of death and we want to believe evil rich people don't just get away with exploiting us with with no hell to punish them.
No, there's actually plenty of evidence that Islam is true. There's much evidence for it, and no proof against it. Some things might even be proof.
For example, the Quran has the speed of light in it. I don't feel like explaining it, just go to Dr. Google to find it.
I know a lot about science and nothing in the Quran is in opposition to recent scientific discoveries. it all agrees with modern science.
tell me, why do humans think hamsters are cute? Why are we the only animal that regularly takes care of other species?
You might say, "because animals look like babies so we're hardwired to think they're cute."
then pray tell, why do many people think hamsters are hundreds of times cuter than ACTUAL human babies? If I think a hamster is unbearably cute because it looks LIKE a human baby, why don't ACTUAL human babies make me literally die from cuteness overload?
Also, if you think a hamster looks like a human baby, i'd hate to see the babies you've been looking at. human babies don't even have fur, so why would we be hardwired to think fur is cute?
hamsters aren't even the best comparison, because they are genetically close to humans. Why do people think CHICKENS are cute, of all things? A chicken looks like an alien from outer space compared to a human baby.
The answer to why we think animals are so cute... Is because God made animals visually pleasing to us, and he made us perceive them as visually pleasing.
Your atheism will never be able to answer why we are conscious and experiencing, and not just biological robots. How can a collection of atoms become conscious on its own?
Doxing as a Fear Tactic
15 October 2021[4]
What really gets Me is all this stupid fear mongering. "Oooo you better be scared cuz we archived all of your stupid comments oooo watch this space." The only thing genuinely making me mad is that you guys think your fear tactics work against me. You probably visualize me being like "ohh noooo the internet mob is gonna ruin my life for good x((("
IIRC it's not like I've said racist things that would be genuinely scary If they were Preserved forever.
we knew about 14 branchland court for like a decade and the worst thing that happened to Chris is that someone hired a hooker to go there.
