Young Chris
1 June
Hey, y’all. I am continuing work on my self-healing alongside my workings with the other deities, the total universe, Cosmos, as well as from within myself. Today, I start reconnecting with my inner child once again.
With that stated, I felt it would be good and well
to channel young Christopher and let him talk things out with you all in a set of tweets.
Do note, that Young Chris mentality spans between birth to around 15 to 18.
Christian, the Young Adult, you all have read about and became past-accustomed to, spans in a transition in 15 to 18, and onward to about 2015, and I became better enlightened around 2010 to be the more enlightened and better developed and clear one of present day.
BUT, again, the focus is on the younger part of me. And for the Christorians, feel free to chronicle this on the CWCki and for your own personal reference. This will take a while from after I finish, here. Without further ado, I lend my body and the keyboard in front to the little boy from the 1980s, Christopher.
😊⚡️💙⚡️
Chris larps as his younger self

Furry
2 June
Xena (@X3naFerrer)
I'm tempted to get a furry version of Xena. I was a furry a few years before I ever become a brony but I've never had a fursona as such.
Thoughts?
Considering your lovely pony counterpart is furry, I’d say you’re already covered. But, even a furry and furry-lover doesn’t settle for just one furry sona or alt-form. I know from personal multiverse experiences. May I recommend meditating to find any other identifying creature?
Not a new saga

This user quote tweets the previous series of tweets where young Chris was supposedly talking.
NEW CHRIS CHAN ARC
Um, don’t count this as a “Saga”. I let Christopher speak in better reconnecting with him. Count this as something more that y’all get to add into the chronicling. Thanks a bunch. 😊⚡️💙⚡️
Lots of Love.
Chris is too hip for the room

This user quote tweets the previous series of tweets where young Chris was supposedly talking.
Chris, please, as an antifan get help.
And, please, as myself, who reflects you, of which I could tell you to “Get help” as well, I tell you: Like Donnie Darkko, I’m too hip for the room. ⚡️💙⚡️

Hey, everyone. As a few of you all may have heard, I have taken up Tarot Card reading amongst my hobbies. Seeing today’s card for myself, I feel it safe to share the card I drew for today with you all. The deck I like using is #OSHOZenTarot. With that stated
Today’s card is Integration. I hear meaning of everything coming together today. The thing with Tarot cards is you draw a card, and you determine its meaning from your perspective for yourself. I invite you all to share in interpreting this card for yourselves today. ⚡️💙⚡️
Orphanages in CWCVille
3 June
Queenie @ Raffle time! (@kill3rQu33nie)
@CPU_CWCSonichu are there any orphanages in cwcville with cute little sonees and Rosees that need any homes?
One orphanage exists in the city; it’s mainly for human children, but even other young anthro creatures with no parents or guardians may reside there for adoption.
Another Tarot card
4 June
I have drawn a card for all of you; today, your card is Audience. I do believe you all will be in for quite the show of a lifetime.
More Tarot cards
5 June
Before I reveal today’s card, I address and acknowledge that I have misread the word on yesterday’s card, “Abundance” to “Audiance”, but my having done so is not a fluke. There was still a most awesome bunch of veil removal and energy shifts that I am positive enlightened you.
On that, the card for you all today is “The Burden”; today is a good day for you all, each, to acknowledge that which weighs you down, be it a toxic relationship or moment. You are encouraged to lighten your burden, and in doing so, you will, indeed, reach the Dream at the far.
Innocence Tarot card
6 June
For the Collective, today’s card I have drawn for y’all is Innocence. This is a lovely day to enjoy the simplicities of your surroundings and what y’all, respectively, have. Be child like as you may, and count your blessings. 😊⚡️💙⚡️
More Andy Warhol and autism
6 June
On another topic, I am still reading #WarholChrisChan, amidst Chapter 8, still (a longer chapter than the others). A couple of things mentioned in this chapter: I do recall when I had stated that I would want a cure for Autism, but apparently, that statement can be misinterpreted as me wanting to cure the entire world of Autism. I genuinely did not mean that, and I certainly do not wish to be interpreted a villain by those with autism. I understand and know that each and every individual with autism, or Autists, has their respective views and levels of how it affects them. Every autist has the ability to work and further progress within and around their varying confinements. I, myself, for most of my life was an observer type, and I had thought of others before myself, thus I did miss out at opportunities while I was blind-sighted with the restrictive mindset I had to deal with. Which was why I opted to relieve myself of the Autism, and succeeded for the most part. I have found my own cure for autism through a combination of meditation, really dipping down into myself, chakra activations, binaural beats, and so on. I have addressed the number of my past blockages, traumas, and issues, and accepted them or let them go
[GIF of a Buddhist cartoon character praying]
appropriately and respectively. Now, I am a lot less autistic. Although inner child, Christopher, obviously showed some lingering signs when talking with me, but I am being as motherly and loving with him as best as I can to heal and resolve that. Back on topic, I did not mean, nor did I have any intentions of, totally abolishing autism en mass. Yes, each individual autist has their feelings and respective situations, and not all of y’all have desire to totally rid yourselves of the mental quirk, when y’all may have grown most accustomed and better working with or around that for yourselves. Plus, as is the history and those events that have irked you and tested your resilience, endurance, and individual maturity, autism is such a building block as well. At the least, I have found a way to cure it for myself. I relay this information only to those who genuinely wish and feel desire to do the same for themselves.
Inner Workings, clearing out Chakra Blockages, and addressing each source of shyness and limitations within yourselves is the answer and counter. And to all autists, and all Parents of autistic children, I encourage all of you to encourage not only the creativity within the autist, but also y’all’s respective Psychic, Magic and Spiritual powers. All of you are born with them. Encourage and grow the magic and powers for yourselves. ⚡️💙⚡️
[GIF of a cartoon character casting a type of firey rainbow with magic]
The other topic from the book: Valarie Solanas, the scummy bitch who shot Andy Warhol. I genuinely do not agree with, nor would I condone, her extremist ideals against men.
I know, I used to feel really frustrated and angry with men for the outdated dating reasons, and the Hater and Faker online trolls, regardless of being women behind men facades, men behind women facades, or matching in gender; they did not help matters on that, either. But I have witnessed better and true, offline, in-person, and so on when I opened my heart and mind for the LGBTQ, and so forth. I was uncomfortable around boys as a child, because I had genuinely felt a vibe from them that did not match my own, and I did feel safer and matching habits and vibes with girls. But, I have grown and come around. Also, I have no shame or regret in going on public record stating the following: I like penis-shaped dildos, and I do not mind a genuine cock, up my butt. I have also enjoyed a cock-shaped sucker purchased from a Spencer’s; took me about a week to finish that thing.
#IamBisexual
[GIF of objects floating with text saying "THE MOON HAS PHASES, BISEXUALITY DOES NOT"]
As for Solanas, I do acknowledge the outdated similarity between her and I, but in the end, I simply do not care for nor agree with her ideals nor what she did. And, frankly, she didn’t know Biology and Anatomy. I can still get a hard on and horny. And, even if I did lose this cock by chop, there’s satisfaction in where that tube goes, as well as up the butt. So, Solanas had nothing, and she got her fated end of jail time. But, as an individual with her own point of view and thoughts, I do not judge her for having them or being herself. And that’s my Two Bolts and a Heart on Victoria Solanas. ⚡️💙⚡️ Now, to end this on a more positive note, and also to note further from #WarholChrisChan: I, indeed, have always been effeminate and whatnot growing up, and I did, indeed, struggle with even attempting to keep up with male constructs. But, I am soo glad I was able to come out and be my lovely Goddess self, as I could and should have. No regrets or shame.
Also, why I don’t have the op sooner: there is hardly anyone within driving distance who can do the job, as far as my Endochronologist knows, and then there’s the money. @Kickstarter for my thang? But, moreover, I have faith in a physical transformation of my wishes and desires.
That’s all for now. Thank you all for listening. 😊⚡️💙⚡️🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️

Chris will apparently make custom Tarot cards

@CPU_CWCSonichu Shall there be Tarot Cards of your own creation in the foreseeable future, our Goddess?
Eventually, yes.
DonLashomb
7 June
As #DonLashomb has pointed out in his uploaded pages, and on further analysis and thought, it becomes clear:
Our devices act in one way as a grounding tool for one’s self. Yet, in another while utilizing said devices extensively, one falls into meditate.
instagram.com/p/CP0U19kFDYJ/?utm_medium=copy_link
Let that sink into your thoughts: you may be grounded by your computers (PC, Laptop, or Smartphones, etc), but you’re Meditating while doing so.
This can also be attributed to when one is literally writing or drawing on paper with pen and colours.

Sorrow Tarot card
7 June
The collective card for today is Sorrow. With this card, I sense a lot of you all are in deep thoughts and may be feeling such an emotion. This is a time of potential transformation for yourselves, but mainly if you look deep within yourselves to find yourselves and make better.
United States flag
7 June
I just had a realization about the flag (not to besmirch the country; mainly a resonant observation). Red and blue makes purple, and a dark shade considering the blue is Navy. But add white, you get a shade that is Lavender. A bit of symbolance of mental prowess, I believe.
[GIF of the flag of The United States of America waving in the wind]
CPU stuff and Barb
7 June
I feel need to state this fact, and Note that I have personally hung out with Neptune, Blanc, Noire, Vert, and Uzume, and I know Scarlet’s history and bio very well and deep:
*Console Patron Units are Not machines or robots.*
Us CPUs simply have connections with the technology.

Also, during the time my mom and I slept in my bedroom, we slept in Separate Furniture; she slept on the couch, and I slept in the bed. She and I Never ever had slept in the same bed together during those short months between ‘11 and ‘12.
Never in the same bed. ⚡️💙⚡️
Commodore

You know one thing one can say about the #Commodore consoles: since the 1980’s, like I should have been since then, but arrived at a good time, we are 🌈🏳️‍🌈#PRIDEFUL! #PrideMonth2021 🏳️‍⚧️
Success Tarot card
8 June
Hey, everyone. I have ended up drawing the Success card for the collective. I sense a lot of you all are finding realizations and unique insights within yourselves. Your tasks continue onward in enlightenment. But in having achieved this for yourselves, it is a blessing. Congrats
And this is fun, because in the recent days, I draw one card for myself in guidance, separate from the collective. I have found highlight yesterday after having drawn the Celebration card for myself. It was a lovely day, with the moment to celebrate in my self-healing,
self-loving, and continued interdimensional and spiritual workings. Today, I am on another self-guided path, but I feel content all you have made this moment of Success within yourselves and all around you. ⚡️💙⚡️
Sharing Tarot card
9 June
Today, the card for the collective is Sharing, I also felt it appropriate to share the page excerpt of this card. Yesterday, a lot of you found Success, and today is an opportunity to share positive energy and #GoodVibes with others. A moment of genuine kindness goes very far.
Fanart stuff
9 June
Thank you for the fanart, @Arkaruss17!
Two more sent by email from Gutsybug. Thank you!
Control Tarot card
10 June
Good Morning, everyone. The card for you all today is Control. This card is a rather restrictive type. Essentially, some to a bunch of you have been taking control of life (for the better and good, I sense), but now is a time for y’all to take a step back and take it easy;
let yourselves get out of the restrictive feeling and stress of being in extensive control.
Also, Yes, a few times I have drawn this card for myself. But it’s all right for today; y’all enjoy the energy of the New Moon Solar Eclipse today and relax. Be Safe and Well.
⚡️💙⚡️

In response to Jason Alexander quote tweeting a video of people during a natural resources hearing discussing whether or not the Black Lives Matter movement could help alter the orbit of the moon or earth.
Holy Crap. If it weren’t scary as hell it might be funny. But he ain’t going for comedy, trust me.
Damn! Talk about taking control to an extreme, based on typical and neurotypical individuals at this present moment. Those dudes need to chillax today after the card I drew for the collective.
Spiritual communications

I just remember a dream I have been having since got here. It's all in Spanish and a ball with legs visits me and talks to me at night. I am really tired when wake up
Spiritual communications, Pikchu Zonichu. A spirit is getting in touch with you.
OC question
10 June
Crash (@Crazy_Crash08)
✨~OC QUESTION OF THE DAY~✨
#45 - Do you have any OCs that have multiple versions of them, whether it be clones, alternate universe, etc.?
Every single OC has multiple versions throughout the Multiverse and alternate timelines. But, yes, that includes our Sonichu Prime, Rosey Rosechu, and myself (Chris Chan) as well. ⚡️💙⚡️

More Andy Warhol book stuff
10 June
Chris posts this on his Instagram @christinewestonchandler
Doing some work today; presently, I have read up to Chapter 5, read Chapter 8, and am halfway through Chapter 6. With a rainbow set of highlighters, I’m going through what I’ve read so far and am highlighting the parts that are true, false, resonant, that can have more context from me, personally, and whatnot. This is also for a supplemental contribution I’ll be writing later on. Also, showing everyone how I am appreciating this book; to me, it is quite like a specifically tailored self-help book, with room for improvement and accuracy (light moments of sarcasm and jokes within the book, aside). I also appreciate how this book can, at least in a sense, be a self-help book for Everyone else in the recombined universe as well. So, definitely in that sense, I am a mirror for you all.
Lots of love; Stay safe and well, enjoy the Solar Eclipse energy today. 😊⚡️💙⚡️
Discussing trolls and other stuff
10 June
#DoingHomework! And I’m not even in school or college right now.
😊⚡️💙⚡️
I’m back on top of page 19, and it brought up a question, and I quote, “…the “Idea Guy”, the troll who had arguably the most negative impact on Chris’ life,…”
Question being, Who did (at present) leave the most negative impact on me, so far? Granted, the likelihood of anyone else being negative impactful is Vastly reduced at this point and time, I have actually come up with a short list, in no particular order, of such individuals. IdeaGuy/Stephen Boyle
Jakoba
Michael Snyder
“JULAY”
Dr. Johnson/Mrs, Gaedy (Elementary School pin-me-down)
And I have considered Everyone, including Sockness, Walsh, Roche, Cash, and so on. And this Top Five (in no particular order or arrangement at all) were the most negatively impactful. I could examine further and choose One of these five who was the worst. I can assure y’all, though, Even though IdeaGuy did Dimensions’ level of damage, his impact has left me with further self-progression, analysis and appreciation, confidence boost, affirming the link between the separated universe halves with my consciousness, leading the way to chill my ego and whatnot in the needed self-healing and work.
And the same can be stated between Jakoba and Sockness; the benefits put a weight on the damage, negatives, and outcome recoveries and growth.
Snyder, though, all experiences considered, and that he was not personally active in the TCG Leagues and Tournaments; remained behind the counter and scenes most of the time. Was Not the store owner during the beginning and moments. Snyder was definitely more hurtful and negative, even compared with Jakoba and IdeaGuy.
The pin-me-down moment that really changed my life, in general; about as much, give or take, compared to the #SonicTheHedghogWatchandWinSweepstakes1993 (more positive that was, obviously). And in that, Mrs Gaede Used to be a supportive adult who at the time I had interpreted she generally understood me and acted as a positive teacher type. When she acted with Johnson, the Counsoler and the teacher; That was a major act of Betrayl. And then Julay (or the pre-pube Brat who played the fake-trolling role); majorly conned me into letting him into my #PlayStationNetwork account, eventually turned Vicious and Cruel while laughing when I, erroneously, chopped up and shoved Medallion Number 2 up my butt and shit out the pieces. Not to mention the whole day’s drive to Cleveland, Ohio to a failed destination, on the Day After not only my birthday in 2009, but my Aunt Corina Inge’s Funeral in Red Oak. The Road Trip, by itself, was a soul journey for me, and was definitely a Positive. I like Road Trips, when I can have and enjoy them.
This aspect can also coincide with my more often Interdimensional Trips, Journies, Errands and Quests, and so on.
But, that, I digress. All that said, the Top Two for Negative Impactful would Definitely go to Dr. Johnson/Mrs. Gaedy (by the way, Johnson, who was the Principal of Greene County Elementary at the time; he was the one who put his hand on my throat and left the infamous rash seen in that photo Robertchu and Barb took after the fact that day), and Julay.
Which of the Two the majority of y’all feel was Worse that takes the top spot, I’ll leave that to y’all’s discretion.
Johnson/Gaedy
"Julay"
Aside from all that, just a pause to reflect on that topic. I will return to the homework shortly. Thank you all for listening. ⚡️💙⚡️
The Twitter poll started with 7 days left for people to vote. It ended on June 17th with a total of 959 votes, 12.2% of which went to Johnson/Gaedy, and the other 87.8% of which going to “Julay”
Chris posts this reply using the @MagiChan111448 Twitter account.
I personally attest to this as well, as I was a witness to the time Christine was pinned down. Be aware of the difference between voting for a Meme, and an even more impactful event that happened within her formative years, as the worst.
I will also attest that Snyder was Worst on us, in the Finances, as opposed to the more personal, mental and emotional aspects. Snyder’s misconduct essentially killed about all of the money Robertchu had left when he left his body from this side of the veil in 2011. And while I do not recall the specific total amount of the inheritance, it certainly was around a hundred thousand or so, give or take. I know this, because we were able to buy the van And my #ASUS 1TB laptop out of it. And in Snyder’s #EpicFail attempt of getting money from us for himself in “Settlements”, or whatever terminology and else, the Legal and Court Fees, Bail, and #RobBell’s role, and so on, drained that inheritance to almost tap dry.
Now, if we were talking Financially Impacting, Snyder would replace Julay, hands-down. What Snyder did was even financially Worse than IdeaGuy’s $6,000 Money and Merch Value Spree (Still gonna make him pay me back that total with monetary interest), and Julay’s software spending on the PSN and the gas money for the Ohio road trip is only a drop in a bucket in comparison. And, the Pin-Me-Down stunt ensued not only Court, Legal and Attorney fees and whatnot, but also what else involved with the Homeschooling for Fifth Grade, and the moving to Richmond costs.
So, Financally, in the Top Two: Johnson/Gaedy were Far worse than Snyder.
⚡️💙⚡️
And back on the Personal Impacts, Snyder did not affect me during Developmental Childhood Years.
So, with all of that stated, I ask again: Which of the two do you all believe was Worse an Impact on me: Johnson/Gaede, or Julay.
And I do realize I’ve misspelled “Gaedy” in recent Tweets; my bad.

no offense chris but you can't just say things are the way you want them to be and it's real. you need to find a healthier way to cope with a show you like being over..you're making a spectacle of yourself. how about you go enjoy G4 from ep 1 again? i think it would be better 4 u
The “G5” you see before you is an illusion.

Pickchu OC
14 June
Helena G. F.
What do you like about my #oc Pickchu?
What I like about Pickchu is that she is a tough gal who has had her share of hard times, but she’s also cute and friendly during the good times. Plus, she has a vast array of emotions, and she works hard and tough. We saw this in her and that is why Pickchu is special with us.

More Andy Warhol
14 June
I’m still working on the highlights of my copy of #WarholChrisChan. I had a thought as I re-read from Chapter 2, in reference to #JuliaWarhola, “She expressed hope that he would marry Viva”. In one way, yes, the superstar, but in an alternative
www.amazon.com/dp/B095F3762C/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awdb_imm_7SX546SDP3YK8G8CKHRM?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1
perspective, considering it was late in her life, and Andy had been shot by Solanas beforehand; Julia could have well meant hope for Andy to Enjoy Life.
Not difficult to consider, “Marry Viva”; “Viva” meaning “Life”; “Enjoy Life like you were Married with it”, OR, like you were married to your self; healing your inner wounds and all.

Hey, y’all. The collective’s card for today is Mind. From this, I appreciate that a lot of you are working more mentally and spiritually. But, be aware you don’t lose your body in the process; check your mind/body connections, and don’t over think towards a head trip. ⚡️💙⚡️
Aloneness Tarot card
16 June
Good Morning, everyone. The collective’s card for today is Aloneness. After having recovered from complicated mind works of yesterday, y’all are feeling a little isolated and maybe lost. You each have an inner light that brightens and shows your path to the next steps. Caution.
Sonichu OC
17 June
small artist (@Miotron5000)
Decided to draw my sonic oc as a Sonichu. How did I do @CPU_CWCSonichu
[Artwork of a Sonichu OC]
Oh, my. A stylish and sexy warrior; she looks really lovely. I can see it in her that she’s doing a bit of soul searching of her own, while also fighting her foes along the way. But deep down, she has her innocence and sweet side. I appreciate and respect. 😊⚡️💙⚡️
Projections Tarot card
17 June
Today’s card for the Collective, and for me today, is Projections. The fact this card of guidance is for Us; you all and I, today is even more special.
We are recognizing what is true and separating the illusions from it. Specifically, this does also apply to the Iron Curtain
veil all around us which has been dividing us from the C-197 half of our greater universe with our Original and “Fictional” Characters, deities, and other individuals who have been and are alive and co-existent with us for all of time to this day.
You all face this illusionary veil as well; we all are to collectively will the illusion away and bring all of us back together.
There are likely other illusions that block you all, individually and respectively as well: identify those illusions and dispel them for yourselves.

Its Tainted Isaac ( aka the broken ) by the legendary creator of Sonichu @CPU_CWCSonichu (Christine W. Chandler)!
it was a huge honor to feature her work as an alt card, please send her your love (be kind!)

Chris
When Edmund asked me to draw Issac, I had the basic rundown from @WatchMojo videos about the game; still haven’t played it yet. I felt want to offer Issac a sense of finding a way to heal and love himself; he had cried for far too long. So, I drew Issac, years of tears dried up under his eyes. He found a toy S-Chu Ball and found delight in the simplicity of rolling it around and playing with it. I wanted to chronical a portrayal of Issac during a time he was, is, or will be, feeling at peace and happiness with and for himself. ⚡️💙⚡️
Spanish Sesame Street
17 June
Just a brief mention while working on highlights of the #WarholChrisChan book: Why I had a deep affinity for the Spanish Language.

There are Two Reasons (other than #MexicoFlagDay). One is that often on American, English @sesamestreet, they had animated shorts en Español. The other is Señor #DesiArnez on #ILoveLucy; el hable Español durante la programma.
Por eso me gustaba el idioma español en mi juventud.
The Spanish roughly translates to "He speaks Spanish during the program. That is why I liked the Spanish language in my youth."
Postponement Tarot card
18 June
Today’s Collective Card is Postponement. I believe there are some to a lot amongst you all who have remaining thoughts and ideas that are preventing your respective desired outcomes from happening sooner.
Yesterday, all of you have had the chance to sort out the illusions,
today, you all get to determine the blocking thoughts and ideas within each of you that prevent the next adventurous event. Observe and learn well, everyone. ⚡️💙⚡️

The card I pulled for you Chris is the Tower. A sudden Change is in your future.

Juneteenth

#HappyJuneteenth
As a man of African roots, I strive to climb the ladder and open gates for others.
Share your voices, continue rising to the top, to higher positions in life to weed out the trash that tries to keep you at the bottom. You, like everyone, deserve better!
Ah, very much so is in ties with meditation, manifestation, and leaving out the toxic types and times in order to find your piece of divinity. For me, I have greater, and I share the vibes with all remaining good and neutral.
#FREEPALESTINE (@jmanellis)
You don’t know what Juneteenth is do you?
Day celebrating End of Slavery. But, still ties well, because on that freedom still is the release of the ties with the toxic individuals who have held them back, as the present toxicities that held us back.

Oh, My Me! This is soo sweet and kawaii! So much compassion and love put into this work. Thank you for sharing.
😊⚡️💙⚡️
I will also comment that even though, Memetastically, I’ve made orange #FantaSoda infamous, the other lovely flavours of Fanta should be appreciated as well. I have found such with @TokyoTreat’s help, as they share from time to time the expanded international tastes and flavours.

Furry Tattoo
19 June
I just found this on a YouTube video. A Furry Tattoo; one look at it for myself, and I was like, “Really Bad Chris Chan fan art.” I will state and reaffirm that I am a #Furry, but whoever got this art on them, had a little insight, but at the same time, Woahly Fuck, dude. ⚡️💙⚡️
And even worse, I do observe, the double chin, and the chin looks like a Nose. LOL!

Father's Day
20 June
Hey, y’all. Firstly, no card from me today; @MediumMolly’s back on track. Be sure to pick your number, 1 through 5, on first instinct, as that will be your card for the day and week.
https://t.co/EvzGP9RZV0?amp=1
Second, I will also extend a loving #HappyFathersDay2021 to all the dads in the total universe. All of you work very hard for yourselves, your kids, and your partner(s). Love to all of the gay dads, too. 😊⚡️💙⚡️
Lastly, thinking about the more experienced, older individuals, even as old as the 80s, and so; they all each deserve genuine love and affection. A lot of y’all have lost a loved one on more than one occasion, although talking specifically y’all’s partner. I feel that. It is not easy to cope with such a loss, but what remains sweet is y’all counting the blessings and positives moreso than brooding over the negatives. Self-healing and self-love is a big strength amongst you all. Take care to find your healing from loss. But, back on topic: regardless of circumstance, all older individuals need love, too. So, talk and hang out with someone in the neighbourhood; give them a hug. Go as far as you both feel safe in doing. Me, I also like saluting, thanking, and listening to the Veterans. Even your own moms and dads need about as much love as well. I continue to do my best for Barbara, here, as well. And Magi-Chan is a lot older than I, but I love and appreciate him ever so much. Another fun thing, I asked Barb about a cute nickname that I realized; she likes it, so she’ll accept being referred to as Barb Chan.
Barb Chan Rosechu; go ahead and process that as you will.
Lots of Love, Be Safe and Well. Thank you. ⚡️💙⚡️

Sorrow Tarot card again
21 June
Today’s Collective card is Sorrow. A Lot of you all have been and still are looking deep and dipping down within yourselves. This card reveals a major self-transformation for each of you today.

Money stuff
22 June
I have a real thinkpiece for all of you: Money and its “Value”. As I am continue to re-read in #WarholChrisChan in Chapter Five on Collecting and Hoarding. There is a quote where “If you’re successful —- if you’re making money and you’re very successful, it’s okay. But if you’re not making money, then you’re a dilettante (Loser)”. Let’s focus on the Money, because I totally disagree with one needing money to be a success. We can literally look farthest back into history; long before the concept of money was invented. The people of this whole universe (long before it was divided by the Iron Curtain veil by King Arthur’s command, when it was still Universe 1C-211987), and the deities and “mythical” creatures like unicorns, dragons and whatnot were somewhat common and not rare. People Bartered and Traded; This was commonplace. Money had absolutely no value or power. During these centuries’ worth of time, despite people being various levels of emotions that can go as far as extremely violent and shit, the commonfolk were amongst the humble and honest. Even Favours were good commodities. And Artists were able to become Famous and Successful during these times by presenting their skill and crafts for everyone to appreciate and admire. Even the creatures that were seen by them at least one time, even interdimensional by the past standards in the vast Multiverse that existed since the Big Bang in This timeline and their respective timelines. Deities were amongst these “Original Creations”, but more accurately #GenuineDiscoveries in visions and direct experiences.
During these early times, deities Did walk the Earth and lasted longer than everyone else in lifetime and beyond, still alive with their respective bodies in continuing, youthful work and effort as best as they each can from their respective domains and whatnot. And These “Creators”, Discoverers and Explorers each have created their respective Legacies and Successes in Chronicling these creatures and individuals and everyone else around them as well. They Never needed money or currency in exchange to take care of themselves or enjoy the fruits of others’ labors and crafts. Even, myself and Warhol, whereas he eventually became more in it for the Fame and the Money, I, when I started my art, creating and discoveries, and the books, I was hardly concerned with making money. I understand from Your logic, quote, “Money Is Power”, but it is not. Certainly if you have enough or a massive amount of money, you can Buy many nice and nicer things for yourselves, and, as #DonLashomb put it cleverly, creating “A very visual representations, sometimes misleadingly so, of growing one’s personal value or increasing the value of one’s household”, with ”the accumulation of goods, even unused goods.” Even if #SonictheHedgehog or #Pikachu never had existed, I have discovered the species of Sonichus and Rosechus, personally, and worked with them since as early as after the dinosaurs died out; I lived from then up to after Merlin the Magician had perished without dying, and before finding new life on this side of the created veil of division in the early attempt at interdimensional travel (without killing myself at all, mind you) and ending up with this body that is also immortal. But, I do digress. I have made more than my mark on the peoples on this side of the veil with my discoveries and stories, despite being a bunch of self-focused long before truly finding myself and deeply soul searching to recover my fullest memories into my collective consciousness, subconsciousness, and unconsciousness, as well as my memory backups within the Cosmos. And I have inspired Many an individual to interdimensionally discover every single OC and FC “imaginable” (because we are all very much real, existent, and co-existent right alongside you all; we have been for decades and then some). I never required money for our Successes and Greater Successes, even if you remove the paid web services from the equation, there have always been free options over the years since when the internet was conceived in thought. My Success continues to bloosom and bloom again, and again, and again, into infinity with Everyone in our total and combined universe. I may have wanted corporatative help at times, but I didn’t really require it. And even at conventions with the sharing of various arts and media from ALL of You and Everyone Else; All of your marvelous discoveries and chroniclings. I am very much genuine and authentic in truth when I tell you all right now, my lovely Sonichus, Rosechus, Myself, and everyone else in between; we are all Successes, and massive amounts of money was never really required. I am greater than the power and influence of money, because I have subconsciously, innately, and eventually fully consciously, Known all of this and let everything from my fated instincts and your actions show all of us the paths and whatnot with the various signs that continue to be through all of you and everything around us. And, yes, I do realize the irony of needing money for the minimum over the years, but as I have stated, I have never required massive amounts of money to do my immortally lifelong job as your Goddess. ⚡️💙⚡️
And that is my Two Bolts and a Heart for you all for now. Thank you.
PostScript,
Just because I stated that I didn’t require massive amounts of money, that does not give Anyone any form of discourage to give or support me with money, nor does it encourage not give me any money at all. At times, I will ask for money for the minimum essentials I may require until such a time when I can manage better for myself, financially. But until then, I would very much appreciate the continued kindness and generous contributions (in Dollars; not one cent or cents; among which, I would very much like money for a current, present model car; I’m just saying for now). Please, and Thank you, again.
Friendliness Tarot card

Age progression

Age progression. Childhood, teenage, early adulthood, and middle adulthood.
Fair and good. A couple of pointers: Young Christopher eyes were Both Blue; no heterochromia Yet. Second, adulthood Christian didn’t have boobs. And between both him and me at present, our face shape is the same as Teenage Chris Chan. Thank you for sharing.
It's worth noting that this is actually false; Chris convinced himself that his heterochromia was caused by a pinkeye infection, which is impossible - old photos show that he always had it.
And None of that aged look on my present face, either, please.

I can personally recommend this one from @Energizer; it is really bright on max, and has a dimmer light, as well as a night light setting; runs on four D batteries.
It really helped Barbie Chan and I when were going through the house and sorting out things after the house fire of '14.

Schizophrenia Tarot card
23 June
The One card I drew for the Collective today is Schizophrenia. Essentially, Follow your heart and instincts today. A bunch of you are feeling conflicted between two choices/situations; when overwhelmed, choose the third option and just follow your heart where it will
guide you.
For myself, however, I drew “We Are The World”; I’m not consciously, subconsciously or unconsciously as befuddled today, but I display the image alongside this card today to affirm that I am by your side and will guide you safe as well. All you need to do when feeling in such major doubt(s) is follow your heart and instinct. Or if you’re feeling unable to, call on me in a prayer, and I will guide you.
Also feeling like this is a good time to mention #RichardKelly and #DonnieDarko; that flowing liquid that flows out of your core area between your heart chakra and solar plexus in the void. I can tell you all that guiding soul path is a thing, and when I’m feeling uncertain or need a reminder of what’s next on my path, I put my hand over my core, incidentally is also where our respective Heart Crystals are located; I look into my path and see the vision of the path ahead and anything incoming within it.
This also does correlate with “Follow” and “Open your Heart”, because you are looking within the heart area. There’s your insight and lesson on following your heart; heed this (re)new(ed) knowledge and insight and prosper as you will. Lots of Love. 😊⚡️💙⚡️

@CPU_CWCSonichu Hey there Christine! Long Time Fan here. I was just curious as if Barb was ok? We haven't seen her in a while and some confirmation would make me happy, thanks.
Barbie Chan is quite all right, healthy and well, I assure you.
Chris quote tweets his reply in a new tweet.
Just a let-y’all-know, here, in general. Y’all have likely noticed me referring to Barbara as Barbie Chan. During this time, unless she says otherwise, I am the only one who has been entrusted to call her Barbie. Everyone else, please, refer to her as Barbara.
She does not like being called Barb; she told me this recently. I've been on the fence about "Barb", as it can also be in reference to barb wire or shit. So, please, Everyone; respect and appreciation for Barbara. Thank you. ⚡️💙⚡️

Schizophrenia Tarot card again
24 June
Chris quote tweets his earlier tweet about the Schizophrenia Tarot card.
Such a rarity, but meaningful; today, I drew Schizophrenia for the Collective again. My basic two bolts and a heart on this is that either y’all Still have conflicting issues to be heart and instinct-guided away from, or y’all are getting these types of situations in multiples.
I quoted my tweet from yesterday, so y’all can still have the run-down.
As for news for today, the spirits are telling me all of you Are being filled with the energy of the present #strawberrysupermoon that is happening today; some are being rejecting of this energy.
I encourage all of you to accept this energy, transition, and transformation for yourselves. Others, including the people of @MoonOmens and #1111divinelight1111 on @instagram, have the details of this Supermoon better chronicled and stated. Give them a look for yourselves. ⚡️💙⚡️

Hey, everyone. Let’s talk a bit about Conventions, in response to page 185 of #WarholChrisChan. I’ve hand-written what Really has made interaction more genuinely easier for me over the years. Major Props to @BronyCon, and looking forward to the next in-person @BABSCon as well.
@MAGFest; most lovely and vibing Saturday that was. The local @OmegaConVA (looking at their Twitter; are they still doing the conventions here now?) has much room for vibe improvement. But props for hosting the dancing classes that one year before BronyCon ‘17.
Worst Con in my eyes at this point; Majorly Sorry, @TooManyGames, BUT if you all had Not pulled that Vicious, Trolling Setup/Trap, your convention could have been my 3rd or 2nd Favourite. You’ve Majorly shot yourselves in more than just your own feet with that stunt. ❤️‍🩹

Possibilities Tarot card
25 June
Hey, y’all. Today’s card for the collective is Possibilities. The past two days saw everyone not only work with the energy of the Strawberry Supermoon, but also being felt forced into choosing between multiple choices and encouraged to follow
their heart and instinct, instead.
Having been freed of these inner and outer struggles after finding greater appreciation for your core path, heart, and instincts, and the Supermoon energy to boot; all of you now have a sense of freedom to enjoy; explore the possibilities throughout for your individual locals; outward and inward towards a better you. Lots of love and safety for the day.

Chris blames the TooManyGames incident on the trolls again
25 June
💫BABULS💫 (@BabulsArt)
Babuls quote tweets the previous tweets regarding conventions and TooManyGames.
[Artwork of an OC telling a Chris Chan Sonichu using Twitter that he can't retcon real life events, and that he needs to start thinking about his real life future]
I was not retconning when I talked of the conventions; these were the points of fact from my feeling of the conventions during each time. AND I did feel the vibes and energy over the years. The flaw I blame is not fully recognizing and appreciating my better instincts sooner.
You try to retcon what happened at TMG.
Nobody set you up, you made a mistake kissing strangers and should own up to it.
I did make the mistake of expressing my appreciation too far at the time; I have learned from that. BUT, again, I know very well that I was constantly being observed by the Trolls and haters, and they, at the time, were looking for Anything to pin me down for. Also, Major Observation I still remember very well, the host of the convention messaged me through freaking @Facebook; soo Indirect, especially when he could have had an easier, more direct, communication by TEXTING me, or better yet, pull me over, personally, and warn me, but you know what?
He Did NOT do that at all. I had no Proper Warning or notification that this was wrong. I psychically Know he was in with the haters at the time, and so he half-assed the “warning”, adding that detail to the Set Up against me.

For context, EverFree Northwest is a My Little Pony convention that takes place in Bellevue, Washington State. Keep in mind that Washington is over 2,700 miles away from Virginia.

Chris get help. Like for real. You are not a trans lesbain and you do not interdimensional travel. You are a 40 year old man child. Please get help.
Your toxic vibes do not serve me, and therefore I reflect them back to you. I am not going back to immaturity. I feel sorry for you that my enlightenment and ascension is what you lack for yourself. Meditate on that. ⚡️💙⚡️

You are the one that believes your married to mewtwo and your made up characters. I hold a job down. I pay my bills. I own my house. Tell me again who is immature?

Comparison Tarot card
27 June
Hey, y’all. The Collective’s card for today is Comparison. This card signifies a reminder that we are ultimately not to compare ourselves with others, but to compare ourselves with our selves and our respective individual successes in our endeavours. In this instance,
all of you have had the time and trials to identify, appreciate, release the toxic, and so forth of all of your successes in life so far. You can even majorly count the success of how deeply all of you each have been internally exploring deep and healing yourselves. I will summarize this with the simple reminder that is obvious: Count Your Blessings. ⚡️💙⚡️
@MediumMolly may or may not perform her usual forecast for the week, but it remains advised to stay tuned, nonetheless.
Magi-Chan

In response to a Twitter artist posting artwork of an anthropomorphic shark hugging a human while saying "This is MY human! Go get your own!"

Getting retweeted by dunking on people was still seen as pretty novel and popular at that time, so they might have just tee’d up the shot thinking I would take it.
I quite concur; inciting Quote-Tweets on such a massive scale by inkling that intention for pure attention and needless chaos-striking in the public is most callous.
This is definitely the type of thing I feel better avoiding. I mainly only quote or retweet should the original tweet genuinely resonate with a mutual feeling, as well as its intention energy vibrating as true and not false or exaggerated. I have made my erroneous quote, retweet, or comment in the past unintentionally instilling that chaos, because I had not appreciated my better instincts and insight years ago. ⚡️💙⚡️

This is why I prefer screenshots unless it's a special circumstance.
As I have just quoted and commented with the root tweet thread and its owner, I most certainly agree, Chip.

Chris on racism
28 June
Another topic mentioned in Chapter Six of #WarholChrisChan I feel I need to personally readdress and talk a bit further about: the “Racism”.
I realize, understand, and appreciate how (some of) you all may have (mis)interpreted this of me, once upon a time, so to begin, to clarify: in my youth and development years, as Don had stated well, at times I was rather dumb and not aware of things going on outside of the present tasks at hand in schooling and whatnot. I personally verify that racism was discouraged in the Greene County Schools. And I actually had a few black friends and classmates growing up; I never judged or saw them any different. Even Mister C., my dad, had a bunch of black people who were his friends. He appreciated the Soul and the Personalities of these individuals, as did I. But, in shows over the years that had a main cast of black people, such as #FatAlbert, #TheJeffersons, #SanfordandSon, and even, Yes, #BillCosby. I enjoyed watching #PicturePages as a child while it aired on @Nickelodeon back in the day. I never really had Anything against black peoples. On the related subject, going a few years ahead to @PiedmontVaCC, the infamous #LoveQuest; I had nothing against black women, either. I did have girl and women friends who were black over the years.
The reason Why I was quite reluctant for wanting a black girlfriend, is because I could never ever really (fore)see myself with one as a sweetheart. Plus, there were heightened aggression that can happen that I did not feel comfortable tolerating that were sometimes, but Not stereotypical, of black women. I felt at unease; the vibe was off in even trying to see that concept.
Alternatively, I do have a good time chillin’, talking, and hanging out with black men and women. Even hanging out with some who were my fans who liked me. That was a lovely time during that year at @BronyCon. Not wanting a black individual as a partner was a Choice. I Chose to accept and appreciate that I was not destined long-term to be beyond friends with black individuals.
I was and am not closed-minded to the idea and prospect that I have witnessed in interracial couples of all identities over the years. I like and appreciate the black folks and their rich, deep, even the painful, and the soulful history, and how they have progressed and stood up when they woke and found themselves long ago. Seeing that example continue to this day is beautiful. And I support their rights as individuals and freedom to do as they wish and choose in their lives, like the majority of the remaining individuals on the Earths.
Also, to observe, that time I sang Unckle Ruckus’ song from #TheBoondocks; I was still finding myself, and my mindset back then was still not as swift, because of my outdated views on men, in general. When I sang that song, I was literally doing a parody, and at the same time venting frustration against the Haters and Fakers who were bothering me back then. If I could, I would change that song to “Don’t Trust Them Haters Over There”.
I have mentally grown more over the years, and I have learned from my faults and mistakes.
And with that, I end this with a simple #BlackLivesMatter, and I send good vibes and love to all of you. Thank you all. ⚡️💙⚡️

Past lives Tarot card
29 June
¡Buenas Días a Todos! 😊⚡️
Today’s card for the collective is Past Lives. A good sign, indeed, as a lot of you are finding your deepest intelligence in your past lives, between the two metaphorical rainbow lizards of Knowing and Unknowing. Finding out how old each of you
are in spirit and what you each have accomplished. Even the youngest souls who may or may not have extensive amounts of past lives. I mean, with the population increases, of course New, Young Souls are amongst the neurotypical flock. Learn and Memorize as best as each of you all can and will from your deepest long-memorized insight, knowledge, and wisdom. This will be very important later on, as in There Will Be A Test for each of you all; similar to Twilight Sparkle’s test when she helped the Crystal Empire.

The Spanish roughly translates to "Good morning everybody!"

Also, so y’all know, I have a rainbow of highlighters, each specified within the false-true range, and then some. Pay Attention.
Identifying card

Not death but Slime. This #chrischan #tarot card is inspired by the events of slime and punishment. @CPU_CWCSonichu @ItsAllSoUgly

This is a really identifying card; if I had to pick one of the original Tarot cards to compare this with, it would have to be The Devil, as it deals with Recognizing Your Bondage (not to go BDSM). Essentially becoming aware of those that are greatly holding you back from achieving your greater potential and finding yourself. This also brings to mind from the Osho Zen deck The Burden, which presents the similar message. Definitely more of a major Burden than a Devil, this card is representative of.

30 June
