================================================================================

"Lovin' You" is the sixth track from the second album of Chris's cruddy musical project, Christian and the Hedgehog Boys COMEBACK!. This song was also played on the video Chris Sings Lovin' You.
In this song, Chris attempts to do an a cappella cover of "Lovin' You" by Minnie Riperton. However, due to a lack of practice, sheer laziness... or both, Chris gets the tune completely wrong. Some have even stated his vocals on here are "like a dying animal", which is far from off the mark.

Lyrics
Loving you...is easy...'cuz you're beautiful
Makin' lovin' you is all I want to do
Lovin' you...is more'n just a dream come true
And everything I do...is out of lovin' you
La la la la la...doot doo-doo da-doo
No one else...can make me feel...
The colors that you bring
Stay with me...while we grow old
Eh, we will live each day in the springtime
'Cuz lovin' you has made my life so beautiful
And every day my life is filled with lovin' you
Lovin' yoooouuu, I see your soul come shinin' through
Every tiiime, that weeeooooo [This note suddenly drops down as if Chris had a stroke]...I'm more in love with you
