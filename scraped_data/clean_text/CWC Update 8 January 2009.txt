================================================================================

"CWC Update 8 January 2009" (officially "CWC Update 010808" — yes, Chris seemingly failed to note the new year) is a video in which Christian issues a statement announcing the hacking of sonichu.net by Gregg Mays, demanding that the site be restored. Other than that, very little in this message makes sense: Christian seems to say that he forced someone to fix the site, but still needs Gregg Mays to do something; he threatens to elicit the help of Jay Z but then questions whether this same person is a troll; and he declares his willingness to show his fangs.

Sonichu.net, in my case, is under slow recovery from Gregg Mays' attack on it; some files may be misplaced among my zip discs and HDD, but I'll have it all fully recovered as soon as I am capable.
But, BUG THE HECK out of him to at least confess to me that he's a troll, and to restore the missing files on Sonichu.net.
This video will not be deleted after the Sonichu.net has been fully restored.

Chris's lawyer, unbeknownst to him.
Captain's Log, January 8th, 2009. [inhales deeply]
Ladies and gentlemen of the Sonichu fan base: unfortunately, due to, uh… a troll having, uh, found access to the, uh… database behind sonichu.net, it is temporary shut down, and, uh, I cannot change the password at the moment. But, uh, apparently, the, uh, guy said that, uh, he can re—he can fix it, so… I pretty much forced him to do it, so… y’know....
Gregg Mayyys! Gregg Mays! At gmail.com! With three Gs. In the “Gregg”.
[groans] If you do not re-upload sonichu.net… back to the way it was… before you even started… I will come down at you… with my boys from Nintendo and my big—and my lawyer man from the… big—and my lawyer man from Nintendo, Jay Z… [assumes B-boy stance] he gonna come down with his boys from Nintendo and the boys at Sega! They gonna rain d—they gonna track you down. We're gonna punish you for what you did if you don't bring that—bring my website back up to the way it was!
Jay Z, if you were the—one of the trolls that wanted a response… you're gettin' it, so just listen to me, ya jerk! Re-upload it! Or we're gonna rain heckle on you, ’cause I'm not afraid to… [moves very uncomfortably close to the camera for a canine close-up]
SHOW MY FANGS!
[returns to seat and sighs] But I digress...
Peace and love to all the rest of the Son—all the rest of the loyal Sonichu and Rosechu fans. Thank you for your patience.
