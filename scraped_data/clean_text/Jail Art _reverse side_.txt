================================================================================

While in Central Virginia Regional Jail, Chris drew jail art as commissions for customers or for Praetor to sell online. Some customers have noticed that the reverse side of the art has titles of the art piece, or an Artist's Note by Chris explaining his thought process with the art.
Customers have also noticed that, since the jail art was drawn on the backs of official CVRJ paperwork, the reverse side of the art contains information such as Chris's account balance. Sometimes the information was scribbled over with pen, but still remain legible.

An Honest Self-Portrait from June, 2021
Artist's Notes: I've pondered how to properly draw the self-portrait of Barbara upon receiving the commission description recently. I've opted for an Honest piece reflecting past-tense emotions that were still present. I had foreknown of mine and Barbara's separation two months, less than, later and the betrayal circumstances. But, essentially, regardless of her past emotional manipulations and whatnot, I still cared and had patience when it came to tending to her care. Yet I could not escape emotions that she and I had already were drifting apart. And that had become more clear over the past year with her worsening handicaps and lethargy. I've realized, despite my efforts with her, she had become an emotional burden even moreso than before and was holding me back. But ultimately, to return to better progress, work and life, I have had to make the hard emotional choice to let her go. I've wept while writing this.
Mrs. Jesus Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu.

Artist's Note
Wedded Schultzes
Wedded Schultzes is a piece of jail art Chris drew on 29 June 2022. The drawing was accompanied by an artist note, written on a piece of paper which was a receipt showing Chris's commissary balance. The information pertaining to the commissary had been scratched out with pen, but still remain visible.
The image shows Christine Chan Sonichu performing a wedding, saying "Bless this true and honest union of Alex-chan and Jenni-chan!" Sonichu and Rosechu are witnesses. Alex and Jenni appear to be much taller than the other Electric Hedgehog Pokémon.
Notes
The heading reads

On 05/31/2022, Chris purchased six Popcorn ($.90 each for a total of $5.40) and one Natural Fiber ($9.95), an anti-constipation supplement.
Chris's balance after the purchases is unclear due to the scribbling which seems to read $468.15.

Artists Note: For Reference, more than 99% of ALL Sonichus and Rosechus are standing at 3 feet 5 inches (not counting the ears. TALL Sonichus and/or Rosechus are Uber Rare, and thinking of the scale in height, even while levitating myself in the event, was a bit of a headache. Anyway. Bless you both, I do. Be happy, safe, and well with love.

Goddess At Work
Goddess At Work is a piece of jail art dated 18 July 2022. It was uploaded to a previously little-known DeviantART account on 23 August 2023. It is apparently drawn on the back of a receipt for medicine rendered at a medical location while he was incarcerated. The bottom portion appears to be two handwritten notes; the left side hints at his eventual return to the Sonichu Temple. The right side appears to be instructions for cards in his TSSSF.

Angelica Rosechu's Christmas Play
In some of drawings from the Angelica Rosechu's Christmas Play videos, using artwork made while Chris was jailed, circa winter 2022, but filmed after his release, the information from the reverse side can be faintly seen. A Kiwi Farms user identified some examples.[3] Some appear to drawn on the back of paperwork of Chris's bills and an Insider news article about the Affair with Mother.
