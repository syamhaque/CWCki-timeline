Praetor's Etsy account, confirming that the products being shipped will be dogshit, even by Chris's standards.
OfficialCWCmart is an Etsy storefront created by Praetor, who are partnered with Chris to sell items.
The store was originally operated by an account named "Praetor";[1] the account name was changed to "Christine Chandler"[2] in 2023 after Chris's release from Central Virginia Regional Jail.
Chris has, or at least had, access to the account, as seen in some of the Etsy Comments Review videos which show him logged into it. At least one member of Praetor appears to also still have access as of August 2024
- a response to a customer's negative review was left which referred to Christine in the third person.[3] Many users have also reported either being ghosted or getting a reply from someone other than Chris while trying to contact Christine via the Etsy seller contacting option.
Below are listings which have appeared on the shop.

Price: $25 (sold out)[4]

If you have bought a medallion from any place other than Chris Chan, now you have the chance to actually buy the only official personally approved medallions. These are the first run of the mass-produced Christine Weston Chandler medallions. Limited quantity; order now!
(Editor's Note: All descriptions, titles, and product designs come directly from Chris Chan. These are hand done, and will therefore reflect the "Chris Chan Style." Expect defects, burns, and a general lapse in quality.)
Chris advertised the run on Twitter on 11 December 2020.[5] The medallions are of a much worse quality than those produced only by Chris, and have received backlash from weens and concerned fans. Chris told them to count their blessings and assured them they will be of high quality, despite the page selling the medallions stating that "these are hand done, and will therefore reflect the "Chris Chan Style." Expect defects, burns, and a general lapse in quality."

Official Chris Chan Sonichu Medallion (Final Run) (2nd run)
Listed: 11 May 2022[10]
Price $40 (sold out)
After Christine Chandler's arrest, the store was closed and all remaining merchandise was put in storage either within the Chandler residence or within a rented storage cube. While the waters calmed, there the medallions sat. Waiting.
After much conversation with Christine, these medallions have been brought back to be sold, taken off our hands and hearts. Until the point that Christine is released or made publicly accessible again, no others will be produced. These are the last ones.
Below is a small recorded message from Christine endorsing these medallions.

God be with ye in these trying times.
Sonichu Medallion, Handmade by CWC (1st run)
Listed: 4 May 2022;[11][12] relisted 16 September 2023[13]
Price: $70 (4 May 2022); $85 (16 September 2023)
In contrast to the regular medallions, these medallions were apparently made by Chris. The medallions are of a noticeably different style compared to their cheaper counterparts and are adorned with Chris's signature on the back, so their description may very well be truthful.
A handcrafted medallion was included with each purchase of "Golden Church of Sonichu Cult Robes." The robes came in two sizes. Red robes were large, while blue robes were extra large. No smaller sizes were offered, as "Golden Church members were assumed to be naturally, uh, large people."[14] A yellow mask with red Sonichu-style cheeks was also bundled with each robe.
A handmade and autographed medallion by Christine Chandler herself.
These were made in a matter of only a couple months before the arrest. In preparation for the release of a Chris Chan twitch channel and the eventual release of a new comic we had gotten him to begin making, these medallions were meant to be a new wave of merch. Unfortunately, both the channel and comic were promptly cut short for obvious reasons.
Below is a link to a recorded part of a phone call with CWC, endorsing said medallions. [links to Sonichu Medallion, Handmade by CWC audio]
Getting Christine to make new medallions was very difficult. This effort will not be wasted. Buy one today, and receive enlightenment.
In a later relisting, Praetor noted:[13]
(NOTE: Christine Chandler packed the majority of these herself. Multiple reviews have mentioned finding hairs/odd smells on packages. We cannot guarantee whether your package will be ever truly sanitary, as we do not open them to preserve Christine's products best as possible. Enjoy your extra flavor bits.)
Megastone Medallions, made by CWC
Listed: 17 May 2022
Price: $115 (sold out)[15]
The most expensive of the medallions, the megastone medallions were a variant of the handcrafted medallions. In addition to being signed by Chris, the back of the medallions contained a "megastone" which Chris verbally claimed to "have personally blessed and programmed each and every one of." As such, wearers could "really […] feel the spiritual aura and charge and vibrations within."
These medallions are much like the standard medallions Chris Chan made, with the addition of a Megastone for channeling power in their backs. This makes them nearly identical to the original Sonichu Medallion worn by Christine, and very unique in this fashion.

Golden Church of Sonichu Medallion (2nd run)
Listed: 28 April 2022
Price: $100 (sold out)[16]
After Chris was arrested, the Golden Church of Sonichu Discord server became inactive. A second wave of Golden Sonichu Medallions, this time unsigned and not created by Chris, were listed in 2022. These golden medallions did not come with a code to join the Discord, but still came with a printed Certificate of Authentication.
The Golden Medallion, featuring:
-Autographed Golden Sonichu Medallion
-Autographed Certificate of Authentication, straight from the printer of Christine Chandler herself
This is the last of the golden medallions. After Christine's arrest, all extra merchandise from the store was put in storage either at the Chandler Residence or in a local storage rental shed. As the waters have quieted lately, we've brought what we have left out of hiding. The end of an era.
NOTE: When the Golden Medallions were first introduced, they functioned as a ticket into Christine's Golden Sonichu Discord, the beginnings of her attempt at crowdfunding an actual church. This is no longer the case.
Golden Sonichu Medallion with Autograph (2nd run)
Listed: 7 January 2023;[17] relisted 5 October 2023[18]
Price: $60 (sold out)
After Chris was arrested, the Golden Church of Sonichu Discord server became inactive. A second wave of Golden Sonichu Medallions, this time unsigned and not created by Chris, were listed in 2022. These golden medallions did not come with a code to join the Discord, but still came with a printed Certificate of Authentication.
This is a new run of Golden Church of Sonichu Medallions, mass produced under Christine's direction for the Etsy store. Fans may remember that before the Jail Saga Chris sold these medallions as a means to enter his private discord, the Golden Church of Sonichu. As his views on his universe grew more theocratic he began to push to have his followers take a more reverent tone with him, hence the religious name.
To raise funds for important spiritual icons like Discord Nitro, Golden Medallions were sold with numbers and autographs on them. Buyers could send the numbered code into our email to get a link to Christine's discord church. After the arrest the Discord was abandoned, and obviously no longer included Christine.
As such no medallions sold will gain access to the discord. However, each still comes with a signed authentication certificate from Christine. These were printed and signed by her in bulk, as they are meant to supplement multiple kinds of merchandise.
[PACKAGE INCLUDES]
-One unsigned Golden Medallion
-One autographed authentication certificate
Jail Art
Main article: OfficialCWCmart Jail Art
Chris has created original drawings during his stay in jail and given them to Praetor to sell, beginning in early 2022. Chris continued to send art to Praetor even after his case was sealed in August 2022, making them the only outside individuals with whom he has had confirmed contact since then. However, Chris has not sent out any new drawings since 26 November 2022.
Golden Church of Sonichu Cult Robe
Listed: 25 March 2022
Price: $100 (sold out)[19][20]
Options: [RED, LARGE], [BLUE, EXTRA LARGE]
Before Christine's arrest, she requested that robes be purchased to make her a more regal outfit befitting her human form. We naturally enthusiastically agreed, and set about purchasing robes that followed her very specific instructions.
She requested that red and blue robes be brought about, to match the classic CWC shirt pattern. These robes would then be sent to her most devoted followers within her Golden Church of Sonichu discord. Masks were suggested and added to the garb for follower anonymity.
Christine's personal robe was to be white, adorned with crystals and talismans. When the robes arrived, they had incredibly pointed hoods as can be seen in the pictures. For obvious reasons, Christine's robes were scrapped and a new design began to be debated.
When Christine was arrested, the robes were just about prepared. They had to come under storage, as followers of the Golden Church scattered like roaches. Now here they are, brought back to light.
NOTE: 1 OF EACH COLOR LEFT
-Red Robe w/hood
-Sonichu Mask
-Rope Belt
-Handmade by CWC herself, a signed Sonichu Medallion
Buy this most glorious outfit, and feel finally connected to our fallen goddess.

Chris Chan Rock Centerpiece
Listed: 30 April 2022
Price: $20 (sold out)[22]
A favorite rock from Christine Chandler's collection. Buyers will receive this stone and all of the blessings/kisses Chris bestowed upon it.

Maybe. Buy it, and see if it works its magic.
Chris Chan Taser
Listed 2 May 2022
Price $40 (sold out)[26]
Recent Christorians may recall the Taser Incident, where the Praetor group while working with Christine posted images of tasers onto their respective Instagrams and Twitters. Through leaked chats and discussion, it was hypothesized that the Praetor group was planning to tase Chris on video. This lead to a flurry of drama and doxing, and the tasers were forgotten.
The tasers had originally been intended for sale, as signed ones would be put out for purchase. To negate negative attention, they were boxed and stored away to wait until the smoke cleared. Now, these zappy little buggers are available for sale once again!
Each Taser is hand signed by Christine herself, emblazoned with her autograph and the iconic phrase "Zappin' it Up!" Per Christine's suggestion.
Now you too can zap it to the extreme. Handle with care, while these are collectables they can be recharged and may have residual charge left over.
Package comes with:
-Autographed Taser
-Charging cable
The Secret Listing

This listing was taken down earlier. This item features an authentic Chandler autograph, but we cannot go into detail due to Etsy policy guidelines. For more info, please DM us here on Etsy or at llcpraetor [!at] gmail.com.
Thank you.
It was revealed in the March 2023 Praetor Interview that 'The Secret Listing' was in fact a Taser, put up as 'The Secret Listing' in hopes that Etsy wouldn't take it down.
Andy Warhol, Chris Chan: CWC signed copy
Listed 4 May 2022

Dr. Don Lashomb writes this compelling novel, comparing artist Andy Warhol and visionary Christine Chandler. The parallels between them become uncanny.

Chris Chan Signed Certificate and Sonic Gfuel
Listed 29 August 2022
Price $20 (sold out)[29]
Before Christine's arrest, the idea of selling a Chris Chan soda was tossed around. Chris came up with several flavors and ideas, even pitching a love potion of sorts involving spring water and hunks of easily digestible rose quartz. The most easily sellable idea we pitched back was "Cremé de Fanta", a tongue in cheek soda which would be poured into wine bottles, corked, labelled, and sold.
The recipe was Orange Fanta, Sonic Gfuel, Non-dairy cream, and a little flavorless gelatin powder for a more authentic consistency. We're sure you get the idea here.
After the arrest, much like most of the items we were prepping for sale this delicious beverage was scrapped. We now bring you some of the many cans kept in storage at Christine's home for the mixing of our drinks. Along with this we are including a pre-signed authentication certificate made by Christine.
NOTE: CANS ARE SEALED AND NOT SIGNED. ONLY CERTIFICATES ARE SIGNED, ONE CERTIFICATE PER CAN, ONE CAN PER PURCHASE
