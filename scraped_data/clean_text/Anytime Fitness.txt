The Idea Guys were here.
Chris was brainwashed into believing that he needed to get fit while in CWCville.
A fan spotted him at the gym and snapped his photo.
Exercising on a treadmill at the gym.
Anytime Fitness is a chain of gyms operating in the United States.
Chris purchased a membership for the gym and began attending it in spring 2018. He was manipulated into doing so by the Idea Guys, who told him he would need to be in shape while in CWCville.[1] In April 2018, Chris uploaded One-Hundred!, a video of him working out in his bedroom with actual dumbbells of 20 pounds each, instead of lemonade boxes. He followed up by taking a selfie at an Anytime Fitness gym of him on a treadmill "speed walking 4 mph for two hours".[2]
A couple of weeks after the treadmill update, Chris was cocky enough about his new lifestyle change to use a put-down of telling other people they could stand to go to the gym to lose weight.[3]
You are now Blocked. Before continuing to insult me whenever possible you should consider Going to the Gym Yourself, as I feel YOU could stand to Lose Some Weight!
On 7 May, Chris lamented the fact that weens had been calling up the gym to harass management about him:
You Jerks and Trolls ruin EVERYTHING! I CAN'T EVEN GO TO THE GYM WITHOUT YOU HARASSING THE GYM THAT I GO TO![4]
Later, LoveYouLongTime shared information that Chris had been banned:
Chris was legitimately getting complaints from fellow gym goers regarding being gassy and burping a whole lot. So he already had a strike against him for that, then couple that with people calling them inevitably got him banned.[5]
In the Copitz interview, Chris claimed that he had only been banned from the Ruckersville location and was still regularly going to another undisclosed location in the Charlottesville area.
