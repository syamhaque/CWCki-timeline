Title: BFF's (Best Friends Forever)

================================================================================

"BFF's (Best Friends Forever)" is the fourth track off the Christian and the Hedgehog Boys album. It is sung over "If Only Tears Could Bring You Back" by Midnight Sons, an obscure Norwegian pop group known mostly for contributing said song to the Pokémon: The First Movie soundtrack.
The girl of whom Chris speaks appears to be Sarah Hammer, while her boyfriend is probably Wes Iseli.[1] The lyrics are quite passive-aggressive (Are you too busy to hang / With an old friend / That's been with you forever?), with Chris trying to spin Sarah's friendship with him as one in which she genuinely enjoyed his company, and didn't just play with him only out of a sense of duty or pity.

Lyrics
[sung over Midnight Sons' "If Only Tears Could Bring You Back"]
It took me a while
But I have realized that you
Are the one that can
Soothe my loneliness
Is it too late?
Are you too busy to hang
With an old friend
That's been with you forever?
What would I do?
I feel very lonesome without you
You are my best friend
I can never seem to find you
If only I could keep up with you
How far I would run, what I would do if you
Went with me for a thing
Sometime, somewhere
'Cause from birth to now we are
BFFs
You hang out with your
New friends you made and
Your boyfriend who acts
As a Black Sonichu
It is your choice to
Go with them instead of me
Soon you'll realize that
You're not complete because
I am not there
To share your joy as we did long ago
Old friend
I can never seem to find you
If only I could keep up with you
How far I would run, what I would do if you
Went with me for a thing
Sometime, somewhere
'Cause from birth to now we are
BFFs
If you were there to
Help guide our lives
I only wish that we could shine it up again
'Cause I have no one else
To shine it up again
Best friend
I can never seem to find you
If only I could keep up with you
How far I would run, what I would do if you
Went with me for a thing
Sometime, somewhere
'Cause from birth to now we are
BFFs
Notes
↑ While no names are mentioned in the song, the girl Chris is singing about shares many parallels with Sarah Hammer. In Chris + Sarah's Life-Shares we are told that she too knew Chris from a young age and that despite his wishes, she spent little time with him during her adult years. Likewise, Iseli is depicted in Chris + Sarah's Life-Shares as Black Sonichu.
