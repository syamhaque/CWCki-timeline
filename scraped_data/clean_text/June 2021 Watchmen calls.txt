“
No, dude, I didn't dox you.
”
Naught, lying to The WCT about having posted his dox on Kiwi Farms.
During June 2021, two Watchmen calls took place. The content of the calls, chiefly The WCT's allegation of being doxed on Kiwi Farms by fellow Watchman Naught, would result in Chris cutting ties with three Watchmen members - Naught, Kyle and MKR - and a restructuring of the Watchmen group as Chris would leave their Discord server The Place and join a splinter Discord server The Knights of CWC set up by WCT.

Movie Night Confrontation
Participants in this chat were Watchmen members The WCT, Naught, Kyle, and MKR. Chris was not present during the chat.
During the group's movie night, in which they selected Hitler: the Rise of Evil to watch, The WCT confronted Naught, alleging that Naught posted his dox on Kiwi Farms. Naught denied the allegation - months later, he would admit to having doxed WCT for declining to share his Kiwi Farms account with him.[1][2] Despite being an admin in the Watchmen's Discord server The Place, Kyle was more concerned with watching the movie than WCT's allegation, saying to "Shut up and watch the damn movie."

Pre-Jail Interview
Participants in this chat were The WCT and Chris, which took place on 25 June,[3] The audio was uploaded by The WCT on his YouTube channel on 3 August 2021 under the clickbait title The final pre-jail interview with Chris Chan;[4] he later deleted his YouTube channel though a copy of the call was archived.
The conversation begins with WCT and Chris each talking about their day. WCT then asks Chris how he feels about Naught, Kyle and MKR, to which Chris answers that he has been distant from them as of late. WCT then begins to tell Chris about his suspicion that Naught had doxed him on Kiwi Farms. He shares with Chris multiple screenshots of Naught’s postings and audio files of Naught denying doxing WCT. Chris believes WCT's assertion that Naught is lying.
WCT then alleges that behind the scenes, the Watchmen group had been infighting among its various members
and, including himself, had been making fun of the Praetor group, claiming that Kyle and MKR had taken it to another level. Chris reacts with anger at the claim. At one point in the call, WCT also alleges that the Watchmen member Naught was also one of the people that Chris had talked to in his Mumble chats, declaring him as being one of the Miscreants.
WCT then asks Chris about his opinions regarding Watchmen as a group, and begins to influence Chris into believing he should leave the Watchmen’s Discord server The Place and join his splinter server (which would later be named The Knights of CWC). He pushes the idea that Chris should be free from Naught, Kyle and MKR’s oversight and make his own decisions over his activities and who to associate with.
Continuing with his campaign to convince Chris to distance from Naught, Kyle and MKR, WCT sends Chris the full audio of the 21 June call and claims Naught, Kyle and MKR are racist. He also tells Chris of the second layer in The Place. He tells Chris not to talk to the three, saying they will try to manipulate him.
WCT goads Chris to say “Fuck Bismuth!” (a pseudonym of Naught’s) to release the clip publicly. Chris hesitates as he felt Bismuth had room for improvement. WCT again goes off on his spat with Naught and Chris then agrees to say “Fuck Bismuth!”
