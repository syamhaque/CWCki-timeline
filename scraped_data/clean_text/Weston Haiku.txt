The haiku.
The Weston Haiku was a Haiku written by Chris to remember the birth order of Barb and her seven siblings. Chris posted the haiku onto the Knights of CWC server on 29 July 2021, the last day before the storm in Christory. When he posts it, Anaxis commented on how many siblings Barb had.
The Chat
Chris 09:21 AM
Good morning, everyone.
I have an inspired bit of poetry to share.
I am reminded of Barbara’s big family, as she is child number five out of eight children of the Weston household from Red Oak, Virginia.
The oldest to youngest are as follows: Edna, Stanley, Corina, Leroy, Barbara, Harriet, Madeline, and Wayne.
And to also help remember this very order, I am inspired to manifest a Haiku.

That's a lot of siblings!
Analysis
Anaxis then noted in the second layer of the Knights server that Chris had swapped the positions of Harriet and Madeline according to the Weston family tree, and that Chris had referred to many of the siblings by their middle names rather than their first names. Anaxis speculated that this might have been a quirk of Barb's that Chris had picked up on.

According to the Weston family tree, Harriet and Madeline should be switched. Also, a lot of these people are referred to by their middle names by Chris rather than their legal first names. A quirk of Barb's, perhaps?
