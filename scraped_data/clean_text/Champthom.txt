“
Cogsdev and me are complete opposites, my dude.
”
Champthom after being confused for Cogsdev.[1]
Champthom (often nicknamed Champ) was one of the original admins of the CWCki, as well as the original owner of the CWCki Forums before passing ownership of it onto Null and having it rebranded as the Kiwi Farms.
Champthom is best described as being one of Chris's "behind-the-scenes" trolls, having a relatively minor presence compared to the other classic era trolls, but being an integral member of the Miscreants all the same. Champthom was a highly active member of the now defunct PVCC forums, where many of the trolling plans from the Miscreants were discussed.
However, Champthom also interacted with Chris some times, being the person behind the Ignatius J. Reilly persona,[2] and speaking with him several times in IRC chats. Champthom was also the namesake of Champ, one of Ivy's two pet hermit crabs.
Mimms and Lucas Q&A
Main article: Mimms and Lucas Q&A
Champthom had set up a Q&A on PVCC, where Mimms and Lucas were interviewed about their experiences with Chris at The GAMe PLACe. To accomplish this, he reached out to Mimms via Facebook, asking him questions about Chris's behavior at the store, his relations with Megan Schroeder, and whether he tried to play with his homemade cards.
