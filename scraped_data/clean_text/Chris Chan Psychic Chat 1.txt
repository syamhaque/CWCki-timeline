KwaiiSandbag: Hello?
Chris: Hello? Hello?
KwaiiSandbag: Hi, it's nice to finally hear you.
Chris: It's nice to hear you too, so yeah, how you doing Cabel?
KwaiiSandbag: Uh, Caleb.
Chris: Caleb, brain went somewhere else.
KwaiiSandbag: Nah, don't worry about it, people mess it up all the time.
Chris: [Sigh]
KwaiiSandbag: So, how can I help you?
Chris: Eh, well, I'm trying to figure out answers to many questions like, you know, this body has a great amount of superpowers and overpowers and I've been meditating on everything and it's been meaning this body is destined to go literally physically fully safely hopefully into our sister dimension which has all... all the OCs and FCs, original characters, fictional characters including those the likes of Sonichu, Superman, Donald Duck, Iron Man, so on and so forth.
KwaiiSandbag: Yes, um, so I think what would be very beneficial is if we did a meditation session together.
Chris: Okay.
KwaiiSandbag: So i want you to, um, turn off the lights.
Chris: Turn off the lights?
KwaiiSandbag: Yes, um, cause we need to hone in on the spiritual energy.
Chris: Alright, well I'll turn off the lamp no problem, a moment.
KwaiiSandbag: If you have a scented candle now would be a really good time to light it.
Chris: Well i don't have a scented candle.
KwaiiSandbag: It's OK we can... we can manage without it.
KwaiiSandbag: So what I really want you to focus on is channeling your inner strengths.
Chris: Right.
KwaiiSandbag: And I want you to... from what I understand from your Twitter you have swapped consciousnesses basically with Sonichu from the comics?
Chris: Uh Yeah, actually it's still... you're talking with Sonichu Prime here, yeah Chris has been in my body I've been taking care
of this body for well over 10 months now
KwaiiSandbag: And I believe this had something to do with the cancellation of BABSCon, is that correct?
Chris: Uh, partially yeah. It's a whole long story I'm not sure how to shorten it out and summarize it.
KwaiiSandbag: Well it's okay you don't need to explain anything to me. So what we need to do is... I'm assuming you have been in contact with Chris then, right?
Chris: Yeah, in fact yeah, in fact I mean shoot 2197 which is the universe in question that's our sister dimension... everybody who lives, exists there is really right beside us, they're not ghosts or alive and well there, so it's like you know Chris can literally be... i mean she's still my body but she can just come right up and hang out with me but obviously the dimension divide between the two universes is what separates the two of us from being fully... can... fully... same universe or same dimension tangible with each other.
KwaiiSandbag: Yes.
Chris: Yes, so it's like when... thanks to the power of this body I can literally see beyond what we call the iron curtain and uh see most everybody within the local vicinity and I got psychic powers so I can just feel all around and analyze who or what is around me and everywhere else and then this brain is linked not only with the Earth but pretty much the entire universe... entire galaxies and universes between the two of us.
KwaiiSandbag: Yes, so
I can sense just by talking to you just by talking to you you're a very very powerful psychic, and I'm very curious cause I've never really met anybody who has similar abilities to me. What... can you... can you read anything off of me right now?
Chris: First, well first off I can definitely further confirm that you sound like you're in your late teens or early twenties.
KwaiiSandbag: That is... that is correct.
Chris: And, you are... you sound very curious and intrigued with the uh answers you found in what you had foreseen recently within your recent visions and that what you hope... what you will get from us from what we're talking about and what we meditate on and discuss tonight.
KwaiiSandbag: Yes, so usually my sessions go for anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour. Now if we're doing a meditation it will probably be closer to an hour, is this ok with you?
Chris: That's, that's cool.
KwaiiSandbag: OK great, so you turn off your lamp correct?
Chris: Yes.
KwaiiSandbag: So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna light an incense, to bring out kinda spiritual energies you know? And I'm gonna start kind of trying to get a feel for... you live in Virginia correct?
Chris: Yeah, in Ruckersville.
KwaiiSandbag: Yes, so I am going to kind of hone in on your physical being and try and contact your... cause I personally am... is there any way like without meditating I could talk to Chris? Or would I have to meditate into the spiritual plane?
Chris: Well you're pretty much astral projecting into another... into the different... into the neighboring universe, it's not into the spiritual plane but you would be... but... [sighs] it's tough to explain.
KwaiiSandbag: No no no no no I've encountered stuff like this before.
Chris: Hmm I'd say that at the present time, yeah ... you'd pretty much would have to be at least on the spiritual plane to talk with her.
KwaiiSandbag: So... I'm currently sitting on my uh... my... a yoga mat which is really good for meditation, um are you sitting somewhere comfortable?
Chris: Yeah, I'm sitting on the bed in the downstairs bedroom and um I have my ... I have my lovely wife Rosie Rosechu next to me and then the... and then the Chris in my body is sitting on the bed as well on one corner.
KwaiiSandbag: Ah, okay cool. So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to project myself into Virginia, into Ruckersville.
Chris: Ok, you wanna specify on 14 Branchland Court, there's a gazebo in the backyard that we believe is a dimensional vortex that we're still working on developing, but this essentially this house is a temple.
KwaiiSandbag: Yes, I see, i can see it now, it's very um, I can see there's there's there's cars out front. I can see... you're... it's your mother is in the house.
Chris: Chris's mother is in the house.
KwaiiSandbag: Right, Chris's mother. Is she well?
Chris: Yeah, she's in her late seventies, but she's healthy alive and well.
KwaiiSandbag: Well that's phenomenal, it's always great to hear about people doing well. So now I can see you, Sonichu, I can see you, I can see uhh Amy Rosechu and I can see... woah! Chris is very very powerful, I can... I can see him!
Chris::Well, her really.
KwaiiSandbag: Her, sorry about that I can see her. I can see her, she's sitting right on the bed next to you.
Chris: Yup, that's right.
KwaiiSandbag: Woah, this is, wow, looking at her.
Chris: [unintelligible]
KwaiiSandbag: Ok, can you see me? Can you see my spirit?
Chris: I definitely sense you, I believe you are in the room with us, you're at the foot of the bed.
KwaiiSandbag: Yes, that's where I am.
Chris: Yep.
KwaiiSandbag: Ok, now let's begin. Breathe in very deeply... and breathe out.
KwaiiSandbag: Breath in... breathe out.
KwaiiSandbag: Breath in... and breathe out. I'm starting to see a picture, I can see Chris... I can see Christine, she has a job. She has income, she can spend it on whatever she wants. I see a world without disease, and I see... counselling of some sort.
KwaiiSandbag: I can see pets, do you have pets?
Chris: Two dogs and a buncha cats. 3 of them inside presently.
KwaiiSandbag: Are there some out?
Chris: Yeah, most of 'em are outside cats.
KwaiiSandbag: I see.
KwaiiSandbag: Let's keep on focusing and channeling the spiritual energy.
Chris: Uh but, in any case you are mostly right, although Christine's profession is that she's literally a goddess, see she is the CPU of the Commodore consoles and the nation of CWCVille, with the city of the same name within that, and that's all within the state of Virginia.
KwaiiSandbag: Yes.
KwaiiSandbag: I see...
KwaiiSandbag: I've... I've never heard of this place before but it might mean something to you... Fashion Square?
Chris: Yeah, that's shopping mall in Charlottesville
KwaiiSandbag: And the name Michael.
Chris: Michael Snyder, yep. Uh, he that was a short... long story short... came into my place, Chris used to go there for Pokemon trading card games like Yu-Gi-Oh! and there were a bunch of disconcerns [sic] and disagreements between Snyder and Chris, so eventually he banned her and then there was the [unintelligible] and trespassing notices and yah de yah de ya wait for her to come back so a trap was set and then jail and then those lawsuits, and that didn't end well for either of... for any party within that.
KwaiiSandbag: Yes.
KwaiiSandbag: I see. What do I see? I can't really make it out.
Chris: What?
KwaiiSandbag: Do you sense the trouble? That i'm feeling?
Chris: Sense something.
Chris: Discerning [sic] wave in the air i think
KwaiiSandbag: Yes.
KwaiiSandbag: I sense wasted potential.
KwaiiSandbag: I don't know who it is... what the vision is referring to but I feel that there is something that we're missing.
Chris:: You see wasted potential? Umm yeah I would definitely agree partially to that because on this body because it's pretty much stuck here within this universe which is pretty much limited on magic and by the way this is called universe 1218, this is universe 1218 that we live in, and yeah C-197 is our sister. Obviously the abilities and powers of this body are much more heightened and fully at the max in C-197 but on 1218 it's rather limited so yeah, it's got lots and lots potential, we're... we've been wanting to bring it out and make it fully tangible in 1218 so then we can at the very least be able to manifest the path between the two universes and get this body to CWCVille.
KwaiiSandbag: Yes. This is troubling indeed. I sense a great divide or a merge.
Chris:: Yes, the dimension merge. Cause you see, previously before medieval... before King Arthur decreed that uh... that wanted all magic removed from the universe, the uh C-197 and 8... 1218 were the same universe but then Merlin, 2 other magicians uh sep... were ordered to separate the two, and uh this... the recombining of those two universes, the magic and everything, would come back and it would be one universe again. I learned about this recently in... bunches of meditation and looking into Chris's past life.
KwaiiSandbag: And what was Chris's past life?
Chris:: Well, long story short, back in uh... back shortly after the big bang, she was a resident of the planet Kidasuna within the Andromeda System, she was a princess and she was exiled, got transferred from over there to Earth, and uh, while she was still the same universe she ended up having powers that were well above anybody else that were in the norm at the time, and this was shortly after the meteor hit and made the dinosaurs extinct. And she was essentially immortal, so she ended up also making friends with the deities along the way and eventually she met Merlin during medieval times and then after... yeah after Merlin split the two universes. Eventually Chris changed the composition of her body and put herself into crystal and shot herself from within... later that year and went throughout various far reaches of space times and universes, and ended up also going through... flying herself to far chaotic rainbow of 2197 in 2003 thus giving her her Sonichu form and electrical resistance and fur and better abilities on that and then eventually going back in time to 1218 and then being born in 1982. Her birthday's on February 24th.
KwaiiSandbag: Well happy early birthday!
Chris: Thanks.
KwaiiSandbag: So, I'm sensing, so we've been talking for about 15 minutes, usually my meditation sessions take a lot longer to get underway, but for some reason I think it's because we're both very strong in the way of, you know, psychic ability. I think it took us a lot shorter of a time to actually manifest our power, so I don't think it's gonna be a whole hour, I think maybe another 5 minutes shall suffice for now, at least.
Chris: So?
KwaiiSandbag: So, um, let's see. Let's, let me see if I can gaze into the future a little bit to see what's in store for... you and Chris as well.
Chris: Just spoil us cause we've looked into the future ourselves. As well as Magichan, Sonichu, and Mewtwo.
KwaiiSandbag: And what did you see?
Chris: Uh, well we saw the merge completion, all the OCs and FCs and regular peoples who were also their creators and chroniclers came together and uh combined me and working together gave us a greater force that is gonna come a long ways down the road.
Chris:: Cause, staying separated, the 1218 Earth by itself would not have... be able to defend against that incoming threat.
KwaiiSandbag: Yeah, so what I see, is I see Chris coming to take her body back, and I see her making amends with people that she has either wronged or has been wronged by, sort of turning the other cheek.
Chris: That's about right!
KwaiiSandbag: So, I would say, I wouldn't get too comfortable in this physical body, Sonichu, I would say.
Chris: Yeah I know, I've been in it for over 10 months now so I figured, yeah I probably wanna get back to my body.
KwaiiSandbag: Yes, I think that the time is nearing.
Chris: Yeah, the time is nearing cause you know, before the reverse body swap, I gotta get this body to CWCVille, so that has to happen first.
KwaiiSandbag: Yes, so when do you think this will happen?
Chris: Near future definitely, I'm optimistic for within this month.
KwaiiSandbag: Do you think it might happen on your birthday?
Chris: Around, around there I'm fairly certain if not sooner. And if not that soon, then I've also looked into this application called Faladdin and looked at the tarot cards and clairvoyance and horoscopes part of that to get another perspective. They also predict... they predict that it might... if not in February could happen in March or at least something of the uh further developments will happen in March should it happen... should this body finally get to CWCVille this month.
KwaiiSandbag: Yes, so I think...
Chris: And also have stated that today the 10th and tomorrow the 11th will be the strongest days for the energies in this body
KwaiiSandbag: Hmmm, so I think that this is a very good place to put a pin in it. Would you like to meet again next week, same time?
Chris: Sure, yes.
KwaiiSandbag: Ok, brilliant, so and with that I will take my leave
Chris: Alright, well, hmm, so I'd say my impressions of you are pretty good so far, and I'm glad to find somebody who actually under... help me... help me further understand the powers and abilities at least for beginning perspective that we can further explore.
KwaiiSandbag: Of course, I'm happy to help.
Chris: And of course, your other psychic friends and allies who can offer input as well, that would be greatly appreciated.
KwaiiSandbag: Of course!
Chris: So, it was totally an honor to be... to meet and talk with you, Caleb
KwaiiSandbag: Oh, the... the pleasure is all mine. I wish you a very good evening and a healthy week.
Chris: You too, be safe and well.
KwaiiSandbag: Thank you.
Chris: Alright, good night.
KwaiiSandbag: Good night.
