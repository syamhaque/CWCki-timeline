Singing "All of the Lights"
Reminiscent of the SingStar Challenge, Chris is requested to sing over a song selected by another person. Unsurprisingly, the parallels do not end there. Chris demonstrated nearly zero effort in preparing for this request; muddling the lyrics, souring the melody, and constantly fidgeting throughout the video.

A long transcript of Chris mostly singing
[Chris leans back into his chair, then awkwardly assumes an uncomfortable position.]
Hello everybody! Here's another song, by paid request!
[Chris hits a button on his PS4 controller and looks up at his out-of-shot TV. He grabs the remote, and the song All of the Lights by Kanye West featuring Rihanna and Kid Cudi starts playing. Chris weakly follows along to the lyrics of the song, fidgeting throughout the video.]
All of the lights, all the lights, all the lights, lights, lights, lights, lights
All of the lights
All of the lights
All of the lights
-the lights-here, baby
Turn 'em up extra bright, I want y'all to see this

There you go. Have a good day. Thank you.
To Shelly
A set of screenshots from Kiwi Farms user crayolasword show that Chris initially wanted to charge $10 for this video. However, after his work ethic was questioned, he made it for free, possibly so he could use it for his own advantage when he later made a Facebook post imploring any former Etsy customers to "take a good look at me in my latest video on my YouTube channel. I am feeling Very Tired..." (even though his shop got closed months ago for failing to send products).

[Chris leans back into his chair and retracts his hand from the bottom right of the frame. Throughout the video, he fidgets around, playing with his hair or moving his right hand around.]
Ahhh, hello, this is Christine Chandler coming to you from my home once again, uhh, so hey, uh, Shelly from your husband, he definitely wishes you a happy birthday and I wish you a happy birthday too. M'kay? So, you turn another year older and another year wiser... That's good. Have a good day.
[Chris leans forward and extends his hand to the bottom right of the frame.]
Happy Birthday, McKenna
Chris lazily fulfills another boring birthday request. This time, he adds flair by including his cat Lucy.
Happy Birthday, McKenna

[Chris looks at his phone, which is down in his lap. Lucy is also in his lap, her head in the corner of the frame.]
Hello McKenna, this is Christine Chandler, comin' to ya live from home, wishing you a happy birthday. I hope you have a great and safe one, and a great year.
[Chris picks up the camera and moves it so that Lucy is facing the camera. Chris speaks in a much higher pitched voice.]
Here's my cat, Lucy! Mew! She wishes you a good day, too! Don't ya, miss!
[Chris turns the camera towards himself. He speaks in his normal voice now.]
M'kay. Have a good day, McKenna.
Singing an ol' diddy
Chris sings his greatest hit, "So Need a Cute Girl", replacing the line, "I never want to hear you say, 'I have a boyfriend!'" to "I never want to hear you say, 'I'm already taken!'". Chris may have done this in order to be inclusive to dykes, thus widening the field of candidates—beyond heterosexual women—targeted by his original song. Disregarding the outrageous fact that Chris has kept the lyrics sheet of a parodic song—written on lined notebook paper by him in 2003—notice how he gazed up every time he approached the replaced line. This is likely due to his autism, which probably prevented him from looking at the original line without reading it out loud.
Notably, this is the first video appearance of the Christine Doll.
A screenshot from Kiwi Farms user AZ09199976 shows that Chris made this video for free, as compensation for having failed to deliver a medallion sold through Etsy.

A long transcript of Chris mostly singing
[Chris sits in his bedroom. He is holding a piece of paper. In front of him, from left to right, are a Rosechu Amiibo, an Equestria Girls figurine, and a Sonichu amiibo.]
Hmm. And now by, reque-[Chris snaps]-and now by special request, an ol' ditty, which I still have the handwritten lyrics to, [Chris holds up the sheet of paper] written over a decade ago. So, enjoy.
[Chris hits a button on his PS4 controller. The Backstreet Boys' "I Want It That Way" comes on, and Chris disinterestedly sings the lyrics to So Need a Cute Girl. Throughout the video, Chris looks and sounds bored. ]
Hey, Look at me,
I'm sitting here sad and lonely,
Without a fire,
But a desire
To not hear you say,
"I am ta-ken!"
And I see the laadies walking
A-long one by one,
And I never wanna hear,
"I'm already taken!"
Tell me why
I'm stuck in a sad, lonely cage!
Tell me why
I so need a cute girl my age!
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say,
"I'm already taken!"
I-have no fire
But a desire
To never hear you say,
"I'm already taken!"
Tell me why
I'm stuck in a sad, lonely cage!
Tell me why
I so need a cute girl my age!
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say,
"I'm already taken!"
Why do alla the jerks
Get most of the pretty girls, yeah
You may not notice,
But I want you to know
That I am a lonesome heart!
And I have no fire,
But a desire
To not, [Chris accentuates each "not" with a hand spasm] to not, to not
Heeeaaar…[Chris cups his hand to his ear]
Don' wanna hear it!
Stuck in a sad lonely cage!
So need a cute girl my age!
I never wanna hear you say,
"I'm already taken!"
Tell me why
I'm stuck in a sad, lonely cage!
Tell me why
I so need a cute girl my age!
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say,
"I'm already taken!"
Tell me why
I'm stuck in a sad, lonely cage!
-so need a cute girl my age!
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say,
"I'm already taken!"
'Cuz I need my sweetheart.
[Chris turns off the song. He looks at and salutes the camera.]
Thank you.

Transcript of Chris mostly singing
[Chris sits in his bedroom. To his left is a half-full Dr. Pepper bottle, and right in front of him an Equestria Girls figurine.]
Hello, coming to you straight from my house, once again! [Chris adjusts his microphone.] A little mic adjustment…
[Chris picks up an envelope.] Here's a birthday greeting: happy birthday, Ty! From Luke, Tyler, Brian, Dylan and BJ with love. [Chris looks at camera with a glazed expression.] Brotherly love, I'm guessing, so… here-ya-go, happy birthday, Ty! Here's a song.
[Chris presses the play button on his PS4 controller, "Hearts Strong as Horses" from My Little Pony starts playing and Chris starts wagging his finger off-beat.]
Heresuffest little, ponies in town
Got the moves, got the mojo, no harder working ponies around
We are a trio, work as a team
We'll be the first ponies out on the fuh-lag waving scene
We're--
Get goin' when the going gets tough
We never… [unintelligible mumbling] is never enough
We're kinda short, but so what? We don't get defeateeted
We take a little break, but we don't need it
We got hearts as strong as horses
We got hearts as strong as horses
We got hearts as strong as horses
We got hea-a-arts, hearts strong as horses
Uh, when we put our minds together, we can achieve
We're the cutie mark crusaders, and you should believe
We got determination to represent the nation
Or a win [Chris runs his finger through his hair]
We got hearts as strong as horses
We got hearts as strong as horses
We got hearts as strong as horses
We-- We're going to win as we gallop to glory
We can conquer any challenge we're in
We got hea-arts, hearts strong as horses
Hearts strong as horses
[Chris waves and looks into camera.]
Okay… thank you.
[Chris leans toward camera.]
Have a good day.
