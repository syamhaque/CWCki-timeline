The interview
On 11 March 2023, Kiwi Farms user themarchivist2 got into contact with Praetor in regards to their new OfficialCWCmart listing, who then answered questions and gave updates on Chris's condition:
Chris is still in contact with the group, calling them twice a week in regard to their store.
Chris is still receiving his monthly tugboat.
Chris does not receive in-person visitors at jail, disputing an alleged account by a Redditor.[1]
Chris has grown a beard due to shaving restrictions at jail and not receiving HRT.
While Praetor was incorrect about Chris not receiving HRT,[2] the beard growth for lack of a razor was later verified by both a Goddess Log entry and a jail art drawing OfficialCWCmart released in November 2024,[3]
A return to the Internet is "inevitable [...] in a matter of months". This came true in October 2023.
Transcript
The Marchivist
Hey, what's the new listing?
Praetor
Etsy removed our signed Tasers. If you'd like an image, you can easily find them on YouTube as the channel SuperMega unboxed one. Chris has autographed each, and they are all fully functional.

The Marchivist
Alright thanks! Also if you don't mind me asking, have you heard from Chris since november? And can you confirm or deny that Heilberg sent out cease and desists?
Praetor
Chris calls twice a week to deal with the store, as no listings are made with out his express oversight. As for the cease and desists, we'd just advise that folk stay out of any trouble. Chris's cash has been accumulating, as the money he gets from both the store and monthly disability hasn't been touched while incarcerated. This "second coming" he keeps mentioning seems to also include goals to put Heilberg on retainer, and sue a couple of choice folks.

The Marchivist
Has he ever mentioned the purported "jail visit" from January?
Praetor
Christine doesn't receive visitors. Both the lack of recent letters and having no visitors is intentional, as Heilberg advised us to close any way for ill-meaning folk to get close.
A note is that any visitors that come would have made notice of the fact that Chris has a beard. Lack of hormone or razor access has let him grow it out. He shaves it only when allowed and under supervision, as is CVRJ policy.

The Marchivist
Thank you for being so receptive! Last question if that's alright, when would you guess Chris will return to the internet given what you know now? I understand you probably don't have any super accurate predictions, but when would you infer?
Praetor
We won't spoil anything, but a return is inevitable. Christine will be back in a matter of months, with plans far stranger than anybody could guess. He's had a long time to prepare, and has been writing A LOT.
---
The Marchivist
You've been using 'he', is Chris identifying as a male again?
Praetor
Truly, Chris doesn't give a shit either way. The only one out of either Chris or us who remembers what the pronouns are is his lawyer.
Unless leverage is needed. In which case, Chris is a proud woman and always has been.
