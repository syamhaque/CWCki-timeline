On 9 March 2010, Chris uploads a new LittleBigPlanet level that inadvertently reveals the identity of The Wallflower.
On 14 March 2010, Chris wears a kilt and shows us his underwear.
On 17 March 2010, Sonichu turned 10, but Chris was too busy getting pissed at Tito to pay much attention.
On 19 March 2010, Kine kicked off the CWCipedia's total destruction with this small change.
Also on 19 March 2010, this image, among many others, is uploaded in a flurry of massive vandalism.
On 25 March 2010, Chris complains about costumes in Little Big Planet.
March was the third month of 2010. It started out with a bit of concern, as Chris had made mention of his father Bob being hospitalized with congestive heart failure. Though many were worried for Bob's health, Chris didn't seem as worried, as he was seemingly confident his father would continue to live a long life despite the seriousness of his condition.
Chris inadvertently revealed the identity of his latest gal-pal through a LittleBigPlanet level. Dedicated trolls saw he listed The Wallflower's pen name in the description of the level, and used it to find out her real name; while many were content with trying to keep it on the down low and letting her discover for herself what kind of monster she was dealing with, one of them decided to ruin it for everyone and sent her a link to the CWCki. Soon after, the gal-pal left Chris, and as a result of their falling-out, Chris discovered the existence of the CWCki. He immediately demanded that all the pages involving him, his family and friends be removed, or there would be trouble.
Chris was also, for a good part of the month, trolled by Surfshack Tito, whom Chris blamed for the loss of the gal-pal and the china he was sure would follow. The resulting angst drove the man-child to hilarious new lows, such as threatening trolls with a pocket knife, dressing up in a kilt, and using the dreaded N-word - hard "R" and all - on camera, despite being unsure of Tito's ethnicity.
As if in retaliation to Chris dropping the N-bomb, control of the CWCipedia was relinquished to Mao, who opened registration to the masses. In no time flat, the website was greatly enhanced by those masses.
Holding true to his manifesto from the end of the previous month, which basically told his fans to fuck off and stop asking him for Sonichu comic pages, Chris completely neglected answering his Mailbag and publishing comics. While he had promised to at least begin earnest work on Sonichu 11 in time for the 10-year anniversary of the strip, the stress of his women troubles instead drove him to more angry fits of railing against his fans. He even compared them to the trolls that constantly torment him, which is probably the closest Chris has ever been to realizing the truth about his "TRUE and LOYAL fanbase." As if a final slap in the face to his fans, he told everyone that he was leaving the internet forever and that the only way new comics would show up was when they appeared on comic shelves. If that were really the case, he'd have a schedule that would rival that of Rob Liefeld. Thankfully for all, Chris came back 36 hours later.
