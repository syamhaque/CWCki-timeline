================================================================================

Among the many prizes Chris purchased with his My Coke Rewards points were numerous free song downloads from Napster, then known as Rhapsody.com. Intrepid trolls duly hacked a record of his downloads, which is summarized below.
Most of Chris's choices are entirely predictable. The vast majority are songs from Guitar Hero games, SingStar Challenge cuts, Britney Spears singles, and soundtrack selections from The Transformers: The Movie. Besides those, there's No Doubt's biggest hits, a couple of Christmas pop songs, and a few classic show tunes.
