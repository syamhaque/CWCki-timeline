Josh can't stand him, but Chris is always trying to hang out with him. I think Josh is the ONE man his age that he can stand being around.

Joshua Martinez was an old friend of Chris, who he met at James Madison University, as they both attended speech therapy together. After Chris stopped attending speech therapy, the two remained acquaintances, and would meet up occasionally. In 2007, after discovering Chris's internet infamy, Martinez became a troll, pretending to be a woman named Lori Lopez, which made him first person to ever catfish Chris. He came back in 2009 pretending to be Vanessa Hudgens in an effort to get Chris to cheat on Ivy. Martinez's efforts would be foiled by Rocky Shoemaker who threatened to go to the police. Unsurprisingly, Josh disappeared from the trolling scene after this, and has since never been heard from again.

Relationship with Chris
According to Chris, Josh lived in Dyke, a rural community west of Ruckersville. They carpooled to James Madison University in Harrisonburg for speech therapy when they were children. Josh had to attend speech therapy because of his thick Spanish accent.[1] While in Harrisonburg, they would play at Purcell Park and on the abandoned airplane nearby, an experience Chris would fondly remember years later in his video "A browsing around an ol' playground". Chris considers Josh his second closest childhood friend, after Sarah Hammer[2].
After Chris finished high school and returned to Ruckersville in 2000, he and Josh apparently reconnected. They hung out at restaurants including TGI Fridays and Country Cookin, where Chris would usually pay the bill for both of them. On one occasion, Chris had no money for food, so Josh paid for his own meal and ate while Chris looked on in envy.[3] In Chris's 2002 letter to Santa Claus, Chris wished that his "old friend" Josh would receive a special present from Santa.[4]
Lori Lopez
Lori Lopez
Lori Lopez is a non-existent boyfriend-free girl whom Joshua Martinez created in order to troll Chris.
In an email to Anna on 5 November 2007, Chris revealed Lori for the first time.
Joshua found a gal who WAS interested in me, after reading about me in my MySpace profile at least.
Her name is Lori Lopez.
I chatted with her through AOL Instant Message last night... <3<3<3
She was really sweet, and not only did I have a great time getting to know her, but... *blush* I got turned on.
I know that she works (at a car lot, I think), she is 23, brunette, brown eyes, and she is a mix of American and Spanish.
If you've watched the movie, "Into the Blue," the starring woman, Jessica Alba is an American/Spanish mix as well.
I'm keeping the Sweetheart Search details on my profile until I know for certain that Lori is really to be my Sweetheart.  :)
On 18 November, Chris sent the following image to Megan.
This is Lori; the girl my buddy Joshua is hooking me up with. She had it done at JMU; that's why it has her name on it.
The image of Lori is actually an image of Vanessa Hudgens, and the name Vanessa is even written on the image of Lori. This was likely an inspiration for Josh's next trolling scheme, two years later, where he impersonated Vanessa directly.
Chris and Lori's relationship ended when Lori confessed that she was in love with Josh instead of him.
Chris counterattacks
After Chris discovered he had become a lolcow, he tried diverting the attention from himself to Joshua with gems like the following edit to his ED page. Since Chris was still of the belief that trolls went after him because he was so amazing and talented at the time, the reasoning he gives for the unknowable hordes of the Internet to descend upon Josh amount to a weird ramble about how successful in life and sex Josh is.

--- Look, pal, if you REALLY WANT to TAKE DOWN someone who HAS a REPUTATION, consider one JOSHUA MARTINEZ.
Ladies come a runnin' from at least as far as New York City to his house in Dyke, VA; not just any ladies, but STARS like Megan Fox, Jessica Alba, Jessica Biel, Jessica Simpson and plenty other whores. He also has been Piggy-Backing on the Stardom of Vanessa Hudgens; singing with her in her Latino Albums, and starring with her in various HBO movies, and even worse, TRANSFORMERS 2. He has her and some other gal named Brittany for BOTH HIS SIMULTANEOUS GIRLFRIENDS; DUAL Marriage in the works here.
He's a more LUCKY S.O.B. than I can ever surmount to.
RUIN HIS REPUTATION.
Joshua Martinez.
PS YOU DID NOT HEAR THIS WHOLE THING FROM ME.

Vanessa Hudgens
Oh noes!
Main article: Vanessa Hudgens
In early 2009, Josh served as a sort of Eastern Front for the trolling war on Chris, as he impersonated Vanessa Hudgens.
The trolling culminated in Josh attempting to sell a "special" PSP to Chris intended for "Vanessa." He was foiled when trolls suspected that Josh was doing so for personal gain and not simply for the lulz. Josh isn't exactly too bright either — see the Vanessa chats for ample evidence of his limited imagination and clumsy attempts to manipulate Chris — and Chris's dalliances with Vanessa were also interfering with the success of Ivy. Josh's involvement ended and Chris canceled the check for the PSP according to Ivy's instructions, yet Chris refused to return it because "Vanessa would be upset." It was a knock-down, drag-out case of retard vs. retard.
Chris's parents were furious at Josh, and actually went to the police in an attempt to bring him in for conning Chris out of his cash. However, during that very visit, Bob and Barb found out that Chris was stealing money from them, prompting Bob to deny police assistance for fear that Chris could be implicated. He instead announced his intention to take Josh to small claims court, but it's unknown what, if anything, came of this. This visit also saw Rocky Shoemaker get involved to investigate the trolls (against Bob and Barb's wishes), ultimately ending the Ivy operation alongside the Vanessa operation.[6]
The Vanessa AIM Chats were leaked after Josh gave them to the CWCki editor Robotnik, which apparently didn't take much convincing to do. After the threat of police, Joshua has unsurprisingly completely stopped trolling Chris, or interacting with him in any form. As such, his role in Christory is considered to have ended.
