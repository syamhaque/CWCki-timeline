Chris's Bluesky bio, an updated version of his Twitter one.
Bluesky is a decentralized microblogging social platform, similar to Twitter/X. Following Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter in 2022, the platform saw a large influx of Twitter users who were unhappy with Musk's management of Twitter and his political views.
Chris created a Bluesky account on 15 October 2023 following his return to the Internet after a two-year hiatus. The following day, he made his first post on Bluesky and his first post on Twitter in more than two years. Although Chris criticized Elon Musk's management of Twitter at the time, Chris remained far more active on Twitter than Bluesky. He recycled 20 Twitter posts on Bluesky until February 2024, at which point he let the account go dormant.
In November 2024, shortly after Pmurt was elected to a second term as United States President, Chris announced that he was making a "permanent move" to Bluesky, with Elon Musk's highly publicized endorsement of Trump being a key motivator. Although Chris is more active on Bluesky, he still uses Twitter to repost fan art, YouTube videos, or any updates in his life.[1][2]
