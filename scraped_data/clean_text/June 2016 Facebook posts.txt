This page is an archive of Chris' Facebook posts during June 2016. Posts are sorted by date, and color-coded for reference; those who consistently responded to Chris' posts, e.g. Kenneth Engelhardt and Jessica Quinn, are colored in red and green respectively, while infrequent responders are colored in orange, yellow or purple.
Chris began the month with a comment that he was taking the day off due to stress, saying he was prone to distraction and in a meditative state after a period of stress and fearfulness. Further subjects included a commentary on a credit increase discussed on Kiwi Farms; Chris spent of this increase on Transformers, and the other half on Barbara's declining health. Naturally, he reiterated a request for donations, as he had in his videos. Towards the end of the month, he posted a photograph of Bob on Father's Day, which contrasted strangely with his earlier post suggesting he believed Bob was his uncle. His penultimate post was a rant against Cole Smithey, Chris' estranged half-brother, who he believed had not provided sufficient support during the family's recent financial troubles.

"Meditative state"
7 June 2016 at 15:05
I didn't feel swift today, so I'm taking an off day to recover. And it is not a waste. I have been in a meditative state, self reflecting and pondering. Among which, I have realized among my problems is lack of better self-motivation. In my subconscious are all of my fears and stresses. My creations, reputation, and life in general, are all still being met with mixed results; the bad half lingers. And at home, something that leaves me with a shock is inevitable, which drains me more quickly if the severity is high. And I find myself also stuck in a rut where I could be doing more work here, but something else comes up, or my ADD throws me a mental curveball towards a different focal point.
So, the question that I am still pondering: how do I better self-motivate, keep my waking energy focused on the required tasks that have yet to be completed at hand from creation, and how do I keep my set on blocking out stressed reactions to random inputs that would cause such?
Your answer may be "Just Do It", but with a creative mind with fickle energies and moods/emotions that are prone to easy distraction and drain, that Is the weakness set. And therefore the most difficult to pinpoint, identify and reprogram the mind to heal and counter all of that.
To put it in a way I believe you may relate with: your daily work in front of a computer with tasks simple to you with prior educations... Charts and Graphs that you have created with details of the company you work for. It all went smoothly for you. But, suddenly, you are met with a shock! Your lover has left you for another and will never return? The rent is Past Due with Final Notice? There is illness or maybe a death in the family? Or maybe your own mind has fallen into a dark void of being lost, blank and confused beyond your own belief and understanding for hardly a noticeable reason. The following day at your job, you sit there; looking at your monitor, but you are barely able to function, even while your own mind is conscious, stuck in a constant observation-only function. You feel like you can hardly move or think.
I do understand Everyone has their own set of stresses. And among the creative types who feel this way as well, I have been stuck, waiting for that recovery and inspiration to finally return, so we can Feel and Have the energy we each Require to Create in our own way!
I do wish it was "Bob's your uncle" quick and easy for the mental and emotional recovery for me. But it's not. And the remains of the Autism aren't helping much either.

Y'know what I find helps keep focus? A clean home and a daily routine.
I find myself freed up when everything is in its place - it's hard to focus on doing something I like if my environment is a mess. And the only way to reach a stable point at home is to develop a daily routine to keep your home tidy. A place for every thing, and every thing in its place.
Cleaning can also be very therapeutic. Just put on some of your favorite tunes and get things done! 🎧👍
Jessica Quinn, 7 June 2016 at 18:13
Furthermore, finding a place for everything might help you stay focused - I imagine the amount of media and playthings surrounding you makes it easy to get distracted from whatever task you have at hand.
I hope this helps! ❤️
Kenneth Engelhardt, 8 June 2016 at 01:00
I agree with what Jessica said. A messy room can be psychologically draining. In terms of cleaning being therapeutic, I've seen that with washing dishes the old fashioned way with a sink of hot, soapy water. It can take your mind off your troubles

Transformers

Firstly, I want to clarify something, since some people behind their mothers' basements sought and leaked amongst their kiwi grapevines, prevaricatively: unexpected last month, one of my credit account limits was raised, and I used half of it to catch up on the Combiner Set Collection catch-up. Bruticus. Plus, lovely female Autobots: Arcee, Chromium and Wingblade. And I gave the other half to my mother to help with the bills here.
Also, Fun: you're a male-born child with a mom and dad in the 80's, shortly after middle or end of Season Three Transformers G1. You want to play Transformers with your family, and Really want to include mom (and you Never got to even hear of the "Search for Alpha Trion" episode, much less the Orion Pax episode). What role can mom play; knowingly, you only can think of Arcee. While dad is the "Optimist" (pun intended), and you're Bumblebee. And the game is to spy on and take out the Decepticons in their current Energon-stealing scheme.
Well, more than three decades later: the transforming figure of Arcee is finally released, and with a deluxe Optimus Prime and Bumble figure, and Starscream, Megatron and Soundwave, the family game of yesteryears can Finally be played for real. Totes Sweet and Sparkles!
Transformers addendum
13 June 2016 at 16:34
Also, Someone Draw from G1 female characters, and maybe current Windblade, a Five Piece Combiner with All Female Transformers! Elita-One can be the centerpiece! And then Arcee, Chromium, Windblade, and take your pick: Moonracer, Firestar, one of the others there, or even Black Arachnia (after becoming a Maximal). Epic Female Combiner! Someone suggest that to Hasbro and the comic book people. Yeah!
Credit increase
13 June 2016 at 16:39
But, seriously: that credit increase was a bonus that went quick. And mom impulsively spending more on the bills than minimum payment as usual, we are financially down early this month. What that means to me more emotional ware in my subconscious; it slows me down more compared to early in the months. So, I am more than serious on asking in my recent video for donations. So, if you can donate either through the Support button on my YouTube channel, or better yet PayPal it to my email address, please.
Thank you.

Spending more on the bills is good though!
Jessica Quinn, at 17:44 on 13 June 2016
Paying only the minimum payment isn't the wisest idea - it leads to you paying far more in the long run. If anything, it's a smart idea.
Kenneth Engelhardt, at 03:33 on 14 June 2016
Have you thought of working with a credit counselor and consolidating your debts so you make one payment every month? It would result in a substantial savings in terms of bill payments.
Father's day

Hosiery and stockings are one of society's non-conforming garments.

I am not sure what you mean by non-conforming.
Mellanie Chafe, at 17:37 on 26 June 2016
I think they're more conforming because of society's standards that women have to wear them.
Jessica Quinn, at 14:10 on 28 June 2016
I don't have a problem with them ❤️
O brother, where art thou?
26 June 2016 at 20:15
**THIS JUST IN!**
‪#‎JosephColeSmithey‬ residing in Carnigee Hall with Wife as early as 2000. More than $2000 a month's rent! Pissing and Burning Away Money! Should REALLY be sharing it with his Caring Biological Mother and Sister! Mother Paid His way through SCHOOLS! Paid for his Car! Reared Him with Lots of Love and Care! Mother and Daughter REALLY could use financial Help! Cole Hates His Own Mother Over Father Issues and False Rumors spread by Aunts and Uncles! NEVER Contacts neither his Mother or Sister! Sister, Christine Weston Chandler, quoted, "We HARDLY EVER hear from the B***ard." ‪#‎JCS‬ is Quoted to be "World's Smartest A-Hole!"
**Update**
I just relearned and Confirmed, with a past signature Care Package sent to Cole last Christmas, that he Currently lives a few buildings down East 90th from Carnigee Hall. BUT, he DID live at Carnigee Hall as early as 2000, as confirmed by a Christmas Card, mailed to our mother, December of 2000. This was a couple of years Before the b***ard disowned her. The block must still have very Pricey rent, anyhow. Money-Burner.
Kim Wilson, 27 June 2016 at 02:14
Cole isn't ignoring your mother because of financial issues. He admits that he could help her. He just dislikes her very, very much. That he could possibly help her just makes it more satisfying when he refuses to.
You have to accept that he had a different experience with your mother than you did. He lived with her for years before you came along.
Telling him how mean he is for having different feelings than you do (ones that are just as valid) won't make him change his mind. It just makes you an asshole.
(Not meaning to be mean. Just saying you should be more considerate when it comes to family situations, especially when someone else has just a valid reason to believe things as you do. Now it's late, time to go to sleep. Talk to you later. :) )

Marvin, pal, you're defending the world's smartest critic?

Jennifer Marie on 27 June 2016 at 08:59
Wait...what?
Kenneth Engelhardt on 27 June 2016 at 14:20
William : Kim is not Marvin.
William Elliott Waterman on 27 June 2016 at 17:45
I heard about this awesome thing called "burden of proof." It means I can say I'm automatically right until anybody in the world can prove it's not Marvin. Isn't that cool?
Jennifer Marie on 27 June 2016 at 17:48
Yeah, but this theory also means that I can say you're an a$$hole until *anybody* proves otherwise. Isn't that cool?
William Elliott Waterman on 27 June 2016 at 19:09
I like the dollar signs.
Jennifer Marie on 27 June 2016 at 19:15
Thanks, Marvin
Kenneth Engelhardt on 27 June 2016 at 19:27
Marvin is Howard Winslow who lives in Baltimore.
William Elliott Waterman on 27 June 2016 at 19:30
Baltimore... is that a city in Virginia that's close to Ruckersville? I don't see that being true otherwise.
Kenneth Engelhardt on 27 June 2016 at 22:44
William Elliott Waterman I am talking about Baltimore, Maryland.
Jennifer Marie on 28 June 2016 at 12:19
I think I misunderstand. Why is William calling me Marvin? Is this some sort of joke I'm missing?
William Elliott Waterman on 28 June 2016 at 16:55
I'm sure someone who told Christine my freedom of speech on Kiwifarms wasn't being blocked off and overseen by moderators doesn't understand what Marvin I'm talking about, so of course the joke needs to be explained to you.
Jennifer Marie on 28 June 2016 at 17:01
Ok.
William Elliott Waterman on 28 June 2016 at 17:05
Yes, it is very okay. We are going to have lots of fun.
Jessica Quinn on 28 June 2016 at 22:01
^ That sounds... creepy.

How about closer to $4000/month in Midtown Manhattan.

The Massachusetts Bay Transit authority extended its line down to Wickford Junction in North Kingstown a few years ago. Boston housing has become so damn expensive to live that the Providence area is a bargain. It's like 40% or so cheaper.
Jessica Quinn on 29 June 2016 at 15:08
How is mocking your brother going to help convince him to help you?
If you're truly struggling, have you considered trying to get a part-time job or something? I'm sure there's some way of making money if you put any effort into it hon.
Good luck! 👍
Kenneth Engelhardt on 28 June 2016 at 15:38
From what I have noticed, you have a lot of merchandise in your room. For starters, what about having a closeout sale? It might put some money in your pocket and clear out some of the stuff just taking up space.
Jessica Quinn on 29 June 2016 at 15:08
Ken's got a great idea there. 4th of July weekend is fast approaching - great time for yard sales. You probably have a treasure trove in your home and you don't even know it!

Why don't you just make and sell more comics? Isn't that what you're supposed to be known for? Breathing new life into your series would probably renew interest in your other related material.
Just a thought. Good luck! 😀
Kenneth Engelhardt on 1 July 2016 at 03:58
I would change it to the Sonichu League and then you could branch off into different adventures with the characters.
Jessica Quinn on 1 July 2016 at 06:20
What if Sonichu pulled a Captain America and was "Working for the PVCC all along!?" 😂
