This article is still yet to be completed due to stress. We get a lot of stressful torture in our lives that makes us crash into slumber. Given that inspiration is a big variable, and we may have been lacking of it, this article will be completed as soon as possible, at our own pace... HONEST!

Hit-or-Miss R34
30 July 2019
MKR posted two R34 drawings of Transformers and commented:
Dont judge me XD
Chris responded:
I was curious about the twitchy servos in that for a while, but it ended up being hit-or-miss with me.

Is that The Sergeant at Arms?
17 September 2019
Chris
I just got the memo of the server.
Hold up a moment: @Thesergeantatarms?
The same guy on YouTube who uploads EVERYTHING there is about me?
[Chris linked to The Sergeant at Arms's YouTube channel]
Yep. I'm willing to wager it is he.

Barbara's Trip to the ER
19 October 2019
Midnight Moonflower
So how have you been doing lately? I am trying to heal up from a sore throat. My runny nose is gone thankfully
Chris
I'm faring okay. I've been feeling a LOT of psychic senses going off and on all day today while being out on errand and grocery shopping. Also, my mom had a bit of high blood pressure and asked me to drive her to the ER; they found nothing wrong with her It is likely a combination of stress and the incoming magic energies from C-197.
Midnight Moonflower
I'm sorry to hear that your mom isn't doing so well. On October 26th to 30th Angel and I get to see my parents. Also get to see my sister on the 29th. Also thinking of different ideas for comics and stuff. I kind of have Angel's luck when it comes to shinies and other rare things in games.
I might get a tattoo of where my wings will be on my back. Not right away but when I have the money
Chris
That would be cool for when you wear a tank top or a swimsuit.

Watchmen Raid
Unknown date
The Watchmen raid Midnight's Discord server to harass and intimidate her and other members over Chris being a member of the server. Watchmen members Naught, MKR and AquaDiamond8; and Midnight's friend Lilli are present in the conversation.
Naught
friendly reminder null marvin the captain and others have access to cwes social media..so if you think ur communications are private theyre not.
Lilli
It's funny how people come here expecting this to have anything to do with Christine
MKR
Christine is in the server
Lilli
She barely shows up
MKR
Yeah, but other people don't know.
Naught
doesnt matter
Lilli
No one is trying to bother her so like why don't we all just let this out and stop playing around it's getting really annoying tbh
Lilli
Like how everyone shows up when I mention Christine
MKR
I don't understand
Naught
no one is playing
Lilli
Sorry I'm just tired of people acting nice when no one here is trying to bother Christine well I mean like maybe some people are but Midnight isn't
Naught
you dont understand the situation
Lilli
That's the only one I can vouch for
Naught
namẹ em
Naught
than you all get doxed
Naught
guilt by association
Lilli
What? You're going to doxx ya?
Lilli
*us
Lilli
Or just me and Midnight?
Naught
no
Naught
im telling you what will happen
Naught
not by me thats how it goes
Lilli
Okay I understand that thanks
Naught
believe it or not im one of the less mean ones
Naught
Lilli
Oh really? So then let's get this all out on the table then, what do you like want? What's your deal? When people start arguing you show up
Naught
i curb weens and alogs
Lilli
Okay
Alright so like we barely talk about Christine here I'm barely in here
She never shows up here
Naught
dont be pedantic
Lilli
Lmfao
Naught
youre gonna end up with a cwcki page and on kiwi farms if you dont cease your faggotry
Lilli
You're threatening to "curb" me and you expect me to not have evidence for my innocence?
Okay thanks for the pro tip
Lilli
So like you guys see all that? You understand I know what's at stake? Why do you think I'm not in any servers and why I don't rp or engage in that kinda shit? I'm not interested in anything but spreading a little fucking kindness? This isn't directed at anyone specifically it's directed at the ones who are taking notes
AquaDiamond8

im lowkjey surprised i havent been kicked yet

Watchmen Raid, Part 2
Unknown date
Midnight protests against the treatment towards herself and her friends.
Midnight Moonflower
I decided to come back for a bit. @yugiohroxmehsox @Aqua I would like to talk
Midnight Moonflower
I thought you 2 knew that I am close to Christine to be her friend. Also this is not a Sonichu/CWC server. It's my server supporting my art and comics. Yes Christine is on this server but this is because she's my friend. She is barely active on this server. Also Pokegeek is my best friend who isn't Pri not some ween. One of your friends mentioned that she would get doxed. You put @Darth PornRobes's face in one of your pictures without her permission and accused her of being a kiwi membership. That XIII guy thought I stole Christine's wallet on her visit! Her wallet wasn't even there when she came in and she found it at the police station! None of my friends are weens. I don't know why you think I am like Jacob Sockness but if I have to prove my innocence I will! I am not going to hide and watch this anymore! And I will take screenshots of you think about taking screenshots and flipping what I just said I am going to make this a civil talk and ask why you all are doing this on my server?
MKR
Bismuth thought you were all weens.
Midnight Moonflower
That's fine you don't have to get along with all my friends.
MKR
I will say one thing before leaving this server as I feel that's the natural consequence. If you truly want to be friends with Chris, it's very important for you to grow a thicker skin. Get tough or the trolls, weens, farms and internet will eat you alive. People have committed suicide over this before. So please for your sake get tough and learn to take criticism, constructive and otherwise.
Midnight Moonflower
I mean I don't get along with Jacob Sockness or Sarah and Steve
MKR
They are out of the picture
I take my role in things very seriously, its actually made me a stronger person overall.
