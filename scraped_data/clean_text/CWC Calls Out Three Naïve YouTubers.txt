Someone told him she was a troll.

The Man in the Pickle Suit on why Chris lashed out at sonichuizcool.[1]
CWC Calls Out Three Naïve YouTubers is a name to a trilogy of videos posted on 10 July 2009 by Chris for three individuals: ShmionSonozaki, sonichuizcool and oxycleanfanatic2264. Their accounts were already closed when the videos were posted.
Deemed "too hot for YouTube" for Chris's very blunt and inflammatory rhetoric (wherein he called individuals retards and told them to go kill themselves), it led to his account immediately being banned. Luckily, a brave patriot discovered them when they were new and mirrored them, allowing them to then be archived by the TheCWCvilleLibrary for great justice. Each video begins with Chris holding up a piece of paper with the user's name written on it and playing the same recorded disclaimer in the background.
Ironically, Chris called the users "naïve" and revealed his particular disdain for this word calling it "the most cruelest of words", and then he proceeded to butcher its definition by saying it meant being stupid. Some people have speculated that he might've been slightly intoxicated when making the videos.
It was eventually revealed that oxycleanfanatic was in fact, Samantha Thaddeus, daughter of Jack Thaddeus, who was assisting her father in holding Chris's PSN hostage. She called Chris out on this video in the Samantha Thaddeus E-mails.

Perhaps you are actually a dude, or even worse, a hermaphrodite.

[The screen shows a piece of paper with the name ‘ShmionSonozaki’ written on it in felt tip pen.]
The following is addressed to this individual, whose YouTube account is this only. The opinions and if--feelings and emotions expressed in this video are not...res--are not representative towards any persons other than this one. Thank you very much.
[camera cut to Chris] Hello! Hmm...you hide under a veil. I don’t know, are you a pretty woman? Or are you a...or are ya hide a beard underneath that veil? Or do you hide that beard? Perhaps you are actually a dude, or even worse, a hermaphrodite. You know what, you gettin' not much of response from me, because, you even deleted your own account! You are such a cowardly, naïve, retarded, individual. Naïve is the cruelest of words, cause it questions one's intelbi--intelligence. And that’s why I’m calling you...you naïve retard.
[jump cut] And also, I know you live...in Pennsylvania!
CWC Calls Out
True fan
Sonichuizcool is a slightly slow-in-the-mind female Pokémon fan from England. In the video included below, Sonichuizcool discusses Clyde Cash's faked death, and tries to inform Chris that Clyde was still alive and posting comments to her videos.
Trolls manipulated Chris into calling her out by planting the notion in his mind that she herself was a troll.[1]

[The paper this time reads 'sonichuizcool'. The same disclaimer from the first video is heard, then a camera cut to Chris.]
Hmm... I don’t know. You seem to hide behind a face mask, and a beanie. Who do you think you are? Tuxedo Kamen? Ah! You’re so naïve and slow in the mind. I couldn’t even give a dang about you. And if you want my trust, you’re gonna have to do some earning, then you’re gonna have to come out and into the open. You gotta come out where I can meet you. Ehh? Ehh?
Dumbass.
Vidio Reply To Christian Weston Chandler Maker of Sonichu Comics
Sonichuizcool replied 3 days later. Hilariously, she 1-ups Chris in this video, parodying his index card introduction and referencing the destruction of his Sonichu medallion (albeit unintentionally) by chopping up her own. She (like so many others) calls him out on his bad behavior, and states that because of it, he had lost the only true fan he ever had at the time. Despite that, she still felt pity towards Chris and even offers some good advice, which speaks volumes about her virtue of forgiveness, and Chris' sin of being a total douche.
Chris never replied to this video.

Sonichuizcool: So. This is a reply to Christian Chandler, who made the video where he called me names, including "dumbass". I-I'm recording this again, because the sound was very bad. (brings out a piece of paper with 'Christian Weston Chandler' written on it, and peers under it at the camera) So...this is for the maker of the Sonichu (pronounces it 'Soniku') comics whose name is this and this only.
It was very mean of you to say all that nasty stuff to people, and what about it come to you? I have not tried to get your trust or whatever you said on your video, but the only thing I've shown is a true fan of Sonichu and yourself for a very long time and you called me names! I have done lots to sort out the trolls who were hating you, and I have argued for you when those nasty guys said bad stuff about you. I thought that you were truly a good guy.
Well, now, you have lost a good fan, and I might even be one of your best fans you ever had. I have now chopped up my Sonichu medallion because I think you are an idiot, and I am not a Sonichu fan anymore.
Anyway, apology accepted, and I do see the vids you made. You have a lot of people to apologize to, who you have said so much bad stuff to people who have not done anything to you. I-I'm not one of your "fanbase" anymore, but, I still think you are okay. A lot of bad stuff has happened to you, and I'm not blaming you, as you have a lot of hate from nasty people, and that gets you all mad, yeah. I think you should concentrate more on comics, and less, um, YouTube, as there are a lot of bad people on YouTube, which is why I wear a disguise. I actually made a lot of vids without this mask before. I started wearing this. Y'know, I think it was cool, too.
Anyway, an update on my comic, second page is done, and posted the two pages online. The address is on my YouTube.
Anyway, from the beanie-masked YouTuber who is now known as GX, or G Extreme, after my comics. Bye, bye, bye, that's all for now! Gene of X.

[The index card this time reads 'oxycleanfanatic2264', with '(not a YouTube handle, / but still a handle for this individual)' written below it in smaller writing in pencil. The intro from before is played, before we cut to Chris.]
Hey! You! I know you. I have your name! You live in Sacramento, California. I have a detective on the case, and I am going to send him against you as soon as possible. Which that would be in the next few days, or tomorrow when I can get in touch with him. And I will get in touch with him. And you think you’re sooo smart and you think you’re sooo corny by doing the things that you have done so far, Mr. Hacker! You think you’re so smart? Well, you know what? You're just a naïve retard! And naïve is my least favorite word because it sounds like nails on a chalkboard. You naïve retarded bastard! You should just go ha--you should just go...hang yourself, after you have given me back what you have stolen from me. Do it NOW, GIVE 'EM BACK TO ME! Or I will send the detective and the police on your case. You bastard, you- naïve retarded bastard.
[jump cut] And not only that, but you are such a coward, you dare not even show your face like others have done, partially, on their YouTube videos. You are such a cowardly naïve retarded bastard!
[jump cut] That’s right. I’m calling you out!
