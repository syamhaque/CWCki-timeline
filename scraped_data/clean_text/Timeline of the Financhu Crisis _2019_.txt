Another fine collectible from my mother’s collection; she is yelling for the money again. Ugh!
”

April '19
2nd - Chris is sued by Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC for an undisclosed amount, with a hearing scheduled on May 15th.
4th - Chris shows off six purchased Poké Ball Plus toys in a Twitter post. He had purchased them from GameStop. Chris claimed he bought one brand new (a $50 price) and the other five used "at up to $15 savings difference", which would mean he still spent at least $200 on them.

15th - Chris drives to Newport News again to pick up his lost wallet.
23rd - Ending his 100+ day-long streak of not begging, Chris records We Need some gas money, Please, Help., saying that he needs $20 to fill up his van with gas.
26th - Chris lists rare coins on eBay, begging coin collectors to consider helping him and his mom. It's worth noting that these coins are among the only things of (non-Christorical) value Chris has tried to sell so far, although their value is lowered somewhat by the fact that they haven't been graded by a numismatic authority like NGC or PCGS.
