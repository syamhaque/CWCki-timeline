“
Soo stressed, and I don't care if y'all share this on Kiwi or not, that in the van on the way back home from an errand, I crapped my panties; the pad took most of that damage.
”
Chris, showcasing his continued fecal incontinence and apathy with his personal details being shared online.
On 21 June 2021, after talking about a dating sim game he's been working on with Helena Fiorenza, Chris had spoken to the Watchmen about the stress he's been experiencing from a part of Warhol/Chris Chan, which discusses how Chris lost his copy of Sonic CD in the House Fire. The stress Chris experienced from this was apparently so strong that it literally made Chris crap himself, something which he openly told the Watchmen he didn't care would be shared on the Kiwi Farms.
The WCT engaged with Chris the most in this conversation, with WCT telling Chris to cherish his personal items. Chris then spoke about his wedding rings, talking about how they were a link between himself, Magi-Chan and Cryzel. After Chris and WCT talk about Uncharted 3, he asks Chris about Praetor, with Chris telling him they were "busy as usual".
The Fool also occasionally chimed into this conversation, telling Chris the same thing about cherishing his belongings.

Chris
Hey, @everyone.
Just relaying a message for now: Helena is working on a Dating Sim game on top of an RPG, and she is requesting help.

The WCT
Hi Chris!
yeah this is going to be difficult knowing how many like to mess with Helena.
Chris
Just respond and help her any way y’all can, please.
Also, feeling a bit of mixed emotions after re-reading the first few pages of Chapter Five of “Warhol/Chris Chan”.
Suffice to say a whole bunch of insecure hyena-like laughter, and a personal commentary of, “With each of my games and consoles I sold, I lost a piece of myself, definitely.
Even my OG Megazord, Dragonzord, and Titanus from the house fire of 2014.
The only item I have left from the Shopping Spree of 1994 is my copy of Sonic CD for the Sega CD and its instruction booklet.”
Soo stressed, and I don’t care if y’all share this on Kiwi or not, that in the van on the way back home from an errand, I crapped my panties; the pad took most of that damage.
The WCT
Cherish that Sonic CD copy your entire life Chris.
You might've lost a lot during the fire, but anything you were able to save that still makes you happy is what matters.
Chris
Yes
But the most important thing in recent events and present, in addition to completing the Dimension Merge, is my self-healing work and locating and accepting my remaining flaws and stresses.
The WCT
When I left my childhood home not long ago. I was sad and I really miss living there everyday. But what keeps me in a good place is that I know that those days weren't wasted.
The Fool
We all lose things. Be happy you have the memory of them, that can never be destroyed :)
The WCT
I'm not sad that it ended, I'm happy that it happened. (edited)
Chris
I realize I still have a mental hangup between the Hoarding and Collecting; having had parents that were one of each is quite a combination.
The WCT
is there anything from your parents that you cherish the most?
The Fool
Chris, I don't know if you've ever seen the show "Hoarders", I love it, it gets really emotional as people learn to let go of things and learn to love themselves and their family more
[The Fool linked to a Youtube playlist on the Hoarders show]
not every episode has a happy ending but a lot are nice
The WCT
the ones where they save the house are so satisfying.
Chris
Their wedding rings, for one thing, and now they’re a link between I and Magi-Chan and Cryzel (both of which are white gold); the silverish ring on the middle finger is with Sylvana, and the Nathan Drake replica ring is with Mewtwo. (edited)
The WCT
those look nice.
the drake one especially is unique.
Chris
Came from the C.E. Box of one of the PS3 games; the third one, I believe.
The WCT
I liked Uncharted 3.
because I'm a big Middle East history buff, it made me happy. lol
the other ones were also great.
Chris
Yes, they are.
The WCT
So @CWCSonichu1982 what has Praetor been up to lately?
Chris
I’ll be getting back to work on the book highlighting in a little while.
I’m feeling better, but the laughing I did earlier upon fresh-reading, it would have given the Joker a run and laugh for his money.
Busy as usual.
Which reminds me, I need to check in with him about a detail.
