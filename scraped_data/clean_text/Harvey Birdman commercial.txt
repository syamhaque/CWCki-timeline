“
My entry was very dramatic, and a lot BETTER than that piece of poo, or any of the others that made the top 5 as well! I'm very upset about that! My "CWC's Harvey Birdaman Spot" was the BEST, and I feel sorry for you, Adult Swim, for not noticing that! You all should take another good look at it and seriously reconsider!

Chris, being a good loser as ever.[1]
The Harvey Birdman Commercial is a commercial produced by Chris in February 2005 as part of a contest held for Cartoon Network's Adult Swim block. Adult Swim held a contest inviting viewers to make a commercial for the Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law, Vol. 1 DVD set (or Harvey Dirdban, as he seems to pronounce it). Always willing to earn fame and fortune with minimal effort, Chris stepped up and produced an advertisement promoting himself, his eternal rivalry with Mary Lee Walsh, and Sonichu...and Harvey Birdman.
Chris is not famed for his conciseness, to say the least, but due to the contest rules specifying 28-30 second entries, Chris chose his loquacious pitch at a manic pace rather than omitting anything from his agenda. One can only imagine the 17-minute infomercial Chris would have delivered, had he been allowed.
Shockingly, Chris's barely comprehensible spiel about self-promotion with a cursory mention of Harvey Birdman did not win. This inspired him to post a complaint on the [as] forums (to be precise, he posted the same complaint twice), but for some reason, Chris's idea of justice was never served.
The commercial appears in somewhat poor quality on Christian Weston Chandler...Yep, I'm on TV :), but he also uploaded a better version of the same footage to his original YouTube account some time prior to October 31, 2007.

If one can look past the poor lighting, viewers may notice that, in this video, Chris actually wasn't that fat during this period in his life. Not as fat as now, anyway. Also, if Chris were to record this today, he would almost certainly tear off his glasses for maximum effect.
