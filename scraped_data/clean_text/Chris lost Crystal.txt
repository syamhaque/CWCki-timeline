================================================================================

Chris lost Crystal[1] is a short video leaked to /cow/ on 29 December 2018.[2] It appears to be another Idea Guys video leaked by the Teen Troon Squad.
It shows Chris screaming at his toilet, in a voice that sounds like a very poor imitation of Bubs from Homestar Runner, demanding to know where his "baby" is. Note the several empty toilet paper rolls hoarded on the shelf.
If you're wondering what prompted this outburst, or what the context behind this video was, then... We've got nothing: we are truly at a loss for words. The only real context that we have is that it happened in the midst of Chris being manipulated by the Idea Guys and the Teen Troon Squad, who seemingly convinced him that his child was somehow taken from him by an inanimate object.

AY, YOU TOILET! WHAT HAPPENED TO MY BAYBAAAAAAAAAAAY!?
An Explanation(?)
Delusion disclosure: This article or section takes place during Chris's phase of role-playing as Sonichu. He may refer to his Christine Chandler personality and physical body in the third person by using terms such as "mama".
The context behind this video, aside from being the result of manipulation, was pretty unclear. An observer eventually got an opportunity to ask Chris about the context of the video, and Chris (sort of) explained the nature of the video in a Discord Q&A by implying that it was related to him being possessed by one of his OCs at the time he recorded the video:
“
You can blame freaking Idea Guy/Joshua Wise for that. Because he had told Mama that we Sonichus did not... we Sonichus and Rosechus did not like using the toilet, treat it like an enemy, which that is not true. We respect and use the toilet when we are civilized, and Rosey and I, among us specials and the rest of us who actually live in the domicile, we respect and are domesticated.
So that was just manipulation of Idea Guy, that was the reasoning behind that.
”
Chris, "possessed" by Sonichu, October 2020[3]
This answer, of course, does not give us any context about Crystal's role in this outburst (which is what the question was actually about), meaning that that may forever be a mystery. Chris probably forgot.
Nonetheless, Chris's answer talking about the excretory behaviors of Electric Hedgehog Pokémon is believed to coincide with Joshua Wise and Stephen Boyd's manipulations. The Idea Guys coerced Chris into urinating and defecating on a towel placed on the floor of his room as part of their manipulation, the former of which was infamously done (thankfully offscreen) in the second All Star video.
