Chris made himself exceedingly scarce in the first month of the year, going unseen by anyone for the first time since October 2024. Throughout the month he would upload three more reviews of his kitbashed figurines. On the 18th, it was discovered through a search made by a CWCki editor that FamilySearch held a detailed record of Chris's family tree, appearing to confirm that he was indeed of distant Cherokee ancestry and putting paid to claims he made almost twenty years ago. On the 20th, Pmurt was sworn in as President of the United States, much to Chris's dismay.
On the 31st, the Charlottesville Fashion Square, foremost Love Quest haunt and the center of much of Chris's young and adult life, closed its doors for good after 45 years of service.
February

Chris in February 2025
On the first of the month, Chris uploaded a rambling, lore-laden post to Cwclight, titled The Autobots of Cwcville. February 4th saw Chris teasing his new talking Sonichu and Rosechu plushes, officially announcing them on the 6th.
Chris and Flutter were spotted again in public at a pet store on the 14th.
February 24th saw Chris reaching his 43rd birthday; on the same day, Barbara was also photographed and recorded speaking to visitors for the first time since January 2024.
March

Chris in March 2025
On March 14th, Chris ended his YouTube hiatus by posting two videos, one in which he read a previously unreleased chapter of a Sonichu story, and a livestream of him playing Sonic the Hedgehog (2006); this playthrough was continued on the 29th. This month saw the 25th anniversary of Sonichu's creation, and marked the second full year since Chris's release from jail. Compared to recent months, Chris was considerably more active on social media, making several dozen posts across both Twitter and Bluesky. He continued to go unseen in public, save for a single unconfirmed sighting on the 17th that reportedly took place at a Food Lion in an unknown location.
April

Chris in Helsinki, April 2025
April saw two new additions to Chris's series of reviews of his kitbashed figurines and one new instalment of his reviews of positive comments on his Etsy page. Current information suggests that Chris spent most if not all of this month in Finland on his fourth known visit to the country, with photos and sightings emerging around this time proving that Chris had once again visited Helsinki. Outside of this, his online activity was extremely limited, making only a single post on Twitter at the very end of the month. Additionally, a new episode of The Chris Chan Conspiracy finally released, which included interview footage from March 2024, and a portion of previously unseen writings from the Goddess Log (Chris's jail diary).
May

Chris in May 2025
Chris started out the month by giving his thoughts on drama involving Saberspark and ILoveKimPossibleAlot. A few days later, he put a copyright claim in on Geno Samuel's Sonichu: The Animated Series for infringing on his right to steal copyrighted characters. His fourth trip to Finland was confirmed to be concluded a few days later, as he attended the Festival of Light in Lynchburg on 10 May. He also continued to upload more boring and unwatchable videos during this month.
On 17 May, Chris would pause his gaming livestream to call a donor named Waltah White. In their nearly 20 minute chat, Chris is notably pressed for details about Big Island, Finland, and Flutter for the first time. Chris admitted to being in Big Island, but outright denied ever going to Finland, despite the overwhelming evidence. He refused to give any information about Flutter to the donor, even after being bribed with money, though he felt comfortable enough to tell him that she supposedly lives in Philadelphia and goes to university there.
Two days after the incident, Chris uploaded Grounded Deep Response, a rather lengthy and introspective "apology" video in which he fails to properly take accountability. Chris makes it transparent that he wants to be recognized for his maturity and growth, which would technically be fair criticism to those who don't recognize the difference between the "classic" and more modern Chris, although he only says this because he doesn't like the way his viewers treat him (something which has been gnawing at him for months). The donation money apparently wasn't enough to keep the stress from piling up, as Chris holds back tears in the video, threatening to quit doing livestreams if the treatment continues. So far it seems Chris has followed through with this threat, and feels more comfortable uploading prerecorded toy videos.
June

Chris in June 2025
Chris uploaded more prerecorded Transformers videos this month. On 7 June, he accidentally posted a picture which contained a partially obscured photograph of himself at an amusement park in Finland, although he hasn't acknowledged this yet. He created his very own AI chat bot replica of himself via Character.AI, sharing and endorsing the bot as a substitute for asking him questions on 8 June. The next day, the donor Waltah White repeatedly called Chris's phone, in which Chris hung up quickly, angrily saying that Walt "betrayed" him and threatened to finally block his number. Chris would then remain pretty silent for the following weeks.

Chris in July 2025
Chris uploaded more prerecorded Transformers videos this month. On 23 July, he would be spotted back in Finland with Flutter, marking his fifth trip to the country. Notably, they were shopping at a market in Rauma, making it the first time they have been seen outside of the capital Helsinki.
