Chris Chan's Infamous Bag
Listed: 13 April, on Cwcvilleshopping.com
Price: $30
Sold: 13 April-16 April
Even more one-of-a-kind than Limited Edition, this bag has been the go-to purse and bag for Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu for well over half a decade from as early as 2013. This bag was seen and carried every time she went out for her errands and trips. Replaced since, now, this bag also sports a custom, duct tape crafted pocket for storing a phone or what have you that is flat behind the flap (which is personally autographed). The bag has two zipper compartments, shoulder strap with buckles and detachable pocket for small items; all remaining in good condition. The issue now is the zipper along the side of the bag, still functional for a while longer, needs to be replaced. It comes complete with personal Certificate of Authenticity, for rather you'd like to use the bag for yourself, or keep it as a rare collectable. Shipping is included in the price.
