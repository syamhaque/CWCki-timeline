Hey y'all! This is a disambiguation page — but I digress...
Note - In Chris's mind, Chris Chan, Chris Chan Sonichu, CPU Blue Heart and Night Star are all different forms of himself; there is only one Chris Chan with the ability to transform to these forms. The CWCki treats them differently to maintain readability.
Chris Chan may refer to:
Christian Weston Chandler's nickname.
Comic Chris, Chris's Mary Sue in the Sonichu comics. Now considered to be a separate entity in dimension C-197.
Chris Chan Sonichu, Chris's fursona.
Night Star, Chris's ponysona.
CPU Blue Heart, Chris's deity form.
Oh, My Chris Chan!, one of many exclamations used by Chris to refer to his messiah complex.
