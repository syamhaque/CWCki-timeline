On 14 June 2018, Chris uploaded two videos searching for a local technician for assistance with a Commodore 64. In the first video, a drawing of Cryzel and Magi-Chan can be seen taped to the ceiling over his bed.
Chris accidentally tilts the camera and shows that he had taped a drawing of his wife and husband to the ceiling over his bed.

Hey everybody, this is Christine Chandler coming to you live from home once again! And, today, I'm reaching out for a little help and assistance. As you can see right behind me [singing] da da da da ta da! [fumbles around with the camera] Get the camera.... See it too....
[Shows his monitor] So there's my self Commodore 64 monitor. And there's my floppy cassette drive with two joy sticks. Aaand.... here's my old BFF! [taps on keyboard]
Uhh, I got just about everything needed to put this thing back in this order once again and be able to play on it and... everything, but there's a slight problem. Yeah. It needs some TLC. I tried to get, uh, tried to fix it with a Lysol wipe, but the AV output, this thing right here. [Points finger near output] Yeah, it's got rust around the edges
So, I'm reaching out to a local in Charlottesville, Virginia. Whoever hears this video, please, I did take this thing apart myself, and look inside, and I also have this lovely...punch of literature [holds up some Commodore 64 manuals] that my father invested. [squealing] And right here...! [singing] Da da da da ta da... [flips open one of the manuals] [chuckles] Look at that! Shows the inside of the thing! Anyway, I think it's going to need a new phase...alternation line encoder, which I know that part has the...AV output on it.
And, also with that, I might, ah, ask the person to come over to bring a Y cable with three males on it. And, yes, go ahead, make a meme out of that...[singing] Y cable...with three males!
Okay, so, that's the update. Oh! Also, I'm not sure where it is, and I definitely need it, but I need the power cord for...the floppy drive, as well. I'm going to check eBay for an inexpensive one.
So, thank you all so much! Please, all responses to this video are to be sent to my email address: christine@cwcville.us! I'll put the e-mail address in the description below. Thank you!

Hello everybody, Christine Chandler coming to you live from home once again and right now... uh, I'm just showing off the problem I have with my C64 I mean it's not powered on right now but...
Here's the ol' monitor, you can see it's turned on and... my video's obviously recording it going... reverberating like that, but anyway, I'm gonna demonstrate that it does function on the front input and I had tested the... rear... input... as well... this PlayStation 1 console.
So, turn it on... [clicking] as you can see... [PlayStation 1 starts up] the input on the monitor works great.
So lemme turn off the console... there and I switch to... [grunting] I had managed to clean... bulk of the rust off of the single... video audio output from the console.
So I'm puttin' the... Y cable back in, which I found one up stairs. Three males.
[Sliding and clacking noises as Chris fiddles with his C64]
And... we're just gonna plug these back into the front...
Okay, so... turn it... on... making sure you can see that... aight... power light comes on...
As you can see, not much is happening up here...
Also do note that even though I have them connected, I'm not using the cassette drive, and... the floppy drive. I don't have a plug for that... right now.
[Chris sighs]
I do have a cartridge though. Sea Wolf. So we'll put that into the cartridge slot... in the back of the console.
Power it on again... Still, nothing.
So... [pause] Kinda stumped. Still need local help, it's probably something in the c-circuitry... I'm guessing, I don't know. I [don't] know squat... about circuitry... alright?
Heard it straight from me. I know squat about circuitry. [Pause]
So... requesting help locally from somebody in Charlottesville whose got... technolo- the technological knowledge to... y'know, go inside and all the parts and figure out... what the problem is... cause, I love this old friend of mine, y'know?
Anyways, so... I'll p-put the emailf... to contact me at... below this video and uh- hopefully I get a response to get this thing going again so I can play again.
And also, reminder: please... go to my gofundme page and... help me on voting up the funds I need... to go to the TooManyGames convention up in Pennsylvania. I'm very serious about that. Thank you.
