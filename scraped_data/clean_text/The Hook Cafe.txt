The Hook Cafe was the online personal-ad unit of Charlottesville's former local alternative weekly paper, The Hook. Some time in early 2010, Chris posted a personal ad at the Cafe under the blunt nickname "direct2sex," declaring that he "Need Sexy Sweets from Woman." A 90-day pass to the site cost $40, which meant that Chris had to use his monthly tugboat to put the ad up.
The ad was one of the most blatant confirmations that Chris was no longer interested merely in "true love," but was also pursuing the side quest of getting laid. This was not totally unexpected, as many of his followers had always believed that true honest love was merely a ruse to get some china, and that if Chris could get to the hanky-panky without having to actually care about someone, he would do so in a heartbeat.
Of note are the differences between this and his previous dating profiles. By this time, Chris had apparently been making an attempt at being a grown-up, and as a result he neglected to mention Sonichu, his autism, or the fact he was a 28-year-old virgin with rage. He also has started to specify a desire for women at least 21 (as opposed to 18) years old (but not older than himself, despite his pretty obvious desire for a mother-like mate).
This was not the first time Chris has posted a personal ad on The Hook Café. An earlier attempt, in which Chris had promoted himself as a "Handsome Virgin searching for Woman," had fallen victim to hackers around early 2009. Unfortunately, most of its original contents weren't preserved. It's the hacked version that's referred to in Chris's 20 January 2009 IRC chat.
Chris was able to solicit the attentions of a young lady named Jackie on this site. Thus began an on-and-off-again relationship lasting until at least February 2012.
On 9 April 2010, the moderators on the site deleted Chris's profile, possibly due to a flood of fake profiles set up by trolls. Several troll profiles were also deleted. With the death of this profile, Chris apparently shifted his efforts back to OkCupid as his go-to for soliciting sex via the internet.
On 27 December 2011, The Hook announced that it was shutting down Café for good at the end of the year. The magazine itself went under on 26 September 2013 and was replaced with C-Ville Weekly.

Ad
A screenshot of the ad, as of 5 April 2010.
The following consists of all the information included in the ad. All misspellings and unusual capitalizations are from the original page. The peculiar entry under "Religion" (which lists his affiliation as both "Methodist" and "None") might be the result of an error Chris made when filling out the form that produced his profile.
