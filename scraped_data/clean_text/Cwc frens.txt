Title: Cwc frens

================================================================================

cwc frens was a Discord server created by Klop, the founder of the Official CWCki Server, and run by Naught. It was originally designed to be a place for Chris to address his onlookers directly (since the CWCki Server had been deemed inappropriate for that purpose). The link was posted prematurely on the CWCki Server after Chris's banning, resulting in an invasion of weens. Moderators were quick to take control, and revamp the server so that spamming would be reduced.
Chris joined sometime during this period of chaos, and has since posted occasionally. A mailbag channel was created, where users could submit questions, and a Watchman would sort through them before privately delivering the appropriate ones to Chris.
The server was shut down in the early hours of 6 September 2020, seemingly by its owner, for unclear reasons.
The mailbag channel aspect was succeeded in the Discord server CWC Questions, where questions were sourced from users for the Discord Q&A.

This Temple is now nominated to be a PokeStop
20 August 2020
Hey, y’all.
Present topic: Yes, this Temple is now nominated to be a PokeStop.
Fortunately, ONLY Level 40 players can review and rate the nomination.
I will not be making the details on how to go about that public, just to be safe.
Other than that, presently, I continue to observe, participate, and follow the clues, cues and all other artifacts and events of great significance.
I am not able to speak out the specific details publicly, but I can state that everything is continuing to progress as foreseen and expected.
I will be in Cwcville, with this body, shortly enough.
As for how all of you can speed things along, the best answer I can offer for that question is thus: trust your better instincts that have nothing at all to do with hatred, malcontent or evil, and follow in best efforts on those as you each will, respectively.
Aside from that for now, all of you be safe and well.
And do keep attention and kind thought and care about me, about Mama Chris Chan, and about yourselves.
Thank you all.
