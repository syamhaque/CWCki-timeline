Subject: I did it
I humped it for eight sweating minutes, and I just gave you the song and dance; the music would NOT pick up easily on recording, and it was a BITCH for me even to try. I uploaded the zip folder with the files onto Megaupload.com, with the "From" and "To" E-mail addresses filled in with Mine and Yours respecively. I'm not sure it was successful, because I did not find it on the filemanager. Please let me know if you got all that.
NOW, I will ask you to GIVE ME BACK ALL FIVE of my Out-Of-USA PSN accounts; I will check for successful LOG IN upon receipt of Sign-On (e-mail address) IDs and Respective Passwords. If I am NOT satisfied with FULL Return of my Accounts AFTER I WENT THROUGH ALL THAT MOTHERFUCKIN' TORMENT AND TORTURE, it will be ON your head and In your nightmares.
Good Day.
I hold the Cards, I make the rules. Give me the Videos first.
I told you before. I know everything. I have connections everywhere. Just like I know that you're Sam. You really are a naive retard to think that I would fall for your "trolling." You're not as clever as you think you are.
Oh. By the way. "Jack Thadeus" never existed. I am the REAL Samantha. That's right. I planned every single move precisely. I purposefully let you get into the oxycleanfanatic account.
So for all this bullshit and you thinking you're so fucking clever I'm adding another condition. You are to sing VERBATIM(that means word for word since you're a little slow-minded) the song "It's Okay to Be Gay" and upload this to YouTube. And NO SUBTLE HINTS TO HETEROSEXUALITY. That means NO Sailor Moon posters or Optimus Prime dolls. Which is gay in itself. Do this and I WILL give back your accounts. If not. Well. You know what will happen.
Subject: FINE!
I'll do your song, but PLEASE, just answer this for me; WHAT was the ORIGIN of your Wanting to Troll the shit out of me? And DO NOT SAY, because I KILLED ANYONE, because I FUCKING NEVER HAVE; THEY KILLED THEMSELVES. What have I ever Done To You to make you Turn against me? WHAT THE FUCK?!
Subject: ALSO
I HAVE TO KNOW, WHY ME? WHAT INSPIRED THE DAMN TROLL FROM THE VERY START BEFORE NOVEMBER, 2007? WHAT THE FUCK DID I DO TO WHO? And all Respective WHEN, WHERE and HOW QUESTIONS AS WELL?!
I HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW; WHY MY NAME IN THE MUD; THERE ARE WORSE AND BETTER PEOPLE THAN ME, EVEN AS OF 2004. IN THE LONGEST TIME AS WELL, WHAT THE FUCK?!
Who the hell is the very first troll?
YOU STILL HAVE NOT ANSWERED MY QUESTION.
What Was The Very First Thing from your Point Of View that made you have at least an inkling Towards Wanting To Torture Me? WHAT THE FUCK?!!!
Who was the very first troll? That will answer your question.
Do it fucking over.
You were to sing this song like you did with your Girl Friend. You are to sing it with PRIDE!
Do it over NOW! & Don't try to change your voice in any tone! None of that Louie Armstrong Bullshit.
I plan to hold over my end of the deal, follow YOUR END!
I will improve it.
SHOW YOUR FUCKING FACE AND DANCE TO THIS SONG!
I am serious. I will do a retake and do it better.
don't forget to turn the volume up to the music!
& don't try to drown your voice!
I am in the full working process of that tomboy video, but I want to ask you one simple question with THREE SOLID ANSWERS. Please answer me truthfully.
What are the Names of your Friend at Sony, your Brother at NBC29, and that "Hungry" Reporter? I will keep the information private.
Your lost Then you won't recieve [sic] your psn emails. Unlike the other fucking trolls I am intending to give your accounts back disregard what my fellow trolls thought. This is why you get trolled in the first place.
I hold the gold, I make the rules.

0:29: On the sign, Chris has written (The word is "Stupid", NOT GAY, SO CUT_IT_OUT)
Throughout the video Chris has a poor disguise on.
4:00 Chris clearly sneaks in "It's NOT Ok to be gay" I believe I made it clear to not to change the lyrics in ANY WAY!
oh and i found this little comment under the tags tab..
http://img528.imageshack.us/img528/2561/trickeryfail.jpg
"IT'S A MOCKERY YOU DAMN DIRTY HOMOS!"
fuck you Chris. I intended/willing to give your psn back but now you have failed big time. This time I will add an extra demand.
Along with re-doing that video THE CORRECT WAY AS I ASKED SEVERAL TIMES. You will now do this following conditions.
You are going to host a puppet show, Chris. The one where Tails & Sonic commit a taboo behind Amy Rose. Tails & Sonic thought it would be nice to go out camping in the Wyoming Hills. Where Sonic & Tails will commit hot steamy GAY sex. This video must last for 15-20 minutes. 9 minutes of it dedicated for gay sex scenes in which you later pop your head out & ask if you could join them for the gay sex.
Oh & for pulling this bull shit with me starting at 11:00 am at your time, every 2 hours I will delete a psn account with no hesitation with the help of my sources.
Good Luck Chris. Can't wait to see your video done Right!
PS: You are now to wear feminine clothing (Skirt & all) when singing its okay to be gay.
I am of NO FURTHER CARE of those Foriegn [sic] Accounts. You may have the "upper hand", but I hold the future in my hand. The Power is HERE in my command. I have Real Life Friends and Trusted, Honest Individuals. I have played on with expectations, but if even you can not be humble to accept a Laugh at Yourself from Yourself, and if you will No Longer be Serious, I WILL NO LONGER PLAY.
And I am done with your oxycleanfanatic2264@gmail.com; I humbly return it to your control. The Password and Question's Answer is "oxystarscleanfanatic". You have LOST YOUR ONLINE FRIENDS "Jack", and Your Game Ends Now.
You failed to EVEN GIVE ME NAMES of your Trusted "Real Life" Associates upon Request. You are as weak as your Cocane and when you did the Jackson 5. Also, Rocky is an understanding Individual; she knows of my Trolling-Back Games, and she understands that comment I made in the IRC was an ACT, and my Pastor and Congregation will stand by me all the way during those times as well. I have ALL YOUR INFORMATION Saved In My Brain.
The ED pages are not worth Shit, and my Detective I have been working with In Real Life Here agrees with me. THAT SITE WILL GO DOWN IN A BLAZE OF VICTORY upon "Zordon's Revival".
Cut the "Gay" out of your "Stupid"; It Is Over.
Good day,
Christian Weston Chandler.

Subject: You Took My Adspace?
I'm feeling pissed off, because I was not informed of that transaction, but I am even more upset with the content of the ads. Please Change the icon for the Mexico Trip Contest to the Flag of Mexico, and Please REMOVE the... (UGH!!!) gay-rights ad.
And I do apologize for not answering your calls, but between you and me, I feel e-mail is preferred, because I KNOW it's you in the e-mail address, unlike on the Caller-ID that comes up "Restricted" or "Unavailable". If you at least told me your phone number, and NOT let it be Restricted, I would feel more likely to pick up.
*sigh*
Anyway, I heard you have more info on Clyde; please tell me in your reply.
Have a good day,
Christian W. Chandler.

I have noticed that you have reassumed control of the Cwcipedia Ad Space. Firstly, I humbly welcome your return. Second, I would appreciate it if you keep the ads NOT gross and offensive. Dicks and naked dudes are not cool. I am in support for gays and lesbians, and the ads can be more family-friendly. Looking back upon the past ads you had, I felt cool with the following:
-The Peter Griffin Ad.
-The rainbow flag Ad.
I will grant you full approval of your ads, As Long As the people in the ads are Fully Clothed, Not Kissing, Not portrayed In Bed, and LIMIT all Ads to ONLY the Side Bar Underneath the Control Panel Links; NO Ads on the Upper Area At All, Please. Hugging, Handshakes and hand-on-the-butt contact are cool. And I encourage you to use such photos for supporting Lesbians in an equal amount to the Gays, and Half of either one for the amount of Bisexuals.
I repeat: the people in the ad photos are to be Fully Clothed, Not Kissing, Not In Bed, they can be hugging, handshaking, slapping the butt, INCLUDE Lesbians and Bisexuals equally. And KEEP ALL ADS only in the Side Bar underneath ALL Control Panel Links.
I feel that these requests are agreeable, and I would appreciate your cooperation. Thank you, Jack, and Welcome Back.
Peace,
Christian W. Chandler.
