NOTE:
Chris has only used these slurs during the time he was being manipulated by the Miscreants group of trolls. He has not used them before or since. He has also never used the phrase "no darkies" - it was used in a piece of fan art, mocking Chris's specific requirements on his attraction sign.
Niggos is one of Chris's many minced oaths, this one meant to refer to black people. While he only used the term once, it has become a popular term among Christorians that use it to allude to Chris's history of problematic behavior where African American people are concerned.

Etymology of "Niggos"
His only known use of the term was in the 3 March 2009 chat, where BlueSpike coerced him into saying "BILLY MAYS is the new mayor of CWCville, and Christian Chandler will be thrown in CWCville jail, where he will be raped by a bunch of niggers." Chris repeated the line as ordered, but ignored his instructions and attempted to outsmart BlueSpike by saying "niggos" instead of the dreaded N-word. Yes, out of all the things Chris could have done, like...
Refuse to say "nigger",
Literally say "N-word",
Say something else like "blacks" or "African-Americans",
Bleep himself out, or
Just end the conversation,
He chose to coin a dumb and offensive term which, as if to add insult to injury, sounds like a lame brand of cereal. It should be noted that Chris's creativity was completely in vain. BlueSpike pointed out Chris's stupidity, and our autistic hero then went on to to say "niggers" several times at BlueSpike's prompting. He even warmed to the subject and started reciting "Don't Trust Them New Niggas Over There" on his own will until BlueSpike cussed him out for it. Chris has done this more than once before.[1][2]
Chris has never again used the word "niggo" and probably doesn't even remember the whole incident. Nonetheless, "niggo" is still considered a CWC-ism, and is classified as a CWC-neologism.
Chris and the actual N-word
“
Sit, Spin and Shut the Fuck Up, NIGGER!!! And I WILL call you That RIGHT IN YOUR FACE!!!
”
Chris, March 2010[3]
Thankfully, this is not what Chris actually believes.
Chris has used "nigga" or "nigger" on occasion, often in quotation.
According to a 2010 comment by TheRcholic (a YouTube account which is potentially Michael Snyder's), Chris used the words "nigger" and "black" as pejorative terms to describe others while attending The GAMe PLACe, which nearly led to him getting his ass kicked at one point. However, that claim is contradicted by Daniel Mimms, who said in a 2009 interview that Chris never used the word nigger.[4]
Chris's first recorded use of the word "nigger" is in Mumble 7, recorded 13 February 2009. Chris is asked if he watches the Adult Swim sitcom The Boondocks, and when he answers in the affirmative, he is asked to do an impression of the self-hating black character Uncle Ruckus. He responds by quoting the line "Don't trust them new niggers over there!" from the series' premiere episode. He would repeat this performance in Mumble 8 and BlueSpike PSN Chat 3.5. In the BlueSpike Skype Logs 10 and 11, however, Chris refuses to type the word, rendering it as "n*ggers". Chris is forced to say the word in Julie Reveals Herself, saying "niggos" before BlueSpike forces him to say the word.
In June 2009 Chris made up and sang a parody version of Uncle Ruckus's song "Don't Trust Them New Niggas Over There" called "Don't Trust Any Homos Over There". He modified most of the lyrics to make fun of gay people to establish his commitment to heterosexuality but leaves in references to "nigga fingas on the trigga".
As part of the SingStar Challenge Round 5, Chris recorded two cover versions of the song "Smell Yo Dick" by Riskay, which uses the word "nigga" multiple times. Chris's singing was extremely slurred and unintelligible, however – not because he was uncomfortable with saying "nigga" but because he was uncomfortable saying "dick".
Chris called the troll Surfshack Tito a nigger multiple times, both orally in the Chris Drops the N-Bomb video from 17 March 2010 and in writing in the Surfshack Tito e-mails, released shortly afterwards – even though Tito, like the Rocket Power character he's named after, is Hawaiian, not black. Tito, noticing this, made a video response to Chris using footage of an obese black YouTuber, obscuring his face while dubbing over an apology to Chris.
In the Lars Call, Chris says "I'll be yo nigga" and "I'm yo nigga" when prompted by Lars.
Once again referencing The Boondocks, Chris states in a March 2021 Twitter thread that the black Sonichu character Inos is not a victim of "Nigga Moments", a term used in the episode "Granddad's Fight" to refer to violent conflicts between two black men over petty incidents.
In Reading Chaos Crystal Control Act 4, Chris is tricked into giving a shoutout to "Nick Gurr", which is a common prank played on livestreamers. He has also been coerced to say "Knee Gur" and "Vinegar" on other occassions, as well as sang Don't Trust Them New Niggas several times unprompted.
