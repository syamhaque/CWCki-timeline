Some of the more ironic notes on the Charlottesville Free Speech Wall.
On 12 July 2009, a month after their previous outing, Chris hung out with his gal-pal Kim Wilson again, in an event referred to as Chris's Big Night Out II. It is revealed here that she has a boyfriend, but doesn't want Chris to know because he'll throw a huge hissy fit. Ironically, she says that right in front of him, but he's too busy "playing Guitar Hero" to notice (he also didn't seem to mind being around her previous boyfriend during their last outing together as well).

[Chris is kneeling down in front of the Charlottesville Free Speech Wall, where he draws Sonichu's head in yellow chalk. He draws a © under Sonichu and begins to write his name next to the drawing. At about 0:32 a woman crouches next to him to write something on the wall, and Chris takes a second to register this. He continues writing "Christian W Chandler is a Nice and Good Man". He straightens up and poses next to the drawing, giving the camera a thumbs-up sign.]
Kim: Okay, lemme take a picture.

[As Kim sets her camera down on a nearby table, Chris gets up with a microphone and gets ready to sing.]
Chris: Thank you!
[Chris talks to the DJ; we can't hear what he says due to all the chatter in the restaurant, but he's probably requesting that the DJ plays "I Want It That Way" by the Backstreet Boys.]
Kim: [laughs]
Chris: Yeah.
[The instrumental for "I Want It That Way" starts about 45 seconds in, and Chris sings his own lyrics over it, albeit changed in certain places]
Chris: ...'cause I need a sweetheart. [fervently slaps crotch] LADIES, ALL HANDS ON ME. [There are no takers, just laughter]
Man: [bewildered] Oh-whoa-WHOOOOA there, buddy!!
DJ: Alright, that's getting out of hand...
Man: Whoa-ho, you got that on film!

[Some girl in the background does a mediocre job of singing Pat Benatar's "Hit Me with Your Best Shot"]
Chris: [singing along] ...your best shot!
Kim: Oh, God....
Chris: I'm praying Guitar Hero!
Kim: [Laughs]
Guy: So, next time you're going to bring your boyfriend?
Kim: That might be a... bad idea.
Chris: [Whilst air-guitaring in such a way that would cause even the most amateur guitar player scratch his head, mouths "hit me with your best shot" in sync with the song]
Guy: You don't want him to know?
Kim: He wouldn't take it real well.
Guy: Huh?
Kim: He wouldn't take it well. Which is understandable, really. [laughs like Elmer Fudd]
Chris: [Hideously "struts" his "stuff" when the song gets to the guitar solo, imagining that he is air guitarring a badass solo... all on open strings!]
Guy: We got the guitarist right here, everybody!
We got the guitarist!
Kim: [Laughs and cheers]
[After another full minute of Chris making an ass of himself, the song is coming to a close]
Kim: Chris!
[The one and only creator of the Sonichu franchise finally sits his shameless ass down]
Kim: [Laughs]
Chris: [In a Southern accent] Star power, baby!
Kim: Yep.

Chris: All female hands on me!
Kim: [laughs] So, how does the drink taste?
Chris: [sighs] It—it's good.
Kim: Good?
Chris: [sounds a bit rapey] Delicious.
