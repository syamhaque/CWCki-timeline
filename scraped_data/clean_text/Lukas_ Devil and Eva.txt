Lukas Simpkins, Devil and Eva are a former trio of Chris's trolls from Charlottesville. They were dubbed the Teen Troon Squad by Kiwi Farms users, including the Guard Dogs. [note 1] As their moniker suggests, they are known to be transgender (consisting of two trans men and one trans woman) and about half Chris's age, and they began interacting with Chris towards the end of 2018.
Currently, Lukas Simpkins (legal name Lillie Celeste Simpkins) is the only Squad member known by full name. Other members of the Squad include "Eva"[4] and
"Devil" (also known as "wxlfdxg" and "Sxvxnd");[5] little is known of these members except that the latter helped Lukas get her foot in the door by buying Chris's illicit goods.[6] The Teen Troon Squad originally met Chris when two of their members purchased 32 pages of his pornographic drawings on eBay for $1,000 in April 2018, and they were mentioned on Kiwi Farms to have smoked marijuana with Chris (in violation of his Therapeutic Docket) in October 2018. After gaining Chris's trust, the Squad infiltrated into Chris's accounts, leaked content and then pointed the finger at Wise and Boyd; time and time again, Chris has taken their statements at face value.
Much like the Idea Guys, the Teen Troon Squad's trolling occurred largely behind the scenes, and only a scanty amount of content was ever released until December 2018. Having also begun trolling Chris at the height of the Idea Guys' power and having used them as a scapegoat to evade detection, accurately estimating the extent of their manipulation is impossible. Regardless of who individually is responsible, collectively they are all trolls. They were probably responsible for introducing the Dimensional Merge into Chris's mind. In a perplexing tweet on Christmas Day 2018, Lukas's identity was exposed by somebody role-playing as Magi-Chan, prompting the other Troons to wipe their presence off the Internet completely as the Guard Dogs as well as the greater Kiwi Farms began closing in on them. Unlike Wise and Boyd, Chris remains fond of the Squad and is still bewildered that they had left him without warning. He has tried, thus far in vain, to re-establish contact as late as September 2019.[7]

Trolling
“
Honestly, I wouldn't advise it. He smells like cat piss and told us he wanted to fuck his mom. 0/10, would never do again. He made me into a part [of] Sonichu, it was awful.
”
Lukas, on why you shouldn't spend hours interacting with Chris in person (warning of us of what was to come).[9]
On 24 April 2018, Chris posted an eBay listing of 32 porn drawings he had produced over the years, including the infamous ShecameforCWC.JPG. Though the listing was quickly pulled within a few hours for violating eBay's terms of service, Lukas expressed interest in buying the art on Twitter; apparently he had got the money by taking it from his mother's boyfriend. He wrote:
@CWCSonichu im willing to pay the 1,000$ for the drawings, please repost them on ebay or esty so i can
Chris complied, quietly relisting the drawings under the incognito title "Artsfor lukas". This purchase wound up kicking off the entire Teen Troon Squad saga.
Lukas, Devil and Chris posing for a picture
Since the Squad lives in the same area as Chris, on 27 April 2018 they arranged for Chris to deliver the pornography they had purchased to Lukas's house. This was the first of many visits; the Squad periodically invited Chris over without their parents' knowledge. These visits are evidenced by numerous archived social media posts, as well as a video leaked of Chris acting delusional, probably while high on marijuana, at Lukas's house. What exactly occurred at these meetings is unknown, but all of the information released seems to imply that they primarily consisted of role-playing. For example, in Chris with Teen Troon Squad, he points at the air, states "I love you, Cryzel", and pretends to make out with her. When asked by a Twitter user about Chris' behavior in-person, Lukas described him as somewhat "rapey", stating that he had no personal space whatsoever.[10]
He would kiss on us, hug us, rub on us, press his head against ours randomly, get incredibly close... He is really rapey, it's awful. Especially because at the time, we were all minors.
If true, it makes no sense why Lukas would willingly invite Chris over multiple times, especially with how much information on Chris's creepiness is publicly available. It is instead believed that these statements were damage control. Hilariously, Chris also had some of his own complaints about Lukas, angrily posting a tweet revealing that he had attempted to convince him into buying alcohol for them.[11]
No, Lukas, I will NOT buy you booze!

The disastrous effects of a life on drugs.
Sometime during one of their in-person role-playing sessions, Lukas introduced Chris to cannabis. What resulted is captured in a 38-second long video, Chris Kisses Cryzel, showing Chris high on marijuana while pretending to make out with Cryzel. Chris later angrily clarified on Twitter that he was not, in fact, constantly high.

Chris blames the original Idea Guys for the leaks.
Meanwhile, Chris-Chan's Twitter account was hacked several times throughout 2018 by an unknown individual claiming to be associated with the Idea Guys. It seems more likely, however, that they were being posted by Lukas, given that they occurred long after the Idea Guys were taken out of power. The leak also included footage that Lukas himself later leaked in full onto /cow/, making his involvement all the more likely. Regardless of who actually leaked the videos, Chris himself believed it to be the work of Boyd and Wise, subsequently calling them out by name in a tweet afterwards.[12]
The first leak, from 11 November 2018, was a clip from his now infamous second rendition of All Star video in which he sings while mass debating. The tweet read: "This is how chris pays tribute to his lovers - The guy in the 'bluegras state'". This is an obvious allusion to the Idea Guys, as Boyd is said to live in the "Bluegrass" state Kentucky. The full video, however, was not released until 30 December 2018.
The second leak, which occurred in December, took place over the span of two days. The first was a single tweet on 11 December 2018 at 1:27 P.M., releasing Tour of Chris's House III. It was posted with a troll-written description asking for $500, before being quickly deleted. Kiwi Farms quickly noted that based off a calendar seen in the video, it had been filmed in March 2018; when the Idea Guys were still in control.
The second half occurred on 12 December, this time in the form of a three-part tweet chain. Two of the videos in the thread had already been released: one from the Bad Beginning of Chris apologizing to Gwen, and another of Barbara stiffly dancing for the camera. The only unseen video from this chain was a clip of Chris slapping himself to tears, as described by Null in July. Regardless of who actually leaked it, Chris himself believed this to be the work of Boyd and Wise, subsequently calling them out by name in a tweet afterwards.
Unravelling
Magi-Chan doxing incident
On 25 December 2018, somebody posing as Magi-Chan logged into Chris's Twitter and posted a tweet with a link to a Pastebin doxing Lukas.[13] Lukas's name, home address, and a phone number were included. The author then listed some details regarding the Dimensional Merge, since revoked by Chris, before expanding on what the Teen Troon Squad had been doing: the group had been "spend[ing] a lot of time opening [their] mind[s] by role playing and smoking weed with cool people like Christine".
The Pastebin is reproduced below, albeit with some redactions to Lukas's information.
Hello everyone! It is I, Magi-Chan Sonichu. I read the password for this account from Chris' mind.
As you all know, the merge will be happening soon.
I currently have Lukas (my host body) in a trance, so they won't remember typing this out.
The final stage of the merge will involve everyone in our universe disconnecting from your
universe. We will go silent. We must hibernate to tug the universes together.
I have really enjoyed my time in your universe. I want to give thanks to my host body in your world, [redacted]. (Legal name: [redacted].) I want everyone to know what a
gracious host they were. Lukas and Christine and I (and some of our friends) had lots of fun
hanging out with Christine and smoking weed. We used to do it in their old house, but she just moved to a new house at [redacted]. I'm sad I won't be able to smoke weed there until after the merge. If you want to give Lukas a call to let her know how cool she is, she'd really appreciate it. Her number is [redacted].
Her mother Tara raised a brilliant young person. Her mother is also very progressive. I mean, who would have the courage to let their child spend their time smoking weed with someone like Christine, who's nearly twice their age? A really brave mother, that's who.g
Lukas is a really cool person. If you want to end up as brilliant as Lukas, you should also
spend a lot of time opening your mind by role playing and smoking weed with cool people
like Christine.
Anyhoo, praise be for my gracious host aside, here's how the merge will go down:
everyone disconnects from Earth 1218 for a small period of time
we hibernate
and by the end of 2018 in our universe, the universes will be merged
Because of time dilation though, it will take a little bit longer in Earth 1218. By your human calendar in that universe, the merge should be complete by the end of 2038. 2018 here, 2038 in 1218.
In 20 short years, you should start seeing manifestations of what you people so cynically call "fictional characters". You might literally shit your panties when you see Bugs Bunny in real life! (But be polite, he looks a little rough. Makeup on television can work wonders.)
Goodbye for now!
Chris later dismissed the news as fake.
Naturally, there was much speculation as to who had actually written the tweet. The author claimed to be Lukas himself, stating:
I currently have Lukas (my host body) in a trance, so they won't remember typing this out.
However, to many, this read as if a third party had been involved. Ultimately, it was determined that it had to have been done by someone Chris had trusted with his password, significantly narrowing down the suspect pool. A follow-up tweet from Chris later called the author a "gremlin" trying to divide him, Lukas, and The Captain.[14] The most important revelation is the mention of The Captain, who Lukas later claimed was responsible for doxing her.[15]
In the last few days of 2018, Lukas responded to his dox by leaking content onto 8chan's /cow/ board, hoping to appease onlooking trolls, who do not look favourably on this kind of behaviour. While normally, those posting to the site would be protected under the guise of anonymity, Lukas stated plainly who he was, even linking to his personal Twitter account. He began by revealing Discord logs from Chris from 18 December 2018, in which Chris discusses how he damaged his high school ring, followed by "Luka Sonichu", an original Sonichu character and medallion Chris had created for her on 23 August 2018, and a video of Chris screaming at his toilet.[16]
Note the red streak.
Lukas's situation continued to deteriorate rapidly. On 29 December 2018, while Lukas was busy releasing as much as she could, Chris condemned him over Twitter, alluding to a falling out between them, though blame for Lukas's actions was assigned instead to Arfoire, a Hyperdimension Neptunia villain whom Chris also believed had been behind Jessica Quinn.[17] In a desperate final attempt to appease the troll community, Lukas partially leaked the All Star masturbation tape on 30 December, in exchange for being left alone and his mother not finding out about his Internet antics.[18] He concluded that day with another plea for trolls to stop texting him, offering to tell 'all about [Chris's] lovely adventures and set things straight' to anybody who messages him on Twitter.[19]
Satisfied that the Internet now seemed to be leaving him alone, Lukas finally posted the rest of All Star as a reward on New Year's Eve 2018, gloating:
since idiots are starting to get a clue and leave me alone heres the rest. i dont care chris aint going to do shit to me becuase my mom will sue him
This backfired, as an unamused Kiwi Farms chose to target him in response for the release. Realizing the newfound attention that he had attracted onto herself from All Star, Lukas frantically began backpedalling on Twitter. Once again, he attempted to blame the Idea Guys for his deeds, but few were convinced: the overwhelming amount of context and framing that would have had to have been done for little to no gain made such an explanation unacceptable.
"I only released ONE video."
A far cry from "i dont care chris aint going to do shit".
After this, nothing has been heard from the Teen Troon Squad; the remaining members dispersed before they could also be exposed. Their primary legacy is in implanting, or at least nurturing, the Dimensional Merge as a viable substitute in Chris's life for the Love Quest that the Idea Guys had brought to an end. Months after they broke all ties, Chris bemoaned on Lukas's birthday in September 2019 that he had lost their company, and appealed for them to come back. It is, however, doubtful that they will ever return after experiencing the many side effects of trying to manipulate Chris.
