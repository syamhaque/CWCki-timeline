Hello everyone, slight update to the uh, plan there, in addition to the embargo f-, against the GameStop, Best Buy and Simon Malls.
[Creepy Stare commences]
We need to make sure dat Gamestop is well aware of this, and I'm not sure this is getting to the uh, one to four stores' address, so we need to go onto Facebook, look up the GameStop...page, and uh, message them, as well as posting onto their timeline, lettin' them know this unjustice must be undone, that I should be unbanned. Thank you.
