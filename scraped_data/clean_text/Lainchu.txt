This article is still yet to be completed due to stress. We get a lot of stressful torture in our lives that makes us crash into slumber. Given that inspiration is a big variable, and we may have been lacking of it, this article will be completed as soon as possible, at our own pace... HONEST! This article is missing the following:
• The Lainchu Manifesto
NOTE:
Despite the shenanigans that came about through the Lainchu persona, it wasn't created to troll Chris with.

Lainchu the Chronicler is an OC created by Chris, whose purpose was to document select chats in the Watchmen's Discord server The Place and elsewhere (and unofficially, to provide Christorians with first hand information), based on the protagonist of the anime, Serial Experiments Lain, in which a teenage girl finds herself engaging with a virtual world network, reminiscent of the internet. Naught has implied that he got Chris interested in the anime.[1]

Origins
Chris created the character out of feeling that he was being improperly "chronicled", attributed her to being the primary reason for all that's happened to him thus far, and introduced the character to Naught while venting about it.[2] Chris even attributed Lainchu to be the primary reason for why he couldn't find a sweetheart, blaming her for the "Chronicler Law" created by the Idea Guys.[3] Chris therefore entrusted Naught, and some of the other Watchmen, to channel and control her, thereby setting the record straight in Chris's favor.
The Players
Four people, all of whom were in The Place, had taken up the responsibility to take the role of Lainchu, all with varying results.
Naught
Naught, the original owner of The Place, has seemingly gotten Chris into the anime that the character was based on, which got him to create the character. Naught was also the first person to play the role of Lainchu. The exact date Naught started roleplaying Lainchu is unknown, but it can be assumed to be somewhere between 4 August 2020 and 7 August 2020, as Chris introduced Naught to the character in a leaked DM with him.[2] Naught handed over the role to Klop for reasons "he can no longer recall".[4]
Klop
Klop, the founder and first owner of the Official CWCki Server, was the second person to roleplay as the character. He took over from 7 August 2020 until 29 August.[5] After Chris had gotten banned from the CWCki server due to him being there breaking the server's philosophy, Klop created the cwc frens server with the purpose of letting Chris address his onlookers. A mailbag channel was created in this server, which later evolved into the CWC Questions server, where the Discord Q&A would take shape. Klop handed the role over to Anaxis due to stress in running the CWCki server and related servers, and losing interest in playing the character.
Anaxis
Anaxis, the third owner of the Official CWCki Server, was the third person playing the character and served as Lainchu from late August 2020 to July 2021.[6] He was also the most prominent player of the character, with Chris even deeming him the "One True Channeler" of Lainchu.
On 19 February 2021, the Watchmen banned Anaxis from their Discord server The Place. The Watchmen attempted to replace him with a Discord account run by The WCT.[7] However, Chris sided with Anaxis during the conflict[8][4] and continued to communicate with him outside of The Place.
The WCT
The WCT from mid February 2021 to March 2021, was elected by the Watchmen to take over the role of Lainchu after they had banned Anaxis from their Discord server.[7] WCT created a separate Discord account named "Lainchu (Current Host)" to interact with Chris; consequently, from Chris's perspective the Fourth Lainchu was a stranger. Chris rejected the Fourth Lainchu, stating that he sensed "Lainchu within Anaxis moreso than this dude."[4]
Documentation
Discord Q&As
The Discord Q&A is an 11-part question-and-answer series with Chris, consisting of questions screened from the community. Lainchu was involved for all but the first and fourth segments. Klop asked questions in Q&A 2 and 3, with Anaxis disseminating the conversations, and Anaxis handled Q&A 5-11. A Discord server, CWC Questions, was also set up by Anaxis to field questions for Q&A 5-11.[6]
Anaxis had tried to revive the Q&A on 25 March 2021, asking both Chris and Barb a series of 20 questions each, but Chris didn't answer the questions. Anaxis had posted about the unofficial "twelfth part" of the Q&A series in his manifesto.[9]
Lainchu Chroniclings
By the beginning of 2021, Chris had stopped regularly answering questions provided to him by observers, which meant that Anaxis, now under the role of Lainchu, had to seek out other ways to document him. By mid-January, Anaxis had regularly interacted with Chris, checking on him weekly and asking him if he felt ready to answer new questions, which Chris often ignored. As an alternative, Anaxis had decided to record Chris's texts in The Place, as well as DMs that Chris had with him, consistently. Anaxis, with Chris's permission, posted these recordings publically on the CWCki, and called them the Chroniclings of Chris Chan, or the Lainchu Chroniclings.[10]
Anaxis released three Chroniclings, or segments of chats which occurred in The Place, at Chris's request and with the permissions of server members. The Journey to the Merge (16 September 2020 - 9 January 2021), The Vaughn Interlude (3 January - 24 January), and Thinking with Portals (31 January - 8 February). Afterwards, a series of disputes by several The Place members resulted in Anaxis being removed. Chris, who took Anaxis's side, chatted in DMs instead, allowing Anaxis to release a fourth Chronicling, A Medium's Guidance (9 March 2021).[6] Chris also authorized Anaxis to release a fifth one, which Anaxis gave the working title A Future in Motion (17-18 March 2021), however Anaxis opted to hold off on doing so, though eventually released it as part of his essay The Lainchu Manifesto.
Watchmen infighting
Main articles: Imposter Lainchu and Anaxis Bird
The Watchmen group, particularly during its iteration in The Place Discord server, was prone to infighting issues. Drama from infighting had an effect on the Lainchu role.
During late 2020, The Place member MKRNightVee, joined later by Val, showed hostilities towards Anaxis, who held the Lainchu role.[11][12][13] On 19 February, Kyle, who had recently been made owner of The Place, attempted to resolve the disputes by banning Anaxis.[6]
In DMs, Anaxis, who had been preparing for another Discord Q&A, mentioned to Chris that he had been removed from The Place but was not given a reason.[14] Chris then asked The Place what Lainchu had done to be kicked out.[15] Kyle, later joined by Naught and MKRNightVee, responded with various accusations and rumors about Anaxis, though did not provide proof.[16][17] Chris disagreed with Kyle's remarks and requested that he allow Anaxis back in.
In the second layer of The Place, which Chris did not have permission to view, the Watchmen attempted to replace Anaxis's role of Lainchu. The WCT was voted in to take over the role.[7] In doing so, WCT created a new account named Lainchu (later renamed to Lainchu (Current Host) at Kyle's suggestion).[18] Creating an alternate account proved to be a misplay; from Chris's perspective, the new Lainchu account was a stranger. Chris called out the attempt to replace Anaxis, saying, "on the flip side, you're not the original Lainchu" when the alt account tried to interact with him.[8]
