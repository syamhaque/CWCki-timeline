================================================================================

Chris-chan Discusses... is a series of July 2009 video interviews between Larry Bundy Jr., a.k.a. "Guru Larry", of Channel Awesome (formerly That Guy With the Glasses), and the Internet's favorite autistic manchild, Christian Weston Chandler. Guru Larry is the second big-name fan of CWC, along with animator Harry Partridge.
While a normal person would see Larry is clearly insulting Chris to his face, Chris's autism prevented him from comprehending Larry's blatant sarcasm. The only thing Chris picked up on was that Larry was using the Bulk and Skull theme from Power Rangers, which has negative connotations. This was the second time that Chris gave a public interview.
Chris obviously has no idea whatsoever how to conduct an interview, shifting all of the pressure to Larry and trying to avoid answers which force him to be creative or think a bit, especially in the beginning. He constantly cuts off Larry and has no tact.
For a long time, only selected extracts were available, until Guru Larry released the full interview on 30 August 2012.

Caption: Some of my long-term fans may remember I once held a series of interviews with Chris-Chan in June 2009.
I never uploaded the full version before, due to the amount of editing it needed for lip-syncing due to lag. Also, because I lost what I thought was the only copy during a hard drive failure.
But by total luck, I recently discovered a back-up copy.
So after some pain staking, [sic] re-editing, synching, and general HD upscalingness, For the first time ever... the highly demanded full, uncut Chris-Chan interview!
Larry: -Sec, yeah, you got it? That's better. And how d'you get rid of the graphics on the screen as well?
Chris: The, uh, the what on the screen?
Larry: Oh, there you go. Now I've got rid of them. So there you go. So yes. That's, that-yeah, that's quite good. Did you know that- Do you know that there's a little twisty thing on the front of your camera that makes it zoom in, as well, so you can do that close up.
Chris: Uh, um...
Larry: So that's... So that, that little th- you know that th- you know that little plastic thing in the front, you can twist it, see, look. (puts hand on camera, which zooms out, then back in.)
Chris: Yeah.
Larry: So that's... quite good... So yes, let me just... try and get comfortable, there you go... There you go. So, uh how should-how should we start this, how do we start to... start this?
Chris: Well, like how you would normally start an interview.
Larry: Okay. Uhh... Let's have a s- let's have a thing out to start this... Okay. Three. Okay, now let's just move this camera just... tiny bit. There you go. Hello, and welcome to my first introduction for a YouTube celebrity. A first- I can't say it. Uh... How should we- how should we start it? How shall I intr-pronou-How shall I announce you, how would you like to be announced?
Chris: Uh, however you feel.
Larry: Okay.
Chris: Like you want to announce me.
Larry: Okay. All right, I'll prepare-I'll announce you as Sonichu creator, shall I, or... will that be... good? Okay, um...
Larry: Hello, and welcome to my very first interview with various people… from the Internet! And with me tonight, we have Christian Weston Chandler… uh, best known on the Internet for- creator of Sonichu, the Electric Hedgehog Pokémon! Hello, there, Christian!
Chris: Yep. Hello.
Larry: So... Yes. Good. Uh, so, uh, we're gonna be talking about E3 today, so, uh, what about- you know the- Start again from the overall thing, what's your overall opinion of uh, the video games on there this year. What do you think of them?
Chris: Oh yeah, I like the games, they're very good. Especially interested in the uh, y'know, God of War 3 and uh, the PSP version of Little Big Planet.
Larry: Yeah. Oh, I didn't know that. And what do you- What do you think of the PSP Go, is that something you might be buying, or...
Chris: Yeah, I might buys that for myself, but I would be keeping my PSP-2000 as well.
Larry: Oh, yeah, so-
Chris: Cause, y'know, I have a bunch of UMD games...
Larry: No, you don't wanna get rid of that just yet.
Chris: Yeah.
Larry: You're not being tempted to modify it or anything, so you could play copied games on it, from the hard dr- the Memory Card?
Chris: Yeah.
Larry: Oh, That's good. Anyhow, um, okay, we'll talk about the first thing, I don't know if you know about this, um, Microsoft, um, what do you think about their new camera? ...That got out, that you can interact with things.
Chris: Hmm. Umm... I don't know much about the... Xbox- uh, you're talking about the Xbox camera?
Larry: Mmm. Well it's- it's sort of a... they're trying to- it's sort of like, uh, the next level of EyeToy, really, the same thing where you sort of interact with it, so you can watch what you're actually doing in a game, like if you're doing- you're doing a steering wheel, and it can actually copy what you're doing, and that, so I was just wondering if that's- if that would ever interest you into ever purchasing an Xbox, or...
Chris: Mmm. Mmm, yeah, that sounds pretty good. I mean I saw wha-dat- I saw the thing that they did for the, uh, PlayStation Eye, with the uh, two six. And the- (Chris is cut off by Larry)
Larry: Well, yeah, you mean- you mean the Wiimote, the lollipop stick coming out. The lollipop on the end.
Chris: Yeah.
Larry: So, yes.
Chris: Yeah, those are pretty neat.
Larry: Yeah. (Larry begins to speak but is cut off)
Chris: Yeah, let me talk about Little Big Planet PSP for a bit.
Larry: Alright.
Chris: Yeah, ak- as you know, uh, yeah, some features I'd like to see, for the PSP version. I'd like to have it, uh, where I can sync up with the pee- with the original PS3 version, and, uh, copy the, uh, stickers and costumes and objects, that, uh, originated from the PS3 version, as well as the downloadable content...
Larry: Mm.
Chris: Cause I'm sure a lot of us would love to be able to play the uh, play in the spaceman suit that we, uh, got, uh, at the release of LittleBigPlanet, or even as Kratos or Nariko. (At this point, Larry tries and fails to get a word in edgewise and fails.) And uh, an-a-nd also another thing question, I mean uh, whatever happened to the uh, real Media Molecule... Ibuh the Rare Mol- Media Molecule shirt that they talked about at the beginning? It never came out!
Larry: Oh. Have you tried contertactiong them about it? Or anything? Or...
Chris: Yeah, I tried tal- I tried contacting them about that, uh, haven't got a response yet.
Larry: You'd think they'd- You'd think they'd contact you, I mean, they did favorite one of your videos once didn't they, I mean, you are one of their stars, after all.
Chris: Uh, okay, yeah.
Larry: So, ah, yes. So, uh, what- and the, you, you-I didn't know you was a big fan of god of war, I thought you were opposed to, uh, violent video games.
Chris: Oh, I like, uh, the- I like violent video games sometimes, the... I mean, I was, I mean I was particularly-I got particularly interested in the God of War series, I've been playing Chains of Olympus.
Larry: Oh yeah. You know, being- (cut off)
Chris: And I put-
Larry: -Buy the PS2 one for-
Chris: -especially, the... Yeah, I mean I don't have the, uh, God Of War 1 or 2, but I did get Chains of Olympus, and, uh, you know, amongst, uh, everything in the game, I particularly liked the, uh, fun little bit with the uh, two naked ladieeees! Hehe!
Larry: Um, excellent. (speaks over Chris) It's a shame you don't get to see it, though. Same, yet they always move the camera away.
Chris: Yeah, but... Still, they way they uh... shake that candle bit, that's good enough.
Larry: Yes. And, uh... Also-uh, what else? uh, what is your opinion on Gran Turismo? Have you ever... sort of into that series or anything? 'Cause they keep sayin'- you know, they keep delaying it over and over again, is there anything you'd ever be interested in?
Chris: Yeah. (pause) Ugh, excuse me. Yeah, I like the- I like the uh, Gran Turismo. What date was that at the E3?
Larry: Yeah.
Chris: And, uh, it's a pretty good racing game.
Larry: Hm. That's good. (the two stutter as they try to decide who speaks first) ...You go first, go on.
Chris: Okay, and I still have the, uh, Gran Turismo HD thing that they released before they did-a long time before the, uh, GT5 prologue. I still have that saved in my hard drive. On the PlayStation 3.
Larry: The demo, yes. So do you- do you have a high-definition television to see it, or...
Chris: Yep. I have an HD television.
Larry: Oh, nice. And, uh, what else... Uh, how about Nintendo, now? So, what's, uh, what was your views on Nintendo's outshowings this year?
Chris: Hm. I didn't see much about their take on-about what they did at the E3, because I only had the, uh, what Sony did over at the E3 downloaded from the PlayStation Network...
Larry: Yeah.
Chris: But uh, yeah, you know, whatever Nintendo is doing, uh, you know, they have my support.
Larry: Okay. Well, I- I'll tell you a couple of games they're bringing out this year. They're bringing out, uh, New Super Mario Brothers Wii, it's a sequel to a DS game, on the Wii. And it's gonna be four players, so it's gonna be- It's a bit like LittleBigPlanet, and it's gonna be like, you know, four people can play at the same time.
Chris: Alright.
Larry: So, what do you-what do you think of that sort of game?
Chris: That sou- that sounds pretty good.
Larry: So yeah, that's coming out later. And they're also bringing out a sequel to Super Mario Galaxy, Super Mario Galaxy 2.
Chris: Yeah, I've heard of that.
Larry: So, yes. Is that- is that- (Chris tries to talk over him and fails) Something that you'll be buying, or...?
Chris: Yeah, I might buy that, I mean, the... I like the Super Mario Galaxy 1. So, Suboio Galaxy 2 sounds like something I might, uh, go- I would consider buying. Yeah.
Larry: Oh, that's good. And, uh, there's a new Metroid Prime- there's a new Metroid game coming out, and it's
made by the people who made Ninja Gaiden, as well, that's coming out.
Chris: Huh. That sounds pretty good.
Larry: So, yes, there's gonna be-it's gonna be- Basically, it's Ninja Gaiden with, uh, Samus. So...
Chris: Hm.
Larry: It's gonna be quite good. And, uh... Ooh! Yeah, it was a bit dry this year, actually, for uh, Nintendo, I mean there wasn't too many announced, I mean, uh, but how about- How about the, umm, the new uh, the new Wiimote? The uh, the uh, motion controller. What do you think about that?
Chris: Hmm, yeah, it's a- yeah I think it's pretty good, I mean, gives a more uh, ease of controlling the uh, Wii-the, uh, Wiimote, among other things. Yeah, sounds like a pretty good peripheral.
Larry: You know- you know, I think it's something they should have really put in there in the first place, rather than make us pay a game for something that they left out.
Chris: Hm.
Larry: So, yeah. And also, um, what do you think about [unintelligible] metal-new Metal Gear Solid games coming out on Metal Gear games?
Chris: Oh, yeah, I like- Oh yeah, I'm a- yeah, those like, yeah, the Metal Gear Solid games, yeah, those are- yeah, they sound, uh, pretty good, especially the uh, I mean the- I mean, I mostly heard about the Peacemaker, they're doing for PSP-
Larry: Alright.
Chris: -Sounds better than-it sounds better than what they did previously on the previous, uh, Metal Gear Solid games for the PSP.
Larry: Ah. So you did buy the, uh, Playstation 3 version, then? {{w|Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots|Metal Gear Solid 4]]?
Chris: Uhhhhh, not-not yet, but I'm planning to.
Larry: Oh, that's good. So yes... Uh, what else can we talk about then, uh, for E3? Um... how about uh, Sonic games? Have you, um, there hasn't been much in the way of new... [unintelligible] Sonic games released, so...
Chris: Oh, yeah, I mean- I mean I know they're doing the, uh, that a new Sega Rally race for... Yeah, Sega Super Stars Racing.
Larry: Oh, yeah.
Chris: And Sonic and Tails get their car. Get cars. It's pretty mu-it's pretty much, uh, I mean, I feel like it's- like, uh, Sonic Drift and Sonic Drift 2 get an upgrade for next generation, and, uh, I like it.
Larry: Do you think Sonic actually needs a car, being if he runs so fast?
Chris: Heh. No, I don't think he needs the car, but it's like, you know, it's a, it's a car racing game, so it just makes it m- it just makes it more appropriate. I mean, they gave him- I mean, I mean in Sonic R, they gave him a chance to race against, uh, vehicles in Sonic R, that was fun.
Larry: Hm. Yes, that's- I did actually like Sonic R. I must admit, I do enjoy the music in that game. (Sings the first verse from the game's theme song)
Chris: Yeah. Yep.
Larry: So yes, did uh, did you own- you owned a Saturn, uh, do you still got one?
Chris: I'm sorry, what?
Larry: I said, you- you owned a Saturn as well, don't you? So you must've, you must own Sonic R.
Chris: Yeah. I do.
Larry: Oh, that's good. So yes... also, uhh... ano- another thing a lot of people have been asking me to te- ask this. Uh, what do you think of the voice actors for Sonic the Hedgehog? [pause] I mean there's- I must say there's- there's somebody out there on the Internet who's uh, very opposed to, uh, Jason Griffith. Uh, doing the voice of Sonic the Hedgehog. What do you think about that? You bothered with the voice?
(Chris strokes his chin thoughtfully.)
Chris: Y- I pretty much like the- uh, original voice they've been going with this whole time. Uhh... changing it, uhh... would be uh, I don't know- I don't know if it- well it depends, I would have to compare the new voice and compare it to the old voice to - um, make an opinion. Although I will s- although I will say this. In comparison to the animated series, y'know, where they had the- uh, kid who was Urkel originally voicing Sonic the Hedgehog... versus uh... what- who they have for Sonic X and the video games... uhh.. I'd say- I'd say the newer voi- I'd say the newer guy does it much better.
Larry: Ah.. No. There's uh- There's uh, two guys doi- uh, there was the guy doing it in Sonic Adventure and Sonic Heroes, it was a guy called Ryan Drummond. But then they- uh, they fired him because he couldn't make it to New York. They hired this guy called Jason Griffith, and they uh-
Chris: [speaking over] Oh, that's too bad.
Larry: So yes. So yeah, basically, uh, everything you hear now at the moment is Jason Griffith, and I was just wondering if you thought- y'know- If you notice any difference?
Chris: Hmmm. I didn't really notice a difference.
Larry:
Oh that's good. So you- yeah. So... you reckon that someone made uh- started making... per- petitions to uh, have him fired and that, is a bit over the top?
Chris: Hmm.
Larry: I mean, would y- would you say that's going a bit far or...
Chris: Uhhhmm... yeah, probably. Sounds like it was going a bit far, yeah.
Larry: Oh that's good. So yes. So th- It's a- It's a guy called, uh, Spax3. Have you ever heard of him?
Chris: Uhhnn... I'm sorry... uhh... dax three?
Larry: Spax. S-P-A-X. 3.
Chris: Oh! Spax... uhh... no, I've never heard of that one.
Larry: Ah. Yes, it's a guy, yes. He's not a very nice person. He uhm, he uh... he actually has fantasies about Cream the Rabbit as well, don't know if you know about that.
(Chris's eyes bug out and start to dart around the room)
Chris: Ohhh...[pause]...oh... huh. [another pause] Uhm, is this- is this like a villain character, this Spax?
Larry: No! No, no! He's a- He's a real person. He's a real person. Uh, he- uh, he- uh, doesn't like people saying that. That, he- uh... likes... rabbits. He gets very upset about it. Yeah, he says he has uhh... y'know, there's a big thing on- loads of trolls on ED who want to keep saying that he likes having sex with a rabbit.
Chris: Huh...
Larry: He wants to have sex with a six-year old rabbit. So. So, do you- do you find that disgusting at all?
Chris: Mmm... Well, I mean, that's his decision but I personally do not promote bestiality, as a matter of fact, I'm against it, and the Bible is against it, so uh... I- y'know uhh... he has his opinions, and he has his rights to his own opinions but personally, I'm against it.
Larry: Even if they're half-human?
Chris: ...Uh... even if...?
Larry: I mean, 'cause they're like, Sonic the Hedgehog, he's- he's sort of half-human, he's not like a proper hedgehog, he's like half-human. He's got two legs and stuff, so.. does that SORT OF count?
Chris: Uhhmm... uhhh... I don't there is, uhh... any hu- any half-human there... uhh... Yeah, I'd still say he's uh... all-animal. I'd still say they're all-animals. They just been given-uh... human form... it's not necessarily making them "half-human".
Larry: No. So, so- uhhh... So you wouldn't say there's any human in Sonichu or anything, either then? When he's, uh, completely a Hedgehog Pokémon. Or there's no, other way 'round it... even though he stands on two legs?
Chris: ...Yeah.
Larry: And-uh, also, uh, how about, uh, we'll go back to gaming now, actually, so uh, uh, what else can we think of, uh, how about, yeah. Are you uh, are you buying a new DSi? Or have you bought one already?
Chris: Uh, I'm thinking 'bout buying one. It's pretty-it sounds pretty good, it's got like uh, like, it's own built-in camera, it's good for on-the-go [unintelligible]-thinking.
Larry: It's got two cameras. It's got two cameras. It's got two-
Chris: Okay.
Larry: Yeah, it's got two cameras. One you can film yourself, one you can film other people. And it's also got, like, uh, it's like a Wii, as well, it's like, you got like a Wii shop where you can buy DS games on there. So far.
Chris: Yeah. Yeah, no, it's uh, it's too bad that the- Yeah, it's too bad, though, they took away the uh, GBA slot, so it's like, you could not play- you could not play GBA games, or, uh, even the Guitar Hero on there.
Larry: No. Uh, I think they do that because, uh, basically, they, they think they might- do they make GBA games anymore? Can you still buy them new?
Chris: Sometimes, yeah.
Larry: Of course. That's good. So yes. So uh, yes, so what do you think about the future of gaming, what would-what would you think is the next big thing in gaming? What I mean-what would you like to see in effect?
Chris: (coughing fit) Excuse me.
Larry: Is that Fanta?
Chris: No. Root beer. (Chris says this with a slight tone of malice.)
Larry: Okay. Has it got alcohol in it?
Chris: I'm sorry, what?
Larry: I said, has that got alcohol in it?
Chris: No, root beer does not have alcohol in it.
Larry: Oh, that's good.
Chris: I mean, it's a soda pop.
Larry: Oh, okay. No, I think- I think that it has alcohol in it if you're in Germany. They have alcohol in lots of stuff. You can now- you can buy alcohol from McDonald's in Germany.
Chris: Huh.
Larry: Yes. So you can have a Big Mac and a beer. Stuff and all that.
Chris: Okay. Um...
Larry: Ah yes, interesting fact.
Chris: Um... Yeah. Might talk to Damien about a thing like that.
Larry: Yes.
Chris: My sweet thang. Mmm... Umm... Yeah, I definitely um, would like to see... Yeah. Um, a little-A little bit more motion sensor control actions in like, PlayStation 3 games, I mean like, I mean like in High Velocity Bowling, they did pretty good with y-using the- taking the Sixaxis controller, and uh, and then this, and then you make like, like that's a bowling ball, and you're throwing that.
Larry: Yeah.
Chris: Yeah, I'd like to see more, uh, stuff like that in the PlayStation 3, cause then that would give them, like, an edge, er, uh, against the, I mean, um the competition with Nintendo, with the motion sensors and the Wiimote and Nunchuk.
Larry: You don't think this, uh, this controller they're bringing out is trying to compete with the Wiimote, then? The one with the lollipop at the end?
Chris: Yeah. [cough] Yeah, I figure that's a fair-it's a fair competition. I mean, like, you know, final version, yeah, they should definitely do something like, you know... You know, it doesn't look all that similar, but, you know, it has all the buttons of the Sixaxis on it as well, yeah.
Larry: Ah, that's good. Is that-is that something you'll be getting?
Chris: Yeah.
Larry: Do you reckon they'll have-probably use it for LittleBigPlanet 2, or something, or...?
Chris: Yeah.
Larry: Oh, that's good. So yes. And, uh, you're no- you're not into PC gaming at all or anything, are you?
Chris: Yeah, I'm not into PC gaming.
Larry: I know, so what do you think of the announcement that s- uh, that Xbox Live might be free soon as well, that they're... the only thing you can do is uh, they put adverts on the [unintelligible']
Chris: (talking over) Oh, really? Oh, really, they're gonna make that free?
Larry: Well that- they say that, the trade-off's that you'll have to watch some adverts on the main screen, that's it. I mean, would you, would you get an Xbox, would you get on on Xbox Live if it was free, but you had to watch a couple adverts?
Chris: Yeah, probably.
Larry: And you can actually finally play Halo as well then, sorta get into that. What do you play online at the moment, apart from life? PlayStation home, I mean.
Chris: Mmm... yeah, yeah probably.
Larry: Okay. Um. No, I mean what are you into at the moment in online gaming, I mean what sort of games do you play?
Chris: Um, like online, uh, I like playing LittleBigPlanet' online, uh, among other game titles, I can't remember the names of them. I can't remember the names at the moment.
Larry: Ok.
Chris: That's that would be uh, that's a lot for me to think about though, yeah.
Larry: Ok uh, did you buy Ghostbusters as well?
Chris: Uh no I didn't get that yet, but yeah but I like what I've seen so far, if they release a demo then I would download that...
Larry: Yeah.
Chris: If I don't buy the game first...
Larry: So what was the last game you bought?
Chris: Uh, yeah, last game I bought... which one was that [coughs a bit] yeah I bought the new Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (video game), that was pretty good.
Larry: Oh, that's good.
Chris: Yeah I like and I've seen and I saw the movie last Wednesday and I thought it was awesome. I don't care what the critics- how the critics put it down... I thought it was a very fun movie and it did have a good story to it and I enjoyed the story.
Larry: That's good. Yes there's enough-
Chris: I mean you know, critics will be critics... I mean like you know some of 'em get paid to praise it and some of 'em get paid to haze it, and you know I just think like you know in general I don't care for those who haze it. I mean, I mean like you know, Transformers has been uh ve-, has been uh very good and they have their own history, especially in generation one, you know in generation one they had some humor, and uh, whatnot, in uh, in the characters and in the story, so I'm thinking so I'm feeling like uh the uh movie is very much following that theme, and I think I think Michael Bay is doing a good job with that.
Larry: So yes, Optimus Prime did die in the second one then?
Chris: Yeah, he died but yeah [clears throat] but they brought him back to life shortly enough with the Matrix of Leadership.
Larry: Yeah, that's good because you don't want any kids to lock themselves in their rooms for several days, and all that...
Chris: Yeah, yeah, especially like you know in the generation one, they brought him back to life episodes later in the two part episode.
Larry: Yeah.
Chris: [fake-sounding cough] Excuse me. I got a frog in my throat! He's using my tonsils for a lily pad!
Larry: Oh dear! So yes...
Chris: It's a little joke I picked up from Red Skelton.
Larry: He is indeed a master of comedy!
Chris: Yep! Very funny man.
Larry: Yes.
Chris: And a good human being as well.
Larry: Oh, that's good. Uh, what else are we gonna say, yes... Uh, what-what f-... what's with that bruise on your head, as well? How did you get that?
Chris: Bruise on my head?
Larry: Yeah, you got a cut on top of your head there, the other side, the other side, the other side, yeah.
Chris: Oh, it's just uh, it's just a bug bite.
Larry: Ah, ok. I thought we had a bit of a ruckus at a wedding or something.
Chris: No, no, did not have a ruckus at the wedding. It was a nice wedding.
Larry: Oh I see. What sort of wedding was it? Was it a church wedding, or a-
Chris: Yeah, it was a church wedding.
Larry: Oh, that's good. So, uh-
Chris: With a reception and cake.
Larry: Hm, so uh... How old is your cousin?
Chris: Uh, he's at- he's about, uhh... Yeah, he's a little bit younger than me, but he's in his twenties.
Larry: Ah, okay. So yes. Is that- is that something you'd like to do, get married in a church, or...?
Chris: Yeah, I'd like to get married in a church, yeah.
Larry: Ah that's good. That's good news. So yes. Uh, let's have a look, anything else. Would you, um... Hmm... Is there anything else you'd like to ask about, me to ask you about at all? Stuff?
Chris: Hmm. Uh, yeah, but it's just, y'know, I think, uh, couple of, I think uh, I'd like to address a couple more LittleBigPlanet issues.
Larry: Okay.
Chris: Yeah, let's see, we talked about linki- linking up with- between the PSP and PS3 versions... With the copying the costumes and the stickers and all that... Mmmm... See, it's like... Expandable memory usage, for like, y'know, y'know, people are just gonna continue collecting the objects from the custom levels And uh, creating their own levels, but it's like, y'know, you keep on go- you keep on creating and collecting and like, you g- it's not- it's- you collect too much, and then uh, you won't be able to save your profile. Uh, on your, on your, on your hard drive. I'd like to see, like, y'know, like expandable memory, like, y'know uh, it, like, it grows as you collect, the memory?
Larry: Yeah.
Chris: Yeah, so, yeah, I'd like to see that. And, uh, also, another thing I'd like to see - a soundtrack to uh, music on LittleBigPlanet, cause it's good music.
Larry: I think it's all licensed and it'd be pretty hard to-
Chris: (cuts in) Pretty good music, I'd like to, uh, see it...
Larry: Yeah, a lot of it is licensed, that might be a bit hard.
Chris: Yeah, I liked it. Yeah, especially uh, also the uh... Heh. I mean, like, y'know, I guess, y'know, people probably pirate the uh, one song that put the game in the question that delayed it's release by a week or two. Remember that?
Larry: Oh. Yeah, it actually got released in Britain with that... My copy had it on.
Chris: ...Heh.
Larry: It's actually on the disc- It's actually, the song is actually on the disc, but they released a patch to remove it.
Chris: Yeah. I've heard about that, yeah.
Larry: So if you got rid of that patch... If you got rid of that patch you could actually listen to it.
Chris: Yeah, yeah I know, I've heard- I've heard about that, but... Still, I mean, like, y'know, game soundtrack would be good. Yeah, even, like, y'know, if they released it in the PlayStation Store, like they did with soundtrack to, uh, PixelJunk Monsters.
Larry: Yeah.
Chris: And then put that up for sale, yeah, I would, uh, definitely pay, like, ten, twelve bucks to, uh, download those tracks.
Larry: That much, eh? So yeah. So what would you...
Chris: Yeah.
Larry: What would you like to have included into LittleBigPlanet in future. I mean, what sort of, uh, characters and designs and stuff?
Chris: Yeah, I- I mean, like, y'know, I liked what they're doing about the uh- What they talked about at E3, uh, doing Disney characters? But I'd like to see... Transformers. Like, y'know, Me- like for y'know, Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Starscream and Megatron or even, like, Soundwave from Generation 1, that'd be cool.
Larry: Yes. I agree.
Chris: Make it even, like, y'know,two sets of costumes, y'know, one from Generation 1 and one for the movie.
Larry: Hm.
Chris: And a whole buncha stickers!
Larry: Ah.
Chris: That- That'd be awesome.
Larry: Yes, it would be then, yes. Also, uh, oh, another thing about Sony, what do you think about the new Shadow of the Colossus
game coming out?
Chris: Oh yeah, I've heard about that. Yes. Yeah, yeah it sounds pretty good.
(Larry attempts to talk but is shot down)
Chris: Yeah, yeah, yeah I saw I- yeah, I saw the, uh, I saw the, uh, stuff about The Last Guardian, yeah. It looks pretty good.
Larry: Oh, that's nice. (He is once again interrupted)
Chris: Yeah, well also there's also [incoherent] LittleBigPlanet, Little Big Pla- I played the, uh, the uh, Ico level, I don't know if you uh, played that or not, but, you know, it's go- it goes really in-depth, it's got, uh, you know, you can't, uh, win it, you don't get a prize for anything yet, because, you know, the- you know, the game where you have to pass the way to move on.
Larry: Yeah.
Chris: Yeah, I mean, it's a level that- yeah. You know, I think you know what I'm talking about, but you drag the lil- but you drag the lil, but you drag the uh, glass sword along with you, and you, uh, play along with this, uh, glass sword... that you have to wield in order to defeat the witch at the end. Yeah, th-that's I-I-I would like that level, a lot of people did too, it's like, possibly one of the, uh, greatest levels anyone's ever created on LittleBigPlanet.
Larry: Oh. That's good. (Larry's sentence is interrupted by Chris's violent coughing.) What do you think of this notion that you may have to pay for some levels on LittleBigPlanet as well, they announced that at the beginning, would you ever pay for any, or...?
Chris: Uh, I'm sorry, what was the question?
Larry: I s- uh, at the bit- when a little bit of panic when it first came out, they said that some people are really good at le- at levels and they might charge for them, so I don't know if you'd ever be prepared to pay for any.
Chris: Mmm. Uh, yeah, uh, yeah that does not sound- that does not sound good to me, uh, it should continue to be free.
Larry: Even if it was for a dollar or something, like a dollar or something...?
Chris: Mmm. Uh, yeah, I would disagree with that. It does not sound good to me, I mean playing a level- for uh, paying a dollar to play a level that I cou- that I could previously could play for free, yeah, charging to play a level, tha- ju- that's not good. That's not good.
Larry: That's not cool. So what do you think- (Chris's coughing interrupts him again.) Uh, so would you ever charge for a Sonichu level, if there was a Sonichu level, would you charge for a Sonichu level, or would you let people have it for free?
Chris: Uh, yeah, I mean, like, I'd let them- yeah, I would say, uh, let 'em play for free, yeah.
Larry: Yes, then you could spread the love of Sonichu to the world.
Chris: Yeah.
Larry: So uh, what are your plans at the moment in terms of Sonichu, what are you working on at the moment?
Chris: Yeah, I'm working on some more comic pages, and, uh, som- a little something for BigPlanet. Yeah, I-go-I gotta lot going on in my noodle here. The wheels are turning, and uh, inspiration comes and goes. But, it's be- its be-
Larry: You should write them down, you should write them down before you forget.
Chris: Yeah, I write them down.
Larry: Oh, that's good. Always have a notepad handy.
Chris: Yep.
Larry: So yeah, you can't- you can't give any sort of secrets or anything that might be big happening in the Sonichu world?
Chris: Well, I'll say- I'll say this one thing, my car is an autobot.
Larry: Oh! Wow. Is it- is it definitely a good one, or a Decepticon?
Chris: Oh come on, I just sa- I said it was an autobot.
Larry: Oh, that's good. Cause you're on the side of good aren't you?
Chris: Yeah.
Larry: So, yes.
Chris: Yeah.
Larry: Yes, that's good. Umm, so what else are we gonna talk about, as well as, umm, so what- is Clyde Cash going to be involved in your comic anymore, now that he's dead?
Chris: Uh... oh. No, no, no, no. No. No, I don't think that, uh, he's gonna be anywhere in my comics.
Larry: So his- his image won't defile your pencil with his vile facial features.
Chris: Yeah.
Larry: Oh, that's good. Uh, is uh, are you gonna be announcing Billy Mays' death in your comic as well or anything, or...?
Chris: Oh... oh yeah, well lemme just, uh, I mean, I've already uploaded a video onto youtube but lemme just say that once again, I neve- he never was the mayor of CWCville, when I made that segment(?) on the YouTube, I was blackmailed into doing that by, uh, the uh, quote-unquote Julie [inaudible] a little thirteen-year-old brat, so I was lying out my ass when I said that.
Larry: Ah.
Yes-
Chris: So I've been- So I've always been the Mayor of CWCville and I still am. There's no question about it.
Larry: Now it was- it was quite hard to tell if you were lying or not, 'cause then we couldn't see if you were holding Optimus Prime, so... if it was on video, we would have noticed right away you was lying...
Chris: (coughs) Well, yeah, well, I was lying right out of my ass when I said- when I said that, um, that I was a... homosexual... lyin' out my ass when I said that, when everyone knows I'm damn straight.
Larry: Yes, of course! You're indeed a fine role model for us heterosexuals!
Chris: (visibly hesitates) ... Yeah.
Thank you.
Larry: You're welcome. ... So, um... yes... what else... anything else that you'd like to announce, like...? (mumbles things to announce)
Chris: Uh... no, I don't think so, not at the moment.
Larry: Any sort of, uh, announcements for trolls, or anything -- just to get rid of them -- disgusting, vile people! (Chris starts to speak) I HATE them! I wish cancer on them!
Chris: Yeah, well, I'd say, well- very much down with the, uh, ED website, and, uh, I'd tell the trolls -- just leave me alone.
Larry: Yeah... that's good, yes... you should, you should, they should... ere they feel your wrath!
Chris: (hesitates again) ...yeah...
Larry: And what's happening with your Wikipedia page, as well, how's that developing?
Chris: Uh, yeah, it's coming along. Uh, one day- one day at a time, one upload at a time... I'm workin' on it.
Larry: That's good... what do you think about people saying that you have to have it notable, [unintelligible] proof, rather than just 'cause you said it?
That's the bane of Wikipedia.
Chris: (coughs) I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand the question.
Larry: (speaks up) I said, a lot of things, a lot of times, on Wikipedia, you have to make it noteworthy... you know, you have to find proof of what you say is true.
Chris: Oh, yeah-
Larry: Have to, uh, walk around that.
Chris: Mmmm. (strokes chin) I would say, uh... go with the word of faith.
Larry: Yes. (pauses) Yes, very wise-
Chris: I mean, uh, it's like, you know, you find out Wikipedia, you know it's true, like you know, I read in the, I read the announcement video about Billy Mays, about, well, I quoted Wikipedia about Billy's cause of death, which was basically something like a heart attack.
Larry: Yeah.
(Chris and Larry talk over each other for a moment.)
Larry: You do know that he was involved in a plane crash the day before, as well.
Chris: Oh...
Larry: Yes.
Chris: Yes, I suppose that would put a lot of stress, then... to, uh, further induce the heart attack, yeah.
Larry: So, yes, uh... that could be... you weren't, you weren't flying the plane, though, we'll get that straight, were you flying the plane?
Chris: Yeah, I was not- Yeah, I was not flying the plane, I was in Red Oak with my mother and my relatives.
Larry: Okay... okay, so you've got no ulterior motive towards his-
Chris: I have no ulterior motives. I want to- in fact, I forgot to say this in the video: "I have often confused Billy Mays with Richard Karn from Home Improvement, 'cause they both look and act- both looked, acted and sounded alike."
Larry: You mean they're both fat and got a beard?
Chris: Uh... no... I'm talking about the- you know, aside from the beard, like you know the other facial features,
and the voice... I just often confused, uh, Billy with- with Richard Karn.
Larry: Yeah, I often confuse people with fictional characters as well, so... It's- it is quite easy to do. So, uh-
Chris: Yeah.
Larry: So what- what do you think of the people calling for, uh, Adam Stackhouse to be the new mayor of CWCville, as well?
Chris: Uh. No, no, no, no. I'm still Mayor of CWCville, there is no elections. I mean, that's just a whole bunch of, uh, rumors on the internet, that the, uh, trolls are, uh, just talking amongst themselves... (Short pause) Uh, just do not believe anything that comes from the trolls...
Larry: Okay.
Chris: It's all just a bunch of, uh, rumors- all bunch of false rumors and lies.
Larry: (Nods)
Chris: (Short pause before Chris coughs into the camera)
Larry: Ah-
Chris: Yeah, excuse me, I've come down with a bit of a bug in my throat.
Larry: Ah. Have (?) we had a frog in there earlier?
Chris: (Hesitantly) ...Yeah.
Larry: What have you put down your throat lately, Chris?
Chris: (Slightly annoyed) Uh, no, but seriously, I have a bit of a virus in my throat.
Larry: Ah. So yes, I'm sorry to hear that.
Chris: But, yeah, that's why my voice sounds different, in case you hadn't noticed.
Larry: Yeah, you say- you sound a little bit croaky.
Chris: Yeah.
Larry: Have you had- have you had much rest, or...
Chris: Yeah, I've been, uh, yeah- I pretty much came down with, uh, the starting of this, uh, throat virus yesterday... but, I'm taking it easy, uh... had some ice cream, had some, uh, lemonade, and tea... and some OJ. Yeah-
Larry: You could go with-
Chris: I've been working on-
Larry: You could try gargling mouth wash, 'cause that's got antiseptic in it. Antibacterial.
Chris: Hmm. I have not thought about that, but I will take it into consideration.
Larry: That's good. (Pause) Thank you.
Chris: Yeah. Okay, so, uh... That it for the interview?
Larry: Yes, I think that'll be it, thanks. Thank you ever so much for this, uh, interview there, Christian.
Chris: That's, uh-
Larry: Hopefully we can talk again sometime in the future.
Chris: Yeah, okay, that's okay. Yeah, happy to do it. So-
Larry: Yeah, thanks so much.
Chris: Okay, well, I gotta go. Y'all take care.
Larry: Oh! Can y- I- Can I just say one more thing- Could you possibly say, uh, give a shout-out to my sorta girl- my girlfriend Shannon, please? Just say, "Hello, Shannon"?
Chris: Okay. Hey, Shannon. (Waving) Hello.
Larry: Thanks. Thanks very much!
Chris: Uh- Alright, y'all take care.
Larry: Yeah, you too.
Chris: Alright, bye-bye.
Larry: S-see you soon. Bye-bye!

"I'm damn straight!"
Chris: (fading in)...you know, I read in de uh- read in the announcement video about BILLY's MAYS- about uh, well I quoted Wikipedia about BILLY's cause of death which was basically something like a heart attack.
Larry: Yeah.
Chris: And I was in Red Oak the whole weekend.

Larry: Ah. Yes. If I could a-
Chris: I- SO I BIN- So I've always been the mayor of CWCville and I still am, there's no question about it.
Larry: Ah. Now it was quite (Chris coughs) it was quite hard to tell if you were lying or not because we couldn't see if you were holding an Optimus Prime ... I saw ... so, uh, so if it was on video we would known you was lying.

Larry: Yes of course, you are indeed a fine role model for us heterosexuals.
Chris: Yeah... thank you.
Larry: You're welcome.
Chris-chan Discusses... Spax3 & Jason Griffith
Note: For anyone wondering who Spax3 (real name: Alexander/Edison Prins-Stairs) is, the best way to describe him is if ED was an Olympic sport, Spax would have the silver medal to Chris's gold.
Other note: Up until Larry informs him otherwise, Chris is under the impression that "Spax3" is a new character in an upcoming Sonic game. How he came to this conclusion is unknown. You are welcome to speculate, though.
Jason Griffith is Spax's equivalent of the Man in the Pickle Suit.

Transcript
Larry: Yes... also, uhh.. ano- another thing a lot of people have been asking me to te- ask this. Uh, what do you think of the voice actors for Sonic the Hedgehog? [Pause] I mean there's- I must say there's- there's somebody out there on the Internet who's uh, very opposed to, uh, Jason Griffith. Uh, doing the voice of Sonic the Hedgehog. What do you think about that? You bothered with the voice?
Chris: Mmm... Y- I pretty much like the- uh, original voice they've been going with this whole time. Uhh... changing it, uhh... would be uh, I don't know- I don't know if it- well it depends, I would have to compare the new voice and compare it to the old voice to - um, make an opinion. Although I will say this. In comparison to the animated series, y'know, where they had the- uh, kid who was Urkel originally voicing Sonic the Hedgehog... versus uh... what- who they have for Sonic X and the video games... uhh... I'd say- I'd say the newer voi- I'd say the newer guy does it much better.
Larry: Ah... No. There's uh- There's uh, two guys doi- uh, there was the guy doing it in Sonic Adventure and Sonic Heroes, it was a guy called Ryan Drummond. And they- uh, they fired him because he couldn't make it to New York. They hired this guy called Jason Griffith, and they uh-
Chris: [speaking over] Oh, that's too bad.
Larry: So yes. So yeah, basically, uh, everything you hear now is Jason Griffith, and I was just wondering if you thought- y'know- If you notice any difference?
Chris: Hmmm. I didn't really notice a difference.
Larry: Oh that's good. So you- yeah. So... you reckon that someone made uh- started making... per- petitions to uh, have him fired and that, is a bit over the top?
Chris: Hmm.
Larry: I mean, would y- would you say that's going a bit far or...
Chris: Uhhhmm... yeah, probably. Sounds like it was going a bit far, yeah.
Larry: Oh that's good. So yes. So th- It's a- It's a guy called, uh, Spax3. Have you ever heard of him?
Chris: Uhhnn... I'm sorry... uhh... Dax3?
Larry: SPAX! [Spells it out] S-P-A-X-3 ...
Chris: Oh! Spax... uhh... no, I've never heard of that one.
Larry: Ah. Yes, it's a guy, yes. He uhm, he uh... he actually has fantasies about Cream the Rabbit as well, don't know if you know about that.
Chris: Ohhh...[pause]...oh... huh.[another pause] Uhm, is this- is this like a villain character, this Spax?
Larry: [Speaking over] No! No, no! He's a- He's a real person. He's a real person. Uh, he- uh, he- uh, doesn't like people saying that. That, he- uh... likes... rabbits. He gets very upset about it. Yeah, he says he has uhh... y'know, there's a big thing on- loads of trolls on ED who want to keep saying that he likes having sex with a rabbit.
Chris: Huh...
Larry: He wants to have sex with a six-year old rabbit. So. So, do you- do you find that disgusting at all?
Chris: Mmm... Well, that's his decision but I personally do not promote bestiality, as a matter of fact, I'm against it, and the bible is against it, so uh... I- Y'know uhh... he has his opinions, and he has his rights to his own opinions but personally, I'm against it.
Larry: Even if they're half-human?
Chris: [Pause] Uh... even if...?
Larry: I mean, 'cause they're like, Sonic the Hedgehog, he's- he's sort of half-human, he's not like a proper hedgehog, he's like half-human. He's got two legs and stuff, so.. does that SORT OF count?
Chris: Uhhmm... uhhh... I don't there is, uhh... any hu- any half-human there... uhh...
Chris: Yeah, I'd still say he's uh... ALL-ANIMAL. I'd still say they're all-animals. They just been given-uh... human form... it's not necessarily making them "half-human".
Larry: No. So, so- uhhh... So you wouldn't say there's any human in Sonichu or anything, either then? When he's, uh, completely a Hedgehog Pokémon. Or there's no, other way 'round it... even though he stands on two legs?
Chris: [Pause]... yeah.

Transcript
Larry: Right, so, uh, we're gonna be talking about E3 today, so, uh, what about- Start again from the overall thing, what's your overall opinion of the uh, video games on there this year. What do you think of them?
Chris: Oh yeah, I like the games, they're very good. I personally interested in the uh, y'know, God of War 3 and uh, the PSP version of Little Big Planet.
Larry: Yeah. Oh, I didn't know that. And what do you- What do you think of the PSP Go, is that something you might be buying, or...
Chris: Yeah, I might buys that for myself, but I would be keeping my PSP 2000 as well.
Larry: Oh, yeah, so-
Chris: Cause, y'know, I have a bunch of UMD games...
Larry: No, you don't wanna get rid of that just yet.
Chris: Yeah.
Larry: You're not being tempted to modify it or anything, so you could play copied games on it, from the hard dr- the Memory Card?
Chris: Yeah.
Larry: Oh, That's good.
Chris: Yeah, let me talk about Little Big Planet PSP for a bit
Larry: Alright.
Chris: Yeah, ak- as you know, uh, yeah, some features I'd like to see, for the PSP version. I'd like to have it, uh, where I can sync up with the pee- with the original PS3 version, and, uh, copy the, uh, stickers and costumes and objects, that, uh, originated from the PS3 version, as well as the downloadable content...
Larry: Mm.
Chris: Cause I'm sure a lot of us would love to be able to play the uh, play in the spaceman suit that we, uh, got, uh, at the, uh, release of Little Big Planet, or even as Kratos or Nariko. (At this point, Larry tries to get a word in edgewise and fails) And uh, an-a-nd also another thing question, I mean uh, whatever happened to the uh, Real Media Molecule... Ibuh the Rare Mol- Media Molecule shirt that they talked about at the beginning? It never came out!
Larry: Oh. Have you tried contertactiong them about it? Or anything? Or...
Chris: (licks lips) Yeah, I tried tal- I tried contacting them about that, uh, haven't got a response yet.
Larry: You'd think they'd- You'd think they'd contact you, I mean, they did favorite one of your videos once didn't they, I mean, you are one of their stars, after all.
(licks lips) Okay yeah.
(cuts)
Chris: It's just, y'know, I think, uh, couple of, I think uh, I'd like to address a couple more Little Big Planet issues.
Larry: Okay.
Chris: Yeah, let's see, we talked about linki- linking up with- between the PSP and PS3 versions... With the copying the costumes and the stickers and all that... Mmmm... See, it's like... Expandable memory usage, for like, y'know, y'know, people are just gonna continue collecting the objects from the custom levels And uh, creating their own levels, but it's like, y'know, you keep on go- you keep on creating and collecting and like, you g- it's not- it's- you collect too much, and then uh, you won't be able to save your profile. Uh, on your, on your, on your hard drive. I'd like to see, like, y'know, like expandable memory, like, y'know uh, it, like, it grows as you collect, the memory?
Larry: Yeah.
Chris: Yeah, so, yeah, I'd like to see that. And, uh, also, another thing I'd like to see - a soundtrack to uh, music on Little Big Planet, cause it's good music.
Larry: I think it's all licensed and it'd be pretty hard to-
Chris: (cuts in) PRETTY GOOD MUSIC I'D LIKE TO, UH, S-
Larry: Yeah, a lot of it is licensed, that might be a bit hard.
Chris: Yeah, I liked it. Yeah, especially uh, also the uh... Heh. I mean, like, y'know, I guess, y'know, people probably pirate the uh, one song that put the game in the question that delayed it's release by a week or two. Remember that?
Larry: Oh. Yeah, it actually got released in Britain with that... My copy had it on.
Chris: ...Heh.
Larry: It's actually on the disc- It's actually, the song is actually on the disc, but they released a patch to remove it.
Chris: Yeah. I've heard about that, yeah.
Larry: So if you got rid of that patch... If you got rid of that patch you could actually listen to it.
Chris: Yeah, yeah I know, I've heard- I've heard about that, but... Still, I mean, like, y'know, game soundtrack would be good. Yeah, even, like, y'know, if they released it in the Playstation Store, like they did with soundtrack to, uh, Pixeljunk Monsters.
Larry: Yeah.
Chris: And then put that up for sale, yeah, I would, uh, definitely pay, like, ten-twelve bucks to, uh, download those tracks.
Larry: That much, eh? So yeah. So what would you...
Chris: Yeah.
Larry: What would you like to have included into Little Big Planet in future. I mean, what sort of, uh, characters and designs and stuff?
Chris: Yeah, I- I mean, like, y'know, I liked what they're doing about the uh- What they talked about at E3, uh, doing Disney characters? But I'd like to see... Transformers. Like, y'know, Me- like for y'know, Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Starscream and Megatron or even, like, Soundwave from Generation 1, that'd be cool.
Larry: Yes. I AGREE.
Chris: Make it even, like, y'know,two sets of costumes, y'know, one from Generation 1 and one for the movie.
Larry: Hm.
Chris: And a whole buncha stickers!
Larry: Ah.
Chris: That- That'd be awesome.
Larry: Yes, it would be then, yes.

Larry: What do you play online at the moment, apart from life? PlayStation home, I mean.
Chris: Mmm... yeah, yeah probably.
Larry: Okay. Um. No, I mean what are you into at the moment in online gaming, I mean what sort of games do you play?
Chris: Um, like online, uh, I like playing Little Big Planet online, uh, among other game titles, I can't remember the names of them. I can't remember the names at the moment.
Larry: Ok.
Chris: That's that would be uh, that's a lot for me to think about though, yeah.
Larry: Ok uh, did you buy Ghostbusters as well?
Chris: Uh no I didn't get that yet, but yeah but I like what I've seen so far, if they release a demo then I would download that...
Larry: Yeah.
Chris: If I don't buy the game first...
Larry: So what was the last game you bought?
Chris: Uh, yeah, last game I bought... which one was that [coughs a bit] yeah I bought the new Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen video game, that was pretty good.
Larry: That's good.
Chris: Yeah I like and I've seen and I saw the movie last Wednesday and I thought it was awesome. I don't
care what the critics- how the critics put it down... I thought it was a very fun movie and it did have a good story to it and I enjoyed the story.
Larry: That's good. Yes there's enough-
Chris: I mean you know, critics will be critics... I mean like you know some of 'em get paid to praise it and some of 'em get paid to haze it, and you know I just think like you know in general I don't care for those who haze it. I mean, I mean like you know, Transformers has been uh ve-, has been uh very good and they have their own history, especially in generation one, you know in generation one they had some humor, and uh, whatnot, in uh, in the characters and in the story, so I'm thinking so I'm feeling like uh the uh movie is very much following that theme and I think I think Michael Bay is doing a good job with that.
Larry: So yes, Optimus Prime did die in the second one then?
Chris: Yeah, he died but yeah [clears throat] but they brought him back to life shortly enough with the Matrix of Leadership.
Larry: Yeah, that's good because you don't want any kids to lock themselves in their rooms for several days, and all that...
Chris: Yeah, yeah, especially like you know in the generation one, they brought him back to life episodes later in the two part episode.
Larry: Yeah.
Chris: [Fake sounding cough] excuse me. I got a frog in my throat! He's using my tonsils for a lily pad!
Larry: Oh dear! So yes...
Chris: It's a little joke I picked up from Red Skelton.
Larry: He is indeed a master of comedy!
Chris: Yep! Very funny man.
Larry: Yes.
Chris: And a good human being as well.
