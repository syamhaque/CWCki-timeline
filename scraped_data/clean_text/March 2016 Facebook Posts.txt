PS4 Thanks

Thank you, Miss Kagney Lynn Moore from Seattle, Washington, for the PlayStation 4 and the Blue Controller. I also appreciate your swiftest redemption of the voucher I have sent to you, and I will have your twelve figures ready to be shipped out to you in a couple of months.

Kim Wilson called him out (10 March, 9:15 am).
I think you should revise this post. You make it sound like Kagney Lynn bought you the PS4. But you actually bought it yourself.
You should probably edit and clarify your post.
Someone working for Fingerhut sent me some details of your order: http://pastebin.com/PxHrGbw1
They established to me that they work for Fingerhut and most of the information seems to check out.
Anyway, when you get a chance, Christine Weston Chandler, update your post to clarify! Enjoy the PS4 you bought! :) :)
She linked to a Pastebin post:

Social anxiety

I just watched this video. Here's a thought out honest response: We ALL have our own Social Problems and Troubles. Autism counted, I have and have had More than my fair share of social problems. And I am certain there are people a lot worse off than I am and I feel sorry for them. Among that, I feel like Everyone who constantly has to keep their eyes on their phone to socialize; That in itself is a Social Problem. Not to criticize, but to face socializing offline should definitely be Award Worthy, and to not be eyeing the phone screen for more than a second is a Hallmark too. Hey! You in the basement! There is Life going on Outside too. Come Out and Play! There's Portable Dreams you can play and talk face to face an one on one with Outside.
Yeah...
I have a lot of anxieties of my own too. http://youtu.be/8kiGgz60xvE

Both the Original Autism Tutorial Video, AND the spliced-together Full Video with my Commentary are now on the CwcvilleGuardian Channel. Enjoy them both, but you'd be good to go to My Earth in LBP 2 or 3 and view the animation parts as they were originally intended. https://youtu.be/rqTn8bORBt8
