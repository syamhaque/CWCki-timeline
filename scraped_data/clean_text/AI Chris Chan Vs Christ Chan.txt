================================================================================

AI Chris Chan Vs Christ Chan is a series of YouTube videos in which various songs of different languages are "sung" by an AI Classic Chris voice, and then by current Chris.
The videos' description refers to them collectively as a "Neo SingStar Challenge" and a "Worldwide Musical Journey." The premise is that, across the series, Chris will sing at least one song from every language Duolingo offers, although thus far Chris has mostly covered songs from the languages he's already familiar with or has shown interest in learning. Aside from the one German novelty song, his selections have been from English, Japanese, Hebrew, Finnish and Swedish. He's also already tackled Duolingo's only two novelty pop culture conlangs, Klingon and High Valyrian (from A Song of Ice and Fire/Game of Thrones). While Chris's vocal performances so far arguably rank among his most competent, that's not to say they're good. So far, it seems that AI Chris has the upper hand, despite Chris's best efforts. Only time will tell if Chris can make a comeback (probably not).
On 14 March 2025, when asked when there will be more, Chris replied that he has "a few more songs in the queue,"[1] acknowledging the pre-recorded nature of the videos. Another trip to Finland has been under speculation, as a theory for the pre-recorded videos is that they are to cover for Chris while he is away for several weeks at a time.

He proceeds to sing and mime airdrums for the second playing of the song, which has no AI Chris singing.
Grund Zum Feiern
Chris's German language entry. This is a novelty cover of Billy Joel's "We Didn't Start the Fire" in German, listing various forms of alcohol. According to the description, it appears Chris came across the song thanks to his old friends at TF2 Analysis, who likely used it in some of their videos. Chris has the gall to call this a "bonus episode" when it's only the second video in the series.

Sakkijarven Polkka
This video in particular is notable for being both the second song in Finnish Chris has sung and for not including the AI version of the song. The lazy title and the added note in the description, as well as the fact that the song Chris has sung back in March 2024 still hadn't been released suggest that it was a prerecorded video put up on the channel to maintain a consistent upload schedule.
The footage of Chris singing is noticeably sped-up; he may slowed down the song while singing it, and then sped it up in post, due to finding the fast pace of the song difficult to keep up with.
