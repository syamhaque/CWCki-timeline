Chris is at it again with overpriced merchandise!
CWCville Shopping was a website created by Chris on 23 November 2019 to sell his custom Twilight Sparkle's Secret Shipfic Folder cards and, on 17 December 2019, his official Sonichu comics and two fan comics. The site, much like his others, was extremely bare-bones and poorly designed. The home page featured a backdrop of the first eight Sonichu comics yet the only products available at launch were the card packs. They were all quite expensive; Chris cited the cost of printing for this.[3] Chris used a website called Make Playing Cards.com or MPC for his print on demand, similar to his use of Lulu when selling his comics on Etsy.[4][5] Chris's website was created with Weebly.
As of 30 August 2020, the website is offline. In a Twitter post from 28 September 2020, Chris stated that the site was closed since he wasn't able to pay the monthly fee to keep it up on time.[6]

TSSSF Sonichu Deck
Twilight Sparkle's Secret Shipfic Folder returns with many a powerful Lightning Bolt and Psychic Power.
Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu (Chris Chan Sonichu) is the (in)famous author/creator of Sonichu and Rosechu, and the Nation of Cwcville, VA. Magi-Chan Sonichu is the guardian over the Sonichu and Rosechu species of Pokemon, as well as the Guardian Angel, Mentor and Devoted Husband to Chris Chan Sonichu. Both Chris Chan and Magi-Chan are prolific and powerful, and they also enjoy the finer and simple things in life. Among which, they dabble in Fanfics and Shipping, and inserting themselves where needed. Shipping themselves to make more allies and friends.
But, in this situation, they ship each other, their friends, and their families together, regardless of relation, orientation, species, or harmonious or clashing fur, hair, mane and coat colour combinations.
In order to help them fulfill their efforts and goals in bringing everyone together against the forces that want to harm us, you can help us write perfect and crazy fanfics. You take turns expanding the shipping, joining Sonichus, Rosechus, Humans, Ponies, and what else with Ship cards.
If you are the first to make one of our narrative Goals a reality, you earn the points for that Goal! Of, you also earn the shame and glory (depending on how you look at it) for enabling the penchant for shipping us and our friends and family, but nobody is perfect.
This Deck can be played with or against the original Twilight Sparkle's Secret Shipfic Folder (TSSSF) Core Deck and past-printed Expansion Packs and Promo cards.
This Deck includes a combination of Four Start Cards, and the Goal, Ship and Pony Decks to make this a game many people can play together; contains 172 cards of the finest Lightning and Psychic Power.

TSSSF ArizonaSlime Expansion Pack
Putting an end to the Endless War with SlimeCo.
The show so far: Nightstar Sonichu got ahold of a sample of the Smooze and accidentally got some in her green eye; she then saw into Dimension C-197's Arizona where the worst kind of warfare was going on. Recognizing Phantom Horn and Strawberry Milk as Trolls with Good Hearts, she sends them both to look into the situation. PhH. and S.M. wandered the streets, as they were forced to go into mining slime that was a result of the company of SlimeCo in the city of New Los Angeles City, a.k.a. New Milwaukee, Arizona. After suffering from the violence, hatred and the worst possible kinds of Trolling, having learning their lessons from the experience, they pray for a solution to these set of problems. I show up, personally, to set these ending wheels into motion. -Chris Chan Sonichu.
Mini-comic strip, "Slime and Punishment", chronicling the events prior to this point was written and drawn by Ben Saint.
TSSSF Sonichu Deck or Core Deck are required for playing with this Expansion Pack.
This pack includes 15 cards.

Sonichu/Rosechu OCs Expansion Pack
With the help of the other Sonichus and Rosechus, we expand our social circles and defensive forces. We also have a lovely party together.
Sonichu, Rosey, and the other found Specials, are not alone in the worlds, as there are many other Sonichus and Rosechus who have their own lives and their own stories to share in our worlds and Dimensions, as well as help us and work with each other. It does astound and please us to have them all with us, together, to be friends, allies, and warriors alike.
The number of these Sonichu and Rosechu OCs that have been made and discovered by their respective Creators, Artists and Authors shows how much love, kindkess and support Sonichu, Rosey, everyone else and I are humbled by and appreciate. The ones featured in this pack are but a small fraction of the vast number. This compilation is one way to show my appreciation to eveyone.
Thank You All.
<3 Chris Chan Sonichu.

TSSSF IdeaGuy Corruptions Expansion Pack
Massive and Chaotic Turmoils were what IdeaGuy had in mind, but the tables ended up being turned.
Late Octover of 2017 started a life-changing sequence of fated events for me, Chris Chan, and everyone in Dimension C-197, that also crossed into this very Dimension 1218, thanks to this Dimension's IdeaGuy, and his OC self-counterpart in C-197, Johnson Wiles. There were so many Awful things the two of themtogether had wrought up til April, 2018, when the chaos and havoc were finally cleaned up and undone. I have had to develop and learn from Everything that has happened. And in the end of it all, I ended up becoming fully awakened as a Goddess: the CPU Blue Heart of the Commodore Consoles.
And now the the few alternate Sonichus and Rosechus, and some of the events, come into play into the Secret Shipfic Folder. Time to stomp out and undo a bunch of seriously awful events.
This Expansion Pack is a companion to the events Chronicled in ("Sonichu" #13): "The Awakening of a CPU, a.k.a. The IdeaGuy Corruptions".
TSSSF Sonichu Deck or Core Deck are required for playing the game with this Expansion Pack. Contains 15 cards.

The dialogue and events between the two match, but there is a difference in her book's timeline and mine: instead of being born individually from the Chaotic Rainbow, Naitsirhc, Crystal and Liquid Chris, all were divided from Chris Chan.

Chris Chan's Infamous Bag
Even more one-of-a-kind than Limited Edition, this bag has been the go-to purse and bag for Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu for well over half a decade from as early as 2013. This bag was seen and carried every time she went out for her errands and trips. Replaced since, now, this bag also sports a custom, duct tape crafted pocket for storing a phone or what have you that is flat behind the flap (which is personally autographed). The bag has two zipper compartments, shoulder strap with buckles and detachable pocket for small items; all remaining in good condition. The issue now is the zipper along the side of the bag, still functional for a while longer, needs to be replaced. It comes complete with personal Certificate of Authenticity, for rather you'd like to use the bag for yourself, or keep it as a rare collectable. Shipping is included in the price.

Doxing of customers
One of many images containing sensitive customer information Chris had sent to Naught.
Chris has doxed many of his own customers to various Watchmen members.
On 7 September 2020, Chris DM'd Naught and ordered him to fulfill a backlog of twenty-three orders ranging from June-August 2020. Chris then screencapped the information of those customers - including their names, phone numbers, addresses, and emails - and forwarded the information to Naught, who then posted the material in The Place.[7][8]
In late September 2020, a disgruntled customer who had yet to receive his order, Justin, angrily confronted Chris over text messages. Chris shot back at Justin, then leaked his texts to The Place, which included Justin's personal information.[9]
