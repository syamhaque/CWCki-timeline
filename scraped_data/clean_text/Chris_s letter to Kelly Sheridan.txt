Transcript
Dear Kelly S.,
I listened to your comments and responses from a video of the "Changing Your Mark" panel. I empathize with the job of artist being not as needed like builder or organizer. As a creative type, you and I, and other artists, we can still offer creative and thoughtful feedback in our abilities. We can also expand our repertoir of skills, like I've taken up cooking from a number of various recipies and instructions, then I simplified it down to basic and simple, like grilling chicken breasts and burgers in a pan, or boiling spaghetti or rice. Learning new skills also helps slow up aging memory problems, and keeping us more mentally able.
Also, I've binge-watched a Lot of cartoons and anime in my lifetime, Just sharing that we have that in common. And, I've wanted to share with you a fun detail. When Pokémon Ruby/Sapphire came out, after the adventure, I bred a new Torchic from my Blaziken, Scorch. And "Inuyasha" was airing on Adult Swim. And considering how much a Blaziken looks like him, I've named this destined-for-awesome Torchic, Inuyasha. Fully evolved and Leveled-Up, plus earned more than 30 Ribbons throughout Ruby, Collosseum, and so-forth up to Sun & Moon Now. Anyhow, I thought to offer the wisdom of learning new skills with you.
Stay Safe and Well,
Christine W. Chandler. :)
