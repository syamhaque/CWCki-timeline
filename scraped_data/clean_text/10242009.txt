Despite being uploaded on 23 October 2009 where Chris lives, "10242009" is a "a small short video response" to Gregg Mays.
Once again, his malfunctioning PSEye causes the video to intermittently skip, but it is thankfully only 28 seconds long.

[Chris briefly holds up his Amnyfest Ring, as the camera skips wildly]
All right, this is a small short video response to uh...Mr. Quote/Unquote [dramatic glasses removal] Gregg Mays alias Clyde Cash, whoever the hell he is of his rea-of his real name. I am not scared of you. You're just a lowly suv-a-bitch. I don't give a damn about you. You can go burn in hell for all I care. So [GANGSTA CHRISCHAN angrily flips off the camera] FUCK YOU.
Everybody else, peace. [flashes peace sign] Have a good day.
