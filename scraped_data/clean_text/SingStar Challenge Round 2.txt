“
if you listen closely, you can hear the 'whooosh' as the meaning of this songs sails completely over Chris' head.
”
Patrick Reid, on YouTube, regarding Chris's entry.
The second round of the SingStar Challenge saw IBAChandler's version of "Don't Say You Love Me" by M2M go up against CChanSonichuCWC's cover of "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" by Will Smith.

IBAChandler uploaded his second video on 1 August, not long after CChanSonichuCWC. He performed "Don't Say You Love Me" by Norwegian pop duo M2M, which was featured in both the Pokémon: The First Movie soundtrack and Christian's Favorite Hits!. At the end of the video, Ian taunts the real Chris.
Ironically, Ian is singing a song about how you really can't love someone when you barely know them, which is ironic given that he's quick to declare his Love Quest over when a service employee asks "May I help you?" One of the song's lyrics even goes "We sit there and you start kissing me, what's that about?" (though Ian's version replaces that line with "You said you love me", which still works). With that said, this is one of his slightly better attempts at singing, as he is trying to at least hit different notes (even if they're all out of key).

[puts on Parappa cap] I gotta believe! Leave it to Um Jammer Lammy! No, not this track. [turns around to grab the remote from his PSP headset] Here's a classic from M2M and the Pokémon world.
[sings possibly the least self-aware song that exists for Chris. Midway through, he yells:] Rorschach!
It is also track 2 on my Favorite Hits. [shows case to his mix CD] Ta-da! Your turn, impasta! I believe, you fail!

next TRUE C.W.C SingStar Challenge #3 Song: Heaven, Bryan Adams
CChanSonichuCWC's second entry is the theme from The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, by Will Smith.
Almost immediately after this video was uploaded, Chris angrily accused CChanSonichuCWC of breaking the rules with this cryptic statement:
"I SAID REAL SONGS; YOU ARE AD-LIBBING;﻿ YOU ARE SOO DISQUALIFIED! Stay Tuned..."[1]
Chris is obviously unaware of what the rap music genre is about, the actual meaning of "ad libitum" (as in "improvisation" or "at the performer's discretion"), and also the minor detail that one doesn't "get tuned" on web pages. Chris was also unaware that The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air theme is a real song, and even if it were just a song composed for a TV show, it was both released as a single and is featured on some of Will Smith's greatest hits albums. The TRUE CWC responded:
"WRONG! I am NOT "AD-LIBBING," as it is Only the Title Which is DIFFERENT as a RANDOM-ACCESS HUMOR JOKE. The SONG﻿ is REAL." [2]

[angry look at camera] Hello there, IMPOSTOR. [dramatic glasses removal] Yeah. Yeah, I see- I s- I s- I seen your, uh, your latest video. Mmm. And guess what? It's- it wasn't even on my, uh, my video- it was ne- that song was NEVER on my playlist. Looks like YOU'RE the impostor. Mmm.
[puts on a white Sonichu cap] So, uh... guess- looks, uh... get started with this song. For y'all.
[video cut; performs "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" without missing a beat, in a performance worthy of a record deal]
YOUR TURN.
