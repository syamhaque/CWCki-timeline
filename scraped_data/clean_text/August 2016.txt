Chris in August
August was the eighth month of 2016. Chris continued to fret about money throughout this month, revealing that the mortgage on 14 Branchland Court is $115,000. His efforts to improve his cash flow consisted primarily of continuing to make videos for paying customers. Despite his bills, however, Chris saw no problem spending money on hormone vitamins and frivolities. Chris spent the last weekend of the month at OmegaCon convention in Charlottesville.
Chris also notably admitted on Facebook that he had incestual dreams and thoughts about his mother, Barbara. In hindsight, this at the time weird one-off Facebook post is rather disturbing.
