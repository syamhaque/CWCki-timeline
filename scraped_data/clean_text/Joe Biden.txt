Joe Biden (born 20 November 1942) served as the 46th president of the United States; his vice president was Kamala Harris. He previously served as the vice president under president Barack Obama throughout his term from 2009 to 2017, and was later elected president in the 2020 election, unseating then-incumbent president Donald Trump. He became the 46th American president on 20 January 2021 instead of Lisa Simpson, who Chris voted for and believes will become POTUS after the Dimensional Merge occurs (although he's more than happy to be rid of Trump). Chris was once hopeful that Biden would pardon him following his arrest for incest.
While Biden was in the running for the November 2024 election, he dropped out mid-run and endorsed Harris instead. Chris has expressed support for Harris's run.

Before presidency
When asked what he thought about Biden in 2009, Chris said "Joe is doing what he can."[1]
In 2017, Chris posted "Yes! Go, Joe!" when commenting on a post about Biden's career.[2]
Presidency
The changed banner on the CWCki front page just after Biden's election win got confirmed. Joe Biden defeated Chris's preferred choice for POTUS, Lisa Simpson, by a landslide.
Joe Biden assumed the Presidency of the United States on 20 January 2021, at 12:00 ET. Chris later acknowledged Biden’s presidency in reality (Dimension 1218),[3] while also reaffirming Simpson's presidency in his reality (C-197).
Since Biden left the White House with President Barack Obama in 2017, Chris’s grasp on reality has weakened to a point where his make-believe city in northern Virginia has expanded to include entire dimensions, and his belief that his characters actually exist has ballooned into something called the Dimensional Merge. Chris even believes that Lisa Simpson will succeed Biden as president after the Merge, going as far as to claim that he actually intended to vote for her.[4][5]
Although Chris welcomed the fact that Donald Trump did not get re-elected,[6] Chris’s continued efforts to avoid reality entirely means that unless Biden can bring fictional characters to life à la Who Framed Roger Rabbit (or at least give Chris everything that he wants), Biden was more or less be an inoffensive extra in Chris's world, like what happened to Sonichu himself after Issue 1.
In October 2021, while waiting legal proceedings on his charge of incest on his mother, Chris wrote to Kenneth Engelhardt, begging him to "contact the local Virginia Governer(s) [sic] of Ruckersville and Charlottesville, VA, as well as President Biden, and get me, Christine's Body, as well as Christine herself obviously, a FULL PARDON to get me out of this Jail and mess, Please."[7]
