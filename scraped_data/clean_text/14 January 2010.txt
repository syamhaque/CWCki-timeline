Ah, Captain's Log, Stardate January 14th, 2010.
Welp, I have just looked up on the, uh, CWCipedia and noticed a jumbo image that, uh, Alec and his associates have put on there and, uh, yes, I'll ha—I'll admit that I have cursed them, though they probably just assumed that, aside from my being angry at them, but I spy— but regardless of that.
In response to that as well as, uhh, their questioning, uh, me as a individual, as such. I mean a lot of us have cursed people. Everybody has cursed somebody in their lives, or said curse word— whatever. But I'm still a g—I'm still a good, individual human being. It's just that, like them with their mental problems and me and my mental problems, when we go into defense mode or response to something that really offends us, we can be mean and c—we can be mean. And that's just, uh, our defense like, you know. It's just like the (?) state of a man. Something offends us, prf [waves and makes punching gesture], we want to punch that sucker right in the face. Every ma— every individual man with, or without, a mental handicap can agree with me on that.
But still, I have given you Sonichu for the past almost ten years now. Well, up to, anyway, 'cause the website didn't go up until 2004. But still—it will be almost ten years now, since I first started him on March 17, 2000. Or ten year anniversary, [Cell phone starts ringing] March 17, 2010.
[Cell phone stops ringing.]
Anyway, uh, regar— irregardless of the incoming call here, hm, I say, trust the ma—trust the individual who you've been trusting this whole time. Don't trust this new guy. He's just trying to take my fame. Please, think about that, my loyal fans. Stay safe and have a good da—
