Transcript
This message is for Sarah May. Sarah, I feel terrible about what- about the big mistake I made in our conversation. I hope you don't do anything stupid, I pray you're still alive and well. 'Cause If you, you, submitted suicide or hurt yourself, because of my actions, I'd feel terrible.
Sarah, I care about you very much. Please, be alive, I care about you... as a friend. And you are a sweet friend, and you are- you are a sweetest- the sweetest among my sweetest friend I've made in my lifetime and I'd just cry if I lost you. Let me know that you're still alive. Send another application to join the Sonichu Girls forum. If you replied- you reply and mention I know you're still alive and we can put all this behind us.
Hopefully I'll get to talk to you again soon. I love you, Sarah May. I love you as my friend.
