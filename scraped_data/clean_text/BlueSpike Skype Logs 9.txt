[10:33:50] BlueSpike:
Chris..There's something I wanted...
[10:34:53] BlueSpike:
I just wanted to see a video of you making love to a doll you own, to hold me over until the real thing, please? I assure you, it will NEVER get out. NOBODY except me will see it. I PROMISE you with my heart.
[14:35:00] BlueSpike:
Hi, Chris. :)
[18:54:17] BlueSpike:
You SERIOUSLY need to fix your biological clock, Chris.
[18:54:25] BlueSpike:
It's getting ANNOIYNG waiting for you.
[20:16:09] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'm scanning the pages now. Also, at 2:30 today, I was out, on my way to my meeting with Rocky.
[20:16:27] BlueSpike:
Neat.
[20:30:44] BlueSpike:
Cool. :)
[20:31:29] BlueSpike:
Could you upload it to Sonichuandrosechu.com in case I lose it? You can make like a fanart gallery for the good (like mine) and the bad troll arts.
[20:32:02] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'll upload the file, and I'll create the fanart area soon.
[20:32:14] BlueSpike:
How soon, do you think? :)
[20:32:39] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'm not certain, but I promise you that I will have one created.
[20:33:01] BlueSpike:
It shouldn't be that hard to do it tonight, you have great HTML skills.
[20:34:15] Christopher C.W.C.:
yeah, but I need time to sort them out from the good, acceptable and the bad, reformat some of them to .jpg format, type up the files and then upload.
[20:34:30] BlueSpike:
ok
[20:48:34] BlueSpike:
You should be done by now. :)
[20:50:28] Christopher C.W.C.:
Yes, it is done; the first three pages of the 9th book are up.
[20:50:53] BlueSpike:
Okay.
[20:52:13] Christopher C.W.C.:
You may go look for yourself. I'm feeling a bit sleepy, so I'll take a raincheck and talk to you next time on the PSN.
[20:52:20] BlueSpike:
Wait!
[20:52:24] BlueSpike:
Can you link me to the new pages?
[20:52:25] BlueSpike:
Please?
[20:52:35] BlueSpike:
I can't find them on the 9th comic.
[20:52:49] Christopher C.W.C.:
just click the 9th Comic Cover on sonichuandrosechu.com
[20:53:24] BlueSpike:
I am, the Spring Break issue, right?
[20:53:50] Christopher C.W.C.:
and I'll create a rage against Clyde video and a private video for your viewing pleasure later this week.Christopher C.W.C.no, the next one.
[20:54:10] BlueSpike:
The one with Chris-Chan sonichu on the cover?
[20:54:18] BlueSpike:
Because the one inbetween isn't clickable.
[20:54:25] Christopher C.W.C.:
refresh the page.
[20:54:33] BlueSpike:
OH, THERE.
[20:54:36] BlueSpike:
Thankyoul.
[20:54:37] BlueSpike: :)
[20:55:51] Christopher C.W.C.:
are you satisfied for now?
[20:55:58] BlueSpike:
Yes. :)
[20:56:16] Christopher C.W.C.:
good. I'm going back to my room and make myself ready for an earlier bedtime.
[20:56:34] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'll TTYL. Ickvenschwel, Julie. :-*
[20:56:49] BlueSpike: :)
[20:59:05] BlueSpike:
Chris?
[20:59:14] BlueSpike:
I should ask, am I gonna be in the comic, anytime soon? :)
February 17
[14:31:30] BlueSpike:
Hi, Chris. :)
[15:38:55] Christopher C.W.C.:
Zlkavszka, Julie. :-*
[15:39:08] BlueSpike:
Hi. :)
[15:39:35] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'm sorry for not getting on sooner, but I went out to buy some things.
[15:39:58] Christopher C.W.C.:
cat food, milk and such.
[15:40:08] Christopher C.W.C.:
*the milk was for my mother.
[15:40:14] BlueSpike:
Ah, okay.
[15:40:34] Christopher C.W.C.:
BTW, do you like soy milk, because that's the kind we have at my house?
[15:40:55] BlueSpike:
I'm not very fond of it. :(
[15:41:20] Christopher C.W.C.:
I see. I'm assuming you have tasted it for yourself?
[15:41:47] BlueSpike:
Yes.
[15:41:49] BlueSpike:
I've tried it.
[15:41:54] Christopher C.W.C.:
cool.
[15:42:14] BlueSpike:
So...
[15:42:17] BlueSpike:
Anything you wanna talk about?
[15:44:22] Christopher C.W.C.:
to let me finish, my family and I drank regular milk before, but for better health results, my mother got me turned onto Silk brand Soymilk.
[15:44:39] BlueSpike:
Meh..
[15:44:41] Christopher C.W.C.:
So, I am capable of going back to regular milk at anytime.
[15:45:00] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'm sorry, but I wanted to finish that thought.
[15:45:05] BlueSpike:
It's okay.
[15:47:37] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'll talk about my day, I crashed at about midnight, awoke at about 6 AM, fed my cats, pondered for a while, and decided to dedicate the day to more drawing. still, I went out with my father to Burger King for breakfast (he enjoys the company), came back and drew some more, then at about 1, I went out with my mother to shop for the cat food, milk and all that. I had just come back to check my PC and talk to you.
[15:47:41] Christopher C.W.C.: :)
[15:47:48] BlueSpike: :)
[15:47:54] BlueSpike:
I'll brb.
[15:47:58] Christopher C.W.C.:
ok.
[15:50:04] BlueSpike:
Back.
[15:50:23] Christopher C.W.C.:
cool. How about you, tell me about your day, please.
[15:50:28] BlueSpike:
Oh, you know.
[15:50:31] BlueSpike:
Same old same old.
[15:52:11] Christopher C.W.C.:
yes, but I'd like to know what you go through from the start of your day. :)
[15:52:33] BlueSpike:
I just went to work and got back..
[15:52:37] BlueSpike:
That's all, silly. :D
[15:52:58] BlueSpike:
I worked a desk job today.
[15:53:14] Christopher C.W.C.:
cool. tell me about your desk job.
[15:53:22] BlueSpike:
Temp. Recepnoist...Sorry if I spelt that wrong.
[15:53:30] BlueSpike:
Still getting used to english. :(
[15:53:46] Christopher C.W.C.: :)
[15:53:46] Christopher C.W.C.:
it's cool. I still understand.
[15:53:50] BlueSpike: :)
[15:53:58] BlueSpike:
What about your job hunt? Thought about what I said?
[15:54:13] Christopher C.W.C.:
I did, and I'm still searching.
[15:55:07] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'm checking the classifieds and such.
[15:56:09] BlueSpike:
Neat.
[15:56:32] Christopher C.W.C.: :)
[15:57:07] Christopher C.W.C.:
hmm...
[15:57:20] Christopher C.W.C.:
I've just had an emotional moment over my Aunt Corina.
[15:58:12] Christopher C.W.C.:
it starts with a mental reminder, then I get the feeling in my heart in response that brought me down a bit.
[15:58:36] BlueSpike:
Hmm...
[15:58:41] Christopher C.W.C.:
I hope she can live a bit longer, so I can give her a hug myself one last time.
[15:58:54] Christopher C.W.C.:
she was a kind-hearted person.
[15:59:04] BlueSpike:
Then why don't you go hug her NOW?
[15:59:10] BlueSpike:
You need to show you love her before it's too late!
[15:59:40] Christopher C.W.C.:
I will. My mother will take me to her soon in another trip. I do not know where the hospital she is at is.
[15:59:47] BlueSpike:
Alright..
[15:59:49] BlueSpike:
I'll brb again.
[15:59:53] Christopher C.W.C.:
ok
[16:01:58] Christopher C.W.C.:
where did you run off to now?
[16:02:10] BlueSpike:
...
[16:02:13] BlueSpike:
I just went to get a drink.
[16:02:19] BlueSpike:
You don't need to get defensive about it..
[16:02:27] Christopher C.W.C.:
it's cool, I'm just wondering.
[16:02:35] Christopher C.W.C.: *hugs*
[16:02:46] BlueSpike:
But when you wonder aloud like that, it makes me feel like you're starting to think I'd cheat on youl
[16:03:04] BlueSpike:
you*
[16:03:24] Christopher C.W.C.:
believe me, that thought has never crossed my mind.
[16:03:34] Christopher C.W.C.:
I fully trust you, Julie-Kat. :)
[16:03:42] BlueSpike:
Sigh..
[16:03:45] BlueSpike:
Okay..
[16:03:56] BlueSpike:
Oh, have you thought about that fighting video yet?
[16:04:17] BlueSpike:
Because I want to see you do it live, you can record it, but I'll see it as you do it.
[16:04:28] BlueSpike:
I need to trust you to be a strong man for me.
[16:05:04] Christopher C.W.C.:
Yes I have. I'm still deciding what to throw my punches at.
[16:05:12] BlueSpike:
Hmm..
[16:05:34] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'll get with you later on the PSN Chat, and I'll show you my strength. :)
[16:06:00] BlueSpike:
Chris..
[16:06:01] Christopher C.W.C.:
I can lift up my chair that I sit in; it's a heavy chair with metal parts.
[16:06:08] BlueSpike:
It's not nice to keep a woman waiting..
[16:06:12] BlueSpike:
I don't think that's enough..
[16:06:27] Christopher C.W.C.:
I know; I need to show my punches and kicks.
[16:07:06] BlueSpike:
More than that..
[16:07:24] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'm still deciding what to throw my punches and kicks at; the only thing applicable that can take my punches is a woman doll.
[16:07:42] BlueSpike:
Just make sure it's not the one that you'll use later. :)
[16:07:46] Christopher C.W.C.:
and I'm rather hesistant on hitting a woman.
[16:07:50] BlueSpike:
But, I think you need to break something.
[16:07:53] BlueSpike:
And it's just a plastic person.
[16:08:04] Christopher C.W.C.:
yes.
[16:08:05] BlueSpike:
Like, you need to break something made of wood, something big.
[16:08:20] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'm still pondering about it.
[16:08:43] Christopher C.W.C.:
I will have a decision soon, and create the video, I promise you. :-*
[16:08:48] BlueSpike:
Sigh..
[16:08:51] BlueSpike:
I want to watch it LIVE.
[16:08:56] BlueSpike:
I want to see everything.
[16:09:18] Christopher C.W.C.:
and you will, I promise.
[16:09:27] BlueSpike:
I like big strong men..
[16:09:31] BlueSpike:
I want you to show me you are.
[16:09:40] BlueSpike:
You'll be able to record on your PS3, right?
[16:09:46] Christopher C.W.C.:
I am strong, and I will show you.Christopher C.W.C.yes.
[16:09:47] BlueSpike:
I wanna see it live as you do it and as you record.
[16:09:50] BlueSpike: :)
[16:10:24] Christopher C.W.C.:
I gtg; I want to draw some more and think more about the video. I'll send you a chat invite on the PSN later.
[16:10:27] BlueSpike:
Wait.
[16:10:31] Christopher C.W.C.:
yes.
[16:10:35] BlueSpike:
I would like a PSN chat at this moment.
[16:10:51] Christopher C.W.C.:
okay, wait for my invite; I'll be there shortly.
[16:10:53] BlueSpike:
We can brainstorm about the video while you draw.
[16:10:54] BlueSpike:
Okay.
[16:52:03] Christopher C.W.C.:
I have a chat window opened up, and I'll leave it open for a while. so please log in and accept the invitation on your PS3
[18:31:09] BlueSpike:
Chris!?
[19:48:14] Christopher C.W.C.:
Julie?
[19:48:43] BlueSpike:
Hello!
[19:49:10] Christopher C.W.C.:
What happened earlier? I heard you scream, you left, and I felt so worried.
[19:49:13] Christopher C.W.C.:
:(
[19:49:18] Christopher C.W.C.:
?
[19:49:23] BlueSpike:
My brother scared me. :(
[19:49:28] BlueSpike:
And the power went out, too.
[19:49:32] BlueSpike:
It was a really wierd [sic] timing.
[19:50:11] Christopher C.W.C.:
*sigh* I see. For the moment, I had thought Clyde ran in and hurt you. I feel better that was not the case.
[19:50:18] Christopher C.W.C.:
*knowing that was not the case
[19:50:29] BlueSpike:
Yeah. :)
[19:50:53] Christopher C.W.C.:
Why did your bro scare you?
[19:50:57] Christopher C.W.C.:
or what did he do?
[19:51:15] BlueSpike:
He told me he was playing around, he ran into the room and shook me.
[19:51:23] BlueSpike:
I was a bit scared. :D
[19:51:27] BlueSpike:
So, can we PSN chat?
[19:51:30] Christopher C.W.C.:
oh.
[19:51:37] Christopher C.W.C.:
yeah.
[19:52:17] Christopher C.W.C.:
I stayed in my room, waiting for an hour for your return, and it's nighttime now, so I'll have to delay on the wood-finding.
[19:52:48] BlueSpike:
:(
[19:52:55] BlueSpike:
I'll send you the PSN invite..
[19:53:12] Christopher C.W.C.:
okay; wait for me.
[19:56:24] BlueSpike:
I sent you the invite, where are you? :(
[19:57:56] Christopher C.W.C.:
on my way
[23:06:15] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'm here.
[23:21:20] BlueSpike:
brb
[23:21:24] Christopher C.W.C.:
ok
[23:31:17] Christopher C.W.C.:
The call was dropped.
[23:33:04] BlueSpike:
is away. This is an auto-reply message.
[23:33:04] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'll hang around for a bit longer.
[23:38:57] BlueSpike:
Hi..
[23:39:16] Christopher C.W.C.:
Zlkavszka
[23:39:35] Christopher C.W.C.:
Clyde left to think; he said he would return.
[23:39:35] BlueSpike:
I went to take a quick shower..
[23:39:39] BlueSpike:
My brother met me outside.
[23:39:47] BlueSpike:
He was listening in while I was gone.
[23:39:50] Christopher C.W.C.:
but he hung up, and the call between you and me was dropped soon after.
[23:39:53] Christopher C.W.C.:
oh.
[23:39:55] BlueSpike:
He told me, 'I don't want to hear that sick sex shit again.'
[23:40:09] Christopher C.W.C.:
ohhh.
[23:40:31] Christopher C.W.C.:
then what
happened?
[23:40:37] BlueSpike:
That's it.
[23:40:40] BlueSpike:
Now I'm wondering..
[23:41:11] Christopher C.W.C.:
We don't have to Cyber Sex anymore; we can hold it in until we are together in person.
[23:41:48] Christopher C.W.C.:
It's okay, Julie; he may have not heard all the details, and jumped to conclusions.
[23:41:55] BlueSpike:
He did.
[23:42:31] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'm sorry you had to deal with that.
[23:43:04] Christopher C.W.C.:
I feel for you there; it's just like last Saturday when my father came in and interrupted us.
[23:43:28] BlueSpike:
Not exactly..
[23:43:46] Christopher C.W.C.:
you are right; my scenario was worse.
[23:44:07] Christopher C.W.C.:
but I have some good news.
[23:44:18] BlueSpike:
I doubt it can fix what happened..
[23:45:09] Christopher C.W.C.:
right before our chat with Clyde, I read his reply to my reply. he says, and I quote, "You ever come down to California, you can meet me." He WAS in California.
[23:45:32] BlueSpike:
Huh.
[23:45:40] Christopher C.W.C.:
he had been "driving for days, it's quite exhuasting."
[23:46:19] Christopher C.W.C.:
so, you ARE safe from him in person.
[23:47:25] Christopher C.W.C.:
Anyway, I understand what you may be feeling now, and I'm willing to give you space until when you contact me again on the PSN or Skype.
[23:47:40] Christopher C.W.C.:
Ickvenschwel, Julie. :-*
