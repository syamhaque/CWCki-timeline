Artist's depiction
In October 2016, Chris visited some of the stores at which he is banned and asked the management to sign a contract to unban him. The documents were leaked to Kiwi Farms on 13 October by Marvin, who cited as his source someone in Charlottesville.[1]
Chris's attitude to bans appears to have remained the same as his reaction to his ban from the GAMe PLACe nearly a decade earlier, using ridiculous negotiation tactics to tackle bans that he just cannot get over. These documents are also a big example of his egotistical nature and deteriorating sense of reality post-Tomgirl, believing that businesses (that'll be better without his patronage) will sign a legal document that will unban him and prevent them from being able to call the police against him (which is illegal since contracts cannot be used to protect from criminal prosecution, thus making it null and void), all because a violent, egotistical lolcow believes that not signing would prove that they are "most uncompassionate and lacking of heart and soul of any person", and are a bunch of "unwelcoming immature rat -a**" b*****", comparing them to Donald Trump. He also believes that the reasons that he was banned are now "outdated" (similar to how he tried to convince Michael Snyder that he needs to "forgive and forget"), and that the "Human Rights Campaign" would be on his side since he's now a ""L"esbian "T"ranswoman", the L and T from LGBTQ.
The reactions of the mentioned businesses to these letters are unknown, but are most likely just ignored.

Dearest Madam or Sir, who has pulled me over, if not the manager of this facility (you may relay this letter to said persecuting executive if applicable),
Firstly, in response to your immediate approach of my person with "purpose" to dispel me
from your store or facility for the following well -outdated reason, I present to you this document to counter said dispel or banning of my person.
The past, well-outdated matter of the protest of SEGA's changing Sonic the Hedgehog's arm colour to blue from tan, and my action of discouraging purchase of anything "Sonic Boom" from Gamestop has been realized to be of most trivial reason to protest, and the ending problems certainly do not justify the past means. I, Christine Weston Chandler, hereby promise never to do anything that I have done then ever again, and I do regret having done said actions.
This very action was Two Years Ago, and frankly, I believe and strongly feel that it is long beyond the time to Move Forward and Forgive and Forget the sordid affair. Failure to Forgive and Forget, on your part, only demonstrates that you, yourself, are a most uncompassionate and lacking of heart and soul of any person. And, thus, you are no better than Donald Trump, who ONLY wants to make this country BROKE to pay his own petty debts and debtors, as well as fill the Corporate Fat Cats' Pockets; Not Caring or Leaving Any Money at all for us, you and I, Middle-Class People, who also harps on and again of "Proud" deeds against Race, as well as against the LGBTQ Community. Of which, l am of two of those letters, as l am a proud "L"esbian "T"ranswoman; the Human Rights Campaign would be on my side, regardless. He is a most uncouth and unwelcoming immature rat-a** b****** , and to not forgive and forget, now, would see you as such as well, and to dispel me is to discriminate against the LGBTQ community as well. But I digress.
I, personally, would like very much to put this vintage matter to rest, and leave both you and I with a mentally and emotionally peaceful day, versus a soul-crushing day. All I ask is that you lift your ban against me from this facility, and allow me to resume being welcomed here at mental and emotional peace; Forgive and Forget. Failure to do so would most tarnish further your facility's reputation; most unwelcoming.
To allow me to resume being and shopping here at peace, is to allow yourself and ease of mind and emotions as well.
Thank You.
And I do promise with my signature and date below to never again perform anything of the past misdeed under protest, nor feelings of bad emotions from after or during a bad day.
Sincerely,
Miss Christine Weston Chandler

Dearest Madam or Sir, who has pulled me over, if not the manager of this facility (you may relay this letter to said persecuting executive if applicable),
Firstly, in response to your immediate approach of my person with "purpose" to dispel me from your store or facility for the following well-outdated reason, I present to you this document to counter said dispel or banning of my person.
The past, well-outdated matter of my possessing and using pepper spray against a person, who was never of employment at this Best Buy and thus dispelling and banning me from this Best Buy by sole reason of indirect news-hearing and gossiping, and no prior crimes, with such visual evidence, directly at this Best Buy, whatsoever, is no longer a valid reason whatsoever. I, Christine Weston Chandler hereby no longer possess pepper spray in any shape or form, and I promise never to use or possess it, even in self-defense of my person, and I do regret having done said actions, never at this Best Buy but at the original location whereas that has actually happened.
This very action was Two Years Ago, and frankly, I believe and strongly feel that it is long beyond the time to Move Forward and Forgive and Forget the sordid affair. Failure to Forgive and Forget, on your part, only demonstrates that you, yourself, are a most uncompassionate and lacking of heart and soul of any person. And, thus, you are no better than Donald Trump, who ONLY wants to make this country BROKE to pay his own petty debts and debtors, as well as fill the Corporate Fat Cats' Pockets; Not Caring or Leaving Any Money at all for us, you and I, Middle-Class People, who also harps on and again of "Proud" deeds against Race, as well as against the LGBTQ Community.
