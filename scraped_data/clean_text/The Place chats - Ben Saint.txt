Delusion disclosure: This article or section takes place during Chris's phase of role-playing as Magi-Chan. He may refer to his Christine Chandler personality and physical body in the third person by using terms such as "wife".

If Ben Saint develops the IP to enough of a level, you won't be able to defend ownership very well
Plus being out of money for a legal defense, he can just wait out the court case and win by default
If you push now, you can get what you're owed, be in a better position to not get screwed in the future

At least half that money should go to Christine!

MKRNightVee on Ben's $8,458 earnings for his The Vapors comic.
Several Watchmen members and Chris discussed in The Place about Ben Saint. At issue was a comic Ben was producing which depicted Chris's Night Star OC. The Watchmen egged on Chris to confront Ben over it.

29-30 September 2019
On 29-30 September 2019, Chris discussed his health, saying that his blood pressure reader showed hypertension and that he was dealing with it by taking potassium supplements and eating a salad, and also asking Barbara to kill spicy foods for awhile.
The Watchmen then pressured Chris, wanting him to confront Ben over his usage of Night Star. Kyle claimed that Chris could potentially lose ownership of the IP in court unless he pushed the issue. The Watchmen also raised the matter of royalties, insisting that Ben should pay Chris for the Night Star usage.
Throughout the conversation, Chris defended Ben, saying that Ben was giving credit for usage of Night Star and argued that Ben was not directly making money from comic panels featuring Night Star.

Has anyone heard from @Sonichu982?
Kyle
This is a worrying absence
MKRNightVee
I hope he and Christine are ok
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
We are all right. Christine has been meditating and working on frequency-adjusting my body into 1218 again. Meanwhile, I’ve been working on healing her body; the blood pressure reader went into level one Hypertension, so I went out and bought some potassium supplements and a fresh salad, among other immediate helpful items. And I told Barbara to kill the spicy foods for a while. The effects of the merge are taking a toll on the body, but she will pull through. Also, in the event that I am able to frequency-adjust her body into C-197, or when it is fatefully summoned there, it is beneficial for me to be in this body, because her soul was constantly being called upon for active duty. There are literally thousands of projections of her that get shared and help out a LOT of individuals between both Earths. They often get a breather by returning to her body for a while, but she’s presently down to her essentials between her main soul amount required to function fully, and her body’s soul. And her body’s soul is also getting called and summoned. So, I am holding this fort for when it is making its first transition soon enough.
*sigh
But, I digress.
Kyle
Could it be colitis?
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
She remains safe in my body, because she’s not being called from my body.
Deleted User
I have noticed Ben saint has been working on christines comic book. Has she been paid her royalties?
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
No, it is not colitis.
He is not directly contributing to the books.
He has been Chronicling what has been going on with Phantom Horn and Strawberry Milk in Arizona.
Deleted User
But still, using Christines intellectual property would cost money.
Kyle
Depending on the audience, a payment-per-use clause would be better
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
I can’t handle topic changes at this time.
MKRNightVee
He now calls it his "Nightstar comic"
Ok
Kyle
Movies use both
Well, you could use the money Christine is owed
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
It is not a Nightstar Comic, and I will be sure to tell him that later.
Deleted User
Yes could you put the screenshot of him calling it that? We just want to make sure Christines intellectual property is protected. If Ben uses it for free what’s to stop anyone else?
MKRNightVee
"The Nightstar comic"
Deleted User
Doesn't Ben have a Patreon where people pay him to draw? Does his fans know he's getting peoples money for ripping off Christine's Characters without paying him Royalties?
MKRNightVee
Yes
They pay him for it (edited)
Deleted User
They pay him to steal Christines hard work?
Kyle
This is horrible exploitation
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
We can’t wait to complete this 15-card set for the “ArizonaSlime” Shipfic Expansion. We’re Chronicling the cleanup events and rescuing Phantom Horn and Strawberry Milk in a set of 15 cards with fresh drawings from our hands. The story will be told in sequence on the cards’ Flavour Texts.
MKRNightVee
Good, he's cruel to those poor ocs
Deleted User
But Ben is making money off of this right? It seems only fair Christine gets her cut for the cards.
MKRNightVee
I agree
She could certainly use the money
Kyle
Its the only right thing to do, thats her money
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
Money is not the issue here. But Ben will realize the error of his ways very soon, as soon as we complete this set of cards. We’ll even have a set of these cards printed and sent to him. That gives me an idea for a motivating Goal Card that will make for an appropriate ending card for the Expansion.
Kyle
Well you wanted money for babscon
And bills
Things cost money, this is theft
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
Good observations. I have personally informed Ben of the property notoriety, and he will be more respectful in future tweets.
Kyle
And the money?
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
He is presently not making money off of these panels, so we’ll worry about that should that become more apparent.
Kyle
If he's making money on patreon for content
And some of that content is coming from your opus
Ipso facto, he's making money from Christine's effort

He does have a Patreon, but these panels are being shared for free, so again, there is no money involved at this time. (edited)
Deleted User
Magi Chan he is advertising it right on his Patreon... he is lying to Christine about making money.
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
Your point is obvious and noted, but as these panels are also being shared Outside of his Patreon between Imgur and Twitter, and nobody is paying him for this particular content.
He is mainly getting paid for his “Vapors” book series, and Nightstar, nor any Sonichu or Rosechu or related, are portrayed in those particular publications.
Deleted User
Patreon is designed to be his income while he makes content for free. That is how it works. He can easily say that he is sharing it for free while collecting royalties on christines characters.
I just don’t like seeing Christine bing taken advantage of
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
He is still giving her proper credit in each Tweet and post.
I assure you, she is not being taken advantage of, and we are turning the tables around on this as well.
In fact, the huge rain thunderstorm has been made south-west of Arizona in C-197 early this morning, beyond the Mexico portion. It will reach Arizona in a couple of days, and then the slime problem will be cleansed; all of the clouds have been treated with the addition of bicarbonate soda and sugar from many an aerial-able individual, without missing a spot.
That is the main reason I am on here now, to update @everyone on the rains now heading to Arizona.
Naught
@Deleted UserBen also gets superchats on twitch about @Sonichu982 and the lore but it's up to CwC.
Deleted User
Yes. He is clearly exploiting our friend. I hope magi Chan at least speaks to her about this.
Naught
@Deleted User why don't you message here? Everyone can see your tweets. @@here would be safer.
Kyle
Its the same reason I cant just put up a coke billboard though
Naught
Hmm, what do you mean? I don't understand copyright law well.
Kyle
I mean, IP is worth a lot of money
In accounting terms, the IP is only worth what you put towards development, legal defense and liscensing
@Sonichu982 If Ben Saint develops the IP to enough of a level, you won't be able to defend ownership very well
Plus being out of money for a legal defense, he can just wait out the court case and win by default
If you push now, you can get what you're owed, be in a better position to not get screwed in the future
MKRNightVee
So he could potentially steal your franchise!? That's scary
Deleted User
Very scary
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
He shall never steal the franchise. That is not his intention.
Has anyone thought of talking with him directly on the topic?
Kyle
I'm ill suited to
Deleted User
How can anyone be sure that is not ones intention?
Kyle
Who knows more than you about the franchise?
So what is Ben's intention?
Naught
@Sonichu982 I could but I need the o.k. from CwC first.
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
She personally approves your inquiring upon Benjamin Saint of the monetary and IP topic as you will. Thank you. (edited)
Kyle
What about Vivian's intent? What was that bit of ancient history, is it similar?
Naught
When magi chan uses the CwC vessel. Do you maintain a regular sleep schedule?
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
Vivian’s intentions were simply mockery and degrading of Christine and her character, and nothing else. It is not similar at all to the present situation, I assure all of you.
Kyle
So what are the criteria for trust?
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
I do maintain a proper sleep schedule as best as possible when in her body. Her body tends to be fickle at times, and wants to sleep in for further recovery, until when as soon as possible it feels able to get up in the morning and stay up for a fuller day.
There are too many details and variables to formulate a set criteria.
Deleted User
Has Ben proven that he's not trying to mock Christine or attempt to be like those Idea Guys and extort Christine for Money? By claiming her Intellectual Property?
Kyle
Whats the risk of being more cautious?
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
He repeatingly cites that Nightstar belongs to her and not him. He has not asked for any money at all. His panels are moreover a conceptual view into that of the Slimeco territory.
Deleted User
I ❤ that Christine is so trusting, but its also because of that nature she let's evil people like Jacob Sockness into her life to corrupt it
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
There Is quite a criteria that I hold subconscious, she does as well, for trust, and we’ve had to shape her to develop her ability to be cautious more and better.
Taming a deity-to-be is not as easy as taming a normal individual.
My duties have me elsewhere in deed at the moment; I am colouring an important drawing at the moment.
Kyle
Why would he ask for money for using your property?
Oh, watcha drawing?
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
You shall see very soon in a lovely 15-card Expansion.

3 October 2019
On 3 October 2019, Chris brought up Ben to the Watchmen, concerned over a comic panel he had uploaded. During the ensuing discussion, Chris asked the Watchmen if Ben is doing it for the money, and they insisted he is and claim that Chris is entitled to half of Ben's Kickstarter earnings. Chris said he will ask Ben for funds to help print his TSSSF cards, and is encouraged by the Watchmen to do so. After Chris DM'd Ben, the latter leaked the conversation on Twitter,[1] to Chris's annoyance.
Chat
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
Good Evening, @everyone. I’m feeling at mild unrest, but I’ll be okay to fall asleep again in a short while. I saw the pasted updated I needed to see and confirm on Twitter. Yes, @Deleted User is doing better on his own reformation and redemption now. But I am a bit concerned; Ben Saint has uploaded the following of his strip:
Naught
Hmm. Interesting.
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
No worries, they were rescued and recovered around when the thunderstorm came into Arizona on the second.
MKRNightVee
That's messed up, Ben is a big jerk. Poor knd
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
But, I take it, this was from those amongst you all who wanted to ask him about the monetary aspect.
Naught
Yes, apparently Ben wants to play game's when the kids next door were honest with him.
He even advertised his live stream in the panel..very tacky. (edited)
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
Quite. Not Ben, as much as the one called CopKiller, who is making this portion happen.
What did you all learn from the stream?
Naught
They are one in the same. Ben and copkiller that is.
Deleted User
Don't worry Magi. The Kids Next Door from what I hear can hold their own.
The WCT
For Ben Saint: [posts emotes]
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
Quite. CK is one of Ben’s self-counterparts, though the more dark side of him, but not exactly the main self-counterpart. Phantom Horn is more his Self-Counterpart than CK is. Although, Ben shall survive the Merge as one of the Creators who differs well from his OC counterparts.
I realize they can hold their own, yeah
[The WCT posts emotes]
Naught
Ben Is a brony analyst who spreads gossip and has hurt his friend's. He's no friend and probably will spread the rumors.
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
I do concur; his actions are trollish in that, but his normal intentions are not totally malicious He’s under a bit of a mind-warp at present, but he is still in there. He responded positively and kind in seeing the cards of Phantom Horn and Strawberry Milk.
The question remains to be confirmed: he was not in this for the money, was he?
Naught
Yes, yes he is.
jet black
Money content fame. It all ozes from his pours
Naught
And to use CwC name for clout in the brony community.
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
And he stated so in his stream?
Naught
He deleted it but he said "hey it's funny to me. I'm doing what I want."
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
Ah. I see.
Deleted User
Does anyone want to channel their voices through a VC?
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
In any event, the thunderstorms will be completed in less than a couple of hours; Arizona and it’s inhabitants have just about all been cleansed of the slime and the Endless War ceased. The collected slime from the area filled the Grand Canyon half-full; now all that slime is dissolved.
Not at the moment, I’m afraid. My mental functions are required more in the dimension frequency-changing events here at home.
Deleted User
Ah, OK
Naught
@MKRis this correct about the slime nitevee?
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
Remember, it was chronicled in these cards by our hands. It is correct. I will check in later. Goodnight.
Naught
Oh, ok. Sleep tight. You need your rest I await the return of CwC.
MKRNightVee
This is pissing me off >:c He called Christine a bitch! This is not ok!
Kyle
Its the whole "fool me once" dichotomy, Ben just seems like a very insidious person
MKRNightVee
Yep
He needs to cut it out
He is literally using her OC to make money...
Deleted User
Ye, I knew it. Ffs
MKRNightVee
At least half that money should go to Christine!
Deleted User
Unironically
MKRNightVee
Yep
I might have to dust off the comic and give Ben saint his famous debut
I'm just really pissed XD
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
I concur, as I have seen this likely result of a response. Fortunately, the last few cards in the Expansion will put an end to him being able to feature us in the Endless War and Slime Problem, because I personally confirm that Arizona in C-197 is 100% cleansed of all slime.
MKRNightVee
Indeed I too have seen this, the slime is gone forever no matter what he might say or do.
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
Very good confirmation. I’ll put a few more pictures up on Christine’s Twitter in a moment.
MKRNightVee
Good idea
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
Also, I shall personally approach Ben for funds to help print the first bunches of the Secret Shipfic Sonichu Deck and Expansions.
MKRNightVee
Yeah, you should
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
This first completed Expansion was on me, as I have ordered a print of the set to be sent to him as well. But this will be a “Now you will lay us for the remainder, and help us get this revival of the Secret Shipfic Folder out everywhere.” Something like that, Anyway.
Deleted User
This is frustrating. These people never stop.
Kyle
Part of it is legitimizing the claim with a definite value in mind
[Over three hours later]
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
Good Evening, @everyone.
I have personally contacted Ben on the issue between the recent events, his sins, and made the request of payment from him. I have no regret on having done this.
He has shamed others before, and this is his repentance.
What bothers me, though, is that he outright screen capped and shared it. He made quite a callous choice that will cost him more.
Deleted User
How much did you ask from him?
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
$300, within no more than two weeks’ time. I told him that it will be genuinely slated for the first prints of the Deck and expansion packs, and he makes a comment of “That’s enough to buy an Oculus Rift”; insulting.
Meanwhile, I am resuming work on the art for the “Let’s Get This Party On!” card for the OC Deck; personally drawn of all of the invited OCs who were able to make it to the party at the Secret Rift Café, with Christine, Cryzel and myself entering with a bag full of copies of the deck and expansion packs.
Fortunately, although apparently his hold remains strong with Ben, CopKiller has been reduced to just a living head In a jar.
