Pewdiepie Does Not Live Here; He Lives In Sweden!" is a video in which Chris complains that PewDiePie does not live at 14 Branchland Court. Unusual about this video is that the comments are disabled, unlike in the previous videos, in which they weren't.
One thing to note is that PewDiePie does not actually live in Sweden, despite the country being his place of origin; he resided in the United Kingdom at the time of the video's creation and currently resides in Japan.

Hello, everyone, Christine Weston Chandler coming to you live from home once again and today, [slaps leg] I'm setting something straight. Every so often, eeeeeevery so often, and this ticks me off because not only- the actual person does not get the mail, but I hate that to forward it is impossible for me because [begins slamming the floor repeatedly] I don't have his address and he lives in Sweden!
[Shows a cardboard mail] Feliz Arvid [looks back at mail] Kjelberg [Note: Chris mispronounces PewDiePie's last name as "Kachelberg" rather than "Shellberg".], also known as P-E-W-DEE-PIIIIIEEE! DOES NOT LIVE HERE AT 14 BRANCHLAND COURT, RUCKERSVILLE, VIRGINIA, 22968!
...and I never, ever, ever
want to see another piece of mail addressed to him sent to me here! And PewDiePie, please, please, please [puts down glasses and suddenly switches to a quiet, soft voice] put a mailing address on your YouTube channel to where your fanmail and everything can actually be sent to?
Please? [annoyed tone] Please? Thank you.
