As for the presentation of "Christory," an extremely cringe term BTW, used mainly by the terminally autistic, the current rules of the CWCki (as inconsistently applied as they are) really seem constructed to protect weening faggots, one of the lowest forms of life online, worthy to be the footstool of the fucking furries. The best content on the CWCki focuses on old-school Chris content, which is understandable I guess because this is the actually entertaining stuff, but the effect is to glamorize it, leading to this kind of behavior. Wanting to document every single thing that Chris does because Chris is an entertaining sped but shying away from "doxxing [sic]" weens, which is probably the only interesting thing left to do in "Christory", is retarded and the height of hypocrisy, not to mention that the only way to deal with these people is by exposing their shit to the light.
”
Spooky's philosophy.[3]
Spooky Bones (born 8 May 1977),[4] also known as Spooky, Regina George and MakeFetchHappen, was the owner of the Burn Book Discord server, leader of the Mean Girls, and the leading figure in the investigation of the "Twilight of Christory", with her primary focus being on Isabella Loretta Janke and her associates. Spooky also created the OP of Bella's original megathread on Kiwi Farms on 1 August 2021,[5] and Null later made her a moderator of the newly established subforum on Bella.
Spooky was initially held in high regard on several Chris-related circles due to her findings surrounding Bella, giving her major influence over perceptions of Chris and his orbiters. However, Spooky is now infamous for spreading many scandalous rumors and gossip about people in the CWCSphere on a large scale, and relying on doxing, intimidation, and lies to serve what she perceived to be the "greater good" while also glorifying the surface-level elements of the "Classic Era" of Christory.
Following multiple instances of infighting involving her and other users from both the Kiwi Farms and the CWCki, Spooky got demoted as moderator by Null on 2 October 2021,[6] and was eventually banned from Kiwi Farms entirely on 14 November.[7] Despite this, many of the rumors that Spooky had spread persisted, with some of them reaching Chris in jail. The most prominent of these were alleged plots by Bella for Chris to commit suicide and manipulating him and Fiona into a relationship at Everfree Northwest, which Chris repeated numerous times as cover stories for his affair with Barb.

Discord Servers
Spooky and her associates had hosted several Discord servers that involved investigating Chris orbiters. Along with posting about her investigations, Spooky had her associates invite people of interest into these servers to interview them or post about their DMs with said individuals. The logs of these servers were eventually leaked onto Kiwi Farms and Onion Farms.[8]
Burn Book
Burn Book was a Discord server for the Mean Girls (aka the "Bellaposters"), where much of the "investigations" took place. The group itself was themed after the 2004 movie of the same name, with its primary members assuming the character roles from the movie; Spooky was Regina George, however several users sometimes referred to Spooky as "Spooky Mama" or "Mama Bones" in reference to her being leader.
Several people who frequently posted on the ILJ subforum were invited into the server. Those invited were marked as "untrusted guests". The server was set up in a very similar fashion as The Place and Knights of CWC servers, and was presented as a space for "centralized" information on Bella. It had a "first" and "second" layer, and only those with a specific role can see the "second" layer.[9] Many channels in this server were also dedicated to Chris orbiters of interest. After the first server got closed on 7 October 2021, Spooky created a second and invited all previous members.[1] Around this time, Spooky also thought to create the BurnBook.CLUB forum, which had a similar purpose.
Halal Server
The Halal Server was a Discord server hosted by Spooky's associates, where they'd interrogate orbiters of interest, and intel were relayed to Spooky. Spooky eventually joined this server on 18 August 2021, under the alias GrafinDusyTold, a name which she had adapted from her Twitter account, which she used to reach out to MKRNightVee, after MKR falsely claimed that her former associate The WCT might have wanted Chris to kill himself.[10]
MKR and Naught were also invited into the Halal Server, where they were asked many questions about various orbiters of Chris. Where MKR spread vicious rumors against The WCT.[11] The server member Sakura Blossom, sought to keep the interactions a secret.

Rumors and Gossiping

Following the Incest leaks, several rumors and conspiracy theories about Bella, as well as people with even the loosest connections to her, were created and spread by the Mean Girls, with little to no proof. Despite this, Spooky was able to influence public opinion and widely propagate many of them via the Kiwi Farms. Chris had also repeated many of these rumors when fans brought them to his attention while he was in jail.
Demonization of Bella
“
ISABELLA LORETTA JANKE was involved in attempting to cause Christine Weston Chandler/Chris Chan, an autistic transwoman and webcomic artist who has been a victim of Internet harassment for over a decade, to end his own life, to extort money from him, and much more.
”
Introduction from Spooky's megathread OP.[5]
An infographic on Spooky's OP.
Spooky's associate, Gunt Gallop (GetInTheRobot on the Halal Server) contacted Discord user ZorgothTDK, who alleged that a Deleted User from 25 April 2020 states "That's what we're trying to do with Chris [...] Get him be suicidal [...] Bc he's retarded", was Bella discussing Chris Chan.[12] However, these conversations ignore that Bella had known of two other people named Chris - her cousin and another Discord user - making it unclear if she was referring to Chris Chan.[13] In addition, the earliest known message from Bella to Chris Chan occurred in October 2020. It is unknown when they came into contact, but she has claimed to have started trolling Chris for almost a year to one of her Chess Club associates in a July 2021 Discord message.[14]
Spooky claimed that Bella had an incest fetish, partly based on an incest fanfiction on Naruto characters she allegedly created. Though the link between this account and Bella is unclear, and the account itself has "Im into engineering and electromagnetism and shit but u wont find any of that shit here, only gay hentai bitches." as its description, suggesting that it could be a troll account, if created by her. A user by the name of Gungann, interviewed her, repeatedly questioned Bella on this point, citing part of a transcription of her call with Chris, which claims that she talked to Chris while aroused.[15] Spooky also claimed, with no evidence, that Bella had been extorting Chris,[5] based on a chatlog where she had made comments about stealing Chris's money.
Glorification of Fiona
After Bella attempted to frame Fiona Cooper, Spooky and many other Kiwi Farms users initially called for Fiona to be doxed, believing her to be the perpetrator behind Chris's crime.[16] Naught had also doxed Fiona, her family, and some of her friends on Bella's megathread on 2 August 2021.[17] One of the friends that got doxed Grant, who went under the alias "G202" on the Kiwi Farms, tried to clear up her involvement with Chris, as well as what was going on with her afterwards.
When it was found that Fiona had shared clips of the Incest call with friends prematurely, it was interpreted as her leaking the call for "moral reasons" as Bella withheld the call. Fiona's apparent revulsion was also seen as heroic. Spooky subsequently deleted Naught's posts and all other posts that involved Fiona's information. On 4 August 2021, Spooky warned Kiwi Farms users not to dox her, threatening to dox anyone who did. She also called her an "extremely autistic young woman",[18] something which shifted the public's perception of Fiona's character.[note 10] Spooky had similarly stated that she viewed Fiona as being more of a "vulnerable adult" than Chris is, lacking full accountability,[19] a claim which was continually perpetuated on the Kiwi Farms, which then reached many other platforms including Reddit. Contributing to these sentiments, Spooky also held the belief that Fiona was in no way comparable to the other orbiters she targeted, exhibiting a clear bias in favor of her.[20]
The general portrayal of Bella and Fiona, as portrayed by a Mean Girl.
Grant told Spooky's associate that Fiona had her Internet privileges revoked, and was temporarily being brought to psychiatric care after having a mental breakdown, possibly because of Chris's affair with Barb.[21] This was misconstrued as Fiona being "institutionalized", further contributing to the sentiments about Fiona.
Spooky later falsely claimed that Bella planned to record Chris and Fiona having sex at Everfree Northwest as part of a plot to blackmail Chris into suicide by claiming Fiona is a minor. This appears to be loosely based on misread excerpts from the Incest Call and the leaked messages involving Bella. With regards to the call, the first excerpt was where Bella discusses Fiona (who held a crush on Chris) and tries to encourage Chris to pursue a relationship with her. In the second, Bella said she would create a slideshow of romantic stuff between Chris and Fiona during the Everfree Northwest convention festivities.
The Mean Girls had also exaggerated Bella claiming that she wanted to "steal" Fiona from Chris, often representing it as Bella meaning that she either wanted to sexually assault Fiona or worse. Such claims, however, are based on out-of-context Discord chats that involved Bella stating that she became "besties" with Fiona, and swore to protect her from Chris.[22] These claims also ignores the flirtatious behaviors between Fiona and Bella, sending her a picture of both her face and legs, and telling Bella that she "had sex with men", indicating that whatever feelings Bella had towards Fiona were entirely consensual.[23] Bella had also stated that she only wanted to go to the convention to dance with Fiona.[24]
Other Orbiters
Spooky had falsely accused The WCT of being in on Bella's supposed suicide plot due to Bella being both in the Knights of CWC Discord server and the Regarding Chris chats, as well as Bella manipulating WCT into both framing Fiona and sharing her Fabricated BDSM texts because of MKR's rumors. Spooky had similarly targeted Christuber GiBi after controversies surrounding him failing to redact Fiona's phone number in a video covering texts that Bella sent to him.
CWCki Server admin Skunt_TV had notified Spooky about the existence of the Lunar Module, a group of fantasy enablers run by Michael Afghani that intended to convert Chris to Islam on 5 September 2021.[25] After Michael posted on the Kiwi Farms about their letter to Chris on 13 October 2021, Spooky created a thread on him, collaborating with a bunch of Kiwi Farms users that she invited into a private DM.[26][27]
Spooky had also targeted minor Chris orbiters and carpetbaggers who exploited the drama that arose from Chris's arrest, many of whom did things like visit Chris's house or send letters to Chris while he was in jail. Spooky had put all orbiters into "categories", which she used as a scale to determine who is more worthy of doxing compared to other people.[28] Spooky had claimed that this criterion was objective and less likely to be abused, believing that the best course of action would instead be to include all of the information of every party involved with Chris, regardless of how crucial they were to Chris's story.
Effects on Chris
“
But yeah, Bella was actually going to record me and Fifi having done something at the hotel, had I actually made it to BABSCon. But fortunately, that didn't quite happen. She wou- she, one way or another, would've gotten me to jail, or tried to get me to commit suicide, on the whole different [unintelligible]. But hey, she failed, [pounds desk] she didn't do that, I took the initiative in my own hands, so... I let mys- I let mys- I let divine intervention and timing and everything to send me- just let me go to jail, spend my time suffering and spending the time for your sins, you fuckin' - fuckin' toxic ones!
”
Chris, essentially demonstrating how Spooky's own mantra applies to her by repeating the bulk of the rumors she'd been spreading.[29]
Because of how widespread Spooky's outrageous claims have become, with many sources repeating them as fact, Chris appeared to have used them as a convenient way to cover his ass when questioned about the affair on several occasions, allowing him to avoid taking accountability. Along with this, he's invented some of his own stories on top of that, building off of these convenient lies. Chris mentioned how he "foresaw" both the alleged suicide plot and blackmailing at Everfree Northwest from Bella. He more often than not does this to present Bella as a scapegoat for his failings, as he's done with others many, many times in the past.
On 8 November 2021, Chris had claimed in a jail letter that he foreknew of Bella's want to "tempt" him to suicide.[30] Chris added onto this in another letter claiming to have "foreknown" of a "Nasty Plot" Bella would have instigated between himself and Fiona.[31] He also lied about Bella "cooking up a Pedophile scandal" in another letter, whilst also claiming that Fiona was not involved with it.[32] On 4 July 2022, Chris again spread misinformation in another jail letter that Bella was trying to get him to out himself as a "pedophile" by dating Fiona. Chris similarly repeats the belief that Fiona was an innocent bystander who was victimized by Bella. Chris also suggests that something worse might have befallen Fiona in a different timeline, likely based on rumors surrounding Bella stating she wanted to "steal" Fiona away from Chris.[33]
After getting released from jail, Chris continued to exploit Spooky's rumors about Bella and Fiona. In his Setting the Record straight video, he accuses Bella of being part of a conspiracy to abuse and manipulate him and repeats misinformation that Bella had intended to blackmail him with a sex tape between him and Fiona at Everfree Northwest.[29] Chris also repeated several rumors that Spooky created about Bella and related people in an interview with Keffals including making up a story that Bella had exposed her to incest fanfictions that she had created, possibly based on Bella allegedly writing such stories under the account narutoisgay77897.[34]

Notes
↑ Often claims that she doesn't want to start conflict, but repeatedly does so with people she targets.
↑ Lied about her conversations with Hurtful Truth Level on several ocassions, leaving out important context from them or otherwise twisting them.
↑ When questioned on why she was intent on doxing minor Chris orbiters, she gave varying answers to this, either saying it was for the sake of "consistency" or due to it being "funny".
↑ Only shared select portions of DMs with Hurtful Truth Level with CWCki mod PsychoNerd054, telling almost no one else in her Burn Book server about them, and spun it to mean that Hurtful was covering for The WCT.
↑ Accused Klop and 4CentUser, two CWCki users that she claimed were "coming around to the truth" of being in on the conspiracy with Hurtful Truth Level when they went against her opinions.
↑ Claimed that she's "not a nobody" after claiming that Hurtful dismissed her as if she wasn't important, citing her "work" on Bella and other Chris orbiters.
↑ Spread rumors about Hurtful Truth Level due to him not acknowledging her.
↑ Went after Christuber GiBi, and encouraged other people to target him for "disrespecting" her. Part of this involved accusing them of several crimes.
↑ A name that The WCT came up with for Spooky following him getting doxed and gossiped about on Kiwi Farms.
↑ Though Fiona is autistic, a trait of hers that's affected how she interacts with others, it should also be noted that autism is a spectrum that comes in many different forms and drastically differs from person to person. Being autistic doesn't necessarily entail being slow-in-the-mind or thinking just like Chris.
