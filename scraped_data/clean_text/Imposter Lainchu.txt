This article is still yet to be completed due to stress. We get a lot of stressful torture in our lives that makes us crash into slumber. Given that inspiration is a big variable, and we may have been lacking of it, this article will be completed as soon as possible, at our own pace... HONEST! This article is missing the following:

“
Unlike a certain "Current Host" on here who is not selling me adequately. Definitely sense our Lainchu within Anaxis moreso than this dude.
”
Chris, expressing his rejection towards WCT as Lainchu.[1]
The WCT being assigned as Lainchu.
After Anaxis had gotten banned from The Place Discord server, The WCT had volunteered to be the fourth person to play Lainchu, and he was assigned the role, calling himself the "Current Host". However, Chris, deeming Anaxis as the "one true channeler"[2], disliked the Watchmen's decision to ban Anaxis, and openly denounced WCT's attempts at channeling Lainchu.
Towards the end of the Lainchu Saga, there was a perceived power struggle between Anaxis and The WCT from the Watchmen that were still in The Place, with The WCT even comparing the competition to the incidents surrounding Liquid Chris.[3]
For these reasons, WCT's version of the character is often dubbed by Christorians as "Imposter Lainchu".

Anaxis' Ban from The Place
Anaxis was the third person to play Lainchu, doing so starting August 2020. He was unexpectedly kicked and banned from The Place server on 19 February 2021, and was stripped of the role thereafter. Following the ban, Anaxis tried to reach out to several of the Watchmen, including Naught, Nova and The WCT. Naught never replied, Kyle's answer to the incident was vague, but The WCT seemed to indicate to him that the reason for his ban was due to him being deemed untrustworthy, with the Watchmen still in the server believing that Anaxis was leaking information about the server to an anonymous source for the creation of MKRNightVee's thread on Kiwi Farms, and MKRNightVee even believing that Anaxis was likely in cahoots with Praetor to some extent.[4]
Chris's Reaction
After Anaxis' ban, Chris questioned Kyle about the reason for this on 20 February 2021.[5] Kyle told Chris that the reason for the ban was due to Anaxis "being unproductive at times". Chris had implored Kyle that the Watchmen bring Anaxis back into the server.
Anaxis then reached out to Chris about it, concerned that the Watchmen could potentially "twist the narrative".[6] He kept touch with Chris, still presenting himself as Lainchu, despite being officially stripped of the role. When The WCT had volunteered for the role of Lainchu, Anaxis sent Chris a warning, telling him to be aware of any rumors that the Watchmen could make surrounding him, and that they intend to replace him as Lainchu.[7]
In the middle of his discussions with the Watchmen about his tendency to masturbate, Chris surprisingly doesn't fall for the ploy to replace Anaxis, and also goes on a tangent about how much he disapproves of the new Lainchu when The WCT intervenes in the conversation.[8] He also considers the reasons that Kyle gave to him as "lame".
Impostor Lainchu (The WCT)
Sex is better when its with somebody you love, not with some stranger you just met like a couple minutes ago.
Chris
I agree with you on that comment. But, on the flip side, you're not the original Lainchu.
Impostor Lainchu (The WCT)
I like to describe myself as a direct descendant of the Original Lainchu.
Chris
Still, @Nova, it was most unfair of you to simply kick him out the way you did. And such lame excuses.
Impostor Lainchu (The WCT)
personalities will be different, and the individual that is given the chance to possesses my powers must be somebody who won't use them for their selfish desires. Its earned, not a given.
Chris
Anyway, I'm still going through my emotions. Sonichu is having a tough him of his own resyncing with his body as well.
Guilt Tripping
After Anaxis got banned, and Chris expressed dissatisfaction, the other Watchmen had tried to convince him to be more active in The Place server. It had gotten to the point that it made MKRNightVee especially angry, and she temporarily disowned Chris. [9]

Chris
Hey, @everyone.
I do sincerely apologize for not checking in with all of you for a while.
The resyncing with my body has been difficult, but progressive.
Nova
It might feel more heartfelt without a reason, giving a reason and no explanation just sounds like another way to shut things down.
Chris
Well, I have been sensing and feeling massively strong energies and events, and it's been difficult to think clearly at times.
So, to give an explanation is a bit much at the moment.
Especially with the heavy energies I have felt today that left my body quaking quite a bit.
Impostor Lainchu (The WCT)
I'm glad you're still around. We were getting sick and worried about you.
[Replying to "Especially with the heavy energies I have felt today that left my body quaking q..."]
is it painful?
Chris
Mildly; more of an annoyance.
Nova
I've seen people who kind of act like that, not distinctively narcissistic, but has some
comparable elements.
Narcissism is fine as long as you win.
Impostor Lainchu (The WCT)
[Replying to "Mildly; more of an annoyance."]
it could be worse, but I'm relieved you're doing fine for the most part. (just promise to keep in touch with us, ok?)
Chris
Is Bismuth still on? I don't see his name on the online/offline list, or did he change it again?
Impostor Lainchu (The WCT)
he changes his name in here every once in a while.
and only appears offline.
Nova
Val left. Don't know if you'd noticed.
Chris
Hmm
Impostor Lainchu (The WCT)
[Replying to "Val left. Don't know if you'd noticed."]
RIP.
Nigel's also gone.
Chris
That is a shame.
Nova
Just look over what led to it. Pity is useless on it's own.
Impostor Lainchu (The WCT)

Chris
I see
Impostor Lainchu (The WCT)
you were gone for so long that they assumed you'd never return.
so they quit.
Chris
That is a bad assumption to make.
Nova
I'm an asshole, but I'm at least affable enough that nobody cares.
Chris
Yep, the paradigm shift did not work favourably here.
The WCT
Hi Chris! glad to see you back here.
Chris
Hey, Neko
Nova
You didn't ask, but it's obvious to say I'm cross too.
Chris
I get it, I should have checked in sooner. Between the events that have been happening and being sensed and all, and frankly, having to reconsider y'all's recent behaviours and whatnot, and looking further into the future and the present to analyze everyone and everything, I had felt it best to take the break.
It was nothing personal.
Impostor Lainchu (The WCT)
I heard MKR got angry at you for a bit, are you two fine now?
your absence dealt an amount of stress on her.
Chris
I mean, Bismuth's leak has been forgiven, but then y'all ditched Anaxis and replaced him, and then there's the bro-ish habit of picking on others in jest that can be misinterpreted; I felt uncertain.
I have talked with Meghan.
And I have apologized to her.
Impostor Lainchu (The WCT)
good.
Chris
I am attempting to practice better selection and analysis of individuals as friends, so it can remain that such things as what happened with Vaughn be the very last that happens with me, or Sonichu in that case.
The WCT
[Replying to "I mean, Bismuth's leak has been forgiven, but then y'all ditched Anaxis and repl..."]
I have no qualms with anybody you're choosing to befriend. You're an adult, and can choose who you want to associate yourself with.
Impostor Lainchu (The WCT)
[Replying to "I am attempting to practice better selection and analysis of individuals as frien..."]
better to be safe than sorry.
Nova
Life is loud, the only option there is is asking questions and if people want to offer meaningful advice.
Chris
Yes
Nova
A lot easier to know someone is lying with facts, but you don't need much.

Welcome back 💜💜
Impostor Lainchu (The WCT)
look at their body language and listen to the tone of their voice.
that's where liars can be exposed.
Chris
[Replying to "look at their body language and listen to the tone of their voice."]
Harder to do that through the Internet. But my abilities to read others' auras and intentions through electronic messages has improved. (edited)
Impostor Lainchu (The WCT)
how long did it take you to improve?
Chris
It's a soulful ability, and I was able to practice it on the one hand while I was in Sonichu's body. And on the other hand, with my body, Sonichu was able to tap into it and learn it's better uses not only for himself, but for the mental record of my body.
Nova
Not really a testable concept.
And regardless it's not a standard of evidence acceptable by anyone else.
I think that's part of why there are biblical standards for prophets.
Chris
[Replying to "Not really a testable concept."]
Says the cynical brainiac who continues to over think math details based on local physics, when the need for that is null, since it is multi-dimensional.
Nova
If it physically exists, physics applies.
Chris
Fair
Nova
I'm an optimist, just that cynicism is how you stay an optimist.
Chris
Not really, the way to optimism is to look and count the positive blessings in everything.
Half Full, or Half Empty with you?
The WCT
[Replying to "Not really, the way to optimism is to look and count the positive blessings in ev..."]
I think that way as well.
anything good that happens, be grateful for it.
[1 👍 reaction, likely from Chris]
Chris
Even if you count both by measuring the full, and then measuring the empty space that has the potential to be filled.
Naught
[Posts an emote]
Impostor Lainchu (The WCT)
sup Bis.
Chris
Hey, Bismuth.
Nova
No, just correct, optimism is useless in an investigation.
The perfect optimist or cynic would probably have died very young.
Chris
[Replying to "No, just correct, optimism is useless in an investigation."]
I could argue that in certain situations, the combined viewpoints of optimism and pessimism can still be very useful in an investigation.
Nova
Just saying something in the middle isn't really a point of argument.
Chris
It's not a riddle without the middle.
Nova
There's really no way to overthink, assuming the validity of the rationale.
And it's a poor excuse when things go wrong.
Chris
On when things go wrong, or the result is a loop, there is opportunity to learn, revise, and find the conclusion. (edited)
Nova
Easy to just say these things. (edited)
Chris
Better to say when not offending than to keep quiet and not be heard.
Anyway
It's been a long day for me, and I'll be breaking for supper shortly. I will check y'all again in the near future.
Battle for Control
Main article: Anaxis bird
Following Chris's release of his Affirmations List and Lovers Attributes List, Chris makes mention of an "Anaxis bird" possibly telling the other Watchmen about his plans in making both of these lists. Due to Chris's misuse of a common idiom, the Watchmen had mistakenly believed that Anaxis was manipulating Chris, and that there was a power struggle between him and The WCT as Lainchu.
The Watchmen tried to dissociate Chris from Anaxis by giving him new lore, trying to convince Chris that Anaxis was "Imposter Lainchu", and that the one played by The WCT was the real one. After the Watchmen had failed to convince Chris with this ploy, The WCT, as well as the remaining Watchmen, dropped the Lainchu character, and they instead began enabling him with the use of other lolcows they followed and other fictional characters.
