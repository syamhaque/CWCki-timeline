“
I started following Chris in early 2009 and I saved pretty much everything having to do with him that I came across. So I have his early videos in their original format, and a bunch of the early leaked stuff, still compressed as ZIPs/RARs. I will sift through all of it to see if there's anything else in there of interest.

Background
According to Statustjej, they have followed Chris and his misadventures since at least early 2009. Statusthej then went out of their way to download the vast majority of content related to Chris, seemingly up to before the death of Chris's father.
Statustjej saved all of this content on a hard drive, letting it sit for over a decade. While searching for the "Creepy Smile" video in said hard drive, they uploaded the video on YouTube, and have decided to dig through the hard drive to find more videos to post on Wayback Machine's Internet Archive.

Comments
The following is comments Statustjej left on YouTube giving and clarifying information.
Commenter
Where'd you get this [referring to Chris Chan creepy smile video]
Statustjej
Found it on an old hard drive alongside a bunch of other ancient Chris Chan material. I also found the rather explicit PandaHalo audio logs from September 2008, which I uploaded to the Internet Archive.
Commenter
cool according to the cwcki it's been lost media for a decade
Statustjej
Yeah, I was looking for that one online recently but could only a short snippet. I started following Chris in early 2009 and I saved pretty much everything having to do with him that I came across. So I have his early videos in their original format, and a bunch of the early leaked stuff, still compressed as ZIPs/RARs. I will sift through all of it to see if there's anything else in there of interest.
Commenter
According to the cwcki you've got quite a lot , I wonder how much more people can learn from this archive you've got
Statustjej
That should not be exaggerated. The really old stuff I have is only about 16 GB in total. Of course, the video files in there are very lo-fi and thus small in size. Don't have too high hopes. By the way the "power" zip-file was hugely disappointing I'm afraid. The lost "specialthx" text file inside that archive is really short and not very interesting. Here is its entire contents:
falsionmkII for the audio
D.D. (i miss you hal) for writing the code to extract these files
Commenter
Why now nearly twenty years later?
Statustjej
I was just totally unaware of there being any "lost media" related to Chris until very recently.
Commenter
You are a hero for preserving all this Christory that was thought to be lost forever. Especially the S3x logs and PowerPoint 🙏
Have you thought about dumping your entire collection of Chris Chan related files? I know most of it could be stuff we seen already, but it would still be interesting to sift through.
Statustjej
Thank you! Yes, I been thinking about doing that. A bit concerned about all the NSFW images and vids though. I'm working on sorting and organizing the files better (which is sorely needed either way), making sure to keep the explicit stuff separate from the rest. When I'm done I'll decide how to deal with this issue.
Commenter
wow were you in the original pvcc group by any chance
Statustjej
Nope, I was not; nor was I a part of any other trollin' group.
