c/o Central Virginia Regional Jail

Orange, Virginia 22960
Dear Goddess Blue Heart, Savior and Messiah, Christine Westion Chandler Sonichu,
I do apologize, I am unsure of your full name and title. I have been following you for quite a while on the internet, and have been watching your currently legal situation with much interest (as I work in a related field). I am sure you are being bombarded with letters, some good and some bad, but I wished to reach out to you to ask about your current situation and for some elaboration on previous statements you have made in other letters.
Firstly, I hope the jail isn't treating you too badly! How is it in there? I haven't had the fortune, or misfortune, to visit Central Virginia Regional Jail but I have been in a few other VA correctional facilities so I can imagine a little what it's like. Have you made any new friends inside?
Next, I have seen you mention several times that you are the second coming of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, which is needless to say quite an astounding thing to learn! I myself have found it a little hard to understand what you have said about the coming separation of the good hearted people and the wicked trolls who have tormented you so badly throughout your life. Could you please elaborate on that for me a bit? What will happen to me?
Finally, I wish you good luck and good health inside! I and very interested in the coming events of as you prophesied, and look forward to the destruction of the evil trolls!
Sincerely,
<CENSORED>[note 1]

Dear █████████,
Thank you for the kindness and respect in your letter. Yours, outside of my attorney, and Barbara, is the first letter I had received from a follower who lives in Virginia.
Well, overall, and in short, the staff treat me well enough. At start, the genuine positive vibrations really and spiritual energy Really sold this place well. Then I've experienced the attitudes and bad habits from some of the real Jerkops, and really noisy neighbours after my Body was relocated from Medical to Booking. But the food is mostly good, the commissary has good items on offer, and I've enjoyed the Rec Room a few times. This facility is 2/5 stars.
I've hardly made friends here, but more like kind allies with the more positive staff. And I have continued to work in my Goddess responsibilities and duties out-of-Body.
I am the full reincarnation of Jesus Christ, complete with ALL of the memories from year Zero to physical ascension to Heaven, changed my appearance, and walked the Earth more in my Immortal life, living Many different Books of identities and lives, up til 1389 when the Universe was divided, and I was fully transported Forward and Backward throughout Time, Space, and Dimensions to fly through the Chaotic Rainbow's apex in 2003, and then be reborn on February 24, 1982.

Firstly, I do not look upon the term, "Troll" as a negative, as there are Good Trolls/People and Bad Trolls/People, and All have an innate want to paTrol and observe/comment on others, regardless. The ones that are wicked are the Haters, Fakers, and the Darkest of Demonics and Sinners who are Toxic to the Majority. A Lot of what has happened, is happening right now with and all around you, and is to happen are covered between The last couple of books in the Old Testament of Any Bible, as well as how I had described the Dimension Merge in early 2018. Although the whole picturesque event is popularly referred to as The Day of Judgment, This is actually comprised of the Dimension Merge (the recombining of the divided Universe), which has been Completed, The Collective Shift (relocating the Majority to the recombined Earth of Universe 1C-211987 from this 1218 Earth, here) that is in (more spiritual) progress and happening now, and my Second Coming where I shall descend at my Temple and fully, physically, relocate the Majority to our recombined Earth (with the Sonichu Temple, as well as other select buildings, artifacts, statues, etcetra), leaving behind the Toxic Minority on the failing 1218 Earth to burn.
<CENSORED>, thou art among the Neutral-Good and shall transcend with everyone, so thou hath nothing to fear, especially as thou continues to be as good as possible as thou hath done so.
Go forth in Peace and Clarity by my Power, Glory and Authority as God, <CENSORED>. Be Safe and Well,
Mrs. Jesus Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu, the
Goddess Blue Heart and Lord, Savior, and Messiah, and God of all.
