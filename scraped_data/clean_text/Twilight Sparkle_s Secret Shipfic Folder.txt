Twilight Sparkle's Secret Shipfic Folder or TSSSF is a fan-made My Little Pony trading card game that satirizes the Internet phenomena known as shipping. Unsurprisingly, Chris has latched onto this card game, presumably learning about it at BronyCon 2019, and has produced a number of original cards for the game based off of his Sonichu characters and those of others, not unlike his Wall of Originals. Like his attempts at making Yu-Gi-Oh cards, his custom TSSSF cards have lost sight of the original game's mechanics and have simply become another creative medium for Chris, arguably the successor to his comic books. He created at least 644 cards so far, many of which were seen in the numerous spreads on Twitter and in his YouTube videos.

Card production
Chris simply uses a template linked from the website of the official TSSSF page.[3] Consequentially, the card types (meant for pony characters) do not match the subject matter of most of Chris's Sonichu recolor cards and instead have types shoehorned in (such as Sonichu being typed as Earth Pony). For the physical cards, Chris uses a website called Make Playing Cards.com or MPC, a print on demand site similar to Lulu but exclusively for custom trading cards.[4][5]

Pricing
While at first these prices seem highly exorbitant, the prices were high for a reason. With shipping included, Chris was actually selling a few of these packs at a near-loss. The custom card printing company Chris used offered bulk discounts, however rather than taking in all orders (if there are any) and shipping them out at a determined point in time, Chris instead shipped out orders as they came in, adding extra and potentially unneeded costs.

An expansion set dedicated to Sonichu fan OCs was inspirited by this drawing. Gotta fuck 'em all.
Chris would contact all the artists to collab and send out free copies of fan OC cards to the artists.
