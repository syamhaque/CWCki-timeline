================================================================================

100 2357.MOV is a video Chris uploaded on 22 November 2010. For the sixth time, Chris announces he is going to leave the Internet. Chris also removed all his other YouTube videos around the time this one was uploaded. His glasses have still not been replaced or repaired properly.
This video was probably prompted by the fact that on this day Jackie sent him a lengthy email enumerating his faults, killing his hope that they might eventually have sex and disillusioning him about online relationships.
Chris's speech implied that he would spend time outside of his humble abode and attempt to socialize with others. Unsurprisingly, he instead spent the majority of his time playing PS3 and making LittleBigPlanet mods. Chris would return to the Internet in full, complete with videos, roughly eight months later. However, he has never been the same since early 2011, so this could be considered as the final chapter of the classic Chris-Chan we all loved.
