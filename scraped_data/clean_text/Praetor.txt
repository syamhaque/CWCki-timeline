“
Our goal is not just to be screwing with Christine. Our goal here is just to make cash with her, as a partnership - right?
”
Praetor leader Caden Peck[1]
Praetor's logo
Praetor LLC is a group of carpetbaggers and enablers. They first came into contact with Chris in 2020 with the aim of producing and selling Sonichu and Chris-themed products on their Etsy store OfficialCWCmart with Chris's permission, giving him a cut of the profits. In December 2020, Praetor began offering Sonichu medallions for sale, which were produced by the group and approved of by Chris. Praetor has since expanded to other, more bizarre, products, some produced by the group, and others by Chris. Chris's income split for products made by him is unknown. As of 2023, OfficialCWCmart has generated more than 3000 sales, giving them a minimum of between $49,905 and $116,000 in revenue, although their actual revenue is unknown but potentially higher.[2] While the sales have slowed down considerably, by March 2024, the number has increased to over 4200.
During the Jail Saga, Chris continued communicating with them, mailing them art from jail, which they added to OfficialCWCmart.
Upon Chris's being released from jail, they have continued their involvement. In June 2023, Praetor member Caden Peck was involved with financing a Big Island, VA house, which Chris moved into later that year. During The Chris Chan Interview, Chris mentioned paying rent. Chris has uploaded or live-streamed several highly edited videos which all promote OfficialCWCmart.

Membership
From left to right: Annie Ikenberry, Cabell O'Malley, Caden Peck, and Chris.
“
In the group, Annie is very much psychically able. Owen is like the magician of the group; among his skill set, he can also make a variety of special teas and such that can be like potions and elixirs. Cabell is also psychically inclined, but she's the artist. Caden is very open-minded, and the brains and business.
”
Chris[3]
While Caden is the leader of Praetor and presumably does most of the heavy lifting, there were at least three other members as of late 2020, along with several additional collaborators. The four core members were all students at Goochland High School in Goochland, Virginia. Owen left the group sometime prior to June 2021, and while there's no conclusive evidence on Annabel leaving, she had a 10 month break in making content following 25 December 2023, after which she had made her own website to sell her content on. There is no indication that Cabell remained involved with Praetor after Chris's arrest for incest in August 2021, making Caden the only confirmed remaining member. It's very possible, however, that he has since hired more members to produce art, as many of the products made since aren't total shite.
Caden Michael Peck
Main article: Caden Peck
Caden Michael Peck (born 17 September 2002),[4] also known as tinyhorse01, is the leader of Praetor. In June 2023, Caden, along with Essential Estate LLC, purchased a Big Island, VA house. Chris currently lives in the house and pays rent.
Annabel Ikenberry
Annabel "Annie" Renée Ikenberry (annirenee) is an erocosplayer and OnlyFans camgirl. In Taser Discussion, Caden implies that her OnlyFans was one of Praetor's business ventures, and that she had created it to make money for Praetor. According to Chris, she is "psychically able." In a 17 February 2021 discussion with the Watchmen, Chris confessed that he had considered her for a possible relationship.[5]
Owen Sundstrom
Owen Scott Sundstrom (owen_sundstrom) is the former co-founder of Praetor. He was present at the Goochland Library Sermon, where he was photographed posing with Chris. He also appears to be the photographer who took the picture of Chris and Praetor at the Chinese restaurant. According to Chris, Owen is "like the magician of the group; among his skill set, he can also make a variety of special teas and such that can be like potions and elixirs." Owen, along with Caden, suggested a link between the Mayan calendar and Chris's dream about a golden disc.[3]
In June 2021, a Christorian left a comment on Owen's Instagram, writing:[6]
Can’t believe such a pretty face could be such a scummy person. Trying to convince an autistic man to tease himself while simultaneously making thousands of dollars by using said autistic man’s internet notoriety
Owen responded to this:
🤣 awe u think I’m pretty? Also that wasn’t me,, I tried to give Chris as much money as I could,, but I was cut outta preator,, I only got 10% even tho is was a partnership, and I was in Chris’s corner tryna make sure he wasn’t taken advantage of,, however I do regret starting preator,, I was the wizard, not the business man
Cabell O'Malley
Cabell Fitzpatrick O'Malley was described by Chris in the Naught DMs as "psychically inclined, but she's the artist." Cabell is the blonde woman featured in the Instagram photo of Praetor and Chris at a Chinese restaurant. Initially, Praetor mistagged Cabell, linking an unrelated account to her.
Given that Chris had referred to Cabell as the artist, it can be assumed that she was responsible for producing the medallions, as Chris has mentioned that the artist of the group was the one who created them.

Isabella Loretta Janke
Main article: Isabella Loretta Janke
Isabella "Bella" Loretta Janke was commissioned by Praetor to animate Chris Chan Sonichu Intro animation, an animation of Chris and the Sonichu characters, which Chris uploaded to his YouTube channel. After Bella produced the animation, Chris sought contact with her, and the two began chatting independently[7] - the most notable chats being the July 2021 Incest Call and Incest Texts, which ultimately led to the Jail Saga.
Despite her minimal role in the group, Chris has repeatedly referred to her as a member of Praetor.[citation needed]
Golden Church of Sonichu members
Main article: Golden Church of Sonichu
Messages from the Discord server Golden Church of Sonichu show that the members were working with Praetor. One member was supposedly making a video game, another was working on CGI for Praetor's Chris Chan movie, and another was making Chris Chan themed clothes. These members presumably stopped their interactions with Chris once the Jail Saga started.
Before Chris
Caden, Owen, Annie, and Cabell were all students at Goochland High School in Goochland, Virginia in the late 2010s.
Caden had claimed that Praetor has been around since 2017, working with "creative types."[8]. If this is true, Caden would have been 14 or 15 years old at the time of Praetor's creation. Caden also claimed that they worked with Kevin Baugh, founder of the Republic of Molossia (no relation), and wrote a dissertation for him in order to officiate Molossia as a sovereign nation.[8]
Praetor used to have a dedicated website, but was taken down by Caden due to the domain costs. He decided that instead of waiting to have "eccentric people" find him, he would personally reach out to them himself.[8] Naught once claimed that Praetor went after other lolcows before Chris, including Tommy Tooter, whom they tried to make products for.[9]
The Beginning
Meeting Chris
The golden medallion Praetor gave to Chris
Chris in a meeting with Caden
“
I've always known about Christine. She always struck me as unique in the sense that she is probably one of the most famous people ever who has profited the least from her fame.
When I heard that she had tried to launch a store before, but been overwhelmed, I knew that there was a chance at profit. I run almost everything I do privately, so I reached out to Christine myself.
”
Caden[8]
On 21 September 2020, a "trio of fans" came to Chris's door with a golden Sonichu medallion, crafted by "the young lady of the group, with paint that had a mixture of 24K gold in it." The "tall boys" had a business proposition for Chris, that with their mold press, they could mass produce and sell Sonichu medallions.[10] Chris accepted, deeming them as trustworthy, and noted that he had a vision earlier where an artist crafted medallions for him.
“
They have their business based in Goochland.
And I could tell by soul-reading them that their intentions were legit, honest and true.
”
Chris[10]
Introduced to the Watchmen
Main article: Praetor-Watchmen Conflicts
On 22 September 2020, Chris made a post on The Place Discord server, where he mentioned that he was meeting with some "new associates."[10] He mentions that they were going to talk about "the molding to mass produce the medallions, and possibly the figures, with optional Amiibo functions, in a little while." After being asked who these associates were, Chris refused to give their identities but gave details about their first interaction.
On the 25th, Chris mentioned them to the Watchmen again, revealing their name as Praetor LLC[11]. On 3 October, Chris mentioned to them that Praetor was helping him create a "lore bible."[12]. On the 15th, Praetor's Discord account, ran by Caden Peck, joined the The Place Discord server, and answered the Watchmen's questions.[8]
Introduced to the Public
On 16 October, they arranged for Chris to give a sermon at Goochland library, where he spewed his Dimensional Merge delusions. This spiel was done in front of a large screen displaying the Praetor logo. When it was eventually released on YouTube, it started with a loud dramatic opening, commissioned from an unknown source. They also added sarcastic captions, mocking Chris. The Praetor members took photos with Chris after the sermon.
With Caden.
With Owen.
Arguably one of the most iconic images of Chris out there, appearing on news articles and formerly on his Wikitubia page until 1 March 2024.
On 19 October, Praetor's presence was made known to the public, when they released multiple photos of Chris and the members of Praetor at a Chinese restaurant. One of these images included the members' Instagram handles, making it very easy for them to get doxxed.
With Instagram handles.
On 13 November 2020, Chris uploaded Chris Chan Sonichu Intro animation, an animation that Praetor had commissioned from Isabella Loretta Janke. After this, Bella began regularly chatting with Chris, eventually becoming rather infamous for unrelated reasons.
Starting the Etsy shop
Praetor somehow manages to make the medallion look worse
Golden Church of Sonichu Cult Robe, sold a year after the server died out
In December, Praetor created an Etsy shop, OfficialCWCmart, where they began selling Sonichu medallions made by the group. The medallions produced by them manage to look much worse than any medallions made by Chris, and are completely inconsistent in how they look. According to several reviews on their store, they aren't also given enough time to dry up, resulting in still wet paint and hair stuck to the surface.
“

”
Praetor's Etsy account, confirming that the products being shipped will be dogshit, even by Chris's standards
Praetor has since offered items made by Chris himself for sale, such as some medallion variants and Jail Art. Aside from a royalty payment from January 2021, made by Praetor to Chris when OfficialCWCmart was only selling Praetor-made medallions,[13] Chris's share of the profits is unknown. When an Instagram user accused Owen Sundstrom of exploiting Chris for money, he responded, claiming that he tried to give Chris as much as he could.
“
That wasn’t me,, I tried to give Chris as much money as I could,, but I was cut outta preator,, I only got 10% even tho is was a partnership, and I was in Chris’s corner tryna make sure he wasn’t taken advantage of,,
”
Owen[6]
Royalty payment
On 7 December 2020, Praetor began offering Sonichu medallions for sale on OfficialCWCmart; the medallions were produced by the group and approved of by Chris. In exchange, Chris was paid a royalty for the use of his Sonichu IP.
A month later, the Watchmen noticed that OfficialCWCmart had made $5,900 worth of sales revenue on their medallion product, also the store's only product at the time.[14] In mid-January 2021, Chris told the Watchmen he had received nearly $400 in small cash amounts for his share.[13] This equates to at least a 6.7% royalty (possibly more as date of Chris's payment is unknown). While royalty rates can vary, Chris's rate falls within a typical range.[15]
Other information is unknown, such as Praetor's operating costs for the medallions and how much profit the group members had after expenses.
The Watchmen - among them MKRNightVee and Naught - erroneously believed that Chris was entitled to "almost all" of Praetor's revenue for the medallions.[14] In the Taser Discussion call from February 2021, MKR and Naught complained to Praetor's Caden. Chris himself did not mind, again pointing out he had been paid $400.
Golden Church of Sonichu
Main article: Golden Church of Sonichu
Praetor also created a Discord server, Golden Church of Sonichu, which was created for anyone who bought their Golden Medallions on their Etsy shop. The server served as another outlet for Chris to rant about his delusions. Caden often posted in there too, giving insight into Praetor's bizarre business plans.
“
-Christine has fully greenlit [REDACTED]'s video game. Please message Chris directly as soon as possible, as Christine would like to provide some direction with the game's storyline.
-The Praetor Flamethrower will be stress-tested this upcoming week at a local firing range sponsoring us. Please standby for future details.
-Christine has approved the future sale of Potions blessed by her. These are to be sold for less than $17 apiece, but a fixed price has not yet been decided. We need help finding cheaply shipped glassware in bulk. As cheap as possible is best, as we are going to be selling 3-4 kinds of potions stocked at at least 12 each. Bottles must be at very least 4oz, at most 16oz.
-Christine's Golden Medallions have already sold out. Expect more members soon.
-Test footage for [REDACTED] has been filmed in order to see if she can cgi a Sonichu next to Chris, allowing us to feature a Sonichu in the upcoming Chris Chan Movie. Please complete this as soon as possible, and we will kiss you on the mouth.
”
Caden[16]
Upon hacking into Isabella Loretta Janke's account, a short clip showing the behind-the-scenes process of the Chris Chan Movie was leaked. It shows Chris posing as a Praetor member commentates, telling him specific poses to do, while he's supposedly standing next to Rosechu, who would be added in post as a CGI character.
Taser Controversy
See also: Taser and Taser Discussion
On 15 November 2020, Praetor posted a screenshot of an online shopping service's shopping cart - in the cart was a Pikachu mask and a VIPERTEK VTS-989 560 BV stun gun (they later claimed the image was for promotion of sales of autographed "tasers".)
In February 2021, Chris stated that he wanted to borrow one of Praetor's tasers to stun his Gate Crystal and Celestial Key quartz crystals in an attempt to activate the Dimensional Merge.[17] The Watchmen confronted Caden about this, saying that it was dangerous for the organization to allow Chris to use a taser, though Caden insisted that Chris would be safe by using a less powerful version of the taser. Talks broke down when Watchmen members began insulting Caden on Discord, with him returning the favor; all parties including Chris agreed to have a call on the issue. During the call, one of the Watchmen - Val - sarcastically asked about Chris tazing himself. Chris half-jokingly replied that he would. Caden objected and reiterated it would be a bad idea.
The Watchmen members MKRNightVee and Naught then chose to spread lies about the potential taser use. In particular, MKRNightVee falsely claimed that the taser was meant to be used on Chris.
Sales
A message left for a customer who bought a taser
In 2022, Praetor began selling tasers previously autographed by Chris on OfficialCWCmart, supposedly for the purpose of simulating "zapping to the extreme" for buyers.
The tasers had originally been meant for sale, but were temporarily shelved due to some members of the Watchmen instigating drama and spreading lies over the taser.[18]
However, Etsy quickly removed the listing. Eventually, Praetor created a listing titled 'The Secret Listing', a listing that had no information on what it was.[19] It was later revealed that The Secret Listing was a taser, with the fact hidden in order to bypass Etsy guidelines.[20]
One of the people who bought the taser would mail it to the channel SuperMega, where they would unbox it on video.[21]
Jail Saga

Praetor's message to a customer who bought a piece of jail art
Caden Peck continued to do business with Chris during the latter's stay at Central Virginia Regional Jail on an incest charge.
In May 2022, OfficialCWCmart began selling art that Chris made in jail. The store also added audio clips of Chris promoting their medallions from jail to their Etsy. Aside from these, the products sold on the store became increasingly strange, including arrowheads, cult robes, and signed g-fuel.
Interview
Main article: March 2023 Praetor Interview
In March 2023, Praetor had an interview with a Kiwi Farms user. In this interview, they have claimed that Chris calls them twice a week about the Etsy store. They also stated that the store has earned Chris a lot of money, despite him still being in jail by that time.
“
Chris calls twice a week to deal with the store, as no listings are made with out his express oversight. As for the cease and desists, we'd just advise that folk stay out of any trouble. Chris's cash has been accumulating, as the money he gets from both the store and monthly disability hasn't been touched while incarcerated.
”
Praetor
They have also stated that the reason Chris hasn't sent any letters or had any visitors is because David Heilberg, Chris's lawyer, advised them to not let any "ill-meaning folk" near Chris.
“
Both the lack of recent letters and having no visitors is intentional, as Heilberg advised us to close any way for ill-meaning folk to get close.
”
Praetor
They offer more insider knowledge on Chris, such as the fact that he had had grown a beard while in jail, and that he had plans to return, with strange aspirations as well, which did come true with the release of Jesus Christ Chan Sonichu Prime Resurrected and Returned.
Post-jail involvement
See also: OfficialCWCmart#Post-Jail Saga Items
After plenty of sightings online and offline, Chris finally made his grand return in October 2023. Along with Chris's return, OfficialCWCmart returned as well, stocked with a plethora of new items. This included new Sonichu medallions, with brand new pictures of Chris in front of a green screen, new promotions of Neo Spiritual Christianity, and dozens upon dozens of lost commissions that Chris drew for the Everfree Northwest fundraiser in 2021
Chris's new videos from this point forward were incredibly high quality (for Chris's standards), making it very likely that Praetor was behind these videos, as they have had previous experience with high-quality editing and Chris uses the same green screen which is used in the Etsy store. Chris also consistently promoted OfficialCWCmart in the description of these videos. The list of products has later further increased in January 2024, though they appear to be the same overpriced low quality stuff as before. This has also expanded to art commissions for a totally reasonable sum of $225-300.
In June 2023, Caden Peck and Essential Estate LLC bought a property in Big Island, VA where Chris currently lives and pays rent.
