A snippet of an Emergency Protective Order against Chris, in favor of his mother, following their incest.
An Emergency Protective Order (EPO) is a legal document issued by a judge. Its purpose is to protect alleged victims from "an act of violence, force, or threat." Either the alleged victim or a law enforcement officer may request one. EPOs are temporary and set to expire.[1]
In July 2021, an EPO was served against Chris following the leaks of the Incest Call and Incest Texts, in which he had bragged about having sex with his mother Barbara Chandler. The EPO ordered Chris to stay away from Barbara, the "allegedly abused person".
Of note is that an EPO is not the same as a criminal charge. Despite the wording of the EPO suggesting Barbara to be a victim, Chris was only charged with felony incest by way of Virginia Code 18.2-366, which doesn't specify a victim.[2][3]
Null, who had been acting as a manager for the Help send Chris-Chan to Everfree NW fundraiser, was in contact with Chris and acquired a snippet from the EPO, which he later leaked.[4]

Snippet of EPO against Chris
Based on the above assertion and other evidence, I find that (if checked below):
[ ] A warrant for a violation of $ 18.2-57.2 has been issued and there is probable danger of further acts of family abuse against the allegedly abused person, _____, by the Respondent; OR
[X] Reasonable grounds exist to believe that Respondent has committed family abuse and there is probable danger of a further such offense against the allegedly abused person, Chandler, Barbra, by the Respondent.
It is ORDERED that the request is hereby [ ] denied [X] granted and ORDERED that the Respondent shall observe the following conditions:
[X] The Respondent shall not commit acts of family abuse or criminal offenses that result in injury to person or property.
[X] The Respondent shall have no contact of any kind with Chandler, Barbra
(X] except as follows: Not to go within 300 feet of Petitioner
[ ] The Respondent is also prohibited from being in the physical presence of _____
[ ] The allegedly abused person is granted possession of the companion animal described as _____
[X] Chandler, Barbra, the family or household member, is granted possession of the premises occupied by the parties, located at 14 Branchland Ct Ruckersville, VA. to the exclusion of the Respondent; however, no such grant of possession shall affect title to any real or personal property.
Effects on Chris
As noted above, the EPO temporarily compelled Chris to stay 300 feet away from Barbara, and explicitly banned him from 14 Branchland Court, Barbara's house in which he had also lived. The EPO was issued on 30 July 2021 and was set to expire on 5 August 2021.[5]
Made temporarily homeless, Chris retained possession of the Chandler vehicle, the Dodge Caravan. He attempted to drive to Aunt Harriet and Uncle Tom's to stay, but was disinvited. He then slept in the vehicle overnight, before acquiring a room at the Regency Inn Richmond.[6]
As Chris had little money, he chose to log into Barbara's bank account and send himself $750 to help fund the room, deeming it an "emergency".[7]
Null, who had access to Chris's email account, noticed an email from Bank of America noting the transaction. Null then asked Chris if he had requested the money from Barbara, concerned that such contact could violate the EPO. Chris answered, claiming he has refrained from contacting her. Null pressed further, to which Chris admitted that he had online control over Barbara's account. The revelation compelled Null to block Chris.[7] Null, assuming it to be a case of theft and a potential EPO violation, then reported Chris to the police.[4] However, Chris was not charged for it.
