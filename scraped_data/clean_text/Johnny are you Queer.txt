================================================================================

"Johnny are you Queer" is the 10th track from SPARKLE like you mean it: ROBEE'S BALLAD by Robee Sonee and the Tomgirls. It is a cover of the song "Johnny, Are You Queer?" by Josie Cotton.
The cover is close to the original song, yet Chris seems to be uncomfortable singing it (opting to speak-sing the song completely unlike the original, ala Ke$ha), particularly with the terms "queer" (he drastically changes his tone) and "gay" (which he isn't able to bring himself to say at all, letting the actual lyrics fill in.)
Since the album is tomgirl-themed, some say the line, "You lost your inheritance," could be a reference to Bob's disapproval for Chris's cross-dressing.

Lyrics
Johnny, what's the deal, boy?
Is your love for real, boy?
When the lights are low
you never hold her close
Now, I saw you today, boy
Walking with them ---- (skipped: gay) boys
Now you hurt me so - now I gotta know
Johnny? Are you queer?
-sigh-
When I see you
dancing with your friends
SHE CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER
-pause- where she stands
I'm so 'fraid I'll lose you
if she can't see-duce you
Is there something wrong, Johnny, c'mon... strong
Wha - why are you so weird, boy
Johnny, are you QUEER boy?
When she makes a play
you pusherd her away
'Cause when uh... you... umf...
'Cause when I see you
dancing wi' her friends
She's worrying and wondering
Where she stands
Johnny, you've forsaken
A love you could be taking
She wants to give it to you, boy,
but you never come through!
Why are you s-so weird boy,
Johnny, are you qwheer boi
When you asked for a date
She thought you where straight, but, Johnny, what the hell? Are you queer?
-goes into a monologue at this point-
Johnny, are you queer, man?!
Ah-ah-I mean I gotta know, you tell me.
What the hell, are you queer?
Uh-ugh I mean I gotta tell 'ya, if you are, boy, then you're just bothering me. And her.
I gotta leave you man, you lost your inheritance.
I'm out.
