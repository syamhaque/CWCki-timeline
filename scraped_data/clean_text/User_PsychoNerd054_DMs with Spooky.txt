Spooky's Profile Pic on Kiwi Farms
This page contains a set of selected Discord DMs I have had with Spooky Bones between September to November 2021. My messages are color-coded blue, while Spooky's are color-coded magenta. Though the transcripts provided are mostly faithful to the DMs we've had personally, I have also decided to censor the names of some of the people involved in her
group. I chose to do this as I was uncertain of their overall role with Spooky, and didn't want them being dragged back into old drama.

Background
Spooky Bones, also known as Spooky, Regina and MakeFetchHappen, was the owner of the Burn Book Discord server, leader of the Mean Girls, and the leading figure in the investigation of Isabella Loretta Janke and her associates.[note 1] Spooky also created the OP of Bella's original megathread on Kiwi Farms on 1 August 2021,[1] and Null later made them a moderator of the newly established subforum on Bella.
Though initially held in high regard on several Chris-related circles due to their findings surrounding Bella, Spooky is now infamous for being largely responsible for the spreading of many scandalous rumors and gossip about people in the CWCSphere on a large scale. Most infamously, this included their conflicts with several CWCki staff members, including Marvin and Anaxis, accussing them of conspiring with people from the Everfree and Incest sagas like Bella and The WCT. However, she had most of their attention on the jerkop and bureaucrat Hurtful Truth Level, perpetuating a narrative to many people that Hurtful covered for the Idea Guys, and was now doing the same thing with The WCT, who was perceived to be doing far worse things to Chris.
Spooky and her group then started to investigate the CWCki's Discord server on 3 September 2021 due to one of its previous owners, Anaxis, being tied to The WCT, and rumors that Bella and Fiona had first met there. She came to conclude the latter due to a ban being placed on the server, discouraging people from discussing her due to the server being marked as a harassment server. I, being the only person (let alone jerkop) on the CWCki to regularly post on the subforum, expressed how strange and seemingly counterintuitive the Bella rule was, something which I think caught the attention of Spooky.
On 7 September 2021, one of Spooky's associates invited me onto their Burn Book Discord Server, as the members there seemed to take special interest in me propogating much of what was being said in the ILJ subforum on the CWCki, and talking with the other regulars of the subforum in DMs. Many other people who frequented Bella's subforum were also invited into the server as "guests". While I was on the server, I asked for feedback from Spooky and those on the server for my edits, believing that Null, the one who promoted Spooky, and CWCki staff like Marvin and Hurtful were aware that this server existed.
Those present were later suspicous about Hurtful Truth Level's "CarbonCoffee99" account supposedly covering for The WCT and Anaxis. I and other members on there also came to the conclusion that they could be "coffee", a name that was mentioned in chats involving Bella. At one point, we came to believe that The WCT was the one behind the account, hence the ban reason I gave to the account on the 8th. Later, we came to conclude it possibly wasn't Sean, hence why I later changed it on the 11th.[2]
When Hurtful told me that they were CarbonCoffee on 13 September 2021, I intended to tell the people at Burn Book this in the hopes of easing tensions, letting them know that CarbonCoffee might not have been doing anything malicious. This seemed to have the opposite effect, however, as I can vaguely remember the people in the server seeing this as a big deal. I also vaguely remember this was what led to some of the DMs that occured after Hurtful admitted to being CarbonCoffee (I think it was after the post where I told them it'd probably be better for people to know about the sock, I don't know to be perfectly honest), as I think I was told by the people there to question him about the "coffee" person we were investigating. After interviewing me about the incident, Spooky later created a thread on Kiwi Farms about Hurtful's supposed involvement with bad actors on 18 September 2021, hours after he made his statement on the CWCki.[3]
Following this, and several other incidents of infighting in the ILJ subforum, Spooky was demoted by Null on 2 October,[4] Null made a thread regarding the shitshow two days later,[5] and Null finally closed it on 4 November 2021.[6] Despite this, Spooky continued to go after the CWCki staff she'd accussed of being involved in conspiracies, to the point she eventually began targeting me when I didn't fit their vague ideals. Spooky was eventually banned from the Kiwi Farms entirely on 14 November 2021, but their actions have still left a massive impact. Many of the rumors that Spooky and their group perpetuated, such as Bella's supposed suicide plot, lingered for a long time amongst the CWCsphere, for them to then be brought to Chris while he was in jail, and would later wind up being parroted by Chris in jail letters and videos. The rumors that she spread about the CWCki staff had also gotten so bad that Anaxis had to write a comprehensive essay with the intent of debunking pretty much all of Spooky's claims.[7] Despite this, several people have or otherwise still continue to perpetuate much of the claims Spooky had propogated, or otherwise put their own twist on them for their own gain.[8]
Considering how much of a negative impact much of Spooky's actions have left on the discourse surrounding Chris, I only feel it's necessary to share my personal experiences with them so that similarly curious people don't wind up in the same situation I got myself in.

Allegations against HTL

I am trying to manage the politics of this safely

One of the first things Spooky tells me in DMs
13 September 2021
This is where the Discord DM I had with Spooky begins, 6 days since I've joined the Burn Book server.
After implementing the Suitress Policy on the CWCki, and having used Fiona's name on this website multiple times prior to that, I've wanted the ability to delete edits in the same way that staff on the site did with the Wallflower. I initially thought that Jerkops had the ability, but was mistaken entirely, so I tried to reach out to Hurtful to make sure I can obtain the ability, but to no avail as he disallowed other people from starting DMs with him. I don't remember exactly what happend down the line, but judging by the DMs I've had with Hurtful on Kiwi Farms, I at some point reached out to Spooky, who by that time was a mod on the ILJ subforum, so that she could assist me in reaching out to Hurtful. Hurtful then reached out to me on 6 September 2021. In the conversation I've had with Hurtful, he informs me that he's unable to grant me the ability, and instead to reach out to Marvin, so I talk to him, and he grants me the ability. The stuff in between that and when Hurtful reveals they were CarbonCoffee on the 13th are mostly unrelated but, as stated earlier, I inform the people on Burn Book about the reveal, and they were utterly shocked at this revelation. The stuff that came after Hurtful's reveal, as I stated, I believe was a result of the people at Burn Book telling me to question Hurtful about the "coffee" person from the Bella logs.
Spooky then starts their Discord DM with me clarifying this by telling me about allegations against Hurtful that she'd heard, claiming that he (and by extension Marvin) were covering up for The WCT, which in utter shock I accepted without giving that acussation a second thought. Spooky also tells me that Hurtful had tried to cover for the Idea Guys as well. She seemingly got this idea from a thread from the CWCki Club, where there was discussion about drama on Kiwi Farms surrounding both Hurtful and Marvin supposedly knowing about what the Idea Guys were doing with Chris, but saying nothing about it, something which got Hurtful demoted from the CWCki club.[9] This was a clear attempt to reopen any old wounds that Hurtful's supposed inactivity might have caused within the community. Despite my shock, I also clarify in this DM in particular and again in a later DM my intentions, letting Spooky know my intent wasn't to betray Hurtful, but to be transparent about what was going on on the CWCki.
After Spooky told me more incriminating information, I then mention the fact that I told Hurtful that nobody was mad at him for socking, and was still hesitant on being in the Burn Book server, something which made me suspcious of him.[note 2] Spooky then brings up the fact that she hasn't told a majority of people in the Burn Book server about what she have claimed to have found. When I bring up the possibility that Hurtful might have been messing with Fiona, Spooky then replies by stating that Hurtful supposedly did nothing to intervene with Bella's attempts at framing her. She and I used that as a reason to believe that Hurtful was supposedly involved with Bella to some degree.
Spooky/Regina
so, maybe I should just let you in on some stuff at this point
since we've reached that part of it
Psycho
What is it?
Spooky/Regina
Basically, TAH and by extension probably Marvin have been doing damage control for Sean for a while behind the scenes.
Psycho
Hmmm
To think you know a guy
To be frank, I really wasn't trying to throw him under the bus.
I just felt it had to be said, because he admitted involvement to this.
Spooky/Regina
They are also in logs mixed up with these people, and at a minimum were aware of the "girlfriend" before the public was and knew quite a bit more about the incest leaks and Bella herself before the public did either
They saw these things being discussed in the thread and did nothing. They even probably knew that Fiona was innocent and it was a framejob by Bella, although that one I'm not sure if I can prove beyond doubt at his point.
TAH has been in touch with me ever since I posted those DM's and logs of Sean.
Psycho
I actually told him "no one was mad at him".
LOL
Spooky/Regina
First message he sent sounded like Sean tbh. As if he copied and pasted.
After that it didn't sound like Sean but it sounded like frantic damage control.
When I dropped Sean's dox, he started getting even more nervous and I've been letting him stew eve since
Psycho
Thanks for telling me this.
I literally had no idea the rabbit hole was deep with him too.
Spooky/Regina
Yeah it goes pretty deep
Marvin is in there too somewhere but I haven't quite figured out how deep
Never meet your heroes
Psycho
When I asked him about the Discord, he declined.
Even when I told him no one was mad at him.
Spooky/Regina
He is scared
He took shit for the idea guys
This is a cavalcade of autism ten times worse
Also this is not public knowledge
Not even to most people on this server
Psycho
He was even willing to fuck with Fiona too?
Spooky/Regina
I am trying to manage the politics of this safely
Spooky/Regina
[reply to "He was even willing to fuck with Fiona too?"]
Well, he was present when Bella talked about bus chucking Fiona
And in all those conversations basically
Even if he wasn't he was on the servers and when all the shit went down he obviously would've looked
And he did nothing
Either to watch the show or in hopes nobody would find him out
Psycho
Yet he claims he had no involvement with Bella
Spooky/Regina
Yeah bullshit he was there for that little intervention they had with her
Psycho
Geez, I'm glad I shared this shit.
Spooky/Regina
And he is afraid of me lol
I'm trying to get some leaks out of him about Sean but after all that's coming out I'm reticent to agree to protect him
Psycho
Protect Sean?
Why does he want to protect Sean?
Spooky/Regina
I don't know
Well, I mean, he's reticent to dump the server, that I kinda understand
But this all started with him reaching out to me to protect Sean
And, I suspect, he even copy pasted something from Sean to me because it sounded so like him
Psycho
Now it makes sense why all of his edits were Sean related.
Spooky/Regina
At that point we actually feared Sean might control the TAH account
But now no, only working with him
Psycho
I'm actually pretty disappointed at this revelation.
Spooky/Regina
Me too tbh
Psycho
He was the entire reason I joined the Farms in the first place.
But now he's actively defending degenerate scum like Sean and the Idea Guys.
Spooky/Regina
I don't know just how rotten it gets but at an absolute minimum he has some bad associations and was trying to protect them
And it looks worse than that
Yeah, goes back to the IG too
Psycho
I can't help but think that's also the whole reason he disabled starting conversations.[note 3]
Spooky/Regina
probably
he saw it coming likely after the ig fiasco
More Allegations
“
(don't let him know i let you know i know though)
”
Spooky, telling me not to interact with Hurtful about our conversations.
13 September 2021
Spooky informs me that Hurtful has another "friend" in the CWCki. I ask them if it was Anaxis, as that was a name Burn Book had discovered he left out in the list of people who played Lainchu. I also bring up how I doubted Hurtful's claim of doing this out of courtesy due to how I was able to censor Fiona without socking. After Spooky tells me who the "friend" is, I tell them they were Klop and how this was already being discussed in the Burn Book Discord, something which led to both Klop and Anaxis being questioned by Spooky.
After calling his act of selectively censoring people who I thought were trolling "scummy", I once again express my anger and frustration that Hurtful could have told someone all of the stuff he encountered on the servers that he was in on the ILJ subforum, but told nobody about it, to Spooky.
Spooky/Regina
so he has another friend in the cwcki apparently
Psycho
Who?
Anaxis?
Is that what was going on there?
Because I don't quite buy his whole explanation of "courtesy".
I was able to do the Suitress rule just fine with my own account.
Who is the friend?
Spooky/Regina
goes by catlopez at least on discord but hold on
Psycho
That's Klop
Apparently
Spooky/Regina
thoughts o
Psycho
It's being talked about in my interview channel [note 4]
Spooky/Regina
oh yeah i'm a bit behind everywhere
but yeah that's him
Psycho
If I can bring the message again, he said the reason he included Klop in that list was because he was already on there to begin with.
Pretty scummy thing to do.
Spooky/Regina
also tah has seen the logs of bella boasting about knowing a cwcki admin right
because it would be good of him to address them
Psycho
What pisses me off is that he knew about all of this, and didn't bother to tell anyone.
Spooky/Regina
yeah, i mean, idk what he was thinking
Psycho
Nor did he bother to post in the ILJ subforum
Spooky/Regina
that this would just pass with time and he wouldnt be noticed
Psycho
I only just posted that stuff because he was acting tense when I asked him questions about a "Gatekeeper" article in the Improvement page.
That's when he revealed he was Carboncoffee
Spooky/Regina
yeah that about takes the cake tbh
and actually, we discovered carboncoffee after TAH made me suspicious by reachng out
so he, like everyone else in this story, literally everyone
fucked himself over
Psycho
More specifically, I suggested putting something like that in the White Knight article, as the defintion has grown thanks to Sean.
I think it was the mention of Sean that got him scared.
Spooky/Regina
yeah
there are some deep connections there
somewhere
and since sean is better doxed now that should also prove motivating
Psycho
Plus, he brought up how I put "Coffee" in the Bella article.
Since we had a feeling they were the same perosn.
Spooky/Regina
right...him in the bella article, God forbid, right?
he knows all of this is a bad look for him
Psycho
I honestly feel like he was trying to use me.
Like, I was supposed to be his pawn in that scenario by just saying that I talked to him and everything would just die out.
Even though figuring this shit out was kind of inevitable.
Spooky/Regina
yeah, i mean i dunno what he's thinking trying to run damage control the way he is
sean and bella are retards, they have an excuse
he should know better
i've been giving him hell though
(don't let him know i let you know i know though)
Psycho
At one point, all this stuff with him needs to surface though.
First the Idea Guys, then Bella and Sean.
Spooky/Regina
oh absolutely
there will be an "end of cwckigelion" post tbh
i just wonder if null is gonna lose his shit or not care
50/50?
Psycho
Well, he did propose that ILJ lawyer thing.
I don't think he's going to be very happy to hear someone's been supporting either Bella or Sean.
Spooky/Regina
more even I think that they knw about the fuckery going back
he's already not very happy with sean to begin with so to know that this fucking literally slow-in-da-mind 21 year old has his hooks in these oldfag trolls?
Psycho
Yeah, he'd probably be pissed.
Null's not a very patient man either.
Lainchu
14 September 2021
I ask Spooky if we should talk to Klop about Lainchu, hoping that he can clear up the confusion that surrounded the character. Spooky then tells me that Klop told them a limited amount of details surrounding the character.
Because of the selective discluding of information of Anaxis, I theorize that Hurtful was trying to pin blame for the Incest Fallout on Klop, and tell Spooky to tell Klop about this. She then suggests I do this instead, noting my position as a jerkop. After this conversation, I had a DM with Klop. In that DM, we talked about his role with the Lainchu character, as well as Fiona. For a summary of our DMs, go here.
Psycho
Should we ask Klop about Lainchu at some point?
He doesn't seem to have any real weenish intent here.
Spooky/Regina
Sure
He mentioned a little bit to me but not too many details
Psycho
I can't help but think that TAH might be throwing him under the bus, tbh.
Since he had no problem listing him on the Lainchu candidates, but not Anaxis.
That's just my theory, though.
I'd also suggest you notify that some of TAH's edits put him on that list.
Spooky/Regina
Sure. You can too, might be better coming from you, you know the cwcki better
Psycho
I'll DM him first
Spooky/Regina
Cool
CarbonCoffee99 and the Idea Guys
14 September 2021
I inform Spooky that nobody had removed the information about CarbonCoffee99 from Bella's page, not even Hurtful under a sock account, from Bella's page. Spooky attributes this to cowardice, but I come to think that this might be a sign of Hurtful hiding something in consideration of the fact that he only now tells me about the sockpuppet after I told him about The WCT. I interpretted this as meaning that Hurtful thought that I was the only person on the CWCki that didn't suspect he was doing anything shady and that he wanted me to cover up for Bella and Sean, who at the time I and many others thought were trying to do illegal things with Chris.
We also once again talk about Hurtful supposedly covering up for the Idea Guys. While I do recall an instance where Hurtful liked a post stating that doxing the Idea Guys went too far, Spooky spun this as him being "sympathetic" towards them to me, which again I bought into. From this, I also state a belief that doxing WCT was necessary because of him supposedly doing illegal things in the same vein that the Idea Guys did, but on a larger scale.
At the end of this conversation, I also inform Spooky that I have never heard of the Knights of CWC server, where much of WCT's activity took place.
Psycho
Also, it's been a day, and nobody took down the Coffee stuff from the Bella page.
Not even Hurtful under another account.
Spooky/Regina
They don't have the balls
They know I would rain down fire, absolutely nuke them
And they don't know what I have either
They're afraid tbh and it shows
Psycho
I feel this shows something deeper might be going on
Spooky/Regina
Don't want more bad publicity like after the IG
Spooky/Regina
[reply to "I feel this shows something deeper might be going on"]
Yeah...they might even be disproportionately scared, if all they fear is the info I've shown you...implies there is something worse they think I might have
Psycho
They were ready to reveal that they were Carboncoffee when I mentioned Sean.
Spooky/Regina
What do you think it means?
Psycho
I'm guessing because I was the only jerkop that didn't really suspect anything, they thought that meant they should tell me shit.
I still think it was pretty scummy of them.
Spooky/Regina
Super scummy.
Psycho
I was supposed to conceal his dirty secrets.
Spooky/Regina
They are most worried about their image for sure, not the real purpose of their wiki
Psycho
What was the skinny with the IG stuff other than concealing information and attempting to Wallflower them?
I remember him liking a post saying how "immoral" it was to dox them.
Spooky/Regina
Yeah it's somewhere in there
They were claiming that doxing them was going too far
Sympathy for fellow trolls I suppose
Psycho
Even though what they were doing was illegal as all hell
Spooky/Regina
Yeah
And a next level of cruelty nobody ever really thought of before
Like it was really shocking to read about
Psycho
Until Sean and Bella popped up
Spooky/Regina
Yep
Psycho
I feel there's a time and a place to dox people, tbh
Spooky/Regina
And this is it lol
Psycho
I bet his defense would have been "But they didn't make him shit on the floor yet".
Even though it was illegal enough they were fucking with someone who was already out of reality.
And what about Knights of CWC
I've never seen that server
Spooky/Regina
yeah that is Sean's Watchmen splinter group
Response from Klop
15 September 2021
After talking to Klop about both Lainchu and Fiona, I tell Spooky what he told me. I also inform them that I planned to take a break from editing on the CWCki due to how much new information was piling up and how shocking a lot of it was. As stated in later posts, Klop also agreed with the idea that Hurtful was actually covering up for the Idea Guys and The WCT.
Spooky never replied to these posts.
Psycho
I talked to klop
He told me that he was kind of dragged into the Lainchu thing, but was none the wiser to what that was all about.
Somebody played the role as him.
And only used the Lainchu name to ask questions to CWC
Other than that, Klop's involvement was pretty minor.
He's also told me a few new things about Fiona
Most importantly that she was basically like a reverse Sean
In that rather than wanting to be "one of the final protagonists", she actually wanted to be a "lolcow".
She even asked Naught to have a thread on KF or something, but was denied that and told how "unfunny" she was.
She's a pretty big danger to herself from what he told me.
As far as I can tell, he doesn't seem to know much about Sean.
Just to let you know, I'm probably going to take a break from this for now. So much information's been piling up, and a lot of it's been pretty disgusting.
Just be sure to gather more stuff, and post it all in my interview channel.
Chris Chan court Bingo
15 September 2021
Spooky sends me a link that she'd sent to all of the members of the Burn Book server, which is a Chris Chan themed Bingo game. I then tell them that I'll consider playing and also reiterate that I will take a break from editing for a bit. Spooky also notes that I've been an active editor on the CWCki.
Spooky/Regina
(sending unique one to everyone) just for fun, for tomorrow, Chris Chan court bingo - https://mfbc.us/m/njhp78b/4
Psycho
I'll probably be there.
Just no CWCki edits for a bit.
Spooky/Regina
i feel you on that
and i noticed you've been going at it pretty hard
not always bad to take a break
Psycho
TBH, I realized how shit it is to be an active member in these things sometimes.
Spooky/Regina
yeah it kind of sucks to be an active member in anything sometimes
Psycho
I don't want to become a "final protagonist".
Para, LavendarBonez, the CWCki, and Fiona
17 September 2021
When I notice a channel about a person named "Para" on the Burn Book server, I ask Spooky who this is. She specifies that this is a random user from the CWCki server that she tried to interview, alleging that two people went under the name "Para". She also states that this is not the same "Para" as from the Knights server.
Psycho
Excuse me, but who the hell is Para?
Spooky/Regina
watchman who followed sean into schism
the para i'm talking to is claiming to be another person
i won't say it's impossible
Psycho
There are two paras apparently.
Spooky/Regina
yep
I just found that out lol
was talking to the other Para
Psycho
So this Para wasn't the Watchman?
Spooky/Regina
nope
just some girl from the cwcki server
Psycho
Be on the lookout though.
For the other para of course.
Spooky/Regina
I think I know where to find him/her
Psycho
Cool.
Post when you find them.
Spooky/Regina
will do
[pause]
“
that's a good point really, in some ways, she's like a minor tbh, like Lavendar is probably closer to a functioning adult at 17 than Fiona is at 19, it's only 2 year difference anyway but Fiona is legit autistic
”
Spooky regarding Fiona's autism
A little later after this, I ask Spooky for assitance on documenting LavanderBonez on the CWCki. She tells me not to post their dox there due to them being a minor. This conversation also leads to a conversation about Fiona, one that I think is very telling of the general attitudes that people, including myself, have had towards her during that time.
This conversations starts when I tell Spooky not to use Fiona's identity when writing about her in accordance to the Suitress policy. Though Spooky acknowledges that she disagrees with the policy, she was willing to abide by it. I myself acknowledge that I figured that not everyone was going to agree with the policy, and that I can see why people would say that she doesn't need protection. I however came to believe that Fiona needed protection due to the Reddit AMA and her interactions with Chris showing that she'll continue doing similar things in such a hectic time, and because of how her parents were likely dealing with her issues.
I mention to Spooky I had fairly nuanced views of Fiona, stating that I thought what she did was dumb and dangerous, but also was somewhat sympathetic towards her scenario, being blamed for the heinous crimes that people were now accussing Bella of. Spooky appears to agree to this sentiment, though she also uses this as a reason to be mad at Hurtful and Marvin for supposedly being unwilling to stop this when it happened. Spooky also states that she views Fiona a minor "in some ways", citing the fact that she was transitioning into adulthood while being autistic. I then tell Spooky what Klop told me, condensing it to my "reverse Sean" analogy. Spooky seems to agree with this, calling Fiona a "vulnerable adult", likely more so than Chris.
Spooky also mentions wanting to use the CWCki as a platform for creating a timeline for all of the events that surrounded Bella and her associates, and asks me if I can help create accounts for their friends. I tell them that I will consider this.
Psycho
I'm going to as for a suggestion about Lavender?
How should I document her. She's underaged, but still a major associate of Bella all the same.
I'm considering putting her up.
Spooky/Regina
I'd put her up definitely
what precedent is there, BlueSpike of course comes to mind
Psycho
Good point.
Spooky/Regina
underage,referred to by pseudonym
Psycho
I guess I'll just refer to her by "Lavender".
Spooky/Regina
and she's 17 tbh so a minor yes but not a complete child
"Lavender" is good because it's not exactly her name
and if people know her name exactly then if they're gonna dox her they're gonna dox her, not much you can do
she'll show up in logs as her real name if people genuinely look
Psycho
I don't think it's advisble to dox her, since she's 17.
Spooky/Regina
no not at all
Psycho
But if they do, fuck it.
Spooky/Regina
we were doxing her but I found her age so stopped doxing
stopped before we got anything of substance really
Psycho
We don't need her personal life anyway.
Spooky/Regina
but it was probably doable, but really, not our problem if someone does it tbh
yeah exactly
her role is interesting because it has to do with how leaks got out and stuff like that
her personal issues are whatever they are, probably not worthy to go into at the cwcki in my view
Psycho
So what's her deal again, she was a component in the leaks?
Along with Fiona?
Spooky/Regina
i might not be the best one to give you the rundown on that tbh
it gets a little complicated, other characters show up
she was the one who was in communication with gibi though
Psycho
Supposedly, there are no obvious links between her and Bella.
Spooky/Regina
nope
Psycho
She still deserves a mention under the "GiBi" section in my opinion.
Spooky/Regina
absolutely
it's part of how the leaks happened, that's an important story
and actually something i am working on, a detailed timeline
with reference to the leaks, etc.
Psycho
Please post it in the article when you're done.[note 5]
Spooky/Regina
it'll be huge and it'll name fiona although i guess the latter can be redacted
it'd easily be an article itself if not several
Psycho
Just don't use her name
Spooky/Regina
that's doable
Psycho
You can talk about her on the page, you just can't reveal her identity.
Spooky/Regina
i've been thinking actually about whether the cwcki might be a better platform for this than putting it all on kiwi
because it's gonna be large and possibly evolving so a wiki is probably the best thing actually
but the only thing is that i kinda wanna maintain control over it myself and friends[note 6]
Psycho
Yeah.
Spooky/Regina
also i'd need to get a few accounts running for other people and I'm probably not on htl's christmas card list anymore
Psycho
What do you mean?
Spooky/Regina
that other people would want to work on the timeline, they'd need accounts on the cwcki
Psycho
I can probably help
Spooky/Regina
yeah that'd be good
i know taylor would probably want one[note 7]
Psycho
In regards to Fiona, since you're concern of that, I would suggest not using her name, and try to avoid linking any of her accounts.
Spooky/Regina
shouldn't really be a problem. I'm not really a fan of wallflowering in general but when in Rome, etc. 😉
Psycho
I knew it'd get mixed reception, TBH.
And I can totally see where people are coming from when they say they're not a fan.
Spooky/Regina
but i mean on the other hand i've been reading these people's personal shit near on a daily basis for over a month
i feel like i know them
of course i don't, and random people reading their shit off the cwcki for years to come is another thing
Psycho
I think in the case of Fiona, it's that she's gone through a lot of shit.
Spooky/Regina
definitely
i'm sympathetic to fiona for sure
Psycho
And the stupid crap she's done could potentially make her a cow on the same level as Chris.
Chris got into his mess from doing shit as stupid as Fiona.
Spooky/Regina
i don't think she would produce enough content to be a cow
Psycho
Even though she was clearly obsessed with Chris, especially at creepy levels, she really didn't deserve to be framed like that.
Spooky/Regina
not at all
what happened to her was awful
like, truly fucked up
it's eclipsed by what chris did, but it is a seriously fucked up thing (for Bella) to do
and Sean helped her do it
and HLT and Marvin knew it was going on and didn't prevent it
Psycho
I also felt like doing it because her parents are taking care of everything.
[break]
Spooky/Regina
[reply to "I also felt like doing it because her parents are taking care of everything."]
that's a good point really, in some ways, she's like a minor tbh, like Lavendar is probably closer to a functioning adult at 17 than Fiona is at 19, it's only
2 year difference anyway but Fiona is legit autistic
Psycho
Plus, this is from klop so take it with a grain of salt, but she also appears to be a sort of reverse Sean.
Spooky/Regina
reverse Sean?
Psycho
She favored being a "lolcow" over being a "final protagonist".
Spooky/Regina
true yeah
she's far from the only person who covets lolcow status,which is something i never really got
Psycho
Another reason I decided to keep the policy up.
Spooky/Regina
i mean yeah,"any attention is good" but it's more than that
Psycho
She's clearly a danger to herself.
Spooky/Regina
yeah she's a "vulnerable adult"
probably even more than chris
Psycho
That's why I was worried about her being "the next Chris".
She's vulnaerable as fuck.
Spooky/Regina
she needs to not have internet access
you're right about one thing as regards 'the next chris'
people will seek out interacting with her
and many won't have good intentions
Psycho
I guess Fiona made me rethink how I look at lolcows, TBH.
Spooky/Regina
all of this has sort of made me reflect on this shit tbh
the level of rabbit hole is insane
Psycho
The fact that all of this was known about her, and yet nobody did anything to clear her name still pisses me off to this day.
Spooky/Regina
definitely
Extended Privledges
17 September 2021
After talking to Spooky about Fiona, she notifies me that my privledges have been extended on the Burn Book server and that I was no longer a "guest" and was given a role that would allow me to see hidden channels on the server, akin to how the Watchmen had a "first" and "second" layer on their own servers. She tells me that she believes the CWCki has been "suspicious" and that I'd be concerned with "promoting the truth" on this site. She also claims that she believes that Klop was "coming around" to the truth.
Spooky brings up Hurtful Truth Level again, and I again express my shock that Hurtful was supposedly covering for the Idea Guys, and now Bella and WCT. Again likely stemming from the fact that Hurtful neglected to tell me about the CarbonCoffee account until after I told him about WCT and told no one else about it, I came to believe that he was going to "fuck me over"; likely considering that I thought he was doing that exact thing to Klop; and I express feeling betrayed.
Spooky/Regina
btw I just expanded your permissions to see a bunch more shit on this server
Psycho
I can see that.
Spooky/Regina
trust you a bit more and it'll be useful to you possibly in writing various articles
there's stuff about sockness, other stuff kind of only tangential to bellagate
it'll be a lot to sift thru but might be useful to the cwcki
i'd just ask that you ask if you're gonna use anything spicy
Psycho
I've been wondering about that.
Was the fact I edit the CWCki suspicious at all?
Spooky/Regina
well, the cwcki in general has been a little suspicious
but i trust you now to be interested in promoting the truth there
not the agendas and bullshit
klop too I think is coming around
Psycho
I have faith in him, personally.
Especially because of how open he was about Lainchu.
Spooky/Regina
i'd like to ask him about the dr.retard situation as well
but yeah
i agree
between your conversation with htl and mine, his eyes really opened up to the bullshit i think
Psycho
The worst part was that I didn't even suspect HTL was doing anything shady.
Spooky/Regina
why would you though?
I was shocked myself
Psycho
I wasn't really around when he was outed for the IG stuff.
Or I missed it entirely.
I have no clue myself.
I told you guys because I simply thought it was a huge misunderstanding.
Spooky/Regina
I remember that shit, but I would've figured that (a) he learned his less or (b) given that this shit is worse than the IG situation by a lot and specifically involves largely innocent third parties getting fucked over, that he would act differently
Psycho
I really feel like he would have fucked me over if he wanted to.
The fact he told me to keep all of this "secret" makes me believe that the more I think of it.
I just find it hard to trust him now.
Ignoring the censorship of Anaxis, despite being a "Watchmen lurker", he didn't say anything about Lainchu until later.
And he did that under another account.
Spooky/Regina
yeah that's just shady as hell
especially since the edits honestly don't look that shady
but the fact he socked to do it means there is something shady as fuck there
Psycho
I feel the irony in this is that he really didn't need to tell me he was Coffee
Spooky/Regina
he really didn't lol
but he kind of did himself in
which is like the running theme
everybody fucked themselves over lol
Hurtful's Admitance
18 September 2021
I notify Spooky about Hurtful admitting that he was CarbonCoffee99 to editor 4CentUser. Though I was still upset at Hurtful, I also tell Spooky this makes me believe that Hurtful likely wasn't "Coffee" from the Bella messages, entailing that he might not have been as involved with Bella as we initially thought. However, due to the supposed covering up of the Idea Guys, The WCT and Anaxis I still suggested to them we keep an eye on Hurtful.
Spooky never replied to these posts.
Psycho
He finally gets out with it.
But he still doesn't remove the Coffee section.
I also can't help but stress that he didn't just censor names either.
He also censored the confirmation that "someone" had done it.
Though, the fact he was more open about this gives me a bit more confidence that he wasn't Coffee from the Bella messages.
That's honestly more than I can say about other people in this drama.
Nevertheless, I say we still keep an eye on him.
Hurtful's Statement and Kiwi Farms Thread
18 September 2021
I tell Spooky about Hurtful's statement about his abscence from the CWCki and Kiwi Farms, and his prescence in Watchmen servers. Spooky tells me that what Hurtful had said in his statement "sort of" resembles what he said to her in DMs. However, because Hurtful stopped replying to Spooky, she felt now was necessary to create a Kiwi Farms thread about what Burn Book has supposedly uncovered about Hurtful up to this point. That thread being this one.
I approve of Spooky's decision to do this in the hopes of revealing what I thought Hurtful was actually doing behind the scenes, as I felt doing otherwise would hurt the credibility of the CWCki. I once again tell Spooky that I'm a little convinced that Hurtful might not be "coffee" from the Bella chats, though also state it's still possible, to which Spooky replies that others should decide that for themselves.
After this, I tell Spooky that 4CentUser had removed the section on CarbonCoffee99 directly after Hurtful made his announcement, which Spooky said she'd revert. I then suggest to Spooky that all of the stuff surrounding "Coffee" should strictly be just the messages with Bella and be in the Watchmen section.
As Spooky and the rest of Burn Book gets to working on the thread, Spooky asks me if I want to be mentioned on the thread (this includes mentioning that I was the one that was talking to Spooky and that Hurtful had reached out to me). I reply to this by stating that Hurtful was likely going to tell people he reached out to me regardless, but Spooky tells me that he has control over the narrative on the CWCki. I reply to this by stating that Hurtful should be mentioned for the integrity of the wiki, and tell them that we (both Burn Book and the CWCki crew) must make a collective effort to "unshit" what I believed Hurtful was doing. I therefore also agreed to be mentioned in the thread for transparency.
Psycho
https://sonichu.com/cwcki/User:Hurtful_Truth_Level/Statement
I feel that this should be looked into
Spooky/Regina
well
that sort of resembles what he sent me
however, he stopped replying to my PMs when I confronted him
so I think it's all fair game now
may as well drop a thread in response 🔪
Psycho
Please do.
I just find it a little less likely that he was actually Coffee from the Bella chats. Although it's still a pretty big possibility.
Spooky/Regina
well, people can decide that for themselves really tbh
Psycho
Someone removed the Coffee section after HTL made this announcement.
Spooky/Regina
link?
Psycho
https://sonichu.com/w/index.php?title=Isabella_Loretta_Janke&curid=33035&diff=267436&oldid=267426
Spooky/Regina
oh 4centuser?
he seems ok mostly, no?
Psycho
Yeah
Spooky/Regina
i'm reverting though
Psycho
He's cool
I think the Coffee section should only talk about the Bella messages though
All the stuff on Carbonoffee should be on the Watchmen page.
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "All the stuff on Carbonoffee should be on the Watchmen page."]
that's fair
Psycho
Because HTL admitted to "lurking" on their discord.
Spooky/Regina
is it alright if I mention you? totally fair if you don't.
Psycho
In what way?
Spooky/Regina
well, that'd be something to talk about...some mention of the fact that we'd been talking about this situation and that HTL had reached out to you, etc.
Psycho
He's probably going to say that he reached out to me regardless.
Spooky/Regina
well, he certainly won't deny it
but he's already struck first and is trying to control the narrative
Psycho
His name should definitely be on there.
I feel like not mentioning him would hurt the reliability of the CWCki, tbh.
Spooky/Regina
the CWCki is gonna take a big hit here regardless, even though the worst manipulation that can currently be shown is the coffee business
Psycho
Yeah, we have to make a collective effort to unshit it.
Spooky/Regina
absolutely
Spooky Confuses Klop for HTL
18 September 2021
After telling Spooky that I intended to "unshit" the wiki, I try to clarify to them that not everyone might be aware of the story behind Bella or her associates, so I tell them that Klop wasn't aware of much of what Burn Book had found about them. Spooky seems to think I'm talking about Hurtful, and expresses disbelief that Hurtful somehow didn't know all of these details.
Still thinking that Spooky knew I was talking about Klop, I chalked up Klop's lack of knowledge to inactivity on the Kiwi Farms, as he likely hasn't been following the story. Spooky then expresses disappointment that I might not have a proper receipt from Hurtful, to which I correct Spooky in clarifying that I've been talking about Klop this whole time.
Following that, I tell Spooky that I think we need to fill in the gaps for both Hurtful and Klop to let them know what was going on.
Psycho
I even told Klop a few things about Bella he apparently hadn't known about before.
Like her harassment towards other TTU students.
Her glowie father.
Spooky/Regina
what the fuck lol how didn't he know that
Psycho
No idea, tbh.
Probably due to inactivity, tbh
I haven't seen him on KF much.
Let alone on the ILJ subforum.
Spooky/Regina
ugh this isn't going precisely the way I hoped
I wanted more receipts before doing this
Psycho
Between the both of us
He's aware of the sexual harassment to a certain extent.
He even knew the university swept those cases under the rug.
Do you think we should talk to him together?
Spooky/Regina
to HTL?
Psycho
Klop
Spooky/Regina
definitely
Psycho
I was talking about Klop this whole time
Spooky/Regina
i want to know what he has to say about the girl who was kicked off discord too[note 8]
among other things
Psycho
Yeah.
HTL
too
Sorry for the mix up
I feel we need to fill Klop in on a few things.
We need to talk to HTL too.
Spooky/Regina
we do
both
26 minutes between TAH's statment and 4cent's edit btw
DM Leaks
“
All because I asked for features on the CWCki.
”
Me, after leaking DMs to Spooky
18 September 2021
Finally, we come to this. This is the point where I leaked the DMs I had with Hurtful to Spooky.
I start this off by asking Spooky if I could assist in the creation of the Kiwi Farms thread.
Psycho
🤔
Since I got that message from TAH, can I help with the thread?
Spooky/Regina
absolutely
I'm writing a draft now
About an hour after that, Spooky asks me a few questions regarding how things in the thread should be phrased.
Spooky/Regina
would it be ok if I say that he reached out to you, and when it was?
(just because it was before the "statement")
Psycho
Probably advisable in my eyes.
Spooky/Regina
when was his PM to you ?
Psycho
I'll check
He outed himself as Carboncoffee on Monday.
Spooky/Regina
great,thanks
also what timezone is the cwcki edits listed in? is it GMT?
Psycho
I believe the CWCki was created by a Brit, so probably.
Spooky/Regina
wait,it'll be easy to find out
lemme check
GMT+1
Psycho
I feel me being messaged should be brought up, just because I feel people would be curious how we found out about this in the first place.
Spooky/Regina
yeah,definitely
that makes a lot of sense
Psycho
Plus, I doubt he would have wrote on the CWCki had he not messaged me.
I think he knew I was being a wee bit suspicious of him.
I also feel this should be included in the thread:
I basically stopped talking to him afterwards.
Spooky/Regina
Yeah understandable
Sickening
Psycho
Did he really hide IG info?[note 9]
Just to confirm.
Spooky/Regina
Well, he knew of their activities. Bad stuff included. He didn't share info because "content"
Psycho
So technically he hid it.
Spooky/Regina
Yep
I've gotta find some receipts back then but yeah
Psycho
You need to include them in the thread too.
This is the second time he tried to pull this off. IG being the first, of course.
And this time, it's completely inexcusable.
Not that hiding IG information is excusable to begin with, but this is Bella we're talking about.
Spooky/Regina
How much he knew about Bella being a threat pre merge is debatable tbh
But he knew all about Sean and Randy Stair
Psycho
And he didn't learn shit from IG.
Because Sean's stunt was pretty much comparable.
Spooky/Regina
yep
Psycho
I can see you created you talk page on the CWCki too.
Also, I banned the Carboncoffee account about a month after its been inactive.
Basically around the time we became aware of its existence.
It stopped making edits on the 25th of August.
And I banned it on the 8th of September.
I merely changed the ban reason on the 11th afterwards.
Spooky/Regina
oh ok
Psycho
The first ban was because we thought it was Sean doing damage control.
I changed it to just "damage control regarding Anaxis and other Watchmen".
And now, the moment you've all been waiting for.
Spooky/Regina
could you give me your response to the first message tah sent you?
if i'm posting his first and then his response to that it looks funny if i do'nt
slightly less so if I'm redacting your name
Psycho
This all happened in the same DM where he told me about the ability to hide edits.
In light of the Suitress policy
Spooky/Regina
oh if you wanna give me that too it'd be glorious
Psycho
I can give you the entire conversation.
Spooky/Regina
please
Psycho
Just because I want to be true and honest about this.
Then afterwards he asked me about creating accounts for other people.
Afterwards, I asked about the "Gatekeepers" article he wanted to make.
Then comes the part where he outs himself as Carboncoffee
And then even after I tell him that I'm not entirely certain if Coffee was actually him, he still gets frantic about it.
That's where it ends.
All because I asked for features on the CWCki.
Spooky/Regina
great, thanks a bunch
i'm writing rn will get right back to this
Psycho
You should also bring up that there were no other means of contacting him through a DM.
Only he could start one.
I have to admit though, if he really was that willing to just give me that ability, I'd hate to see what kind of things he'd allow other jerkops to do with it.
Not to mention how he was a jerkop himself.
The more I think of it, maybe asking for that ability wasn't so wise.
Spooky/Regina
the thing is, now that it's gonna be public knowledge
it's a very bad look
i think i used the comparison before but it's like if people know you know how to cheat at cards they won't wanna play with you
Psycho
So they're not going to trust he'll use the feature responsibly.
That's reassuring.
It's just as easy for another jerkop to revert that too.
Potential for Questioning
“
N.B. This is why I have archived all links to the CWCki; please be mindful that CWCki admins and possibly certain other users have the ability to make invisible edits to the Wiki and remove any trace of them having been made. This ability has been discussed at some length among their staff in reference to removal of the identity of Fiona a/k/a "the Everfree Suitress." Given that HTL/TAH has already admitted to acting in bad faith by the use of a sockpuppet account, no possibility should be excluded at this point. I would highly recommend archiving any and all controversial pages from the CWCki.
”
Directly from Spooky's thread.
18 September 2021
About 10 minutes after I leaked Hurtful's DMs to Spooky, concerned that people on Kiwi Farms could question our findings if we aren't fully honest about them, I tell Spooky about why I was trying to ask Hurtful for the feature to delete edits, addressing that I've used Fiona's name several times before I implemented the Suitress policy, and wanted to hide those like how CWCki staff did with the Wallflower. I also suggest to Spooky that she should share her conversation with Hurtful in its entirety, like I did, for transparency. As you will see later, she never did this, and only shared select portions of her DM with him on the thread. Spooky doesn't seem to reply to any of my posts explaining my situation, instead telling me about the process behind the thread's creation, only replying when I @ her.
I also hadn't noticed this before when the thread was actually posted, likely due to the hype, but Spooky left out the details around my side of the conversation with Hurtful entirely, instead twisting it to make it look like I caught Hurtful red-handed with trying to hide edits. She also made absolutely no mention of the fact that I was the one who made the Suitress policy, despite me telling her this in prior conversations.
Psycho
The edits I wanted to hide were ones where I used Fiona's name.
That was before the Suitress policy was put up.
I also thought that I could remove deletes, but apparently you can't.
I deleted a redirect to what used to be the "Orbiter Wave" article which used her name.
Spooky/Regina
could I ask you (or ask again) what timezone you are in
I'm trying to keep sequences of things clear when possible from the various screenshots
Psycho
Eastern Daylight
Spooky/Regina
great thanks
Psycho
This was around the time I created the policy
I wanted to keep her identity concealed.
Excuse the typo. It was meant to say "not to be disclosed".
So how's the thread looking so far?
Spooky/Regina
extensive lol
Psycho
There's more?
Spooky/Regina
i'm on the wiki stuff or just finished
starting in on the bella stuff, and then the sean stuff
Psycho
I'm just mentioning all of this stuff because I understand that we could potentially be questioned for some things too.
Including you and me, who both had conversations with TAH.
Therefore, I also think you should include your conversations with TAH as well.
He said some pretty shady stuff based on what you shared with me.
About an hour later, I ask when the thread will be done, hyped about the baffling, albeit dissapointing, discovery I thought that we uncovered.
Psycho
When do you estimate you'll be done with this thread?
I'm dying to see it.
Actually, can we talk for a bit?
I @ Spooky, telling them I feel guilt for involving myself with Hurtful's "plan" due to messaging him about the feature.
Psycho
@(not that) Regina
Spooky/Regina
hi
Psycho
I kind of feel a little guilty for some of this.
I asked for the feature.
All because I made a typo in a deletion.
Spooky/Regina
well, that's not your fault certainly, and how we got here is kinda irrelevant
i got involved in this shitsorm because i wanted to do a simple dox of some ween lol
Psycho
Lol
And I basically got involved because some of the shit in there pissed me off a little.
Plus it wasn't on the CWCki before.
Spooky/Regina
lol me too to some degree
Psycho
I think GiBi's dox video was what got me really involvd
Trustworthy People
18 September 2021
Following in-fighting on the Kiwi Farms about Hurtful and Marvin's alleged involvement in covering up for The WCT and Bella, Spooky sends me an invite to what I believe was a group chat (which is now dead), which contains select users from both the CWCki and its Discord server that Spooky deemed as "trustworthy". Some of these people included former editors Abaddon and 4CentUser. After Spooky finished the thread, she sent a link to it to these people in the hopes of having the rumor spread around more effectively.
Spooky informs me that she had gathered up these people, and was later talking to them about the supposed conspiracy that was going on on the CWCki. Abaddon then asked if these "trusted members" could gather in a group chat, which Spooky agrees on. I decline, stating that I was more a witness to the events that transpired. I then ask Spooky what she thinks of Marvin. I tell them that I don't think that Marvin was involved in the same way I thought Hurtful was, and Spooky seemingly agrees to this.
Afterwards, I elaborate that I only believed Hurtful to be doing shady things due to how I perceived him using the CarbonCoffee account as him trying to cover for bad actors, but otherwise didn't have any reason to believe Marvin or anyone else on the CWCki was conspiring with bad actors at this point. I also tell them that I hope that this doesn't become an "autistic witch hunt". Remember this conversation.
Spooky/Regina
https://discord.gg/x73a2F4y
Psycho
So what's this?
Spooky/Regina
trustworthy people
i was talking to abbadon and mentioned i talked to a few other folks i trusted so he asked if there was a chat and i said why not
Psycho
I'm honestly more of a witness, TBH. I basically came back to all of this stuff, not knowing it was behind the scenes.
Spooky/Regina
totally
understood, not saying you were involved in any deep way
but that you've just been trustworthy in this
Psycho
What do you think about Marvin?
He always seemed indifferent to Chris to me.
Spooky/Regina
yeah,idk
I don't think Marvin's involved in this in any deep way
Psycho
Me either.
Spooky/Regina
just poor choice in his associations
Psycho
He was on a few Discords.
Spooky/Regina
which is to be fair enough
Psycho
But that doesn't mean shit to me.
Spooky/Regina
but he's not involved in trying to do damage control and shit
Psycho
Yeah, I don't want to accuse Marvin of anything, tbh.
The focus is on TAH since it's kind of proven he's done shit behind our backs.
I hope nothing emerges about Marvin, as unlikely as it is.
This really doesn't need to become a big autistic witch hunt.
Suitress Policy and Bella Rule
19 September 2021
After having a talk with CWCki Jerkop Larry the Larryhog about the Suitress Policy and Bella Rule, I try to settle disputes between the Discord Server and Burn Book by inviting him to a group chat between the both of us and Spooky.
I notify Spooky about our plans about this, along with those of the Suitress Policy and the Bella Rule on the Discord server. I also told them that Larry chose to abandon the practice of banning people for talking about Bella, indicating that we intend to ease that rule a little.
Psycho
I talked to Larry the Larryhog, another CWCki Jerkop.
Spooky/Regina
yeah?
Psycho
About the Suitress Policy
Spooky/Regina
what's his thoughts?
Psycho
He wanted to discuss with me how to handle it.
Like if it should be kept up.
He initially suggested that we take it down, as that was part of the reason why the Farms was suspicious of the CWCki server.
He also stopped banning people over mentioning Bella.
Do you want to talk to him?
He says he's available.
I agreed with him to talk these things out with him to clear a few things out between the Farms and the CWCki.
Spooky/Regina
well, yeah, stop banning people from mentioning bella, that's the faggiest fucking thing
Psycho
He stopped doing that because he realized how faggy it was.
Spooky/Regina
the wallflowering is really an in-house matter I guess and not without precdent but I don't like it
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "He stopped doing that..."]
some jannie there deleted my posts for mentioning her yesterday
so either he changed recently or not everyone has gotten the memo
Psycho
It was likely only him
Spooky/Regina
anyway, yeah, you could add him to this message.
Ican't give full attention now but will definitely talk to him
Psycho
I don't know how to add people
I'll figure it out, just give me a second.
Spooky/Regina
the man-plus sign
Psycho
I added you to a group chat
Spooky/Regina
cool
Invite Link to Second Server
7 October 2021
By this point, Spooky was demoted from the ILJ subforum.
After the first Burn Book server was taken down, Spooky sends me an invite link to a second server, which also talks about plans to create a dedicated forum for the Burn Book server.
Spooky/Regina
Dear Burn Book Discord Member,
Our Discord began as a small place for friends to gossip and talk, it's not a meme. But more interesting stuff than that happened and we spent a month or more looking into the remainder of the Bellagate saga and in so doing came out with a lot of cool shit including the vast majority of the information we now have about Sean, GiBi, and a wide cast of peripheral characters.
Unfortunately, and I was told this about Discord well before I logged into one for the first time (to help with the Bella dox as it began to become more and more complex), the usefulness of the server waned as time went on and it became more and more of a liability. Accordingly, I am closing the server, effective immediately. This should not come as a significant surprise if you have been paying close attention. We've been planning on winding it down for some time.
My goal is to move things over to the BurnBook.CLUB forum. A word on this briefly, it very much isn't intended as a Kiwi splinter forum, the structure and goals are different. First and foremost, .club is meant to be for a smallish group of people who are friendly with one another and have similar interests to investigate targets or investigate with tactics that don't mesh with the forum we all met on. More on that later.
In any event, if you have not already, please register an account there.
Is a stopgap temporary Discord or, perhaps, eventually a Discord to act as a companion to the forum.
I've enjoyed working but more importantly getting to know and spending time with each of you and I hope we can continue to do both in a new context.
Love,
R.
Doxes on the CWCki
“
They are in no way in the same category as Fiona and I'm not sure why you'd say that
”
Spooky saying that GiBi, Winfield Winfield, e1ectricthunder, and Airsoft Al are not in the same "category" as Fiona
23 October 2021
This was the point where my trust in Spooky was beginning to wane, and her facade began to slip.
On 22 October 2021, Spooky managed to dox GiBi, and posted the dox on Kiwi Farms.[10] As you will see in later chats, this "achievement" seemed to have gotten to Spooky's head, and made them much more trigger happy and relentless, giving them more drive to go after the CWCki staff. Before getting banned from Kiwi Farms, Spooky would even go out of their way to dox GiBi's entire family,[10][11] including his fucking grandfather.[12] These family members that Spooky proceeded to dox aren't even remotely related to the drama that GiBi got himself in, but Spooky justified the doxes in the post through a swatting attempt from one of GiBi's fans on Christuber DawnDusk.[13]
I'm not exactly sure what flipped in me to go from being as dox-happy as the rest of the ILJ cult to seeing this happening to GiBi as a bad thing, but I would personally attribute this to the fact that Spooky lost her modding rights after being involved in infighting about Gutsy Sonichu, an associate of Jacob Sockness, posing as Bella.[14] She took Gutsy's ploy to be the true and honest Bella, again relying on her tactics of hindsight bias. I think this made me begin to be somewhat skeptical of Spooky's expertise given how she fell for an obvious troll akin to Chris doing the same shit. She was also completely insistent that she knew for a fact she was talking to the actual Bella,[15] making Spooky's arrogance more abundantly clear.
Around this time, I've also become an active member of the CWCki Discord server by then, coupled with the fact I was also starting to DM Hurtful again through Kiwi Farms DMs. As you may guess, my official debut on the server wasn't exactly the smoothest. Several of the modstaff were willing to excuse my actions, but others from the team were rightfully pissed at me, calling out my bullshit and poking holes in what I thought I knew. We did eventually find solid ground, but I'd still say it took a quite a while for everyone on the team to fully trust that I would't continue to fuck shit up or befriend shady people like Spooky. Of all people, I think I have them, and frankly the rest of the Discord community, to thank for me being able to evade Spooky's grasp. The thing about cults is that they tend to isolate people from outside that could provide information contrary to their beliefs. Having another group with a completely different perspective from what Spooky claimed to be the truth seemed to have made it easier for me to call Spooky's beliefs into question.
By this point, I think this was where I was starting to sense that maybe Spooky might have been going a little too far when it came to the people she targeted. This is seeing how there was a discussion about how the Suitress policy was raising questions regarding how other people on the site were being covered,[16] and how people like Spooky previously went after GiBi for "purposefully" doxing Fiona after he carelessly shared her phone number twice, something which supposedly put her in a "mental hospital", now turning around and doing that exact same thing to GiBi but ten-fold.[note 10] Even so, Spooky continued to use the supposed persecution of Fiona as justification for how horrible a person GiBi was, and therefore justification for the doxing towards him.[17][18] And even after she got banned from the Kiwi Farms, she wouldn't stop there. She continued her crusade against GiBi on multiple sockpuppets.[19][20]
A day after Spooky had doxed GiBi, she decided to put his full name on the now deleted "Post-Merge Saga" page. After I removed GiBi's middle and last name from that page (as far as I can remember), Spooky confronts me about my choice in a DM. After she question why I would "defend" GiBi, I tell them that I was doing this same practice with other minor Chris orbiters. I also explain that I feel that these people were getting too close to Chris during hectic times in the same way Fiona did with her AMA, and that I intended to make sure I didn't reveal too much sensitive information about the minor orbiters where it isn't needed.
Rather tellingly, Spooky asserts to me that Fiona isn't in the same "category" as people like Winfield Winfield or Airsoft Al, instead comparing the latter two to people like Owls and MKRNightVee. She also put Fiona in the same category as The Wallflower, as other people have, claiming that Fiona didn't "sign up" for being doxed. However, she also expressed ambivalence for the existence of the Suitress policy, beliving Fiona to be sympathetic, but also being against the practice of wallflowering as well.
This, and several other chats that followed this, was actually a huge reason for me upholding the Suitress Policy. It was clear that Spooky and other people were going to call users on the CWCki out for supposedly "defending" people that were deemed as less than favorable amongst the CWCsphere at the time over certain other individuals. Considering that Spooky was acussing me of "protecting" GiBi, something which I'm pretty sure made her extremely salty given what she'd accuse me of later, and Hurtful of "protecting" The WCT, whose respective infamies both grew out of "doxing" Fiona to some degree, you can only imagine how shit would have gone if we removed the Suitress Policy entirely by this point.
Spooky/Regina
Oh come on...just putting Devon's name on the cwcki is hardly doxing. Everyone else gets their name put on there. It's not like I'm putting his parents stuff up there.
Psycho
It's fine
I think it's just considering the events.
Spooky/Regina
Also not sure what you mean "especially since Chris is in jail"?
Psycho
Like Chris being in jail
What meant was Chris being more mainstream
Would inevitably lead to people going after people under the radar much more easily
I just want to play it safe on there
Spooky/Regina
GiBi is basically a ween with a platform lol he's in that category and deserves tk be named as much as Ellen or Dylon or whoever, that guy who stole the plate was doxed too iirc, if I can find it that should go up tok
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "Would inevitably lead to..."]
I don't get it. Why protect him of all people and let the other people's names go up? Again this is just people's names. Not even the state he lives in.
Psycho
[replying to "I don't get it. Why protect him..."]
It's not just him
I didn't put Airsoft Al's name up
I also decided not to put Ellen's name up
Winfield I'm iffy about
He more or less had his name present everywhere
These people are basically dangers to themselves like Fiona was
Spooky/Regina
They are in no way in the same category as Fiona and I'm not sure why you'd say that
Psycho
I don't think Fiona is bad
Spooky/Regina
They are more in the category of owls and mkr who's names are (appropriately imo) listed in the Watchmen article for all to see
Psycho
I guess I see your point
Did MKR display her name often?
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "Did MKR display her name often?"]
Not especially no, but m...k...r...
Owls got doxed by Naught iirc and definitely didn't use his name publicly
Psycho
We're just being more cautious about name-drops is all
It's not about whether or not they deserve it
Spooky/Regina
"Deserve" really isn't the point I'm trying to make, it's just about documentation, nsitm[note 11], right?
Psycho
Yes
Spooky/Regina
So we should document. All of these people signed up for this. Fiona and wallflower did not which is why they're hidden, right?
Psycho
Fiona contacted Chris despite being warned not to.
But yeah her scenario is special
I'm not saying she shouldn't be concealed
She was basically doxxed mercilessly by Bella by having her PI dropped everywhere
And GiBi shared her phone number
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "Fiona contacted Chris despite being"]
lol well that's an argument not to hide her ... but yeah, she didn't sign up for it in the sense that she only got doxed because of Bella Sean and Devon
Psycho
[replying to "lol well that's an argument not..."]
I'm just saying that the policy is up there for a different reason
It's not because she's innocent
She's gotten in serious shit
And people would go after her otherwise
Spooky/Regina
Well, fair enough, we've talked about fi before. Especially that she got hospitalized etc. She's sympathetic. There is good reason to hide her although I'm ambivalent about it
There are no such factors for Devon or Ellen (or Owls or mkr etc)
Psycho
We're basically practicing that.
We're being in more cautious about name drops because something similar could happen
Especially now that more people know who Chris is
And they could be connected to him having sex with Barb
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "We're being in more cautious..."]
Is there an actual defined policy here or how are these decisions being made that some namedrops are OK and some aren't?
Psycho
[replying to "Is there an actual defined..."]
We have a rough idea.
We're considering how much of their name Chris actually usedm
And the scenarios that surrounded their dox
People only knew of Fiona's full name because Bella shared it everywhere
And Chris never used it.
It wouldn't be fair to have her PI up as a result
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "And Chris never used it."]
Yeah I'm pretty sure he knew her only by alias
But the same could be said of others who are named. And Devon isn't just some guy, he's a major figure worth documenting. Ellen and Dylon showed up at 14bc. Not as major as Devon
but pretty significant
Psycho
We actually removed names from Doopie
And Copitz
Spooky/Regina
But as mentioned by whoever wrote the post merge article (you?) Chris related drama is a little different now as it won't be with direct access to Chris but drama surrounding him.
Psycho
Yeah
Good point
Spooky/Regina
Doopie I can see you wanting to remove. I don't like her but she also got involved inadvertently. I can't fathom why copitz should be protected other than inside baseball knitting circle bullshit
Psycho
I don't think Chris used Copitz full name either
It was just his first name
And it's not well known anyway
Spooky/Regina
But yeah things are different now. Maybe scratch Ellen but Ellen fuckin harassed an elderly rape victim. But I understand if your policy isn't about exposing every single person then just using her alias (please keep the pictures of these ugly ass people though lmao)
Psycho
I mean, if they revealed them to Chris or something, keep them
Spooky/Regina
Devon however...yeah. no reason for him not to be documented.
Psycho
Like if they're images they sent to him
Spooky/Regina
I also added the names of the Praetor people
Psycho
I mean, he does illegal shit[note 12]
So I'll rethink it
Thanks for your concerns though
It makes us all think about how we should document Christory
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "I mean, he does illegal shit"]
Swatting. Grooming. Doxing Fiona. Just generally being a douchebag who rides Chris to Internet fame and then very instructively for anyone who wants to interact with Chris he crashes and burns. It's appropriate. He's a major figure in post merge Christory like it or not.
Psycho
[replying to "Swatting. Grooming. Doxing Fiona..."]
Again, I'll rethink it
But I would only keep the details actually related to Chris, since this is a site primarily about him
His crimes are on Kiwi Farms for all to see anyway
Spooky/Regina
The bit players? Fuck 'em, maybe, but it still seems inconsistent. If you didn't name anyone I'd disagree but couldn't say inconsistent. The inconsistencies also open the cwcki up to allegations of bias. Given that HTL has done several things that advantage Sean and his friends over Naught, MKR, Owls et al. and those people are OK to name (especially Owls who quit all of this and went dark) ... well, it's not a good look. It appears biased.
Psycho
Again, that's actually been a point of discussion as of recent
I don't suggest keeping those names up in that case either
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "Again, that's actually been..."]
I'm glad it has because it's a glaring problem
Psycho
I think it was the events surrounding Fiona that led to this discussion
Because she was in pretty deep shit for being stupid.
Spooky/Regina
If you want to nake it policy that only names that came out of Chris's mouth are public as you alluded to I think that's stupid as hell but it's consistent and a concrete rule means it doesn't look biased
Psycho
This actually wasn't the first time it was done
Spooky/Regina
But right now the way things are being done doesn't make a lot of sense, speaking as an outside observer
Psycho
Clyde Cash got a similar treatment
The Clyde name is only used because Chris only used that name
Spooky/Regina
Well again if you're gonna do that you probably have to remove mkr and you definitely have to remove Owls. I don't think you should, mind, but if you're gonna be consistent you have to do it
Otherwise it looks for all the world like you are targeting a very specific faction of people and protecting others
Psycho
Yeah, I don't think MKR's non Chris stuff should be on there
Spooky/Regina
It's blindingly obvious that your admin has it out for that group for reasons that I do not know
Psycho
Marvin is only responsible for the technical stuff
Spooky/Regina
But they top are doxed on kf and if you want to keep doxes on kf then all doxes should stay on kf
Psycho
The other mods have left
Spooky/Regina
Again, I don't care, dox them all in my book, but the inconsistency I don't understand
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "Marvin is only responsible for the technical stuff"]
Oh I mean htl/tah if admin is the wrong title
Psycho
I don't recall if he was an admin tbh
It's been ages
He's a jerkop
Spooky/Regina
Anyway yeah he leaks shit on mkr wirh her name on it, protects others, then there's a new policy to not dox people and mkr stays doxed
Bad, bad look.
Psycho
I agree
Spooky/Regina
Mkr is just the most obvious example I'm sure I could find others
Psycho
That was basically done out of impulse
She never needed her dox on there
Spooky/Regina
So I mean if you're gonna just go with peoples internet names you should remove mkr and Owls real names. Especially the latter. I never heard anything bad about him (other than being involved with Chris) and he's trying to lay low now, has been for a while
But still, Devon ought to be named. He's basically a public figure.
Psycho
[replying to "So I mean if you're gonna"]
I wasn't an active member when that happened [T]BH
I've only just become aware of that
But again, thanks for notifying me
I guess it's just that Fiona made us realize how dangerous that can actually be is all.
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "I wasn't an active member when..."]
I'm not saying you put it there or anything, but if you're having a new policy on name dropping you should remove their shit. Like, now. Or if you have to discuss it reach out to whoever.
Psycho
Sorry for the confusion
Spooky/Regina
And again I think to any rule you'd come up with of that nature gibi would be an exception due due bring a public figure (Ethan Ralph would be in the same category)
Psycho
Good point
In that case, I guess you can put the name back up
He's a public figure
Spooky/Regina
Sounds good to me. As far as the mkr/Owls stuff goes I'll take down Owls because I'm editing that article anyway, I'll let you guys decide what what do with mkr. Keeping in mind the optics of the situation.
Psycho
Honestly, a lot of CWCki stuff has been inconsistent
We can't play around anymore
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "Honestly, a lot of CWCki stuff has been inconsistent"]
Yeah. You can really tell what is an old article versus new. The old ones have this ED type tone and the new ones written
much more straight
It would be a massive project to get it straightened out one way or the other lol
Speaking of which I'm sorely tempted to remove every extra "x" people put on "dox" ;)
Spooky/Regina
But anyway yeah, thanks for listening and good to talk with you again. Sorry the last discord ended unpleasantly (as they tend to do) ... sometime soon I'm gonna do some cool stuff with the forum tho
Psycho
Sorry, my phone died.
Thanks for the discussion.
Spooky/Regina
np glad to chat
CWCIslam
23 October 2021
Spooky informs me that she have doxed the people involved in CWCIslam, a group run by the fantasy enabler Michael Afghani. I tell Spooky not to put them on the CWCki, noting that this was exactly what Michael had wanted. I then bring up how Fiona's page was mostly context for events that occured.
Spooky/Regina
and we just doxed the islam guy
Psycho
Don't put them on the CWCki
They don't deserve any attention.
Spooky/Regina
yeah i saw the discussion about that
he turned out to be legit looking to convert chris lol
not some gayop
Psycho
I just feel we need to send a clear message is all.
Spooky/Regina
but still, yeah, i understand
Psycho
That nobody gives a flying fuck.
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "I ust feel we need..."]
lol my idea of a "clear message" is doxing the shit out of people
we have different approaches 🙂
Psycho
Still, they want attention from it, good or bad.
That's their deal.
Spooky/Regina
true up until a certain point
like bella basked in that shit for a while until her dad got involved and then .... oops
but no I totally get where you're coming from
is the islam stuff on the cwcki at all?
Psycho
I guess in terms of providing info outside of Chris, I think it should just be to provide context.
Literally 70% of Fiona's page was just context on everything.
Spooky/Regina
yea
chris did interact with the islam people
i didnt find his response all that interesting tbh
but just the fact that he made it at all is kinda interesting
Regarding Fiona
“
oh yeah as far as fiona goes, it's really fucked up what happened to her ... i mean for most of these people i can say fuck'em, they interacted with Chris, what did they expect ... and to be honest if Fiona came to my attention without all the Bella shit I probably would have doxed her but it would have been a single kiwi post, maybe a cwcki entry, but people would forget that shit ... but when she got doxed in front of 15,000 kiwi farms visitors during the height of the merge and the subsequent feeding frenzy
”
Spooky on Fiona.
23 October 2021
I talk to Spooky about Chris sending photos to Fiona when he stopped by at the hotel, citing that as him be lecherous to her. I also state disagreement with common misconceptions that surrounded her, such as Chris supposedly turning her down for Barb or the belief that Chris wasn't interested in her at all, attributing those to the fact that Chris simply started his affair with Barb before he ever met Fiona. I also expressed doubts at rumors that she was put into a "mental hospital", as I've talked to a few of Fiona's friends, who reached out to me about what was going on with her, possibly because I was essentially the one handling most of the coverage of her on this wiki. Said friends told me Fiona was merely put into psychiatric care for a while, but otherwise was doing fine.
Spooky then showcases more of their soft spot towards Fiona, as do I in this conversation. However, she also expresses how if it weren't for her involvement with Bella, or Bella framing her, she'd dox Fiona the same degree as anyone else she targeted.
Spooky also reveals that at one point she actually talked to Fiona, having to "chew her out" for her Reddit AMA. I however express that I've mellowed out at her making her AMA, though admittedly not for the right reasons.[note 13]
Afterwards, I state my general belief that Fiona wasn't a bad person...just really flawed. From this we talk about how both her and Bella were not that interesting as far as lolcows go, something that has been debated for quite a bit since she hasn't been heard from since her AMA.
Psycho
He was still kind of lecherous of her, from what I understand.
He still tried to contact her despite her distancing herself from Chirs.
Which I find fucking creepy.
Spooky/Regina
wait,who?
Psycho
Chris sent photos to Fiona.
When he was in the hotel.
Spooky/Regina
oh yeah
he did
Psycho
That's kind of why I don't buy him not being into her.
He clearly did to some extent.
Spooky/Regina
i mean, it is a woman, i'm not gonna go in for all that "Fiona got cucked by Barb bullshit"
exactly
the barb stuff, ugh, i hate even talking about, but it was ongoing, fiona was a future goal and there's no reason to think that she wasn't, he said a few things that seemed dismissive of her, but come on, he's autistic as fuck, he's gonna say awkward shit
Psycho
I just think it was because he met Fiona after he started fucking Barb.
Him saying it was an "open relationship" feels more like an excuse in his part.
Spooky/Regina
yea he wasn't gonna turn down what was right there
ugh,talking about this still makes my skin crawl
i had the glorious distraction of bella and then sean and gibi and then random weens and now...what is left but the crying shame of what happened
Psycho
Honestly, I don't care so much if she's retarded or that she talked to Chris. Her situation still sucked hard.
And she could have gotten scarred from that shit.
Spooky/Regina
oh yeah as far as fiona goes, it's really fucked up what happened to her ... i mean for most of these people i can say fuck'em, they interacted with Chris, what did they expect ... and to be honest if Fiona came to my attention without all the Bella shit I probably would have doxed her but it would have been a single kiwi post, maybe a cwcki entry, but people would forget that shit ... but when she got doxed in front of 15,000 kiwi farms visitors during the height of the merge and the subsequent feeding frenzy
no wonder she needed mental help tbh
that shit crazy
Psycho
I think she was just hospitalized.
She was never institutionalized as some people would claim.
I also talked to people that knew her.
She's doing much better these days.
Spooky/Regina
well she was on an inpatient psych unit
"institutionalized" is the wrong word
and yes i have heard she is doing well also
i had to chew her out for the reddit ama but she is doing well
doesn't really wanna talk about it which is understandable
Psycho
I've mellowed to the AMA, TBH.
I can kind of understand why she made it.
Spooky/Regina
oh i can absolutely understand why she made it
doesn't make it not a dumb thing to do lol
Psycho
Agreed, but it certainly wasn't for attention.
She tried to make a regular account the following day.[note 14]
And it had no mention of Chris in it whatsoever.
Only to have her internet taken for real.
Spooky/Regina
yeah she needs to be lumberjacked for real until idk what
cliche but hopefully it was a learning experience
Psycho
Honestly, she wasn't a bad kid. She just has a lot of room for improvement.
Spooky/Regina
agree, she seems like a sweetheart tbh
and her perspectives on the porn industry are based
Psycho
Yeah, she's pretty sweet personality-wise from what I heard.
She's just an edgelord on the internet.
Spooky/Regina
yea
she was nice when we briefly interacted
and whatever shit she posts in discord,well, it wasnt meant for public consumption,right
too bad she got hooked into all this bullshit but there it is
[break]
Psycho
Some people still want milk from her, I wouldn't blame her.
Even when there's really nothing to her, TBH.
Spooky/Regina
Yeah she's not that interesting. Neither is Bella or any of these tards tbh once you've gotten the basic facts there's not all that much to them. Both zoomergirls are more interesting for what they brought out in other people than for their own characteristics.
Psycho
Yeah, Bella's not that interesting either, IMO. In the end, she was only loosely related to Chris.
She was a Praetor nobody gave a shit about until the incest.
She was a depraved cunt and all, but her plan really wasn't that elaborate either.
And she sucks a that too.
Spooky/Regina
Yeah she failed at everything and her "plan" was basically "???? Profit"
Psycho
I think she wanted Fiona's pussy too.
Which scares me.
Spooky/Regina
Oh she did yea
She thought she was pretty slick by trying to all in one go get Chris blackmail material, steal Fiona, fuck over Josh for Sean, and then somehow cause Chris to suicide for the lulz
Doing even one of those things was probably beyond her meager capabilities
The WCT and Naught
23 October 2021
I talk to Spooky about The WCT and Naught. As you can see here, my views on WCT's role during the Everfree Saga changed drastically from how they were before, going from believing he was some sort of sociopath obsessed with serial killers to now believing he merely had some petty rivalry with Naught and was manipulated by Bella, both of which turned out to be completely true. I also bring up the fact that while my stance on Sean has changed to now thinking he wasn't as malicious as we thought, him enabling Chris was still unacceptable. Spooky, of course, denies that Chris stumbled across Sean's documentary series, saying that he was somehow better at manipulating people than Bella.
Spooky then tells me about how "useful" Naught has been, alluding to the fact that she was using him for intel about WCT's role with Chris. When I state uncertaintly for why WCT would be against Naught, Spooky tells me it was due to a "love triangle", likely referencing the fact that MKR made up this exact story, which she told to Burn Book member Basalas as he was posting about it on the Farms.[21]
Psycho
From what I understand, Sean was an asshole in that scenario
But it was ultimately to take down Naught.
Bella basically manipulated him too.
He's still an asshole, IMO
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "Bella basically manipulated him too."]
Idk about that he came in with plenty of bad intentions of his own. He and Bella manipulated each other. And Sean is arguably better at manjpulating people than Bella is even being as autistic as he is
Psycho
I think Bella was legitimately autistic too. She said that herself.
I don't remember where.
Spooky/Regina
Naught, who the fuck knows, dudes a creep but he's been useful
Psycho
But that could just be her being edgy.
Spooky/Regina
Nah she's probably legit autistic,looks different in women
Psycho
[replying to "Naught, who the fuck knows"]
Sean had a vendetta against him for some reason.
It's just that in regards to the incest stuff, he wasn't that involved.
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "Sean had a vendetta against..."]
A love triangle.
That was the reason.
Psycho
What?
Everybody in this story wants someone's pussy!
Spooky/Regina
Trannydick in this situation but basically yes
Psycho
So Sean had a thing for trans people?
Spooky/Regina
And yeah I talked with Sean a good bit I think on the 2nd and there isn't really any faking how legit out of sorts he was about it all. Scared too because he knew his bullshit was gonna come to light.
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "So Sean had a thing for trans people?"]
At least one. And he's bisexual besides, at one point was trying to get with Naught himself lol
(I have not seen a face picture of him but enough people have told me Naught is actually good looking irl that I believe it)
The other individual in the triangle was Naught's tranny ">g"f
So it wasn't even just a triangle it was even more complex geometry than that lmao
Shit crazy
Psycho
Whatever the reason, Sean was involved with Bella because he wanted to take down Naught.
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "Whatever the reason..."]
And Josh. He also wanted to take down Josh at least with respect to Josh's relationship with Chris.
Psycho
Also, apparently Chris discovered Randy on his own.
Sean just rolled with it.
Still pretty asshole-ish of him in my book.
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "Also, apparently Chris..."]
Nah I don't believe that
Psycho
[replying to "Nah I don't believe that"]
He apparently watched Sean's knock-off Geno series.
Spooky/Regina
That much is true
But do you really believe that he just randomly happened upon the series? While talking to Sean? Come on.
Psycho
I wouldn't say he wasn't acting malicious in that case, either.
Sean still enabled him with that.
Basically, he knew how crazy Randy was.
Spooky/Regina
But introducing Chris to Stair is to say the least a problem
Psycho
[replying to "But introducing Chris to Stair..."]
Agreed.
It's much worse to just play along with that.
Spooky/Regina
Yeah. I do not have a smoking gun as such but I'm quite confident that Sean thought it would be interesting to introduce Chris to his Randy material due to the fact that Chris and randy had superficially similar belief systems (although when you think about it not actually that similar, Randy has to die to get the ghost puss but Chris will live to see the merge)
More on Doxing
“
i think everyone should be doxed and i would give an ovary for tah's dox
but he is probably a tough nut to crack
”
Spooky on trying to obtain Hurtful's dox
24 October 2021
I notify Spooky that we tried to fix the inconsistencies with the stuff surrounding Owls and MKRNightVee. When she questioned me about this, I explained that I assumed that the stuff with MKR had been dealt with already. I also express that it's odd that MKR is seemingly getting doxed more than other people involved, expressing that I don't think doxing people should be treated as a first resort.
When Spooky talks about a post she'll make on the Burn Book server about doxing, I bring up the suggestion that we could probably include Chris's family members, since people like Barb and Bob already have the information up. I also tell Spooky I'm considering just calling Sean "The WCT", their screen name, citing their galaxy-sized ego, and wanting to be known as "one of the final protagonists" as the reason. Spooky disagrees with this, and I state that I can see where she's coming from with their disagreement, given how Bella turned ship after getting doxed. I also bring up Fiona again, stating this is an instance where someone, in this case Bella, was abusing her dox for their ends.
From this, I express the idea of doxing people to "discourage weenery" could probably work in practice, though this is a sentiment that I'd abandon later on when Spooky begins abusing the shit out of it. I also talk about how I've kept the doxes of the Idea Guys for this reason due to them doing illegal things to Chris, and Spooky replies to this by reminding me that Hurtful supposedly defeneded them while also wanting to dox MKR, something I agreed was kind of weird. I also express that we shouldn't be doxing people unless there's a good reason for it, and also express agreement to what Spooky was saying in their post on Burn Book.
Eventually, Spooky tells me that every single person that was involved in the "fuckery" should get doxed, telling me she'd "give an ovary" for Hurtful's dox. She also talks about intending to dox people like Anaxis, Kyle, and Para, but she doesn't put me in the same "category" as them as I've never interacted with Chris. I then give my opinions about doxing, saying that it shouldn't be based on whether or not people "deserve it", which Spooky seems to agree with.
Psycho
So we basically dealt with the Owls and MKR stuff.
Spooky/Regina
did you?
i see some new discussion which I'm adding to
but i also see mkr's dox and owl's lack of dox so i'm curious how you dealt with it
Psycho
I guess saying we "dealt" with it is too strong a word.
We basically removed the doxxes from the page.
Spooky/Regina
mkrs was there an hour ago
and i hate harping on her because it sounds like im her friend or give a shit about her, i don't, dox her to high heaven, it's just the best example and an egregious one because hedgehog tried to knife her on the farms too
Psycho
I thought that was dealt with.
Spooky/Regina
by who lmao
i really wanna know what their problem with mkr is
Psycho
I just saw Owls dox being removed and thought MRK was too.
I'll deal with MKR.
Spooky/Regina
Psycho
Thanks
Honestly, I don't know what the deal there is.
I personally don't see doxxing as something we should resort to,
Spooky/Regina
i took down owls shit because i agree he's really not notable unless anything else comes out, i didn't take mkr's down because i actually disagree with taking her stuff down
Psycho
But that's just my personal preference.
Spooky/Regina
but only use her to make the point
i'm in favor of doxing every single person who gets involved with this fuckery
im writing a longish post about this that i'll make on the general page shortly
Psycho
Oh
I see.
My contribution to this is to maybe consider how close the person was to Chris.
Like, family members are fair game, IMO.
Spooky/Regina
i think trying to get close to Chris is as good as being close to Chris as far as that goes
(In other words, everybody lol)
Psycho
Though at the same time, people want the attention even if it's negative.
That's why I'm considering just calling Sean WCT again.
Because he's a fucking egotist.
Spooky/Regina
no
don't do that lol
also people might think they want the attention that they get when their name gets out like that, but they really don't, or very very very few people do
sean and bella certainly don't
Psycho
I see.
Spooky/Regina
this i know first hand
because they have cried to me about it
Psycho
Bella turned ship pretty fast when she got doxxed.
And she wouldn't have thrown Fiona under the bus if she wasn't concerned about that.
Spooky/Regina
yep
Psycho
I guess Fiona's case is more special in that that was an instance of someone abusing someone's dox.
Bella pretty much dropped her personal information on many websites.
In other words, weaponizing doxxes.
But Sean is probably still revelling in the attention he's getting.
I'm not too sure what he's up to.
Spooky/Regina
he is not happy lol
Psycho
I mean, I guess if it's a means of discouraging people from weenery, then sure.
Spooky/Regina
there you go.
Psycho
I decided the Idea Guys should stay for that reason, not only because they're associated with Chris to high hell, but also because of the illegal shit they did
Spooky/Regina
your daily reminder that htl didn't approve of their being doxed
Psycho
I always found that weird, TBH.
But yet he decided to dox MKR.
Spooky/Regina
yep.
Psycho
I don't personally think we should pick and choose who shouldn't get doxxed unless there's a good reason for it.
Spooky/Regina
exactly
Psycho
I just want to reduce people abusing it.
Because that's exactly what happened after the initial incest leaks.
Like, I think Wallflower is justified in that Chris basically found her first, and because of how trolls treated her initially.
Her article also used to include details not related to Chris, but more on her.
And I guess for Owls, his personal information isn't that relevant to his involvement to Chris.
Spooky/Regina
aright i put up several things on talk pages
Psycho
Yeah, I think I kind of agree with what you're saying in the General. Birthdays, Locations, and things that require digging are closer to "doxxing" than just a name drop.
Spooky/Regina
yep
(one 'x' 😠 )
Psycho
That's actually what I did with Fiona too, it wasn't just her name.
Spooky/Regina
but yeah
naught for whatever reasons of his own posted all kinds of shit on her and her family that first night as yoiu may remember, it was probably him putting up details if anyone did
[break]
Psycho
I can understand your concern, though.
There certainly are double standards.
Like you said, TAH seemed to have problems with doxxing IG.
But no problems doxxing MKR.
I don't think that means he's involved or anything.
But it certainly is an inconsistency that needs to be discussed.
Spooky/Regina
yes
Psycho
I myself personally feel doxxing shouldn't be resorted to in most cases.
Spooky/Regina
i don't think he's "involved" in the sense that he did anything egregiously wrong with sean or any of those people, if he did i'm pretty sure it woud've come out already, but he was "involved" in the sense of mixing socially with these people and chosing sides in their gay little dramas
Psycho
Especially when it comes to Chris.
Spooky/Regina
i think everyone should be doxed and i would give an ovary for tah's dox
but he is probably a tough nut to crack
given that he doesn't really powerlevel or have other internet presence connected
(by "everyone should be doxed" I mean all these people who jockey for position in the "cwc sphere" ... meaning actually trying to interact with chris)
also kyle, anaxis, para ...
they all need to fucking get it, if only because the situation as it stands right now is unfair lol
(don't worry i would not include you under this category as you're a document-er not an interacter)
Psycho
Yeah, I don't personally think people should get doxxed based on if they "deserve" it. (Not saying you're saying this) Mostly because this creates problems.
People attempt to interact with Chris for many reasons.
I see "don't touch the poop" as more of a warning than a reward/punishment thing.
I think Chris being outed as a sexual criminal would have an actual effect on people's lives though. That's partly why this is a concern.
I also like your idea of categories, BTW.
Especially if we're going to do this on a case by case basis.
Psycho
Overall, I see interaction with Chris as a big risk above all else, even if you don't intend to fuck with him, which is why I would highly discourage it. Being actively involved in some scheme is ultimately what's much more fucked, as this increases the risk 10-fold, and because you're actually being a heinous piece of shit.
Psycho
[replying to "they all need to fucking get it..."]
To what degree, BTW?
I never particularly agreed to leaving out Anaxis' involvement as Lainchu.
Spooky/Regina
yeah to me anyway that wass an obvious favor to a friend/fellow cwckifag
you mean "get it" to what extent? depends, i mean random people may just warrant a brief mention, if they acted like an asshole,don't give them "a place in christory" but point out they're a douchbag c.f. making fun of winfield's book or ellen's looks or ethan's gunt
as far as unfair, well, yah, it's blatantly unfair. I am sure there is every kind of bullshit and fuckery that's been going on for many years but i'm not trying to do fucking archaeology
at the moment so the best example of unfair is mkr on the one hand and pretty much everyone else on the other as far as htl's treatment of people goes
Psycho
[replying to "you mean "get it" to..."]
That sounds good. Pretty much the reason the CWCIslam guys aren't getting a mention.
Spooky/Regina
oh btw michael afghani, the cwcislam guy, is a legitimate lolcow in his own right
Psycho
The article still pointed out the action was pretty shit though.
Spooky/Regina
like, there is aa large amount of lore already
Psycho
I think that paints a clear enough message not to troll Chris in jail
Spooky/Regina
so he is probably "interesting" enough
and his head on a pike as someone put it is a good further war
ning for people not to fucking around
again, trust me, he will not enjoy having this information out there
Psycho
[replying to "so he is probably "interesting" enough"]
Maybe a brief mention in the Post-Merge article will suffice.
Spooky/Regina
yeah, we'll se
i'm not in a rush
he's gonna get a kiwi thread maybe tomorrow and we'll see what happens from there
Psycho
But again, I'd go primarily go for the parts that have to do with Chris.
Otherwise we run into the problem of derailing the article.
Spooky/Regina
yeah Chris's response to them isn't that interesting
yeah maybe just "Michael (Samantha) Afghani, incel turned troon turned Muslim larper,who blah blah blah but not blah blah that much, wrote this letter, etc"
apparently he also abused a hamster
for fucks sake
but yeah he is a live one
Psycho
The Post-Merge article is basically just the scrapyard for all the post-merge wannabees that didn't make an impact, but are still worth mentioning.
Spooky/Regina
could easily get a pretty long article for himself but yeah he didn't make any impact on Chris per se so a little descriptor of who he is will suffice people can look at kiwi if they care
Psycho
There used to be a "Lolcow Wiki"
Spooky/Regina
but just saying he's way more interesting than ellen or winfield for example
Psycho
I don't know what happened to that though.
Spooky/Regina
i don't relly know what happened to it either, josh got tired of it basically i think
Psycho
It was a Kiwi Farms subsidiary.
Spooky/Regina
but dont quote me on that, all i know is it was there, josh was gungho about people putting stuff on there, and then it kind of faded away and people act like it never existed lol
More on CWCIslam
24 October 2021
After the above conversation, I inform Spooky about Michael inviting random people from the CWCki Server into their Lunar Module server. I then mention how one of the Mean Girls was able to get a lot of information on Michael, and the modstaffs' efforts to stop Michael. We also draw a few parallels between Michael and Bella.
Psycho
I think only coupon should get the mention in that article.
Because he contributed the most to Christory.
Relatively.
He seems Bella-ish honestly
Spooky/Regina
he is very bella-ish
Psycho
With the way he abducts newbies into his Discord.
Spooky/Regina
i'll invite you to the doxing pm hold on
but yeah he is highly reminiscent of bella in a few ways
who the fuck knows what he might have done had he gotten his hooks into chris
he gives off legit school shooter type vibes
Psycho
Thanks
Psycho
[replying to "but yeah he is highly reminiscent..."]
I think it's just how he abudcts members from other servers.
Bella did the same thing.
Spooky/Regina
oh no lol there's a lot more
skim the thread especially starting halfway through or so and you'll see
like i said he's a live one lol
Psycho
As in the 10 page mark?
Spooky/Regina
thereabouts
i think thats where he was properly doxed, before that it is mostly bulshitting around
ill find the exact spot
Psycho
Dynastia is there too, sick.
Spooky/Regina
yeah just lurking
most of tht list are just lurking but it is good to have people there
page 12ish
Psycho
Yeah, basically all discussion on him is private as far as I know.
Spooky/Regina
yeah we are keeping this need-to-know for now
because he is still producing content in the discord
Psycho
[REDACTED]'s[note 15] provided a lot on him.
Spooky/Regina
he is gonna chimp the fuck out when he finds out he is doxed
and yeah [REDACTED] is an allstar
Psycho
A CWCki server jerkief has notified me that they're still probably on the move.
That's how I knew they were abducting people too.
[REDACTED] found that.
I personally prefer not to go on the server myself, mostly because they already know I edit the CWCki.
Spooky/Regina
elaborate on that? abduction/on the move?
yeah i am in the islam server, just listening
Psycho
[replying to "elaborate on that?"]
Like, as in they've been spamming invites onto multiple websites.
Somehow newer CWCki server members got onto that server.
Spooky/Regina
they are pretty quiet there
oh are cwcki people monitoring their shit too?
if you talk to them please have them be discrete until the kf thread goes up
Psycho
I feel my prescence on there would scare them away.
Spooky/Regina
dont want to get wires crossed
Psycho
[replying to "dont want to get..."]
As in...
Spooky/Regina
as in if people try to interact with them or get info or run their own gayops
by now it wont realy matter we have what we need tbh
but it would be best if anyone in there just lays low for a day or two until the thread comes up
then ... 🍿 time
Psycho
Yeah, I feel it's necessary to build mutual trust in that regard. That's not going to happen over a day.
And of course he was addicted to DMT.
I should have seen that a mile away.
Regarding Anaxis
26 October 2021
I ask Spooky what she thinks should be done with the Post-Merge page now that the stuff on Winfield Winfield and other minor orbiters that she targeted are now on the Fan visits page. She suggest to me that they should go on the Fan Visits page, but that the Post Merge page should be kept, but with a stub template.
Following this, Spooky decides to show me how she'll "continue to find all manner of manipulation and fuckery", showing me one of their edits she's made on Anaxis' "The Journey to the Merge". There, she calls the Lainchu persona a "glorified" sockpuppet of Anaxis. In addition, she claims that Hurtful reverting their edit is more evidence that he is covering up for Anaxis, being aware that he was "socking". While doing this, she call Hurtful a "faggot". She also gloats about how she was making these edits just to see how Hurtful would react to it.
Spooky also comments on some of my own edits, such as one where I revert one of Spooky's edits saying that drama from the Kiwi Farms should stay off of the CWCki. Spooky however tries to justify that this is actually CWCki-related drama, possibly because of how I outed the CarbonCoffee account to them previously. I then reply that the edit that she made might not have been related to Chris, and that I'd check to make sure of this.
Psycho
Since the Winfield stuff is now on the Fan Visits page, what do you think should happen to the stuff on the Post-Merge page?
Spooky/Regina
Good question, there is a lot of overlap between the two
Maybe he and Ellen's main stuff should go to visits and just a stub in post merge
Psycho
[replying to "Maybe he and Ellen's..."]
Good idea.
Spooky/Regina
also i continue to find all manner of manipulation and fuckery
here's Anaxis basically socking https://sonichu.com/w/index.php?title=The_Journey_to_the_Merge&diff=271732&oldid=267096
htl is in there too, obviously aware of whats going on
you people need to clean house severely
Psycho
Yeah, I always found that kind of odd.
Spooky/Regina
and there's a lot of it going around
reverts of my edits haven't gone unnoticed btw
yours is kinda legit saying kf drama should stay off the cwcki but arguably it's more cwcki drama as it originates on the cwcki; htl's reverting my bit about the anaxis fuckery on the watchmen page is suspect as hell because it just shows him guarding her again
the fucking faggot
i doxed gibi 80 days after the incident lol i have a long memory and this bullshit is not going fucking unnoticed
(and why, yes, I did make those edits at least partially to see what would happen)
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "i doxed gibi 80 days after..."]
(I'm not talking about you btw, sorry, that might be able to be misinterpreted. We're cool.)
Psycho
[replying to "yours is kinda legit saying kf..."]
TBH, I'm not too sure if that had much to do with Chris, or the drama surrounding him.
I'll look at it again.
Spooky/Regina
i'm going over anaxis entire edit history
not sure how long she was a member but im a year in so far
not that far i guess im done
unless, of course, she had another name which she probably did
don't worry, the truth, as they say, will out
now im looking at these https://sonichu.com/cwcki/August_2020_Watchmen_leaks (there are a bunch) and will go over the cwcki discord leaks to see who's involved (probably naught, maybe her?)
my merge folder is over a gigabyte and a half lmao
that s alot of fucking material
but yes\
this anaxis stuff, actually may go to show why htl was protecting her
she was a source of this discord shi
Psycho
Really.
What source?
Spooky/Regina
well, at least the one i called her out for and i bet more
i mean, she provided this https://sonichu.com/cwcki/The_Journey_to_the_Merge and possibly (probably?) the other watchmen leaks, and after she started doing that he jannied her up
they were in cahoots for this and you know htl and marvin and all those faggots, anything for content
Psycho
Did Anaxis edit this page?
Well, they did apparently make the page.
Spooky/Regina
yes she did
the thing that particularly stuck in my craw was her calling lainchu a "member of the watchmen"
had she just left it at "conversations with lainchu" it might be excusable
but claiming that lainchu is a real person when it was, at that time, 100% her (a fact which, remember, htl tried specifically to conceal) is obvious redirective bullshit protecting her own gayops
Images and cogsdev
26 October 2021
I assist Spooky with citing images on the CWCki, telling them what format to use.
Afterwards, Spooky brings up a set of CWCki server posts from a catbox file she created, telling me that Anaxis deleted all of his stuff, when in fact he only deleted his Discord account. She also assumes various Deleted accounts from the server in the screenshots she showed me are him. How she came to believe that, I can not answer. I rebute this by saying that sometimes users that got "Deleted" are also banned accounts in this server in particular, so we therefore don't have enough evidence to say the posts belonged to Anaxis.
Spooky then brings up a set of messages alledging that the Watchmen had pictures of cogsdev. I reply to this by saying that I wouldn't find it surprising if the Watchmen were actually against the CWCki in some capacity (a hypothesis that actually turned out to be entirely correct). When Spooky proposes Anaxis might be a "sleeper agent" of theirs', something I tentatively said was possible, Spooky then comes up with this weird theory that Naught, a person she was in direct contact with, was sending Anaxis over to the CWCki to selectively leak things to "win Hurtful over".
I elaborate that I meant it more that, because the Watchmen were going after cogsdev, the literal founder of the CWCki, this could explain why Hurtful might have been socking on the CWCki too. I also state that I believed that the Watchmen might have been going after Hurtful for some reason. I was only partially correct when I theorized this, as Hurtful created the account to leak chats from The Place and correct misinformation without getting attacked by the former Watchmen. Spooky however denies this theory entirely, stating that she only gave me the screencap because she found it "funny".
Spooky/Regina
how do i make a wiki link to an image file
if I say [[file.png]] it doesn't show up and if i say [[File:file.png]] the image itself gets inserted
Psycho
Use the latter.
Then the image will show up.
Spooky/Regina
yeah i don't want it to
just be a link to the image
Psycho
Maybe use <ref>[[File:file.png]]</ref>?
Spooky/Regina
i guess i could put in the whole url but there has to be a way t odo it just in the wiki right?
i guess that would work
cool ill try it
works
🙂
🤔
anaxis deleted her shit
not that that is conclusive evidence or anything
lmfao
that's her lol, has to be
maybe?
Psycho
I think when a user is "Deleted", they are banned on ocassions.
We don't know for sure if Anaxis actually deleted these.
Spooky/Regina
no we don't
but it sounds like it
Psycho
Were these pics you used in the talk?
Spooky/Regina
no im reading these right now
Spooky/Regina
lel
Psycho
So whoever this user is got a pic of the founder.
Spooky/Regina
not necessarily, deleted user could be multiple people so its hard to tell
i.e. we don't know if its the watchman leaker
but its a conversation thats going on at
the same time
and it's funny
Psycho
Yeah, I don't think it'd be that surprising if the Watchmen were against the CWCki
If it's one of them
Spooky/Regina
what does that make anaxis, deep cover sleeper agent lol
Psycho
Probably
Spooky/Regina
bottom line i have no idea what the fuck is going on but i don't like it
but it actually makes sense
say you're naught, right? people don't really trust you and you have a questionable rep. you want influence over the cwcki. what do you do? send your girl anaxis to selectively leak and win over htl.
to be clear i have no proof of that
but it sounds plausible
30 minutes later
Spooky/Regina
oh this is really interesting
someone else has also been archiving the same pages I have
i'll have to read over what it said at that point but that generally means something sus is going on
Psycho
To tell you the truth, I get the feeling that they were probably after TAH.
That'd likely explain the sock.
Spooky/Regina
elaborate?
Psycho
I mean, if they're after cogsdev of all people, who's to say they wouldn't go after TAH too, who was once an admin.
Spooky/Regina
nah i dont think there was anything malicious going on there as such
just looked like bullshitting around to me
i just found it funny
i mean cogsdev shit is not exactly secret
Psycho
Not really.
Cogsdev's stuff is sort of out there.
Spooky/Regina
ya
it might be on ed?
idk ive seen dox but its not something i care about
i think
Spooky's Ban
“
Fucking galaxy brained move lmao. Remember that I archived every single edit I made and talk to plenty of people. I double dog dare you to try to pull some shit. Even your own people are already catching on. I will be continuing to watch your faggotry with great interest, and it gets worse every time I look into it.
”
Spooky on Hurtful's Kiwi Farms profile after getting banned.
26 October 2021[note 16]
Spooky sends me a screenshot of Hurtful banning them from the CWCki, which I tell them I thought it might have been a bad idea that he did that. I also inform Spooky that I was going to warn them of accusing server members, in this case Klop, of working with the Watchmen before Hurtful banned them, as I wanted to give Spooky another chance and was worried that banning them might cause more suspicion and conflicts. Spooky agrees to this, but not for the reasons I had in mind. She misattributed her getting banned, and them trying to "expose" Hurtful banning them, to an instance of the Streisand Effect, failing to realize that the "suppressed" information is only becoming public knowledge because she wouldn't shut the fuck up about it, and people were already beginning to call Spooky out for her claims.
Right after I told them that, she denied the accusations, and despite everything I told them about Klop, stating that I didn't believe they were involved with Bella or The WCT; which Spooky seemingly agreed with prior; she then suddenly flips to saying that he was "100% involved". I then bring up the text that she put on the CWCki, and remind them that Klop told me they were inadvertently involved. Spooky then rejects my statements in their entirety.
That same day, Spooky went onto Hurtful's Kiwi Farms account to mock them about her ban.[22]
Spooky/Regina
lmao
that's not gonna be helpful
like, that was genuinely, solidly bad fucking idea on his part lol
Psycho
I think it was.
Spooky/Regina
extremely bad idea
i wonder what the actual fuck he thinks he is doing
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect
Psycho
I was going to send you a warning about that kind of behavior on there.
Spooky/Regina
which behavior lol
Psycho
Like, I understand your concerns and all.
But I don't think it's very ideal to share info like that on the CWCki, especially when it isn't fully confirmed.
Spooky/Regina
what isn't confirmed?
Psycho
Like, I wasn't really sure if the CWCki server people were involved with the Watchmen.
It's more like I felt that you could have provided this in a less intimidating manner.
Spooky/Regina
i didn't say they were
(if you mean the discord server)
Psycho
Yeah
That's what I meant.
Spooky/Regina
yeah i didnt say that
well
klop
klop is involved 100%
Psyco
The CWCki server was a favorite hangout of the Suitress, among other figures who would gain notoriety in post-Merge scandals. The CWCki Discord claims to forbid people to interact with Chris but, not only were these two individuals and others in notable and very obvious contact with Chris on the server, but with great irony, it's one-time owner was revealed to be a member of the Watchmen in close contact with Chris.[citation needed]
Klop said that he was inadvertently involved though
Spooky/Regina
fuck klop lol
he was a lainchu
27 October 2021
Spooky/Regina
nothing 'inadvertent' about that
he was a lainchu
Spooky/Regina
anyway
I'd like to get in touch with 4centuser
Spooky/Regina
...who is (rightfuly) slapping 'citation needed' on my stuff but it's kinda hard to provide receipts when i'm banned
oh well, the streisand effect is more than worth the loss of the account
The CWCki as an "institution"
“
me and the cwcki as a whole, not so much, i think as an institution it's shown it's true colors and that nothing short of a complete change of it's orientation and the people in charge is going to be able to rescue it from itself
”
Spooky calling the CWCki an "institution".
28 October 2021
Seemingly because I hadn't responded to their previous messages, Spooky confronts me again. Though she also claims that she didn't have hard feelings against me. She then goes on a rant about how the CWCki is a sort of "insitution" that's shown their true colors, and must have a change in leadership to rescue itself. She also complains about some of its users supposedly withdrawing information and how them getting banned further proves this acussation.
She first compare Hurtful Truth Level to GiBi due to their supposed cowardice. She then talks about how she thinks that Anaxis "hiding" is probably smart because of people looking for "her"[note 17] She then expresses uncertainty in who else on the CWCki she can trust but me, but she viewed 4CentUser as a valid option, possibly from me sharing the screenshot of Hurtful clarifying the CarbonCoffee incident to them. She requests I have 4Cent talk to Spooky.
She finally ends this conversation by gloating about how she pissed off the mods on the Kiwi Farms, and plan on making another thread in a few days. By this point, Spooky seemed really unsettling to me...
Spooky/Regina
lol ok it's like that
no hard feelings and nothing personal for the record
Psycho
Okay.
Glad to see we're still cool.
Spooky/Regina
we are
me and the cwcki as a whole, not so much, i think as an institution it's shown it's true colors and that nothing short of a complete change of it's orientation and the people in charge is going to be able to rescue it from itself
and i don't say that because I'm upset about being banned, I'm really not, my ban actually proves my point better than my edits ever could
(and as such is more than worth the loss of the account, I communicate with some of the relevant people anyway and would like to communicate with them more, that's more important to me than editing priveliges)
I mean one big problem with HTL is, essentially, and much like Devon, who I trust and respect about as much at this point, is cowardice, or maybe just autism, I dunno, but I don't know what's discussed internally but he's not responded to anything, not that he really did in any meaningful way on the Farms either. Anaxis is hiding, which is probably very smart because people are, in fact, looking for her. As for other people I'm not sure entirely who to trust but 4centuser seems like a solid person.
Psycho
4cent is basically just a wiki gnome.
I highly doubt he's involved with the Watchmen.
Spooky/Regina
he used that phrase with me
not sure what it means
but yeah I am pretty sure he's got no links to fuckery
Psycho
[replying to "not sure what it means"]
He just works behinds the scenes and adds features to the CWCki like templates.
Spooky/Regina
well, he puts in work and does so regularly, and is respected, that's what's important
he seems to take the issues i've raised seriously enough which I of course appreciate
again, don't know what goes on behind closed doors in a discord or whatever you have
Spooky/Regina
i would like to speak with him if possible
Psycho
With who?
4cent?
Spooky/Regina
yes
Spooky/Regina
Also lol I've pissed off all the Kiwi cwc forum Jannies, haven't I? Is there another one? I need to start a thread. Not this instant but within a few days once it's finished
Also Bella isn't mixed race in the sense people usually use the term she is Dutch through dad and Greek through mom
Spooky's True Colors
“
honesty i shouldn't even be telling you this, i should just be telling the world so people can see the fuckery before you fix it
”
Spooky giving me shit for not reverting an edit about Annie Ikenberry they themselves made.
I hesitated on telling ANYONE, whether they be from the CWCki, Burn Book, or elsewhere the reason why I officially decided to begin backing away from Spooky Bones and Burn Book as a whole. Basically, it all boils down to this one conversation I had with her, where I think I saw her true colors up close. I was already beginning to see how tense and irritable Spooky could be when she didn't get what she wanted prior to this, but this just solidified it for me. Everything she had accused Hurtful of being was right there in front of me.
The reason I chose not to talk about this until now is that I didn't want to cause more in-fighting than there already was by telling people what Spooky said to me, like what happened with Hurtful Truth Level. I knew that was exactly what this asshole wanted from me, and I just know she'd probably get some sort of sadistic joy out of me trying to clear my name as she did with GiBi, The WCT, Hurtful Truth Level, and others.
Rereading this conversation now, though she didn't explicitly say it, I can sense that she fucking dared me to expose them for saying the things she said to me. I also knew by this point that pissing Spooky off or quote-unquote "exposing" them when she still had her thrall on others certainly wouldn't work in my favor, espescially given all the interactions we've had up to this point, all that I've done for them, and how she approached people like GiBi, The WCT and Hurtful Truth Level. That, I think, is what I attribute to me taking the civil approach in the posts I made replying to the message where she calls BOTH me and Hurtful out, and I'm real fucking glad I did. I deprived them of the satisfaction of knowing she was making me, or anyone else on the CWCki, suffer to satisfy their fragile ego.
This conversation was also what advanced the mending of my friendship with Hurtful, despite any hard feelings I've might have felt towards him or anything nasty I've said about him prior, as I began talking to him regularly again on Discord the following day. I've come to realize that Spooky, despite their insistance; or that of those that looked up to her; that she was totally objective, was never interested in documenting the truth in any capacity. All she cared about was what stories sold well, regardless of how reflective to the truth they were or who gets harmed in the process. A part of that process was for them to get me angry at Hurtful Truth Level, the one who introduced me to the Chris Chan subculture, and to try and get me to destroy the CWCki from the inside to fit their vision of what it should be.
I would become more convinced this was the case the entire time after what Spooky proceeded to do after betraying me the way she did.
30 October 2021
Spooky/Regina
Lololololololol
Psycho
What is it?
31 October 2021
Spooky/Regina
we have a number of issues lol
it's rather too late to get into them
(as in too late at night, not too late in the game, but it might be that too)
That evening, Spooky officially begins the conversation with this:
Spooky/Regina
lol what the fuck do you people even think you're doing anymore and do you realize just how transparently bad it looks
like honestly i can't tell anymore if it's malice or incompetence/stupidity/good old fashioned autism
Psycho
What's the problem?
Spooky/Regina
i dunno if i should wait to tell you and put you on blast publicly first
tbh
it should be kinda obvious really
Psycho
[replying to "i dunno if i should wait to tell you and put you on blast publicly first"]
What?
Spooky/Regina
anyway you've been pretty good to me really so i won't do that
but how in the everliving FUCK do you and htl think it's a good look continuing to selectively remove people's info
key word being selectively
Psycho
What do you mean by "selectively"?
Spooky/Regina
if you removed everyone's you'd just be squeamish about doxing
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "What do you mean by "selectively"?"]
exactly what I said lol.
particularly in that several enemies of the Watchmen remain up and other people do not
like LMFAO
way to make it totally transparent
or, again, are yall just that fucking dumb
and give no thought to optics
like explain, please
Psycho
Honestly, I wasn't around for the Watchmen thing.
Spooky/Regina
well, your boy was
Psycho
So I have no idea why certain names are being redacted and others aren't.
Spooky/Regina
very much lololol
well, it's not a good look at all and yall are gonna have a bad time, i'm not even interested in correcting the sitution anymore, it's so disgustingly blatant your shit is probably irredeemble without an outright purge and change of ownership
and no i'm not suggesting myself
like why go to bat for devon of all people and at least 3 prominent enemies of sean's people are still there
why remove ellen and dylon's pictures while mkr's is still there as well as annie's onlyfans being as good as linked?
an 18 year old girl, psycho, an 18 year old girl
this shit is absolutely disgusting
Psycho
I'm not aware of that.
Spooky/Regina
now you are
Psycho
This is MKR?
Spooky/Regina
no
annie
Psycho
Didn't you put that up or something?
Spooky/Regina
MKR's pic is just there, she's 20 something and definitely not onlyfans material
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "Didn't you put that up or something?"]
yes
and she deserves it
but, again, consistency
like protect motherfucking GIBI and feed her to the bus
what the actual fuck
htl is an arrogant cunt, has completely lost the plot, and is playing himself really, really bdly
i guess being le ebin oldfag he is not used to having his shit questioned or looked into
honesty i shouldn't even be telling you this, i should just be telling the world so people can see the fuckery before you fix it
but i still think you and I have decent communication
Psycho
[replying to "and she deserves it"]
You were just talking to me about a week ago how it's not about people "deserving it".
Spooky/Regina
like he is doing this shit when he KNOWS i am watching carefully
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "You were just talking to me about a week ago how it's not about people "deserving it".]
ok, strike "deserve" and put in "she's a legitimate subject for documentation" or something like that
either one is accurate
Psycho
[replying to "ok, strike "deserve" and put in..."]
What does her OnlyFans have to do with Chris?
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "What does her OnlyFans have to do with Chris?"]
well, it's part of a biographical sketch, and arguably points to how she was used as "bait" for Chris since she is an attractive girl
also it's funny
i was going to expand on that page considerably (including picturess) but I obviously can't now
Psycho
[replying to "well, it's part of a biographical sketch, and..."]
But Chris was attracted to several girls WITHOUT an OnlyFans.
Spooky/Regina
who even cares? lol. it's her occupation. i'm sure I can find other people who's occupations are noted
but mainly, it's funny
An hour after this exchange, after telling me that they wouldn't put me on blast, Spooky directed me to a post on Kiwi Farms where they did just that, putting both me and Hurtful "on blast". Anaxis talked about this very post in his Manifesto, citing it as Spooky making "the same old accusations they'd been hawking since the beginning". This was also the same post where Spooky hawked on the "jerkop that betrayed Hurtful", as he put it.
Spooky/Regina
anyway https://kiwifarms.ru/threads/updating-the-cwcki.50150/post-10337656
i eagerly await your response
Another hour later, I decide to confront Spooky directly, as well as provide my opinions in the thread they linked to.
Psycho
I think my whole problem is that you keep talking about consistency, but I have no clue what you want from us.
Like, you keep talking about MKR, but think it's fine to keep it up.
Like, sure, I'd totally ablige to keeping it consistent.
Spooky/Regina
Mainly to point out that hedgehog and Marvin are neck deep in the bullshit
Treatment of mkr vs treatment of anaxis is where it becomes undeniable
As for consistency if I were in charge I would put the whole dox of all of these people if not their whole families front and center
I realize that's not going to happen
So make a policy and stick to it
Psycho
[replying to "As for consistency if I were in charge I..."]
What's that going to solve?
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "What's that going to solve?"]
Maybe just maybe motivate people not to do this shit
Psycho
I don't think this "consistency" can be done if there's constant debate over how things should be done, then.
I feel there should be some kind of agreement.
I personally don't resort to doxxing.
Spooky/Regina
You manage a wiki dedicated to documenting a retard's entire life and act squeamish about "doxing." Get real.
Psycho
Yeah.
But I dont' manage the CWCki.
I'm merely a mod.
I keep saying this.
I guess my whole point is not so much that ALL doxxing is bad.
I just feel we need to reach a common ground.
Spooky/Regina
OK, you know what I mean. You participate in putting someone's whole entire shit out there for the whole internet to see. I am fine with this. But why the reticence to do it to others?
Psycho
[replying to "OK, you know what I mean. You..."]
I think it's because plenty of people also follow this retard.
They risk getting doxxed themselves by getting close to them.
Even if they're not all that noteworthy in any other regards.
Spooky/Regina
I legitimately don't get where you're coming from.
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "They risk getting doxxed themselves ..."]
Exactly this. They are cruising for a bruising by getting involved. Why the reluctance to document them then?
Psycho
[replying to "Exactly this. They are cruising..."]
I guess my whole philosophy on how to handle that is different from yours is all.
It's like some kid attempting parkour for the first time.
It's dangerous as shit.
I consider it more a safety thing.
And there's a serious risk to talking to Chris.
I guess I just choose not to treat such cases with AS MUCH scorn, especially when it's just people being unfunny retards for a day.
GiBi always debated myself over, TBH.
Since he was involved in a lot of shit,
But it's not directly related to Chris.
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "And there's a serious risk to talking to Chris."]
Yep. Why protect these idiots from themselves? If they were kids, sure. They're independently adults who knew the risk and fucked around and found out.
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "But it's not directly related to Chris."]
Of course it's related to Chris, unless you take an extremely narrow view of it which I guess you do and I don't get why.
Psycho
[replying to "Of course it's related to Chris..."]
It's more like drama that resulted from things related to Chris the more I think about it.
It kind of makes me question what exactly is crucial enough to consider "Christory", TBH.
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "It kind of makes me question what exactly is..."]
Yep. Especially now that there's not gonna be much quality content.
Psycho
[replying to "Yep. Especially now that..."]
Again, the GiBi stuff was more a hindsight thing.
I just initially included it because I didn't take that as seriously.
It's incompetence on my part.
Spooky/Regina
Again if I were in charge I'd make the next project documenting all these people and how they were related to each other and the various scandals and dumbfuckery they got involved inm
Psycho
[replying to "Again if I were in charge I'd..."]
Honestly, the whole site is about a bumbling retard.
The people around him, I feel should be the background these days.
I do feel we might have put too much emphasis on these background retards.
Spooky/Regina
And as far as Devon goes I will not deny I have a bit of a vendetta there because he disrespected me personally and tried to use my name[note 18]
Psycho
As for Fiona, she was a very special case.
I wouldn't have done that for most other people involved.
Spooky/Regina
And now he is talking shit again and if he continues to do so I will go full scorched earth on him because I'm that kind of bitch
Psycho
Her footprint was large.
Spooky/Regina
That personal stuff doesn't belong on the cwcki but the basics of his situation certainly do
Psycho
And she could've gotten her own family in danger from GiBi leaking her phone number.
Spooky/Regina
Fiona is another huge topic
Psycho
I'm just bringing that up because that seems to be part of the concern.
I'm just mentioning how she was initially the exception, and not the rule.
I guess it's just considering how many people are now following Chris, all sorts of drama can occur regarding other people related to Chris.
Spooky/Regina
Fiona
and Heather and Danielle sort of share in common that shit got way the fuck out of hand and they were arguably not to blame
Psycho
[replying to "Fiona
and Heather and..."]
Yeah, pretty much.
Spooky/Regina
Not wanting to name them I kind of understand but don't agree with but let's lay that aside for the moment
Psycho
I can totally understand why the Watchmen stuff would look shady though.
Especially since the page hasn't been updated frequently.
Spooky/Regina
There's zero reason to protect people like Devon or Ellen or MKR
Psycho
[replying to "There's zero reason to..."]
But I also don't think that adding someone's name and OnlyFans helps with that.
Not saying we're right for keeping MKR's stuff.
Just mentioning how this isn't helping with creating the consistency that's needed.
Sean's stuff is also on the website, and he's enemies with MKR.
I'd again chalk this up to incompetence and inconsistency than anything else.
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "I'd again chalk this up..."]
I think this is totally possible but if this is the case the issue is the "appearance of impropriety"
Honestly it is a resignation tier scandal for htl
And he's done absolutely nothing to explain what's going on
Psycho
Yeah, HTL's not very confrontational.
That's not exactly a good look when there's a serious matter like this, where you have to explain yourself.
Spooky/Regina
Yall aren't terribly organized so if the fact that the edits seem to favor a certain group is an accident then there needs to be a serious explanation and/or apology
Psycho
[replying to "Yall aren't terribly organized..."]
I agree with this.
It is pretty sloppy.
Spooky/Regina
But htl sending me a bunch of dirt on mkr as soon as I stared a thread on sean looks unbelievably bas
Psycho
[replying to "But htl sending me..."]
What did he do exaclty?
Psycho
[replying to "Yall aren't terribly organized..."]
But again, Sean's stuff is on the website, along with MKR's, both of them hate each others guts.
I think that basically shows how disorganized things a
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "What did he do exaclty?"]
It's in the big thread I made but basically he sent me some screenshots of mkr freaking out at Chris and tried to use that to make Meghan look like an unreliable source given that it's obvious that some of the stuff was leaked by her
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "But again, Sean's stuff is..."]
Sean (and Bella) were involved in scandals that were too big to ignore even if there was bias. The bias shows up with less well known people although mkr is pretty well known
Psycho
I see.
But in those cases, I would think it's advisable to document the events that surround Chris.
Ellen having awful tastes in music or liking Mountain Dew is kind of irrelevant.
Like yeah, it may discourage her from wanting to do this shit again, but things get cloudy when we talk about "punishing" people.
Spooky/Regina
Well take the discord drama behind the scenes about Naught vs Sean for instance, Chris wasn't there but jts highly relevant because they were the people who were fucking with Chris the most
Psycho
And we don't even know for sure if Chris actually raped Barb.
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "Like yeah, it may discourage..."]
Not really but also all that embarrassing shit is just funny and at the end of the day it's an entertainment site, isn't it?
Psycho
[replying to "Not really but also..."]
Not anymore.
Like, entertainment is a part of it.
But the whole goal is to document Chris.
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "Not anymore."]
Well right there you have a big part of the problem because all the old articles are basically written in the style of ED and the newer ones more seriousb
Psycho
Plus, you have to remember how many new people are learning about Chris.
As you mentioned, older pages glorified trolls.
We can't do stuff like that as much anymore.
Otherwise people start glorifying and villainizing people that talk to Chris, and it becomes a giant shit show.
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "We can't do stuff like that as much anymore."]
Definitely not, in fact you should do the opposite which is basically what I'm advocating
Psycho
[replying to "Definitely not, in fact you..."]
And I agree to that.
I guess I would just approach it a little differently than you would.
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "Otherwise people start glorifying..."]
Not really, I mean if you just take it as a project to get way all up in everyone's shit who's involved then it's consistent, it's interesting, it's funny, and has the very positive side effect of discouraging people from doing dumb shit
Psycho
[replying to "Not really, I mean if you just..."]
Well, everyone hates the Idea Guys's, The Teen Troon Squad's, Bluespike's, and some others guts, and people know damn well what they did, do you think that stopped Bella from wanting to be "the greatest troll".
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "Well, everyone hates the..."]
Bella, no, nor the Watchmen or any of those faggots. But the next Ellen or Dylon? Maybe.
Psycho
[replying to "Bella, no, nor the..."]
They're relatively minor examples, IMO.
I think that's where it gets very cloudy.
Question though, how is concealing info on those particlar people "fawning" them?
I do think the tone on the earlier pages would have to be changed, since that's a concern in itself.
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "I think that's where it gets very cloudy."]
I don't. All of these people wind up being at the very least lol calfs in their own right. And have you seen the Islam guys thread? He's nuts.
Psycho
I mainly just took the parts that I felt weren't relevant to Christory.
Unless they are actually related to the story as a whole, and I'm just retarded.
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "I do think the tone on the..."]
This would be a large project but an important one. Since attitudes towards Chris changed and loads of people who weren't there and don't know the history read that shit it causes big problems. By now it's cliché to say that everyone wants to be the next Clyde Cash
but it's true
A large project, by the way, that I'd help with
Psycho
I didn't even want you to get banned initially, TBH.
TAH ultimately decided on it, because of how you behaved on talk pages.
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "Unless they are actually related..."]
It's a huge part of the story my dude. Even these idiots showing up at 14bc or sending letters are a big part of the story because if nothing else it speaks to how people get involved with Chris which effects Chris and contributes to his overall infamy
Psycho
I think it'd work a whole lot better to find a common ground, rather than try and claim people are responsible for shady shit.
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "TAH ultimately decided on it..."]
I'd be curious to know in particular what be found so offensive because I don't feel like I was being over the top at all. His banning me just looks like damage control at this point
Psycho
That's what I've been saying.
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "I think it'd work a whole..."]
This would be great but htl is too much of a coward
I would love to sit down and hash this all out
Psycho
[replying to "This would be great but..."]
Again, I don't feel he's very confrontational, which I find a problem.
Especially when it comes down to this.
Spooky/Regina
Yep
And I'll keep putting him on blast
Psycho
[replying to "And I'll keep putting him on blast"]
I don't think that'll help.
If he's already scared of you, then he's just going to keep hiding stuff.
Spooky/Regina
I'm not going away any more than I went away for Devon in the 80 days he wasn't doxdd
Even if I get banned from Kiwi lol that'll just escalate things that much more
Go to cwcki dot org btw
Psycho
What about it?
Spooky/Regina
About what?
Psycho
I'm on cwcki.org
Spooky/Regina
Ok
Psycho
I'm asking, what about it?
Spooky/Regina
It's there and can be used to further this discussion if the discussion is not had in a reasonable manner
Psycho
[replying to "I'm not going away any more..."]
I feel that's ultimately what's creating this divide in the first place. Intimidating other users just makes communications much more difficult.
Spooky/Regina
Who am I Intimidating? Dude won't talk to me. Brushes me off like I don't exist. I'm not the type to just shy away. If anything intimidation is getting all kinds of oldfags to come out of the woodwork and give me shit. Or banning me. It didn't work out very well, did it?
Psycho
When you went on the CWCki server the first time, you apparently just barged in saying "we come in peace". People had no idea what your intents were.
Even if you didn't mean to intimidate anyone, you gave off a sort of unnerving aura to some people who barely even knew you.
Spooky/Regina
Basically there's two options, a civil conversation or continued escalation. Believe it or not I dislike conflict. I'm not looking to get into fights with people let alone go scorched earth. I am totally open to a respectful conversation but he seems to think that I'm just some silly girl he can brush off. I'm not.
Psycho
That's fine
I'm aiming for the former here.
Spooky/Regina
Me too
Psycho
We have plenty of disagreements.
Spooky/Regina
Get him to talk to me
If he has discord let's all three talk
Maybe I'll bring someone too
Psycho
I think I should be there with him.
Spooky/Regina
Exactly
We'll each bring someone along, We'll keep it civil
Psycho
I'm just concerned about his well-being considering all that's happened.
He communicated poorly, which led a lot of this,
Spooky/Regina
Who's well being?
Htl's?
Psycho
Yeah.
Spooky/Regina
His well being will definitely not be served by disrespecting me by ignoring me like I'm a nobody
I'm not a nobody
Psycho
What exactly were you doing when you talked to him?
What was the context?
Spooky/Regina
I'm not even talking about Bella related clout. Fuck that. Nobody may know me by the names I go by now but I've been in this shit from the very beginning.
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "What exactly were you doing..."]
If you want I'll show you the full exchange. I posted only partial bits in the thread.
Bottom line he lied to me repeatedly and then blew me off entirely and wrote his statement on the wiki
Him having made his point of view public I followed up by doing the same.
Simple as.
If he wants to de-escalate let's have that meeting between him you me and someone from my team
I promise to be on my best behavior
Psycho
Okay. I don't know what exactly what the beef was about, so to keep things civil, I'm only going to consider what you just told me regarding him not answer you. I'm not sure what his intentions might have been.
Or if he lied.
Spooky/Regina
I have no idea. But my 2 main issues are him trying to manipulate the narrative and him admitting his sock puppet shit to you and lying about it to me
Psycho
[replying to "I have no idea. But my ..."]
Yeah, that's shady as fuck.
Spooky/Regina
I don't take well to deceptions of any kind
Psycho
That needs to be addressed better though.
Spooky/Regina
100%
Psycho
The thread likely wasn't the best course of action in that regard either, looking back.
That's what cause a lot of infighting on the board.
Spooky/Regina
It got the message out. I knew full well it would cause drama.
Spooky/Regina
But yeah, anyway, two options, we keep slapfighting like some petty ass bitches or we talk and de-escalate like grown ass people
Psycho
[replying to "But yeah, anyway, two..."]
Do the latter.
Spooky/Regina
I really would like to talk to him in a civil manner and with friends
Please do what you can to set it up
He'll have you and I'll bring somebody probably discorodeo
Psycho
I don't know about DiscoRodeo.
They barely know him.
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "They barely know him."]
who barely knows him?
Psycho
TAH
Spooky/Regina
yeah i'm just talking about him
Psycho
and other CWCki people.
Spooky/Regina
but yeah ok
ok
bring 4centuser
he won't be a capo for me or anything but i am fine with it
he seems neutral and calm
Psycho
By extension, don't threaten to dox people afterwards. That's likely part of the problem.
Spooky/Regina
I can commit to not doxing anyone involved in the conversation
My word on that to God.
About three hours after this whole exchange, Spooky asks me if Hurtful would like to engage with her. I asked Hurtful about this, but I don't recall what exactly I said to him.
Spooky/Regina
So any word?
Psycho
Did[n't] get anything from him yet.
Spooky/Regina
Ok cool
I'm hopeful that we can do this
I'm fine smacking someone like gibi around all day but I wasn't lying when I said it hurts my heart to go after legitimate kiwis
Psycho
[replying to "I'm fine smacking someone..."]
I had no idea you felt that way, TBH.
Spooky/Regina
Says so in the original post
Regarding Skunt
31 October 2021
“
Skunt_TV, Z-list streamer, owner of the CWCki Discord and potential lolcow candidate himself, joined the CWCIslam server to tell Michael that his gayop was a terrible fucking idea and he shouldn't go through with it, which is something akin to being dragged to an intervention by a barfly.
”
Directly from Spooky's thread.[23]
“
but i guess skunt is pissed off about his portrayal in the OP
don't blame him
”
Spooky being a cunt.
Earlier that day Skunt_TV, who at the time was the person who replaced Anaxis as the admin of the CWCki server after he left, informed me about how he was being misrepresented in Spooky's thread on Michael Afghani. Right after I confronted Spooky about her demands for the CWCki and its supposed lack of integrity, I then confronted her about her lack of transparency on her thread, as I felt this was the perfect opportunity to point this out.
In the thread, she talked about Skunt_TV being in Michael's Lunar Module Discord server. She painted Skunt as being an active member of the group, despite him only being there to try and ward Michael away from the CWCki server, and warn him about reaching out to Chris. She also left out the fact that Skunt notified her that he'd join the server before doing so.
Right after I told her about this, she lies to me saying that Skunt never talked to her about CWCIslam. I respond to this by bringing up a screenshot of a chat from Skunt, which I asked him to send me in case she pulls this kind of shit. Right after this, my fears were completely justified, and Spooky pretends to have forgotten about the exchange she had with Skunt. Although I tried to stay friendly with Spooky, I also pointed out her blatant hypocrisy, telling her that she herself was obligated to be transparent if she was going to accuse the CWCki of not being so. Spooky tries to excuse this by stating that MKRNightVee told her about this first, because of fucking course she did, and shows no seeming remorse for Skunt being upset about being portrayed the way he was in the thread.
Psycho
I was told that you talked to Skunt about CWCIslam.
Spooky/Regina
by?
Psycho
Skunt.
Spooky/Regina
well, that's interesting because I didn't lol
V
Psycho
Spooky/Regina
that's my discord with skunt, nothing between 9/18 and today
oh wait
oohhhhhh
way back ok
i don't remember that but ok
Psycho
Don't take anything I'm doing the wrong way. I really want to gain mutual trust here.
Spooky/Regina
yeah I said no becasue i thought you meant, like, recently, and i honestly don't really remember having that conversation
but yeah now i do vaguely
i don't think anything of any real substance was said at that point
let me look mysel
yeah there wasn't much there although he had the picture of them mostly right
although i wouldn't call michael transphobic given that his server is full of trannies lol
but yeah by that point he had had the interactions that he did with them that are documented in my op
why do you ask though?
Psycho
I feel if we're so concerned about transparency, I think we should be transparent that you were initially told by him about this.
Spooky/Regina
if you want to be technical i was initially told this by I think MKR
as you'll note in the transcript I say i was aware
i can check my notes
or try
but i guess skunt is pissed off about his portrayal in the OP
don't blame him
Psycho
Which thread is this BTW?
Spooky/Regina
https://kiwifarms.ru/threads/michael-bijan-afghani-samantha-afghani-cwcislam-coupon11.104027/
(which is an excellent example of the way I think these people should be dealt with.)
Julaypedia
“
a lot of people are interested in these folks that julaypedia would document and the cwcki wants to maintain focus on Chris and mention them incidentally, so really, the two wikis would benefit one another
and create peace and harmony and we can walk off into the sunset 😌
”
Spooky "advocating" for harmony with the CWCki and Burn Book.
2 November 2021
By this point, I began engaging with Spooky less than before, seeing them for who she truly was. What she did next after our long-winded exchange regarding the handling of the CWCki would be the final nail in the coffin for me.
Spooky, telling literally nobody else on the CWCki team or even Kiwi Farms about this, came up to me to propose a way to make "everyone happy". She proposed creating a splinter site of the CWCki whose sole focus is on the Chris orbiters that Burn Book spent a lot of their time and energy observing. The promise from this was that all of the stuff about Chris orbiters that Spooky and their crew wanted to document on the CWCki would go onto this splinter wiki, which she called the "Julaypedia", and have me agree to a partnership between both sites.
She asked me if I'd like to contribute, despite literally putting me on the same boat as Hurtful when I didn't give into their demands not too long ago. Despite claiming their goal was to create "peace and harmony", I'm far more convinced she created the site out of some sort of spite towards the CWCki judging by some of their posts on Kiwi Farms the days following this conversation, where she says the CWCki was "rotten to its core".[24][25] As you will see later, I rejected this proposal, which is precisely why you've never heard of this website until now.
A link to an archive of the site can be found here.
Also a bit of trivia: Though I backed away from the Julypedia project, I'd be lying if I said I didn't take inspiration from some of Spooky's ideas. As flawed as their philosophy regarding the documentation of Chris and his orbiters may have been, that of obsessively digging every nook and cranny for their personal information to plaster all over the site and stretching the truth because it's "funny", I still think parts of it held water. As you will see in this chat, I also thought the idea of a wiki about Chris orbiters could be useful to some degree, since some people were interested in them as they were in Chris. I also didn't want to reject everything the Julypedia had to offer solely because Spooky, who by this point proved to me she's nothing but a narcissistic, pot-stirring cunt, was running it like how Spooky rejected the CWCki as a corrupt "institution" for what she perceived out of Hurtful.
For example, the Julaypedia; when it was still active; had a template which users could put on its pages to mark people as "unreliable sources".[26] This was actually where I got the idea for the Unreliable template here, as the CWCki didn't have such a template prior to that, but most certainly should have. It was also partially the inspiration for the Gossip page and Misinfo template you see here, as both of those built off of the Unreliable template. I also somewhat agreed with the idea that some people in the thread proposed of me advising over Hurtful, something that Hurtful would appoint both me and Larry of later down the line.[27] I would even go as far as say that my encounters with Spooky at this point is what inspired me, and pretty much the rest of the site, to evolve towards a much more neutral tone, as I'd begin overhauling some of the older pages, such as the one on Clyde Cash, in the months that followed to be more transparent about the troll.[28]
Spooky/Regina
I have a proposal for deescalation that I think has the potential to make everyone happy and also not lose face.
Psycho
Okay, what is it?
Spooky/Regina
Well, the issues all relate to documentation of weens and people who fuck with Chris in general.
Move these to a different entity than the CWCki with different standards and not controlled by the same people. Details to be hashed out, I have some ideas.
Psycho
I guess I'm up to that.
I won't personally contribute to it, but sure.
Spooky/Regina
Not to include classic era trolls they stay in the cwcki, we have some standard to define who belongs where even as simple as after a certain date
The cwcki would link to julaypedia (as I'm tentatively calling it) when these people are discussed, julaypedia would link to cwcki for all Chris content
I'll kill all the drama and hand over cwcki.org
Psycho
At that point, just make a different wiki for lolcows in general.
Spooky/Regina
A few other points to be discussed etc
Psycho
I've seen you did some kind of "Burn Book" wiki.
Spooky/Regina
Yea that's for working on OPs at this point
I dunno if I'm up for a lolcow wiki more broadly at this juncture, I don't want lawsuits and ddos and shit at this point in my life
But yeah. JULAYpedia.
Psycho
I'll think about that.
Spooky/Regina
How do you think it will go over with htl?
I'll write up a few bullet points to define things more specifically
[pause]
Half an hour later, Spooky give me a list of bullet points for what their vision of this wiki would be. This is where things truly became worrisome for me. Some of the things that Spooky proposed is not allowing "people of interest" such as Hurtful Truth Level and Marvin to work on the splinter, and only allowing people from the Kiwi Farms to contribute if they are in "good standing". As I have demonstrated, when it comes to being in "good standing" with Spooky, this more or less means that you suck up to them and never ever deviate too much from their agenda. Even so much as suggesting that A-logging people like GiBi (in Spooky's mind "protecting them") isn't ideal is enough to get you in hot water with her.
Seeing how Spooky has already been banned from the CWCki for their relentlessness, questioning the integrity of the CWCki on multiple ocassions, and now going after the "Trustworthy People" she gathered less than a month ago, now acussing them of being in on the conspiracy,[29] I just knew this "partnership" that she was proposing to me was nothing more than a facade for Spooky to get their hands on the CWCki one last time. She even had the nerve to mock me for my expressed desire to reduce any of the drama that I've caused from leaking the DMs by going into this patronizing hippie-talk about "walking into the sunset".
Spooky/Regina
ok here goes
this is not a set of demands, mind you, it's a briefly sketched proposal of an idea
i'd like to hear from you and others your thoughts on the matter
Proposal for Julaypedia.
This is a proposal and not a set of demands. Comments
and additional suggestions are welcome.
As the CWCki is focused speciically on content related to CWC, Julaypedia will be created to focus on people who interact with him in foolish or problematic ways.
Articles on all such people will be on the Julaypedia, not the CWCki.
Classic era trolls and the like will remain on the CWCki.
Any person, group, member of such a group, or people significantly involved with the same, are eligible for inclusion on the Julaypedia.
Domain name 'cwcki.org' will be pointed to nameservers requested by CWCki admin team and after a year will be handed over entirely.
Staff of both wikis will refrain from disparaging one another in public and will endorse each other as a reliable source on their respective topics. Statements to this effect will be made on Wiki pages and on the Kiwi Farms.
Any CWCki editor other than Marvin, HTL, and Anaxis (or any other person found to be involved with Julaypedia's persons of interest) will automatically be permitted to edit the Julaypedia as will any member in good standing of the Kiwi Farms.
A person from the CWCki acceptable to both parties will be given administrative permissions on the Julaypedia. Suggestions - PsychoNerd or 4centuser.
Julaypedia will be given a CWCki account for the sole purpose of making links to Julaypedia.
Spooky Bones' derogatory comments on CWCki talk pages will be removed entirely or followed up by statements that the situation is resolved and that the CWCki is a reliable source. Similar statements will be made on the Kiwi Farms.
The CWCki will (a) link any mention of such individuals to the Julaypedia; (b) mention any person included on the Julaypedia in the relevant timeline article and (c) maintain a list of all persons included in the Julaypedia in a central article with a very brief (one sentence or so) explanation of who they are.
These links will, on a basis to be determined, be based either on people's Internet handles or real names, but on a consistent basis.
The Julaypedia will link to and rely upon the CWCki for explanation of any and all Chris-related content that does not specifically relate to Julaypedia persons of interest.
All person who interact with Chris after January 1, 2020 are automatically the provenance of the Julaypedia, not the CWCki.
All "classic era" trolls are automatically the provenance of the CWCki and discussion of them on the Julaypedia is to be limited to a link to the CWCki.
No mention will be made on the Julaypedia of any person who is a CWCki editor and was only tangentially connected to Julaypedia persons of interest e.g. by being a member of the discord. HTL and Marvin are explicitly off limits. Anaxis is explicitly on the menu.
No attempts will be made to dox or attack any CWCki editors or participants with the same exceptions.
CWCki and Julaypedia staff will be accessible to one another for discussions. These discussions will always be conducted in a respectful and confidential manner and without personal attacks.
Spooky/Regina
ilj would be a topic for discussion perhaps
she could have her own wiki lol
(not seriously suggesting that)
although we contemplated it at one point
Psycho
Good
ILJ really doesn't have much
to warrant her own wiki.
Spooky/Regina
she is boring tbh
a horrible person
but not very interesting all told
all the hampster-boiling and tranny-baiting in the world won't change that, really
but anyway
what do you think?
Psycho
About Julaypedia?
Spooky/Regina
yea
Psycho
I'll have to look over all of this.
Spooky/Regina
its just an outline of how we might relate one site to another in a way that is sensible and mutually respectful
it's a win/win imo
relieves the cwcki of having to deal with a lot of questions that pop up around these people
and, in a way in which nobody loses face, questions about reliability are dealt with
a lot of people are interested in these folks that julaypedia would document and the cwcki wants to maintain focus on Chris and mention them incidentally, so really, the two wikis would benefit one another
and create peace and harmony and we can walk off into the sunset 😌
but yeah, some of the specifics I'd say we can talk about, i'm making a set of proposals for how to best put things together but i'd love opinions
Psycho
I think there used to be a lolcow wiki.
Spooky/Regina
yeah there did
Psycho
Not sure where that went
Spooky/Regina
im not sure exactly what happened to it either
i don't want to do that, too much drama
but the chris-related idiots, yes
4 November 2021
Two days after the proposal, Spooky goes up to me again about it due to me not giving my opinions on the project. Knowing full well I'd probably get the same treatment as Hurtful or any of the other CWCki users that she targeted if I didn't cooperate with them, I decided to engage again.
Spooky/Regina
So I guess this is a no-go? Not even any comments?
Psycho
Just a little conflicted about the idea
Like, I think we can do this kind of thing
Spooky/Regina
what specifically?
like I said, I'm not making a hard list of demands here, I want to discuss
Psycho
Thanks for that
I suppose we can have an extension wiki for post merge shit
Since that's also getting steam in itself
Spooky/Regina
that is a good idea
most of the post-merge stuff by definition involves people i'd consider relevant to the julaypedia
Psycho
It's just that you brought up the concern of drama
Spooky/Regina
well, that was in reference to the idea of making a broader lolcow wiki
Psycho
I guess I just needed time to think it over
Spooky/Regina
that results in getting ddosed and sued by random people and shit like that, just look at josh
Psycho
Plus all the drama is giving me a headache
Spooky/Regina
a focused one is not gonna have that and if there is then it can be dealt with easier
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "Plus all the drama is giving me a headache"]
you and me both[note 19]
Concerns Towards Spooky
“
but you are respectful and that is key
your "boss" so to speak is very much not
”
Spooky perfectly summarizing their views on the dynamics between me, Hurtful and themselves.
4 November 2021
After the talk about Julaypedia, despite any negative feelings I might have felt towards Spooky by then, I began expressing concern towards them. Most people, including myself, believed that Spooky was actually a cis woman that had a family and kids. Spooky kept up this persona in much of their Kiwi Farms posts. In this part of the conversation, Spooky claims that she wasn't aware of how much of the drama would blow up, despite telling me that she knew that the thread on Hurtful was going to cause drama, and citing it as necessary to get the message out.
Psycho
Are you feeling okay?
I'm honestly kinda concerned about your standing myself
Spooky/Regina
how so?
Psycho
Like, you're in the drama yourself
And you have a life outside of it.
Spooky/Regina
yeah, since the merge i've been way too involved in internet stuff
but lately way less than I was
I'm not glued to the computer like that
Psycho
Good to hear
Spooky/Regina
but for the first solid month it was all but 24/7
Psycho
I really hope you can spend time with your family
Spooky/Regina
and thanks for that
yeah, it's important
and ngl the initial stuff did put something of a strain on
especially since I had no idea how shit was gonna blow up
Psycho
Me neither.
I hold no hard feelings towards anyone in this, though.
Spooky/Regina
but, like you, I'm interested in documentation
just of slightly different subjects
Spooky/Regina
[replying to "I hold no hard feelings towards..."]
I mean, I don't really, because it's just the fucking Internet, but I won't lie, several people have really ticked me off
By this point, I express feeling sorry for any confusion I've caused, feeling I somehow might have been at fault for how Spooky wound up becoming. I also express how stressful it's been to be on good terms with both the CWCki and Burn Book.
Psycho
I bet I have to some extent.
I'm sorry if I did
Spooky/Regina
not especially, no
if anything I'm confused as you seem to go back and forth and change your mind on things
but you are respectful and that is key
your "boss" so to speak is very much not
Psycho
I guess it's just that I'm jumping back and forth constantly between CWCki, Kiwi Farms, and you guys.
It's all over the place.
Spooky/Regina
which is why I have a teensy bit of a problem with him
but yeah, there are different standards at play in different groups, that makes sense, it's only natural
but like, your opinions on doxing seem to change depending on who you're talking to(?) it's odd
Psycho
[replying to "but like, your opinions..."]
I'm not even sure what I think about doxxing anymore.
Spooky/Regina
if your opinion is evolving that's one thing, if you say different things in different places that's kinda bad
but yeah, doxing in general, idk
it's a bit over the top maybe to dox some random person for, say, watching furry porn
but everyone that we talk about has essentially asked for it so i don't see a problem
Psycho
[replying to "if your opinion is evolving..."]
I understand that.
I feel I may have looked kind of unreliable for doing that kind of thing.
Spooky/Regina
yea
like you're in an edit page saying MKR's birthday can stay, you're in Discord logs expressing ambivalence about Devon and even Sean's doxing, you've said sort of a variety of things to me when we talk
it's hard to follow
and if your opinion is evolving maybe you should kind of preface stuff by saying that
nothing wrong with an evolving opinion but inconsistency isn't a great look
Psycho
Thanks for that.
It helps dearly that you're letting me know of this.
Spooky/Regina
can I ask roughly how old you are?
or basically like are you young or no lol
Psycho
I'm in my early 20s.
Spooky/Regina
ok you're young, yeah
Psycho
Why do you ask?
Spooky/Regina
just because being young it makes even more sense your opinions on stuff evolve
and something like doxing, it's thrown around lightly on kf, but yes, it is a serious matter worth thinking about
and there's nothing wrong with that
Resting Period
“
just showing off tbh 😉
”
Spooky not even hiding it anymore.
5 November 2021
After all that's happened by this point, I decided to take a short break from the Kiwi Farms and the CWCki, though I still talked to Hurtful. When Spooky showed me the front page of Julaypedia, I told them this. Despite this, she once again tried to show me how "arrogant" Hurtful was through another Kiwi Farms post that called them out, despite declaring she's "not a nobody" to me not too long ago.
Spooky/Regina
Psycho
Cool.
I may need to lay down for a bit, though.
Forgot to tell you this.
Spooky/Regina
cool np
just showing off tbh 😉
enjoy your rest
Psycho
I've heard things from so many people, I don't think I can fully comprehend it.
Spooky/Regina
what things?
Psycho
Bellagate.
Spooky/Regina
oh, just in general
Psycho
Like what happened when
and who did what.
Spooky/Regina
yeah shit is crazy
a lot of the lore is barely written down
just in threads or worse discord logs
i mean fortunately it's all available
but telling a coherent story from beginning to end is quite a task
Spooky/Regina
https://kiwifarms.ru/threads/updating-the-cwcki.50150/post-10384407
fyi
the fucking arrogance of this man
Julaypedia Rejection
7 November 2021
In one of the last interactions I've had with Spooky, she notifies me that she views Hurtful's recent activity as an indication that the CWCki and Julaypedia will not be on friendly terms. Afterwards, she seems to give me the same treatment on this topic as she would with Hurtful, and demand I tell them if I want to work on the new wiki or not. I politely decline, again knowing that ignoring Spooky or calling them out at this stage wouldn't work in my favor.
Spooky/Regina
Lol so I'm taking htl's recent activity as saying that the two wiki will not be on friendly terms. That is a shame.
About 4 hours later, she posts this.
Spooky/Regina
Anyway, I'm not really interested in waiting any longer. I'll give the rest of today to hear a response as to whether you want to work together or if my project will be a straight up splinter. Once more for the record I have no problem with you personally.
Psycho
I personally have no interest in contributing to that.
All things considered.
Spooky/Regina
That's fine. Thanks for being frank.
I wish you well always.
Psycho
My problem has just been me being pulled around left and right.
I have no idea who is reliable at this point.
Spooky/Regina
Yeah I can see that just from the stuff you say. And sympathize. It is hard to find out who is solid and who isn't.
I'd just ask you to consider this: my agenda inasmuch as I have one is obvious from the shit I do. HTL and friends are blatantly hiding stuff and making their true agenda unclear.
Beating a Dead Hedgehog
“
We had about a week-long conversation towards the beginning of September about not these caps per se but the same general situation. In this conversation he bullshitted me around regarding his sock-editing the Wiki among other things and generally proved to be dishonest and unreliable, also sending me dirt on MKR to try to get me off Sean (who's thread was just starting to rock-n-roll at the time) and materials meant to make Sean look better (they didn't and nor was the MKR stuff relevant) and eventually stopped replying to me (when he realized he was caught out socking and tried to explain himself to @PsychoNerd054 who in turn leaked those conversations) ... it's all in the other thread. More recently, as in even today, I've repeatedly tried, through intermediaries, to speak to him about my concerns. He's ignored me.
”
Spooky on their reasoning for harassing Hurtful.[30]
“
Can you blame him?
”
Another Kiwi replying to how Hurtful was ignoring Spooky.
“
Well, it's one strategy. We'll see how it works I guess.
”
Spooky's reply
7 November 2021
Spooky sends me two screencaps of DMs involving Hurtful, which she also posted on Kiwi Farms to yet again try to "expose" him, likely in an attempt to try and reopen old wounds. This time, Spooky was trying to "expose" Hurtful for leaking messages from The Place for clout. She did this replying to Hurtful leaking messages surrounding Chris's trip to Pennsylvania.
By this point, I think I've finally had enough of Spooky's shit, and I quite plainly call them out for trying to respark any past vitriol I've felt towards Hurtful. The fact she proceeded to do this even after I showed them mercy in spite off all she'd done, something she (and I for a time) refused to do with Hurtful, also didn't help with this one bit. Here, I cite them giving me the screencaps as them pulling a "trust me bro" on me. Spooky tries to defend themselves afterwards, posting another out of context screencap, but I refused to entertain them at this point, and I stopped replying to their messages altogether. This seems to have been made significantly easier when Null outright tells them: "You're such a faggot. Ask someone who isn't from the forum to read your posts without telling them it's you and see how they will recoil from the cringe and declare you a faggot."[31]
Spooky/Regina
deleted is sean
and that's called a smoking gun i believe
two of them
i just posted the first one, the second i'm waiting a bit with (there's a few more caps from that convo too)
Psycho
How do you know that's Sean?
I think you're pulling at "trust me bro"
by just posting this without verification.
Just saying.
I'm not saying it isn't.
Spooky/Regina
well, given that I have this, my source was obviously there, and thus can verify it's Sean, but more to the point I have him shilling his wct
videos in the same conversation
it's him
Notes and References
Notes
↑ Note that while that this does not mean that every member in Burn Book had the exact same views as Spooky, Spooky was still a major influence on the ideas and beliefs of those in the server, Kiwi Farms, and whereever else Chris-related drama occured.
↑ Hurtful took me saying no one was mad at him to mean I was only talking about the people on the CWCki. What I meant was that nobody, including the people on the Kiwi Farms and Burn Book, were mad at him.
↑ I wanted to reach out to HTL via DM, but was unable to because he disabled conversations. Looking back on it now...that was definitely a good call on his part.
↑ From what I could find in the Burn Book logs, this seems to be referring to a channel involving Spooky interviewing Klop
↑ I once again think this is referring to the now deleted "Post-Merge Saga" page, where GiBi had a section.
↑ When Spooky said this, this should have been my first clue that they had ulterior motives.
↑ "Taylor" was one of the primary members of the Mean Girls. They were "Taylor Swift's Ghostwrite" on Kiwi Farms.
↑ This is likely in reference to a CWCki server user named "Dr. Retard", who was investigated by Burn Book.
↑ Oh, now I ask this?
↑ As I discuss in Blind Observers, Fiona being autistic doesn't mean shit. Nothing about her implies that she's mentally disabled as many people assumed of her.
↑ This appears to be short for "No shit is too minor", which Spooky often spun to mean that practically anything about Chris orbiters that they wanted could go on the wiki.
↑ This is in reference to a member of his Discord server swatting DawnDusk. GiBi was acussed of being responsible for this by many people due to guilt by association. GiBi was also acussed of grooming minors due to various users in the server, some of which were underaged, making edgy posts.
↑ My stance on Fiona's AMA is relatively unchanged, not deeming it as big a deal as many people did, but it's more because she said herself she did the AMA to help with the editing process on the CWCki.
↑ She didn't actually do this, I was thinking about a Reddit account she had, SumimasenItsMe, before she even got involved with Chris.
↑ The name I'm censoring here is someone who got involved in Burn Book at some point early on in its existence. The full extent to which they were involved, I have no clue. I'm therefore censoring them out of courtesy.
↑ I use EDT time, the block appears to have happened on the 27th because of the site using GMT time
↑ Anaxis is actually a dude. Spooky seemed to think she was female because of how Anaxis played the Lainchu character, which was female.
↑ This could be my bias speaking to me, but I take this to mean that the attacks on GiBi were never about Fiona. She was merely a prop for the mob mentality surrouding him. It was all because GiBi refused to acknowledge Spooky. They were doing this same thing to Hurtful, even comparing the both of them, which makes me more convinced this was the case. The fact Fiona was infantilized and dehumanized on such a wide scale, and reduced to a means to justify targeting other people in this manner sickens me.
↑ This was a common manipulation tactic from Spooky, something akin to gaslighting. They'd pretend to be sympathetic towards people's sentiments about the drama surrounding the ILJ subforum. They'd also do this same thing by giving positive ratings to posts that called them out or commented on how petty the drama was starting to get. Despite this, they'd still encourage in-fighting amongst users and claim to have all of the answers surrounding ILJ and co.
