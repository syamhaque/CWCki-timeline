Chris[1]
Finland (Finnish: Suomi) is a northern European country which borders Russia, Norway and Sweden. Chris has traveled to the country on at least five occasions since 2024, making it the only place outside the United States which he is known to have visited (not counting interdimensional excursions). On the first four trips, he was spotted with Flutter at shopping centers in the capital city of Helsinki. On the fifth trip, he was spotted shopping with Flutter at a market in Rauma.

Background
Chris's first encounter with Finland was in Mailbag 13, where a fan wrote in under the name "Erik Pikkuvikainen" (a parody of Finnish school shooter Pekka-Eric Auvinen.)
In October 2023, Chris joined the language-learning app Duolingo, where he focused heavily on learning Finnish.
Chris is seemingly eager to mention his using Duolingo,[2][3][4] but does not like to specify which language he is learning.[5] In a YouTube livestream on 17 February 2024, when asked if he was learning Finnish currently and why, Chris replied with "I don't know what you're talking about. What're you talking about, guy?"[6]
Many observers have theorized that Flutter may be Finnish or Finnish-American; she and Chris were first seen in public together in September 2023, a month before Chris began studying Finnish on Duolingo. Additionally, Flutter was observed in December 2023 flying from Charlotte Douglas International Airport to Richmond International Airport, where she was picked up by Chris. Charlotte Douglas is a major airline hub with service to Helsinki, which lends credence to the hypothesis that she lives in Finland when not visiting Chris.
To date, Chris has remained secretive about his interest in Finland and Finnish, although he did film himself singing two songs in Finnish (Silakka Apajalla and Sakkijarven Polkka) as part of his AI Chris Chan Vs Christ Chan series. While the series features Chris attempting to sing songs in multiple foreign languages, most of which he has never studied in Duolingo, Finnish is notably the only language he has attempted more than once.
In a May 2025 call with a ween, Chris outright denied both traveling to Finland and studying the language on Duolingo, despite the photographic evidence.[7]
In July 2025, a Reddit user spotted Chris with Flutter shopping at a market in Rauma, Finland, and reported that he was "talking to a cashier at the booth, clumsily trying to speak finnish but then asked for english."[8] Rauma is located approximately 255 kilometers (or 160 miles) from Helsinki, a major population center, and is also not a very notable town, having only about 30,000 residents. This makes Chris's presence there a mystery.
Trips to Finland
First Trip (Spring 2024)
In April 2024, Chris and Flutter were spotted and briefly filmed shopping at Kauppakeskus Arabia (AKA Arabia Shopping Centre) in Helsinki, although this sighting was not made public until October 2024 as the individual who spotted them was not certain that it was them. The individual stated that Chris was speaking English in the store rather than Finnish.[9]
A photo taken in April 2024 of Chris and Flutter at the Mall of Tripla in Helsinki would be made public in November 2024.[10]
On 30 April 2024, Chris and Flutter were unwittingly recorded attending the opening day of Linnanmäki (an amusement park in Helsinki) in the background of a random YouTube user's video.[11] Over a year later in June 2025, Chris accidentally partially revealed a picture of himself at the amusement park,[12] which lead to the previously mentioned footage being found.
Chris was subsequently spotted at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport on 24 May 2024,[13] wearing the same coat. Dallas Fort Worth is another major airline hub with direct flights to Helsinki, so it is likely that Chris had a layover there on his way back to Virginia.
Second Trip (Fall 2024)
On 27 September 2024, Chris was seen in Helsinki by a store employee who leaked a cropped still from the security camera to a co-worker who then posted it to the Internet.[14] Locals believe the sighting was at the Mall of Tripla, in a store called Normal.[15] The following day, Chris and Flutter were spotted walking at the Mall of Tripla, by an observer who took a brief video clip.[16] In both sightings, Chris is wearing a bright blue Superdry sweatshirt with the hood up.
A user on the Finnish imageboard ylilauta alleged having seen Chris at the Linnanmaki amusement park at some point in the summer.[17]
Chris was seen back in the United States on 1 November 2024 when he was spotted at a Wendy's in Lynchburg.[18]
Third Trip (Winter 2024)
On 17 December 2024, Chris and Flutter were seen at Redi in Kalasatama, Helsinki, Finland.[19]
Chris was not seen again after this (in any country) until 14 February 2025, when he was spotted at a pet shop in Lynchburg.
Fourth Trip (Spring 2025)
On the night of 29 March 2025, Chris would be confirmed in the US for the last time as he had livestreamed from his home.[20] On 4 April 2025, a user on Kiwi Farms posted a photograph and details about spotting Chris on Wednesday, 2 April.[21] He was seen at the Mall of Tripla. On 17 April, Chris and Flutter were photographed eating at coffee shop Arnold's.[22] On 10 May, Chris would be confirmed to be back in the US as he had attended the Festival of Light in Lynchburg, Virginia.[23]
Fifth Trip (Summer 2025)
On 23 July 2025, Chris and Flutter were spotted in Rauma, Finland.[24] This is notable for marking the first time Chris had been known to attempt to speak Finnish in public, and the first time he had been known to go outside of Helsinki.
Chris would be confirmed back in America on 13 August 2025, as him and Flutter were spotted and recorded at a Walmart in Lynchburg.[25] However, they were also allegedly spotted by a Twitter user at a Walmart in Lynchburg almost two weeks prior on August 1.[26][27][28]
