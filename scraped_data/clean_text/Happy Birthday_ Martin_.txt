Happy Birthday, Martin. is a video uploaded by Chris on 5 April 2016. A fan paid Chris $50 to make a minute-long video wishing "Martin" a happy birthday. Chris accomplishes this by inanely singing and dancing in an appallingly filthy muumuu.
It should be noted that Chris is starting to look uncannily like an old lady - his messy and receding hair along with his long, blue blouse make him look anything but in his 30's.
