================================================================================

On 25 June 2022, Chris sent a fourth letter from jail to Helena Fiorenza. As with the previous letter Chris sent to Helena, Eels and the Eggman received this letter and chose not to release it verbatim; only a summary was provided. According to the summary, Chris believes that the jail staff has been tampering with his letters and requests that future letters be sent to 14 Branchland Court; he is certain that he will return home soon. Chris also mentions that he roleplayed as his father in his Robertchu form.
Eels' Summary
So Chris writes to Helena and I (really just to her) about his usual "I'M JESUS!!!!!" bullshit. But there are a few interesting points
a.) He asks that letters be sent to "the sonichu temple" at branchland court. He is
SOOOOOOOOO certain he's going home within a manner of days/weeks. Claims that his "soul
is home but not his body"
b.) Chris expresses' paranoia that prison guards are messing with his letters and tampering with
his mail. He also doesn't want me Helena and others to potentially waste time/money/energy
with letters being returned to us (since he believes by the time any other letters get sent to him
(fyi usually takes me about 2 weeks to get a letter to chris and get a letter back, possibly out in 2
weeks?)
c.) mentions new lore about something called "neo lives" (i'm assuming this is our perfect selves
after the dimensional merge)
d.) tries to introduce Helena to someone called "Val." they have some kind of connection to magi
chan- Helena thinks Val is Val Valentino, formerly of the watchmen
e.) Chris cosplays as his father "robertchu" and speaks about Val and Caden should meet
Helena and collaborate son some sort of project, with a bunch of motivational "your a winner!"
"believe in yourself and your powers bs" and also includes a drawing of his father “the internet
lumberjack” young, as a sonichu with a third eye vouching for val.
Helena's Tweets
In response to the summary above, Helena responds with the following, revealing that Chris has shown her his depiction of Val Valentino.
It is Val! He says it himself in the drawing. Has two tails and new markings and talks to me like I know him (drawn the oc before)
