On Autism
2 September
4:02 PM
I had a conscious realization about Autism.
As mentioned in The Basics on Transmutate, lack of ability to easily recognize emotions, feelings and social cues are parts of autism.
But being a rarity among them, myself, we can still feel and can recognize.
But it is within this limitation we on the spectrum are not as prone to surface level stipulations that neurotypicals and others are prone to, so inately we are able to see the bigger metaphysical picture and be sensitive to the various energies and aura.
It is from this that regardless of functionality levels, we are capable to understand and work on deeper levels than most anyone.
And among us are those in the 0.1% with the mind and energy that is overpowered.
And having recognized myself as the One Avatar of all Existence, the number on the spectrum are able to recognize themselves as similar and do good and great things for everyone and themselves.
We on the spectrum are not to be recognized as victims, but as conduits for something truly amazing and should be kindly encouraged and guided.
I am guiding myself better now after years of experience, Soul Searching, and vast explorstions.
You can follow the good examples I have made and learn from the mistakes with those online I had made.
You don't have to be victims of bullies and you all are strong in your own respective rights and abilities.
My fellow autistic individuals, how will You guide yourselves and do good on Light Power and what is right with the Dimensionally Merging Universe, right here, and beyond on this Earth?
Because I am manifesting for the better.

ADD
3 September
12:37 PM
[Replying to an earlier tweet]
I will add a mention of one downside that can be mastered when it comes to Autism; this may or may not apply to everyone on the spectrum: The Attention Deficit Disorder.
The focusing is still important.
But as the person in this gif said, we still do see in multiple dimensions despite the attention shift.

Blue Max

Floppy Deep Dive
🕹️ Floppy & Cassette of the Day: Today’s classic pick is Blue Max on the Commodore 64, released in 1983! This game had us flying high with intense WWI air combat action. One of my favorites! Have you ever seen the box before?

Chris Last edited 11:21 PM
I have just watched the trailer for #MinecraftMovie; I feel like some content so far has merit, but #JackBlack as Steve?
What?
They couldn't get #ChrisPratt?
And realistic teeth on the animals, I concur, is a bit much.
AI generated art comparisons for background aside, at least the integration into the blocky universe is decent.
And What about Alex?
Why is she not in this movie?
It would be better with Alex and Steve together in this movie.
I feel they should postpone the movie launch by a year and give it further considerations, edits and a bit of terraforming.

Also, for real, I do feel #MinecraftMovie would be better with #ChrisPratt as Steve.
After being Emmet in #TheLegoMovie, it really is a perfectly built fit.

Making progress on Book #0 HD.
Let's just say life has been going good for me, and I am more focused now.
For the record, and Update the Freaking CWCki on this: the Pokémon Professor of Cwcville is not Cole Smithey; his name is Professor Pine.
And the Pokémon Professor of Stanardsville, VA where Kel started her adventure from, his name is Professor Dyllin Spruce.
Sorry, Tricky, but now you know.

Friday the 13th
12 September
7:16 PM
I just remembered tomorrow is another Friday the 13th; I, personally, despite popular feeling, hardly ever had an unlucky day on any Friday the 13th.
It was normal like most others.
On that, the number 13 is not an unlocked number when you look at it in #Numerology.
1 [plus] 3 [equals] 4, which Four is a good and Holy number.
Look it up and take what you will in good blessing count of it.

VHS tape revisiting
14 September
1:04 PM
I've recently revisited two of my favourite VHS tapes with the animation block that aired in around '86 on WDCA, DC 20, "Your Superstation.
20 looks good to me.". A few programs that were advertised almost #FilmationGhostbusters, #Smurfs, #Jetsons and @Transformers I actually never got to watch, because live action didn't interest me that much way back then.
But I feel a bit reminded having missed #DukesOfHazard, #TheMonkees, and in particular #PrivateBenjamin.
I searched online, and all I could find of Private Benjamin was the 1980 movie; I'd like to watch the TV series; it lasted three seasons.
Also, #FilmationGhostbusters; WHY has that not been updated for modern times, at least catching up with Jake Kong and Eddie Spencer (Eddie was voiced by
@PeterCullin
)?
I Would love to see that.

Hey @Hasbro, I know you are wanting to reinvigorate your g4 brand in the US.
Give us promotions and new merch too! I think you’ll be surprised at the response.

Trim down receipt paper

Zez Retro
The Game Boy Printer works with modern receipt thermal paper. This roll was 60c from local office supply
It is hard to find the correct width so I had to cut the paper. A manual process but for the price I am good
All new old stock Nintendo paper will have degraded by now

Chris
Now we will get someone on Etsy or something who will trim down receipt paper for retro enthusiasts, myself included.

Red Card
NGL, Hasbro did #MLPG5 very dirty, and it does not deserved this.
I'm very disappointed by this. This generation had some really good and relatable characters, and they fumbled distribution of this generation from the outset.
Chris
Russia was involved; #MLPG4 was meant to continue to 14 Seasons.
Forget this G5, for it seriously was not meant to be.
April O'Neil VA trivia

Did you know...Renae Jacobs, who voiced April O'Neil in the original 1987 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series, returned in the 2012 TMNT show to voice April's mom—a pretty cool nod to the original series! 📺

Now that makes sense.
April's a child there, because she Was April's daughter.

Rick and Morty: the Anime, ep 6
22 September
12:08 PM
I watched Episode 6 of #RickAndMortyTheAnime; I feel like the series is catching up with the flow of the original show.
I realize it was slow at the start in reestablishing the series in the transition to the anime for those fresh to the series.
Plus, explanations for how Tammy hooked up with the Galactic Federation, a bit more of Space Beth and more details about Elle.
Likely in 7 or 8, C-137 Rick will be back in better action.

SATAM Sonic

Sonic The Hedgehog - A Marie Garnett Story
The full Pilot intro to Sonic SatAM definitely exists somewhere. Unfortunately it'll be in someone's storage. With them having no clue it's not available online 😅
Chris
Anyone with the original SATAM Sonic the Hedgehog pilot episode and original intro animation and song (not "Fastest Thing Alive), please do upload it onto YouTube at the earliest convenience.
Thank you.

Clear and obvious this is not the OG theme song for SATAM Sonic. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1LREAjHrow
Boring conduct
22 September
1:24 PM
I have just realized something else.
I have actually read from one individual's "complaint" that they have stated feeling bored from my recent conduct that was recorded in videos.
Read this and Learn now:
Well that "Boredom" of yours is not actual boredom, rather or not you read this, but it is a realization within yourself that you have yet to find and love yourself
in your own Soul Searching.
This is stemmed from how much I have found myself and found inner peace within the moments and better matured, as well as my intuition and powers having vast improved.
A fair comparison is someone who literally foreknows the future in as great detail as possible, so they can enjoy the moments as they come.
This was definitely me after I found myself in my past life as Jesus Christ of Nazareth.
It does take the time and patience to learn and get accustomed to the mindset.
This is harder to attain when one is constantly obsessed with physical life events and some work that requires their constant conscious focus.
This can also make them more prone to demonic influence and temptations towards dark and toxic habits.
So the fact that one can get "bored" from seeing someone else who has thoroughly explored and found themselves and found inner peace amidst the unconsciously foreknown events is a sign that that individual wants to feel this for themself.
Yet you can still find this for yourself just as easily; Everyone is capable of doing so in their own Soul Searching and letting some trivial things and details go.
So take that for yourself and take good care of yourself for resonating better.
⚡️💙⚡️
On the similar topic, when one is on their own love quest, they should not just simply "hook up" with every woman they find attractive possible, for it is the deeper attraction and that friendship with the numerous dejá vi moments that resonates mutually between the partners that makes the relationship.
This is also emphasized by both or all individuals having soul searched, set priorities and loved themselves.
With that self homework done, the moment of that one long-term relationship will be clear like the Universe's Core and Matrix.
