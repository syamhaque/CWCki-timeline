================================================================================

On 7 June 2009, Chris starts working on his own wiki.
On 12 June 2009, we see Chris drinking a Long Island Iced Tea.
June was the sixth month of 2009. Chris showed relatively small internet presence throughout the month. It was, however, found out that a few field-trolls had befriended Chris, and had started taking him out to bars. Several videos were shown of Chris enjoying the night life with the trolls, and some footage even showed that Chris had taken up drinking alcohol, a habit that he claimed to detest before this date. Chris also started using CWCipedia, a sister project to CWCki, as his own site. Slowly, Chris commenced the writing of articles, thus adding tons of embarrassing information that was unavailable beforehand.
Events of June 2009
5 June - Chris's YouTube account, CChanSonichu, is hacked by trolls, who upload the memorable "Coming out of the closet" video as well as an amusing, pro-gay music video.
7 June - Chris starts editing CWCipedia.
10 June - Chris regains control of his YouTube account, deleting the videos uploaded by the hackers and favoriting several Britney Spears related videos in order to prove his straightness.
