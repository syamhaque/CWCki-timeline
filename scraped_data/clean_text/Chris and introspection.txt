This article is still yet to be completed due to stress. We get a lot of stressful torture in our lives that makes us crash into slumber. Given that inspiration is a big variable, and we may have been lacking of it, this article will be completed as soon as possible, at our own pace... HONEST! This article is missing the following:
• Complete sections on Self-Awareness, Perseveration, and Self-Projection
“
I have been slowly but surely mentally, and emotionally, and spiritually- [flips over the Sonichu medallion] been maturing. [dramatic sigh]
”
Chris.[1]
“
Everyone, I realize and understand that over the years, I have been a real jerk. I've said and done insensitive things to others over the years. What did it get me? A lot of being trolled, and lots of regrets.
I solemnly swear: from now on, I will never ever again be a jerk. ⚡️💙⚡️
”
Chris, promising he won't be a jerk again.[2]
Introspection involves the examination of one's own inner workings and past actions, typically to make more well-informed decisions in the future.[3] Possibly as a result of his autism, which affects how he perceives how his actions affects others, combined with his inflated ego, Chris has been noted for lacking the ability to do any sort of true reflection upon himself or to take accountability his actions. Chris then winds up making the same mistakes and blunders over and over and over again, and Christory is doomed to repeat itself.
Chris believes that he is a blameless, holy creature that is practically perfect in every way. However, he sees plenty of flaws in the world around him that cause him stress, never once thinking that his behavior might be the problem. He blames all of his problems on external factors like trolls, homos, conspiracies or the entire male population. In the past he's faulted the police, store managers, Mary Lee Walsh, and mall security guards for complications during his Love Quest. When Chris can't fault other people for his problems, he relies on autism and stress as fallback excuses.

Self-Awareness and Self-Knowledge
Part of one's understanding of themselves is the awareness of their character, thoughts, and actions, and how they affect other people. Chris is noted for his utterly warped image of himself, also being highly sensitive to how other people see him to the point where he sometimes focuses on "positives" about himself and expects everyone around him to do the same.
Also, because he is accustomed to seeing himself as a helpless innocent victim of others' cruelty (for "reasons" that amount to imaginary desires on others' part to aggrieve him simply for the sake of it), he at best virtually or at worst flat out doesn't acknowledge that something he did caused the conflict in the first place. For example, when Chris refused to accept being banned from The GAMe PLACe, he barely admitted to doing something negative (i.e. shouting from stress and writing an insulting message on the side of a card box) that got himself shown the door while other accounts revealed that Chris was openly hostile, bigoted and generally obnoxious to fellow patrons and card game players.
Self-Hatred
See also: Chris and remorse
Chris has a tendency to express regret towards past happenings in his life, to the point of seeing his past, "Classic" self in a very negative light. However, when (much less if) he tries expressing remorse, it comes across as hollow and insincere, especially given Chris obviously wants to appease whoever he has upset and/or gain something desired in return over trying to better himself and avoid repeating the same mistakes.
Furthermore, Chris tends to focus on or contrive reasons why something went wrong that differ from what happened and what he should actually be apologizing for, such as when Chris believed Megan Schroeder misunderstood the sexual act he depicted (rather than being disgusted that she was featured in pornographic artwork without her consent) or that he owed Mary Lee Walsh an apology just for depicting her as a villain in his comics, without acknowledging that he both flouted campus rules and foolishly put her on the receiving end of aggression (in that order).
Victim Complex
Chris is known for portraying himself as a sort of perpetual victim, always being wronged by someone.
Due to her tremendous influence on the CWCSphere, the Kiwi Farms user Spooky Bones was able to spread many, many rumors about Isabella Loretta Janke, the person who intended to leak the Incest call anonymously. As a result of the leaking of the call putting Chris in jail, Spooky's claims about Bella; along with the overwhelmingly negative reception she's received due to her online activities; had made it easier for him to turn Bella into a scapegoat, and avoid taking responsibility for his crime.
Self-Projection
