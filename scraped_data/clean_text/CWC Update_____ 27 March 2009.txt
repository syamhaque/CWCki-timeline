[deep breath] Captain's Log. I believe it is the 27th.
Maaaaaaajor update. I am SERIOUSLY ticked off right now, because information about my girlfriend, even though it was accidentally leaked to a trusted individual, it turns out that that individual POSED as one of my gal pals from high school.
But anyway, I, apparently my, my sw-, my, I, I wi-, I swear to God that, I, consi-,that any, ANY...thing to intrude in my life to make me feel, in my life and within my family...[balls hand into fist, overcome with rage] Nnngh! I swear to God, the comic will cease! But also, I swear to God, that I will
GO TO THE POLICE
WITH EVERY HAND WRITTEN DOCUMENT THAT WAS SENT TO MY FAMILY! And we have hand written d-, we have a hand-written... hand-writing from CLYDE CASH. And a typed letter within that envelope that has HIS HANDWRITING on that envelope! I will go to the police; I swear to God, my family and I will go to the police! With all of this information.
So...in my romantic life, and amongst my TRUE gal pals, in my lifetime, and ESPECIALLY my girlfriend:
BACK THE FUCK OFF!
You back the fuck off. Or...I swear, also...myeah. Ceasing of the comics. I will go to the police! You do not want to get on my bad side a-
GAIN!
Or even WORSE?!
EEEEEEENNNNNNNNGH GON' SSSSSTRANGLE THAT CLYDE CASH!
I will
PAUNCH HIS LIGHTS OUT!
If I ever MEET that bastard! In person.
But anyway, I'll say it again. LEAVE ME AND MY FRIENDS ALONE!
I will be continuing my comics at the moment. But any
FURTHER
incident and not only will I STOP the comic, but I WILL go to the police. ALL RIGHT? Back the fuck off. Have a good day.
