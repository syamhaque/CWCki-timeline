Title: Sonichu chronology

================================================================================

The Idea Guys were here.
Chris was brainwashed into believing that their retcons to Sonichu canon reflects reality.
This article is out of date.
We suggest you keep up with the times.
Even Chris can't keep this shit straight.
The chronology of events in Sonichu, Christian Weston Chandler's magnum opus, is extremely complicated for a series that has only seen 15 complete issues. As with most of Chris's work, only the CWCki is capable of untangling the mess to establish when the hell things actually happened, and in what order.
There is considerable confusion as to the passage of time in Sonichu. Although none of the characters seems to age at all (which would be consistent with most comics, video games, and cartoons), by late 2008 Chris had begun making it clear that several years had passed during the course of the storyline. We may never know if this had been his intent all along; it's equally possible that he suddenly made the announcement in reaction to trolls believing that Sonichu and Rosechu were underage at the time of their sex scene in Sonichu #8. Since then Chris has clarified that the adventures in Episodes 1–11 take place several years before he drew them. Stories involving Chris, however, such as the Sub-Episodes and Episodes 12 & 12.5, generally occur closer to the time-frame in which Chris drew them, usually to better coincide with the real-world events that inspired them. After that, however, events in the comic begin to fall behind real time; in mid-2008 Chris established the events of Episodes 13–17 as having occurred in the fall of 2007, nearly a year earlier. Later stories would make greater effort to show when they took place, which only served to show the gap widening. When Chris abandoned the series in February 2010, he had left off with a Christmas story set in December 2008. When he resumed it in 2017, the series had only reached 2009.
Further complicating the continuity is Chris's gratuitous use of time travel. Although he wanted to show the Chaotic Combo hatching from eggs and growing up, this was at odds with his desire to make them contemporaries of Sonichu. Chris's solution was to reveal that the rainbow that created Sonichu and Rosechu created eggs that traveled backward in time, with most of them ending up (amazingly) in Virginia around the time Sonichu and Rosechu were born. In fact, nearly every major event in the comic's backstory that happened before the rainbow was caused by the rainbow. Later, Chris would devote all of Sonichu #7 to a time-travel story in which he visits his past self before getting lost in a time void where he can observe "future" events--that is, things that had already happened to the real Chris. The fictional Chris later travels to the future, and upon returning to 2008 coordinates to eradicate homosexuality by February 2009, even though the real Chris was writing all this in January 2010 and was fully aware homos still roamed the earth. When Chris recommenced the series in 2017, this led to more headaches as the modern Chris is now a lesbian transwoman who supports the SLGTBQ and such. More clumsy time travel and retcons were needed to change the homosexuality vaccine storyline to a 'Nombie-zazi' vaccine instead, and during Chris's sojourn in the future he learned about tomgirlism from his future self before returning to 2007 as a tomgirl, even though in the real world Chris only changed over in 2014.
The following is a timeline of events depicted in Sonichu canon, either in the comics themselves or in commentaries by Chris on the CWCipedia and elsewhere. Where necessary, ambiguous events have been noted with speculated dates. Events erased by retconning are in italics.

Episode 1: In the final battle between Sonic and the Perfect Chaos Monster, Sonic uses the Chaos Emeralds to transform into Super Sonic. Meanwhile, a Pikachu rushes to the scene to help and inadvertently collides with Sonic. The collision creates the Chaotic Rainbow, a massive burst of magical energy that stretches across the sky. At the source of the rainbow, the Pikachu is transformed into a new species of Electric Hedgehog Pokémon that can talk like humans. After helping Sonic defeat Chaos, the new Pokémon names both itself and its species "Sonichu." The rainbow touches down at Kel's house, striking her Girl Raichu and transforming it into a similar hedgehog Pokémon, who names herself Rosechu.[14]
Sonichu #0 says that Sonichu is 16 years old and Rosechu is 15, which would be true in 2004 when the comic was drawn but not in 1998, when Chris later declared the story took place.
The Chaotic Rainbow magically creates "countless" eggs which are strewn across time and space.[8] (later revised to "Sixty-Nine Special Sonee and Rosey Eggs, and the Thousands of Regular Sonee and Rosey Eggs") Additionally, it creates the Sonichu Balls, which are thrown back to the year 1900.[1]

Everybody at the prom dies and Terrah's ghost is left to haunt the place.[3]

In a parting shot, Mary Lee Walsh attempts to imprison Chris in a Dark Mirror Hole. The exposure of Chris's Sonichu medallion to the dark energy fulfills a section of the Anchuent Prophecy that causes Naitsirhc (who is miles away) to transform into Reldnahc Notsew Naitsirhc. Crystal rescues Chris from the mirror but is imprisoned herself.[26][1]
Episode 14: Mary Lee Walsh demands CWCville's surrender in exchange for Crystal's release. However, the arrival of Darkbind Sonichu and Patti-Chan turns the tide, and the PVCC forces retreat. After hours of trying to free Crystal, the heroes assemble to discuss how to obtain the seven Sonichu balls needed to break the spell of the dark mirror. Reldnahc Notsew Naitsirhc (as Reldnahc Ha-Taque) and Black Sonichu embark on a crime wave. Although Sonichu and Magi-Chan are able to appeal to Black Sonichu with reason, Reldnahc is only stopped through a pitched battle with Chris, culminating in the helpful assistance of the returning Bionic the Hedgehog[2]
During Chris's battle with Reldnahc, Black Sonichu is formally introduced to Bubbles, who reaches out to him and helps to redeem him. Later she suggests that he use the nickname "Blake," which he accepts appreciatively.[15]

The real life date in which these developments were reported was 3 October 2013,[27] but it is not known when they did occur within the Sonichu chronology. It can be inferred that said events happened after 2 November 2007, as both Megagi and comic-Chris have a cordial relationship with Megan during her last appearance in Episode 15.
