01:23: [Stream begins. Chris's Kamala Harris signs are placed on the green screen behind him, revealing they weren't stolen.]
03:44: Chris reads a Super Chat donation from his phone and thanks his fans in Brazil.
04:44: Chris talks about Donald Trump doing an event at McDonald's and the latter's E. coli outbreak.
05:24: Chris stands up to turn up the ceiling fan.
08:25: North Carolina is mentioned, causing Chris to rant about people taking pictures of him in public. "Seriously, are y'all really just like Oh, I have no life so I'm just going to take a bigfoot photo of Chris Cha- or Christ Chan."
18:51: A donor tells Chris to turn up his microphone due to him being hard to hear. Chris denies the request. "I mean, I'm not gonna fall for that meme again! Nope!"
21:13: A donor tells Chris to stop ignoring them on social media. Chris responds "I have a life outside of social media, you know. It's not like I'm ignoring anybody, I mean, I have lots and lots of messages and whatnot! What's wrong with you?"
22:55: A donor gives Chris their Twitter handle and asks for a follow. Chris searches for the account on his phone and says he couldn't find it.
26:11: The previously mentioned donor helps Chris find their Twitter account with another donation. Chris finds the account on his phone and says he will think about following it. When asked about it again about 12 minutes later he says "I am still deciding on that. Let it be a pleasant surprise if I do, okay?"
27:20: Chris curses Donald Trump nonverbally and then moves the camera slightly.
29:30: A donor asks "Christine, how do you think Georgia will go?" Chris responds "I'm not saying anything about Georgia right now... 'cause I'm not a fan of what I'm foreseeing with that."
39:21: A donor tells Chris they need help with homework and asks him what a predicate is. Chris says he doesn't "consciously know" what it is and searches it up on his phone to read out the definition. "I pray that at least answers your question."
41:28: The voting demographic of elderly people makes Chris wonder "what's wrong with those people?" He then says "nothing against them personally" because they have their own "individual wisdoms and insights", and mentions "brain mentality, what can happen to the brain at an old age." Chris then decides to stop talking about it. "I feel like that's enough said, I'm not gonna... say anymore."
44:01: Chris gives his thoughts on political third parties. "Third parties are okay. It's just unfortunate that they're not as popular."
44:47: Chris says the dimensional merge is happening regardless of the election's outcome. It is also in progress, just open your mind and look at the rifts forming in the sky. "They're there!"
48:28: A donor asks Chris to "do a poo." Chris complies and makes a fart noise with his mouth. "There you go. That's it."
49:23: The same previously mentioned donor donates again and says "poo a do," prompting Chris to blow a raspberry and say "Yeah, I'm not going to repeat myself."
50:03: Chris does not regret winning the Sonic Sweepstakes.
50:29: The donor makes a third donation and says "a do poo." "You keep- Of all the words you keep, uh, typing up through the Super Chat... You do short words like that."
51:07: The donor makes a fourth donation and says "a poo do", Chris sighs, looks disappointed, and blows a raspberry. "Oh, just keep it up, you're really laughing it up here. You're doing a real low tier comedy show with those... those Super Chat fails."
52:17: The donor makes a fifth donation and says "do some poo poos." Chris then says "No. Nobody's doing... that. Nobody's making any crap on livestreams. We're not doing that, this is not that type of show, I'm not going to talk with the individuals, so there." The donor later makes two more donations, both of which are ignored, successfully wasting their money.
56:02: A donor asks Chris to bring the webcam to the bathroom the next time he uses it. Chris replies "No, we're not bringing the ca- webcam anywhere outside this room."
1:00:49: A donor says "Daniel Larson for president!" Chris replies "I am not going to agree with that... at all."
1:04:25: A donor asks if Chris would give a closer view of the Kamala Harris signs behind him. Chris replies "Nope."
1:05:15: A donor tells Chris to either turn down the stream volume or turn his microphone up. Chris instead tells the donor to simply turn up their speakers. Chris turns down the stream volume a small amount.
1:16:21: Chris stops watching the stream and takes a "little break," saying he will be back with gameplay.
1:20:27: Chris returns with the screen now broadcasting his Nintendo Switch. Chris attempts to play SONIC X SHADOW GENERATIONS but ultimately fails, mentioning supposed audio issues.
1:21:57: Chris opens the home of his Nintendo Switch and reveals there are two new profiles on it. It should be noted that Chris likely purposefully made sure to not reveal the names of these profiles as he stops broadcasting his console screen when he switches to the next game, Vampire Survivors, since a demo is apparently offered to Nintendo Switch Online members.
1:46:50: Chris stops playing Vampire Survivors and talks briefly for about 30 seconds before ending the stream.
