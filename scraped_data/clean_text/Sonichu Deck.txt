Description
Twilight Sparkle's Secret Shipfic Folder returns with many a powerful Lightning Bolt and Psychic Power.
Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu (Chris Chan Sonichu) is the (in)famous author/creator of Sonichu and Rosechu, and the Nation of Cwcville, VA. Magi-Chan Sonichu is the guardian over the Sonichu and Rosechu species of Pokemon, as well as the Guardian Angel, Mentor and Devoted Husband to Chris Chan Sonichu. Both Chris Chan and Magi-Chan are prolific and powerful, and they also enjoy the finer and simple things in life. Among which, they dabble in Fanfics and Shipping, and inserting themselves where needed. Shipping themselves to make more allies and friends.
But, in this situation, they ship each other, their friends, and their families together, regardless of relation, orientation, species, or harmonious or clashing fur, hair, mane and coat colour combinations.
In order to help them fulfill their efforts and goals in bringing everyone together against the forces that want to harm us, you can help us write perfect and crazy fanfics. You take turns expanding the shipping, joining Sonichus, Rosechus, Humans, Ponies, and what else with Ship cards.
If you are the first to make one of our narrative Goals a reality, you earn the points for that Goal! Of, you also earn the shame and glory (depending on how you look at it) for enabling the penchant for shipping us and our friends and family, but nobody is perfect.
This Deck can be played with or against the original Twilight Sparkle's Secret Shipfic Folder (TSSSF) Core Deck and past-printed Expansion Packs and Promo cards.
This Deck includes a combination of Four Start Cards, and the Goal, Ship and Pony Decks to make this a game many people can play together; contains 172 cards of the finest Lightning and Psychic Power.

Win this Goal when: Chris Chan or Christine Chan is discarded from your hand (not from the grid; end-of-turn discarding counts towards the goal).
Due to a Chronicler Law, personally written in 2018, and put into effect in Cwcville, retroactively as early as 1980, Christine Chan would have to remain sexually restrained until as early as around 2010, when she would be fated to discover herself and come out as a woman. Simply put: No Sexual Intercourse with ANYONE. Chris Chan is a sexual camel in comparison to Christine Chan; she was Super Impulsive and Horny, so she needed to be restrained.
