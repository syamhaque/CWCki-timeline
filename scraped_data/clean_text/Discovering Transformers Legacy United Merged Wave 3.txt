Discovering Transformers Legacy United Merged Wave 3, further hashtagged as #transformers #transformerslegacyunitedmerged, is a brief prerecorded video clip recorded in May 2025, and published to Chris's YouTube on 29 June 2025.
The video is of Chris walking up to a shelf in a Target store. On the shelf are his custom Transformers Legacy United Merged figures. Chris pretends the figures are being sold at the Target. Sale stickers in the video show the date "5/26", indicating the video was likely filmed in May, some point after returning from his fourth trip to Finland.
Chris can also be seen wearing a light blue shirt of some sort, possibly the exact same Superdry hoodie he had previously been seen wearing in Finland.
