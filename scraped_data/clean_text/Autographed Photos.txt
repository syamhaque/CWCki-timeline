Purchase history for the listing.
On 1 July 2014, Chris created an eBay listing for autographed photos of himself. He apparently learned from the multiple failed listings of the Original Sonichu and Rosechu Drawing, since he did not allow bidding on the listing. Instead, he set a comparably reasonable Buy It Now price of $20 for each photo, with immediate payment required, making it less susceptible to trolling. In the Q&A for the listing, Chris indicated that he would wear the Sonichu medallion on request, but that his "The Classic" shirt had been lost in the fire. By the time sales were temporarily suspended in November 2014, 104 photos had been sold, several to CWCki Forums members.[1] In June 2015 he inaugurated a new eBay account with a listing of autographed photos, managing to sell four.
He resumed selling autographs in 2018, which proved to be a popular item that year.

Facebook updates
Evidently Chris seems to think that people who bought photos also follow him on Facebook, because he addressed his buyers in general there regarding the status of orders. On 3 July, he stated that he has "filled every order" and yet "still [has] more to do", including packaging and shipping. He complained that a flash flood warning and the 4 July post office holiday would delay him. Despite this, several orders were shipped on 3 July, and at least one arrived as of 5 July (showing him wearing the Sonichu medallion as promised).[2][3][4]

Attention everyone.
Everyone who shopped on eBay today, I want to state that I am astounded with the amount of interest in my handwriting at least. But seriously, a Lot of autograph requests and a few drawing commissions have been made yesterday, the first.
Rest assured, I will honor all of the requests and business. But with the number, I have to sort it all out on a spreadsheet first, and I have to make the photographs on 8X10 Glossy and autograph them. And, of course, draw up the commissions.
I will dedicate the next couple to few days to all of that, and everything finished will be shipped as I have specified the next day. Everyone will get their respective tracking numbers right after sending out their goods. My goal is to have all of the autographs shipped out on about Thursday, and the drawings either on Friday or the following Monday.
Your contributions are a real big help to me and my family. Please have faith and patience. Thank you all so much. And a big Thank you as well to all future customers as well (in advance).
Y'all have a good day.

Attention everyone who purchased an autographed photo on my eBay. I need to get some rest now; I have filled every order, an I still have more to do, including the cutting of the padding for the photos. And it has come to my attention of a flash flood watch in my local area.
In a nutshell, I may be delayed in sending out the photos by one day, and then Independence Day is on Friday (legal holiday). I will end up sending the photos out as late as Saturday. And I am still open for all incoming order during this time. All respective requests will be honored and accomplished as swiftly as possible, and all tracking numbers will be relayed respectively shortly after shipment.
I thank you all for your patience and understanding.
Y'all have a good day and a Happy Birthday to America.

Questions and answers
Hi there, how much would shipping be to 4170 Australia? I may be interested in purchasing two photographs, is combined shipping available? Would multiple affect the shipping cost? Thank you!
Shipping is free to everywhere; it is counted out of the price, which for me I pay an average of $4 US dollars out of the price per item. You would only have to pay the $40, plus a bit more, I think, since you are in a different country. Should you have to pay more, I will include a single character drawing per item, which in this case, you would get two drawings. You may request the character or person you wish the bonus drawing(s) to be of. Thank you for asking, and have a good day.
Hi Chris, What are the size of these pictures and are they printed on real photo paper? Thanks and good luck in your online sales.
8x10, and Yes, they are on Real Glossy Photo Paper.
Hello Chris! Congratulations on your new endeavour. I'm from the UK, but I want to have my copy shipped to an address in Canada. Would you be able to do this? (I don't use eBay much, so I'm unfamiliar with how it works.)
If you pay for it, I will ship it to you at your provided address, unless you inform me of a different address.
hi chris! would you be willing to write a personalised message on the autographed pictures?
Yes, of course (as long as it was non-offensive).
Hi Christian. Can I have a print of the fourth picture with the message "All that is down is only the floor" followed by your autograph? Thank you.
If you buy and pay, I will do that.
Hello Chris, Would it be possible for you to take a photo in the shirt you wear in the comics. I would buy one but I want something authentic Sonichu. The current shirt is not nice enough.
I lost the shirt in the fire; I still have the medal. So, okay.
Can you confirm the shipping price to the UK? Ebay is telling me that it would cost $15 which does not seem right.
I am uncertain, as I had originally made the shipping Free upon the listing's creation.
Any chance you could wear the Sonichu medallion?
I may.
i was wanting to know how personal of a message can I get? 3
As long as it is not offensive.
I'm a little confused as to what I would be getting if I bought this item. According to your description you are not taking photographic requests, however, you also say this "Note: the featured sample photograph headshots are of myself personally; they will not necessarily be used for distribution of my autograph." so I am wondering what exactly are you selling? If I point out which one of the pictures you have posted, are you going to make a copy of that or take a totally new picture?
I have stated that, because I had not decided which photo would be best, and I did not want any offensive suggestions made at the while. You may pick from among the samples at this time.
Will the Photo Glossy Paper be shipped with cardboard or something similar to prevent damage?
It will be sandwiched between cardboard in the envelopes
What size are these?
8X10 Glossy
What quality stock are the photos printed on, and do they come framed considering the $40 price it would be to buy one internationally?
The photographs are on Photo Glossy Paper with highest quality printing detail. And my autograph would certainly be worth it.
Hey there! If I buy an autographed photo of yours, will I be able to choose one of the pictures displayed in your auction or do you choose them randomly? Cheers, [redacted]
You may choose a photograph; if I am not informed of choice, I default to the first photo. Thank you.

Chris resumed selling autographs in the summer of 2018, first through Mercari and then eBay. This time around, the autographs were all based on one photo (with the occasional variant poking fun at his own past), framed, with the only customization offered being which version of his name he would sign. He charged $50 for each and included three Sonichu stickers as a bonus. The standard autographs were quickly snapped up by fans.

Damaged frames
Photo of a received envelope in which the frame allegedly broke in transit.
Chris decided that shipping the framed autographs in an envelope lined with bubble wrap would be sufficient if he wrote "fragile" on it. This led to complaints of the products being damaged in transit.
Chris replied to one of the complaints on Twitter, managing to blame the customer and the postal service instead of himself[5]:
“
That is not my fault the frame got broke in transaction, the envelope was clearly marked “Fragile” and “Handle With Care”, and it was shipped well in a bubble envelope. Either you, being Trollish, or the Postal Carriers are to blame for the frame’s arriving condition.
”
He has yet to receive negative feedback on this faulty shipping method on his ebay account. One buyer, who noted the damaged frame in feedback, nevertheless rated the transaction positive[6].
