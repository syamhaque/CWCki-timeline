Isn’t that Chris-Chan’s arch enemy Clyde Cash?
”
Paper Jam Dipper's top comment on Know Your Meme's article about Lee Hotti.
Secret Weapon is a YouTube video posted by Chris on 30 March 2009. In this video, Chris claims to have the mugshot of the nefarious Clyde Cash after being given a copy by a Troll, which is actually a picture of Lee Hotti. Nonetheless, it is now jokingly circulated as Clyde's picture.
This is actually not the first video to feature the image, as the first was the immediate predecessor to this video - something that Chris alludes to fleetingly before attempting to place the picture in front of the camera.

Transcript
Chris was a guido in 2003
Laugh now, as much as you want Mr. Sin Dinero [Spanish, obviously meaning "without money"], because you have no money. And you, I can tell you why you can't, why you try to steal other men's women, I tell you what.
[looks at picture of "Clyde Cash", scoffs] And a big detail you left, you may eh, you might have not overlooked. [holds picture up and off-center to the camera] I have your mugshot. I can't even stand to look at it! All those damn freckles! [At this point, Chris moves the paper aside slightly and you can see he's reading off something else for his lines] You're a FREAK! [The audio distorts a bit at this point, making Chris's laugh even more disturbing.]
HA, HA, HA, HAAAAAAA-HAAA!
[At this point, Clyde's "mugshot" is positioned fully at the camera] I scoff at you, you ugly freak!
