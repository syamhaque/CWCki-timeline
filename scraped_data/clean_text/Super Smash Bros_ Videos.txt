Super Smash Bros. is a popular series of fighting games by Nintendo. Through 2015 Chris devoted considerable attention to these games, especially evidenced by his custom Amiibo enabling himself and his cherished Sonichu characters to duke it out. He asked his fans to make Sonichu a downloadable character in the game. On 13-14 October 2015, Chris uploaded five boring videos onto YouTube featuring battles among his imaginary friends and enemies. Four more were released later that month, and another two in November.

Family Needs to appreciate Family
Description:
#JosephColeSmithey, #DrDavidAlanChandler, and #CarolSuzanneChandler; This Message for you three. You all have obviously forgotten about your family that y'all should be caring about as well, aside from your own local married families. Alan and Carol, you two have never really appreciated our Father. There WAS Time for you two to share time with him before his passing, but NO, you all have been selfish and caught up in your own lives that HE gave to us. And Cole, OUR Mother is Still Alive; I REALLY want you to make amends and get close, once again, to her before Her time runs out. And as the one sibling that brings you three, Cole, Alan and Carol in connection together as Family; I want us all to reconnect as family. The distance Really bothers me and I have been feeling ill against y'all for not including me and our mother/stepmother to two of you.
Appreciate Your Families While There is still time.
