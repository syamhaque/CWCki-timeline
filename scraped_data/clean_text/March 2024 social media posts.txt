Chris (2:24 AM)
Actually, Russia is worse than China, because the majority of the individuals in China are actually on spiritual level, all Government Officials, aside.
Around or over 99% of Russia is Not Spiritual or even open to that which is Light Powered or Good.
Plus, I have checked: Russia Preceeded anything China did in regards to MLPG5 and Pony Life.
Therefore, your hashtag and statement is moot.
Chris (2:37 AM
Regardless, I do agree we should #StopChineseGenocide.
Fortunately, that issue is not of the majority of the individuals of China; that is the fault of the government, there.
So, if anything of China, it ought to be GetRidOfBananaPeel (Xi Jengping).
I am very well aware of the reference, as well as the blank paper protest.

I don't hate g5 at all, but the one thing that will forever piss me off about it is that we had this beautiful ending in g4 where we see everyone grew up, fulfilled their destinies and is generally super happy.
Then g5 movie comes along "nah dude they all fucked up, sucked, died"

4. Rhino turns into Optimus Prime
5. Print money

Maybe when @Hasbro finally shelves #MLPG5 and resume Friendship is Magic to distance themselves from Russia and no longer be greedy, Maybe they will finally Consider M.A.S.K. and even GoBots.

I still have absolutely never ever watched or even heard even a second of Anything MLPG5, and I have absolutely NO Intention to,
@Hasbro, until After #MyLittlePonyFriendshioIsMagicSeason14Episode26 is Aired in good Adobe Flash animation.
And long after @Hasbro fully cuts all of its ties with Russia and Dissolves Everything #MLPG5 and even #PonyLife out of existence of any and all media and merchandise, period.

2019 till this day I've drawing Sonichu as a passion. I offered at least 3 times to collab.
@CPU_CWCSonichu, I'm muting you indefinitely. I'll do the #SonichuShow and you are NOT involved.
In the beginning I was doing the Sonichu comics for the lack of content. Nothing changed.
Chris
Lo siento, Helena.
But I meant absolutely no offense in not choosing you in the art contest.
You are a valuable individual.
My concern was the premature grapevine leaks that would have likely happened.
I understand that it is something that is done out of excitement sometimes.
There are certain details that are not to be surfaced until only when the time is right.
You can still improve yourself.
Meditate on it.

Why the influx of porn again? Not really into it. It was actually pissing me off. @CPU_CWCSonichu can you help me?
Chris
Just ignore the porn.
I have, and I don't need to acknowledge it.
I do not need any of what some call "Bitches".
I feel sorry for the lot of individuals that needlessly obsess over pornography.
I have learned from observation and personal experience.
And there was no "Barbussy" at all, ever.
That never ever happened.

Happy #SonichuDay ⚡️, as well as Happy St. Patrick's Day.🍀. And to note:
Today back in 2000 was the day I discovered and started with Sonichu Prime.
Today is not Sonichu Prime's Birthday; that is not until April 20, when back in 1992, he was born as a Pichu.
