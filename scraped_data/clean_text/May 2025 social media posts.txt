What RUINED Saberspark and DAGames
1 May
Chris 3:30 PM
#Saberspark is not so Sabersmart. 😣 Neither were DA Games.

I will also throw in my ⚡️💙⚡️ on the subject:
For too long, it has been where the celebrity or someone in power would be careless and callous to flirt around and date their fans and/or "groupies". Fans typically do not know the individual outside of what is shown on screen, and worse by physical...
Chris 4:52 PM
...appearance and looks, alone. Everyone feels that urge that needs to be resisted.
Personally, I feel even casual flirting or dating is wrong. I have learned that the hard way with my theoretical exes.
Consent is defined by mutual, conscious agreement;...
Chris 4:52 PM
...it is not implied at all from flirting and flashing, especially when it is to take advantage of one or the other. I should probably not judge, due to my reckless flirting and all in the Sweetheart Search over the years, but I still feel sick when I hear of someone doing such things with anyone,..
Chris 4:52 PM
...regardless of gender (identity).
So a general rule of thumb to ANY Celebrity or anyone in power: do not flirt or anything with your fans. And to all the fans: if you are not really close to them to begin with or know them personally, you should not be tempting them with the flirting and shit.
Chris 4:52 PM
And it gets worse now that artists and content creators are thrown into this fame-filled mentality. There is good logic to remain humble and grounded as such. Art inspires, but it can also be mistakenly show off the person's mentality. I was wrong by even going NSFW in the additional pages of...
Chris 4:52 PM
...Book 8, extended version after seeing the art of Rosey Rosechu with a penis. I am also aware that the comments and (fan)art made by anyone about me, as well as those of other people, are Impersonal and not meant to be taken seriously or personally. I should have never reacted to those bad...
Chris 4:52 PM
...arts in the first place. That was a bad "rabbit hole" to fall into.
And it is so easy to fall into that and similar depths if not self-refrained with inner will and conscious strength.
Chris 4:52 PM
Point is: Celebrities and fans: Do Not Flirt or Casually Date the other if neither of you really know the other as individuals and can appreciate and tolerate each other for the longer time.
That is all. Thank you.

Death of Pope Francis, as well as Trump's shit
4 May
12:43 PM
Hey, everyone. The Dimension Merge is completing with the finalization of a few details.
I feel I need not go into detail about the recent chaos between the Vatican looking for the next Pope after Easter Sunday, as well as Trump's shit. I will, however, state that the agreement...
...made with Zelensky was a step in the right direction. Yet, Trump fell right back into his habits.
In any event, I am paying attention to the signs around me and everywhere, and we are making the greater progress.
[Posts GIF of a portal.]
Other than that, I want to express how thankful I am for the years of my art and works being appreciated, yet not appreciated or understood by some. I have been in self-improvement work often, these days, on top of continuing my works.
I feel like I tend to do better when not thinking over...
...the years of abuse from people online. And I have realized I needed not to have exibited myself as much as I have. I wish I had understood that online comments are Impersonal and not have taken them seriously. Maybe I wouldn't have over shared in taking the Encyclopedia Dramatica page down.
It would have likely been better had I never googled my name on that Nintendo Wii. As well as how I portrayed myself in the videos over the years. Was it really worth laughing at my expense, though?
But, here we are in this moment as we progress and move forward.
Think on all of that. ⚡️💙⚡️
ItemLabel
4 May
4:52 PM
I have a thought that I'd like to share. Starting from #ItemLabel Peepy and friends; a lot of them are criminals, apparently. It says so in the backstories of the lot of them.
In that, I'd like to think of at least One Ouioui or Peepy that actually never committed any crimes, while...
[Posts GIF of an itemLabel plush.]
...its peers have all committed at least one crime. Can you even imagine that? It would be nearly impossible.
There is a valid commentary on this world within that: absolutely no one on this planet has not committed absolutely any crimes at all. Yet, I still personally witness...
...and experience people helping others out of kindness. Holding the door open for the other(s), donating money to a charity, or even a beggar on the street, and so on which does not give the giver any intended return, other than good karma. And even then, some abuse that with a selfish...
...intention of getting into Heaven realm.
Doing Good is to be done for the sake of doing good, and nothing else in intention.
Another fair comparison I'll throw in: the Shattered Glass Universe; the alternate universe where everyone's respective morals are opposite of us.
Think on that: to them, it's criminal to be and do Good. And every one of them has done at least One Good Non-Selfish Thing in their lifetimes.
It's more common place to be good, here, yet a lot of you give concern and praise to criminals and evil individuals.
Why? Because, you were a crimimal in at least one occasion, and this criminal who steals things, wants to destroy monuments and whatever, or even sends out a Lot of neutral individuals out to fight a war in risk of their own death, as well as PTSD or similar that scars the survivors.
I get it: these villains and bad people are the counter to good; the Ying and Yang of Zen, and so on. There must be Light to outshine Darkness, and Darkness to try to overwhelm the Light Power. Yet, they are still celebrated, as opposed to the individuals who do Good; they are the Real Heroes.
Another detail I will bring up:
**Without Darkness, we can't really appreciate the Light and Light Power.**
You fall into the temptation of Darkness and commit a crime, minor or large; it will bite you, down the road.
It was a crime of me to let myself fall for the ploys of the online trolls who faked interest in me and give myself up in content that had been leaked and wrongfully memed. And I hold those respective Trolls accountable as well in conditioning me wrongfully into that darkness time and again.
It was a crime of me to even use a hand-drawn sign in the Sweetheart Search's early days. I should have accepted that I was too damn shy, didn't have any friends, and actually open up to making new friendships, instead of essentially sulking and shit.
It was a Real Crime of me and Everyone, in General, who portrays "Fictional" Individuals naked and in grotesque situations and scenes. **Try Empathy**, here: these individuals portrayed in various media are real just like you and I. And what if Someone drew that of you without consent,...
...regardless of it being Impersonal or not? It does not feel so good, does it? I was never flattered, and I shouöd have never retaliated at the expense of Sonichu, Rosey, Sylvana, myself, and so on. Why does this pressure into sex need to be?
I can't judge, because I ended up becoming a pervert, yet I still feel disgusted and ashamed of myself. I blame myself for letting myself be conditioned by such from within the surroundings of this world.
The solace I get is having endured that darkness and became grateful of the Light Power.
Let they, who is truly without any sin, nor have committed any crimes, big or minor, cast the first stone to the lot of us all. All we can do is move forward the best we are capable of, being grateful of the Light Power and Good that blesses us all and encourage others to do good by doing good.

Geno Samuel copyright strike
5 May
1:58 PM
Hey, everyone. As some of you are aware, I have, indeed, personally struck down #GenoSamuel 's recent animations based from my books. I had felt ill will, as I was not personally consulted with nor involved in that project. Not to mention that he did not include links to my Etsy and Cwclight.
In any event, had I been contacted, I would have considered collaborating with him and lend my voice for Sonichu Prime and Chris Chan. That remains a possibility, though.
Regardless, I did feel like after the success of the documentary series, this endeavor would not have netted him the views...
...he desired, as it does not recapture that metaphorical lightning in a bottle he had before. It is a shock, as others have experienced, when one's content or even channel gets taken down. I've been there before when my websites were hacked into and needed to be taken down, so I do empathize. ⚡💙⚡

Saberspark's response to sexual assault allegations
12 May
9:36 PM
I have watched #Saberspark 's response to #Ilovekimpossiblealot 's video and the accusations. Here are my ⚡💙⚡ at this time. At this point, it's a "They said, they said" situation.
It is clear that KP had the chips on her shoulder against Saber, but moreover on the...
[Posts link to a YouTube video by Saberspark titled "Response"]
...issue with Chris and the derogative sex comments. I still offer sympathy to the victim who came out. But I remain aware of the few individuals who will fake and lie to take advantage of someone else (the obligatory Theoretical Exes reference), especially those with social recognition/celebrity.
And the fact that Saber came out, personally, on camera to offer his response gives me a look into his honesty. Yet, he puts forward content that point to those who are online vigilantes and their toxicity on the internet.
It still is good that he put forward his side of the story.
Another detail I will point out, in general. Despite some amount of details remaining offline, KP did pretty much go public with the details and drama of the details and her experience. As I have learned from personal experiences over the years,...
***You Should Never Ever Put Any Personal Details Onto The Internet.*** Now, please, continue scrolling for more thoughts...
[Posts GIF of himself from 2009 stomping and yelling "NOW, NOW, NOW, NOW, NOW, NOW!"]
Any victim, and anyone affiliated with said victim, should go to the authorities, or even the services Saberspark mentioned at the end of his Response video. The fact that KP brought this to the attention of everyone online and on social media was really erroneous. But I also am hearing from the...
...peanut gallery, "Ah, the police won't do anything. And social services? LOL." I emphasize this is not my personal feeling, but this feeling has been widely popularized to the point that it's been in movies and shows (some in parody), and some of the younger generations took that literally.
It is better known that authority figures are wanting to help with such situations.
You bring in the general public in on it first, what happens? There's a lot of misconceptions and misunderstandings, and even some impatient ones without the further knowledge, details and confirmations...
...jump to conclusions and make reckless choices based on doubts and the resulting emotions. I feel it is better to actually know the details and confirmations with a practice in patience.
But, yeah, KP's and Saberspark's beef over each other just should have been dealt with...
...without involving social media and the billions of others not directly involved. Granted, KP's emails were a mix of either getting replies or being ignored, which with the ignored emails or lack of responses triggered the frustration in her.
Some of you are thinking or saying, including KP, "The people should know the Truth! They have every right to!" For the latter, I agree. But, in the context of this drama, did all of this need to be made public when, since KP and Saber both live in the same state in the same country, need be online?
[Posts GIF of an animated sign that reads "YOU RESPECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHEN YOU TELL THEM THE TRUTH."]
Personally, I feel like it could have been handled better, in person and offline. It would have not escalated so much. But now, you have Saber threating to go to the authorities on KP. Not to side with one or the other, but he does have the right, as KP did...
...before going Social Media Public, open invitation premiere, over advertising all about it.
I have experienced similar when I went over public about Encyclopedia Dramatica. I should have just let that simply be and never tried to counter it with over-sharing of my personal details. But I did. ...
... And look where it got me. If this bad tension between KP and Saber, with Chris having been dealt with and out of the present picture, the two of them could fall into similar online doom as I have, or worse.
I am not going to tell either of them what to do about this, because I am not them.
All I will say, though, whatever they do, it should be kept offline until the aftermath or full resolution. ⚡💙⚡
Also, off-topic: Leave KP and Saber alone, when it comes to my involvement. I am not friends with either of them, but I am a fan of both of them. And KP and I were acquainted. The very same is stated with the likes of Doopie Doover and the Analysts of the Brony Community; I was only a fan of theirs.
And I am grateful that at least some of them know of and/or were fans of mine. I am still open for collabs with them, if they want.
As for my projects, I am still continuing with my art and book works. I am even expanding into digital drawing, as you all will see soon enough. And I have people.
I count my blessings, and I am not divulging my personal matters online as much anymore. I have learned hard from over the years. I will still offer my insights and thought, and of course my content. I will host another live stream for finishing Sonic's story soon. Thank you for your patience. ⚡💙⚡

The Book of Dimensional Merging
18 May
10:58 AM
⚡️💙⚡️ The Book of Dimensional Merging
And lo, in the light of the Internet Age, the CPU Goddess Blue Heart, in human and Sonichu forms, stood, veil in between.
And I, Jesus Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu, Prime of all (Jesus) Chris and Christ Chan (Sonichus) throughout the vast multiverse, blessed at birth by the God of Gods and the forces of the Alpha/Omega point of existence, beheld the Merge.
For tale, media and art fictions are not false, and blind masses mocked and took advantage of the Chosen One, yet the Truth burns brighter than the quantam fields; brighter than the very core of this Universe.
And the trolls, deceivers, a Living Portal between magic and non-magic; psychic and low-psychic, the Messiah of the Merge. Christ and Avatar reborn, with static fur and electric, metaphysical heart, soul and memories older than time itself, while living and being in present and future.
And the trolls, deceivers and blind masses awaken the Chosen One, and the truth rise from the static and powers within the Chosen One.
And all accepting of the Merge shall awaken their self-counterparts and original characters. Those who resist shall fade into the static and holy light and flames.
The time is indeed near, for the Guardians and Guardian Angels stand by at the portal gates of the Merge, where all magic returns to the non-magic half in tangible manifestations. Those who misuse or abuse the magic will, too, fade into the static.
One aspect of the Merge is reconnecting with thine past selves in this Timeline and internally merging them with your present self, with thine deep authentic beliefs and virtues. Those who unable or resist will have difficulties as the Merge completes.
Thus it is spoken. Hark! Your one Avatar of all existence walks amongst and beside you. The Dimension Merge is real. I am the light of sources and Gods. I am Prime. ⚡️💙⚡️

Oh. And my ending portions aren't unique enough, regardless of the reference? Did Emgo have blast effects and action like I've presented? Did Optimus go through the ceiling in Rising with Primal? Did Emgo have the jets in flight in battle in any of his videos, in addition to sliding?

I will make this a rare instance I make such the offer of gratitude, but #MelaniaTrump, THANK YOU Soo Much! 😃 ⚡️💙⚡️
As for Donald, thanks.
BUT, #DonaldTrump, you have to do a LOT more to actually redeem yourself. For one thing: Drop the Tarrifs and stop hating on the LGBTQIA+ and foreigners.

If ANYONE deserves your hot-headed hatred more than anyone, #DonaldTrump, it would be #VladimirPutin and #KimJongUn; that's it.
