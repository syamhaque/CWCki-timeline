This article is still yet to be completed due to stress. We get a lot of stressful torture in our lives that makes us crash into slumber. Given that inspiration is a big variable, and we may have been lacking of it, this article will be completed as soon as possible, at our own pace... HONEST!
The Sonichu sprite for the mod
Sonichu Mania was a fan project whose goal was to add Sonichu as a playable character in the game Sonic Mania. Chris joined their Discord server on 8 September 2019, and participated in a livestream that members were hosting. After the livestream, their Twitter, YouTube, and Discord accounts were deleted.

[Chris joins at 44:11 into the stream]
Chris: Mic check, hello?
Slushi: Oh, hi.
Chris: Oh, I had I thought the button I thought I was talking earlier. Apparently, the thing was the thing was off, D'oh!.
Slushi: Oh, no, that is completely fine and understandable.
Chris: I feels a little silly now.
Slushi: Oh, no, that is completely fine.
Member 1: That happens to one of our friends a lot.
Slushi: Yeah. He'll be he'll be gone for like 15 minutes and we think, oh, he's just off eating dinner. He'll come back, he's like, are you telling me I was muted that whole time?
Member 1: It's hilarious.
Chris: Oh, no, I was muted. I muted myself. Hate that. I've- I've been here. I'm here. Hello, hello.
Member 1: How do you-
Chris: So fun, so fun.
Member 1: How do you-
Chris: Oh, well, hey, I feel old. You both what? Early mid 2000s, you first played Sonic? Where were you when Genesis came out in 1991?
Slushi: I wasn't alive.
Chris: Oh, well, I feel old.
Slushi: With age comes wisdom. Rodrey, what did you do? You filled the whole screen with yellow.
Member 1: No, it's fine. I fixed it.
Slushi: One more mistake like that and you're off the team.
Member 1: How dare you?
Slushi: How dare I? How dare I?
Member 1: How dare you? If I go, the whole freaking thing, the whole show goes.
Slushi: Look, if you want sprites done in MS Paint, I'm your boy.
Chris: Oh, boy, you want MS Paint? Call on Asperchu.
Slushi: Hoie.
Chris: Oie.
Slushi: Christie is um an I'm I I've said this before. I'm actually at a loss of words.
Chris: Well, I pull I- I get that a lot, so you're not the only one.
Slushi: Uh, one really neat thing in this part of the game stream chat is when the lightning strikes, Tails actually jumps as a reference to the Sonic OVA.
Chris: Ah! I'm afraid of lightning.
Slushi: That movie. In my opinion, it is both the best way for someone who is un- uninitiated with Sonic to see Sonic and the worst way. It is a delightful mess.
Chris: It was a 1990s!
Slushi: So, uh, Christine, how's how have you been?
Chris: Uh, been doing pretty good, been doing all right. Uh, Magi-chan and I have been swamped and been in each other's bodies the past month. I just got back from California and boy, is my soul tired.
Member 1: Mhm.
Slushi: I was half expecting though. I flew back from such and such and boy, my arms tired. But that's a nice twist on it.
Chris: Well, I teleported back, then I ran there. Got there in got there in less than three hours.
Slushi: Ooh.
Chris: Unless you count unless you count the hour I spent with my friend in Utah.
Member 1: Ooh.
Chris: And Mewtwo were with me, so it was good.
Member 1: Mhm.
Slushi: Having a partner is never, never, never, not good. Isn't that right, Rodgery? You're nothing to me but a tool. This is how I will achieve stardom. I'm bound for great-
Chris: Friendship is Ma- Friendship is Magic!
Slushi: Uh we-
Chris: Friendship is awesomely magical.
Slushi: Um, one thing, uh, one thing that I've personally want to ask you. What's your opinion on the uh, Smash DLC characters?
Chris: Uh, yeah, I like them. I mean especially you got Banjo Kazooie finally. Now we can finally have a new Banjo Kazooie game on console other than Xbox. I mean I mean nothing against the Xbox. I do like them. I do like the Xbox, It's good, It's a good console!
Slushi: Mhm. I'm trying to think of questions. I had a million racing through my mind.
Chris: I've got a million of them. And I'm mortified. Ha ha ha ha.
Member 1: Hm.
Slushi: Um, one thing I remember gosh it's probably been so long just with like the time it takes to edit videos do you remember, uh, Nick Robinson, uh, asking about Rusty's Real Deal Baseball?
Chris: Oh, yes.
Slushi: What was it like meeting him? I've always been a fan of his content.
Chris: Well, didn't meet him personally, meet him in person face to face, but I talked to him. It was a it was a good conversation upon my recollection. And at least he was able to finally figure out, uh, the secret character.
Slushi: The secret character... Um, Alice Angel No, Uh, Magi-chan and- and uh Christine switched bodies back, So.
Chris: Yeah.
Slushi: We are-
Member 1: You're talking to the real deal.
Slushi: The real deal.
Chris: I'm back for a few hours now.
Slushi: Right. Uh, someone asked what's your opinion on the, uh, Sans Mii costume?
Chris: Sans Mii? I don't know I haven't seen- it's a costume? I haven't seen it.
Slushi: Oh, I think it's really cool that Toby actually uh did meet Sakurai in person and they discussed it just to show that like uh you put your you put your passion to a- to a project you'll most likely get something out of it.
Chris: Indeed, you put your soul and heart and effort to it you get the greatest outcome ever!
Slushi: So, uh, one question that the team- team and I have had is should- should the mod feature voice acting? Like, like when an enemy's destroyed, like not- not full fledged cutscenes, but like just little kind of just audio blurbs and like grunts or stuff.
Chris: Yeah, that's okay. I wouldn't mind voice acting, just, uh, you know, mild.
Member 1: Mhm.
Chris: Tell you what, here's the voice, here's a tell you what, you say you Sonichu, you just completed a level. You could be here's your here's your sample from me just in direct thing. All right, Zapin' to the Extreme!
Slushi: Perfect. I'll be sure to I'll be sure to clip that and, and use that. So, uh, what was it like me-
Chris: I can use two more. Let me see.
Slushi: Here, uh, if I download the entire stream, that's gonna be a huge video file and I'll have to spend a lot of time scrubbing through it. So how about just, uh, after it's done, we'll just like record some MP3 files.
Chris: That's fine. I'll just make a team I'll make a team mental notes.
Member 1: Mhm.
Slushi: So, overall, how- how- how have you I already asked that. I'm- I'm sorry again. I'm I'm starstruck.
Chris: Hey, I get that way too, so it's not a big deal.
Slushi: How was the con you went to?
Chris: Bronycon, it was a very good convention. I mean, I mean this one was a four day convention. Uh you can't go wrong with that. And it's like a four day, it's like a four day weekend away from home. And just meeting the the favorites favorite people out of the Brony community. Especially the Analysis and got to meet Andrea Libman, Nicole Oliver and Rebecca Shoichet, very nice people. I also talked I also talked a bit with, uh, Lauren Faust.
Member 1: Mhm.
Chris: Very good experience.
Member 1: Like, I was actually shocked when I heard that you were going to that convention. Like, I was like, Chris Chan is literally an hour away from me.
Slushi: And you didn't take the time to go meet her, Rodgery?
Chris: You're a monster, Inconceivable!
Member 1: Oh, I told my friend, uh, dude, we gotta go.
Slushi: Uh, I'm- I'm gonna be honest here. I've I've met Bronies, but I've never I've never, uh, seen the show myself.
Member 1: I saw like two episodes.
Chris: You can catch up with that on Netflix. It's a really good show. I highly recommend it.
Slushi: Oh, we only have Hulu.
Member 1: I have Netflix.
Chris: Great, you can borrow his computer.
Slushi: Rodgery, quickly, send me your computer. I don't care if it's a desktop. I don't care if it's a laptop. I live on 555 Internet Lane-
Member 1: I'm not giving you my Netflix!
Slushi: I live on 555 Internet Lane, Rodgery.
Chris: Ha ha ha ha!
Member 1: I'm pretty sure there are plenty of websites you can actually see it on Slushi.
Slushi: Oh, let's see. Jake- Jake Clays, I think that's how you pronounce that, um, uh, asked if Minecraft mobs will start appearing during the merge.
Chris: Oh. Hmm. Well, this is not the Minecraft dimension, so that's not likely.
Member 1: Okay.
Chris: That's a whole different alt dimension compared to C 197.
Member 1: Mhm.
Geno Samuel mentioned (2:40:50)
Member 1: Oh, can we get a shoutout to Geno Samuel?
Chris: Aight, Geno?! I like your series! Through Ma- through Magi-Chan watching it, and me catching up with it in mental link... it's a good series and it reminded me of the bad trolls! Worked well! At least... you didn't offend me too much!
Member 2: Yeah, I think he's just doing the series for, like, documentary's sake. I don't think he, like, he doesn't wanna be mean or anything. Geno Samuel's a really nice guy.
Chris: Yes... I see that. He is. Oh my nog- na- now my- Now the brain's trying to remember one where he said something... Where Geno Samuel had said something... Think he was tryin'- he was stiltily singing a song, and... Think it was one of the more recent videos, not number 21... Although that was a fun epic burn from my father when he answered their phone in part 21! They weren't expecting my daddy! But they got 'em!
Slushi: Oh, speaking of your family, how's Barb?
Chris: He's doin' very well. He actually quite capable for her- for her age, and everything.
