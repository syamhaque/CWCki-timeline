Chat
[00:02:40] BlueSpike:
This came from my friend Anneke, who is related to Edward Van Dierten.
[00:02:42] BlueSpike:
[00:03:28] BlueSpike:
julie, these are the main points of Molvania, accd. to Edward Van Dierten: 1. Molvania was an unrecognized territory some 50 miles in radius on the eastern edge of Georgia, a nation that was once a part of the former Soviet Union; its capital was Lagodekhi. The territory came into existence during the mid-1980s, and the United States, under suggestion from both NATO, the CIA and then-President Ronald Reagan, established a small embassy there in the hopes of helping the territory become an independent free republic.
2. The original entry in Wikipedia on Molvania was written by my other niece and fellow diplomat, Cameron Van Dierten. However, the Georgian government--who took issue with Molvania's existence from the start--decided to rewrite it in a manner that would present the territory as false, even going so far as to commission a faux-travel guide from Australia--of all places--to cement the territory's place in history as, well, a joke.
3. Earlier this year, possibly due to the disappointment of losing South Ossetia last August, the Georgian government covertly "re-absorbed" Molvania, erasing all traces of the territory's existence.
[00:04:32] Christopher C.W.C.:
Awesome. I'll write that info down after I finish up writing the directions. I'd print all this, but my black ink cart got messed up after multiple refillings.
[00:04:55] BlueSpike:
Ah.
[00:11:00] Christopher C.W.C.:
I've got the directions all written. I used the back of your letter to write half of the set of directions on, and the cardstock paper your pictures are taped onto for the remaining half.
[00:11:23] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'll use another piece of paper to hand-write your information from your friend.
[00:13:16] BlueSpike:
Okay.
[00:23:07] BlueSpike:
I got my green-card scanned as ID.
[00:26:11] Christopher C.W.C.:
Wow.
[00:26:21] BlueSpike: :)
[00:26:52] BlueSpike:
Maybe you can show this to your parents, and they'll believe me and you can come to Ohio!
[00:27:24] Christopher C.W.C.:
I guess, but I'm looking right at it, and some of the information is blurred out.
[00:27:48] BlueSpike:
Yeah, my friend (whos scanner i used) told me to blur that out, because it's not a good idea to put that out on the internet.
[00:28:07] Christopher C.W.C.:
I understand. I'll copy the pic and show it to my family on my PSP.
[00:29:03] Christopher C.W.C.:
also, for my info, in the info from Anneke, she said the capitol was spelled with an "I" at the end, Lagodekhi, is that the full spelling?
[00:29:56] BlueSpike:
Yes, that's correct.
[00:30:04] Christopher C.W.C.:
cool.
[00:30:40] Christopher C.W.C.:
well, if my father is awake, I'll go let him know about all this, and if not, then I'll tell him later this morning.
[00:33:24] Christopher C.W.C.:
Also, FYI, while I was writing the directions, I had a Skype window open for Sarah May, and was chatting with her a bit. She fully supports you and me being together, and even vouched for you being Truly Julie. :)
[00:33:41] BlueSpike: :)
[00:34:20] Christopher C.W.C.:
also, the video is still uploading, but to let you know, I've gone "Romeo and Juliet" in my effort, but I feel it works well. :)
[00:34:36] BlueSpike: :)
[00:34:45] BlueSpike:
Don't forget to show the ID to your mother, too.
[00:35:10] Christopher C.W.C.:
I will; no worries. ;)
[00:36:29] Christopher C.W.C.:
I've just reformattted the pic to .jpg and saved it onto my "CWC" memory stick duo (it's a Light Blue 1 GB Memory Stick Duo with a bunch of images from my Slideshow, Sonichu book, comic pages, etc.
[00:37:01] Christopher C.W.C.:
it's safe for you to take your ID off the internet now.
[00:37:06] Christopher C.W.C.:
I have it.
[00:37:08] Christopher C.W.C.: :)
[00:37:11] Christopher C.W.C.:
brb
[00:39:56] Christopher C.W.C.:
my mom and dad are asleep now; I'll inform them later.
[00:40:06] BlueSpike:
K
[00:40:20] Christopher C.W.C.:
At least I have all this on paper, and your ID on my PSP
[00:40:28] BlueSpike:
K
[00:40:50] Christopher C.W.C.:
BTW, did you talk to your friend about sending me the files of your pictures from the 15th?
[00:41:27] BlueSpike:
Ah, I forgot.
[00:41:28] BlueSpike:
I'm sorry.
[00:41:36] Christopher C.W.C.:
it's okay.
[00:41:37] BlueSpike:
But we can both go and get the files once you're here. :)
[00:42:02] Christopher C.W.C.:
that's an idea, but it'll be like March at the earliest when I would be able to drive up there.
[00:42:09] BlueSpike:
...
[00:42:12] BlueSpike:
It's 50 dollars at most.
[00:42:17] BlueSpike:
It's a 7 hour drive.
[00:42:57] Christopher C.W.C.:
do you have your friend's e-mail address; I can ask her myself.Christopher C.W.C.I understand that, but I need my tugboat to come in, so I can have the minimum 50 dollars.
[00:42:59] BlueSpike:
You are STRESSING ME OUT.
[00:43:08] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'm sorry.
[00:43:08] BlueSpike:
Oh.
[00:43:14] BlueSpike:
I'm sorry, I forgot about the tugboat..
[00:43:24] Christopher C.W.C.:
yes, the monthly tugboat.
[00:43:35] Christopher C.W.C.:
would you like to know why I call it a Tugboat?
[00:43:44] BlueSpike:
Sure.
[00:43:45] Christopher C.W.C.:
it's a fun story.
[00:44:35] Christopher C.W.C.:
anyway, you know the expression, "Our ship has come in," well that refers to a HUGE one-time amout of money, which can compare to a Luxury Ship that can easily sink.
[00:45:20] Christopher C.W.C.:
and a Tugboat is more reliable, because even though it's smaller, it's built tougher, and it's usually better on time in that sense.
[00:45:53] BlueSpike:
Heh.
[00:45:55] Christopher C.W.C.:
so, I refer to my monthly income as a Tugboat, whereas I would refer to say winning the Lottery as a Luxary Ship.
[00:46:30] Christopher C.W.C.:
Chalk that idea up to a spot of creative thinking. :)
[00:47:07] Christopher C.W.C.:
anyway, I can ask your friend to send me the pictures in an e-mail if I can have her address.
[00:48:27] BlueSpike:
I'm looking for them right now, she says.
[00:48:41] BlueSpike:
You'll have the pictures soon, don't worry.
[00:48:46] BlueSpike:
So, how was your day?
[00:48:56] Christopher C.W.C.:
cool. is Anneke your friend we've been talking about?
[00:48:59] Christopher C.W.C.:
it's been okay.
[00:49:18] Christopher C.W.C.:
how was your day?
[00:49:33] BlueSpike:
No, it's my other friend, Susan.
[00:49:38] BlueSpike:
My day was alright.
[00:49:39] Christopher C.W.C.:
oh, okay.
[00:49:53] Christopher C.W.C.:
did you go to your church?
[00:50:49] BlueSpike:
Not today, no.
[00:51:06] BlueSpike:
I was a bit too tired.
[00:51:10] Christopher C.W.C.:
ah
[00:51:32] Christopher C.W.C.:
for my info, it is a methodist church, yes?
[00:51:42] BlueSpike:
Yes.
[00:51:45] Christopher C.W.C.:
cool.
[00:52:10] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'm not sure I told you before, but I was baptized in my church last Mother's Day
[00:52:27] Christopher C.W.C.:
it was a great day for my mother. :)
[00:52:34] BlueSpike:
Hm.
[00:52:49] Christopher C.W.C.:
I have copies of the bulliten from that day, if you want one.
[00:53:13] BlueSpike:
That's okay.
[00:53:50] BlueSpike:
My friend found them, she's uploading them to tinypic.
[00:54:33] Christopher C.W.C.:
anyway, after I was baptized, I received a certificate of baptism (later framed it and have it in my room), a wooden cross with grains from where Jesus was on the cross in a small window, a church ornament, and a few other trinkets.
[00:54:36] Christopher C.W.C.:
cool.
[00:55:13] Christopher C.W.C.:
Tell Susan I said thank you for taking your pictures and now uploading them.
[00:56:04] Christopher C.W.C.:
she did a good job taking your pics, and you did excellent in posing for them. ;)
[00:56:15] BlueSpike: :)
[00:56:22] BlueSpike:
What did you think of them, the pictures?
[00:56:32] BlueSpike:
http://i42.tinypic.com/9jioau.jpg
[00:56:37] BlueSpike:
http://i41.tinypic.com/2w34xmx.jpg
[00:56:41] BlueSpike:
http://i43.tinypic.com/fygynq.jpg
[00:56:45] BlueSpike:
There they are.
[00:56:48] Christopher C.W.C.:
Positively Gorgeous. :D
[00:57:02] BlueSpike:
Anything else you noticed about me? ;)
[00:59:08] Christopher C.W.C.:
You have a pretty smile, I like your hairstyle, I compared your eyes to chocolate-covered strawberries; beautiful, sweet and even better on the inside. You have a cute nose. and, well, you're sexy too. :)
[01:00:21] Christopher C.W.C.:
Something else I've just noticed; in two of them, you were wearing your shirt; in the one you took just for me, is that your bra?
[01:00:59] BlueSpike:
Yes. :)
[01:01:14] Christopher C.W.C.:
Wow!
[01:01:16] Christopher C.W.C.: :D
[01:04:14] Christopher C.W.C.:
I have them downloaded and saved now.
[01:04:40] Christopher C.W.C.:
Also, in the one where you were lying on the floor, were you wearing a skirt?
[01:05:00] BlueSpike:
Yeah.
[01:05:11] Christopher C.W.C.:
Lovely. (L)
[01:06:34] Christopher C.W.C.:
and I tell you the truth, I saw your face first in all three pictures before I looked at everything else.
[01:06:52] Christopher C.W.C.:
You won't have to tell me "Eyes Up Here". :D
[01:07:17] Christopher C.W.C.:
unless we're getting intimate.
[01:07:27] BlueSpike: :)
[01:07:51] Christopher C.W.C.:
I Love You Truly, Julie. :-*
[01:08:00] BlueSpike:
I love you too, Chris.
[01:08:05] BlueSpike: :*
[01:08:22] Christopher C.W.C.:
I gtg eat something; I'm a bit hungry.
[01:08:28] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'll TTYL, Julie-Heart.
[01:08:49] Christopher C.W.C.:
and I will inform my family of all the information I've hand-written tonight.
[01:09:08] Christopher C.W.C.:
and, maybe, then some. :)
[01:09:55] Christopher C.W.C.:
You take care, and enjoy the video after it's fully uploaded.
[01:10:28] Christopher C.W.C.:
(L)(L)(L)(L)(L)(L)(L)
[01:11:43] BlueSpike: :)
[05:58:08] Christopher C.W.C.:
Zlkavszka, Julie-Heart.
[05:58:41] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'm sure you're catching some sleep for yourself for now.
but I wanted to ask you something.
[05:58:51] Christopher C.W.C.:
Just to make it clear for me,
[06:00:53] BlueSpike:
What is it?
[06:02:15] Christopher C.W.C.:
You grew up in Lagodekhi, which was the capitol of Molvania. I've typed in Lagodekhi, and just as your friend has said earlier, it was at the eastern edge of Georgia.
[06:02:30] Christopher C.W.C.:
Actually, come to think of it, it's more of a verification of my findings.
[06:02:49] Christopher C.W.C.:
Molvania was east of Georgia, yes?
[06:03:23] Christopher C.W.C.:
I mean, when my father was trying to find Molvania on his maps, he found some theories of his own.
[06:03:55] Christopher C.W.C.:
he confused Moldavia (something like that) for Molvania.
[06:04:17] Christopher C.W.C.:
So, this will be good for his findings.
[06:04:33] Christopher C.W.C.:
If I'm stressing you, I apologize.
[06:04:57] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'm only confirming that Georgia and Molvania were neighbors
[06:05:04] Christopher C.W.C.: *neighboring countries
[06:06:52] Christopher C.W.C.:
I guess I didn't have to bother you with that inquiry, the thing was when I just found the map in a search on my PS3's internet, there was a lack of an outline on one point.
[06:07:11] Christopher C.W.C.:
my bad.
[06:08:30] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'm awake, because I've picked up some z's earlier. I was surprised to see you still up; I thought you'd be sleeping for work later.
[06:09:48] Christopher C.W.C.:
Julie?
[06:10:18] Christopher C.W.C.:
Sweetheart?
[06:11:41] Christopher C.W.C.:
did you fall asleep?
[06:12:45] Christopher C.W.C.:
It's okay. I'm waiting for my father to be getting up in a couple of hours, so I can update him with all the information.
[06:13:11] Christopher C.W.C.:
Also, I have installed your pics for my PS3 and PSP Wallpapers.
[06:13:29] Christopher C.W.C.:
I ended up using the pic of you on the floor in your skirt on both systems. :)
[06:14:44] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'll tell you, just seeing you and thinking fondly of you turned me on. I masturbated to your picture and thinking of you during that time while it was displayed on my TV on my PS3 wallpaper.
[06:15:49] Christopher C.W.C.:
But take that as a compliment, because it was another step closer to actually being with you in that sense. it made me release a bit quicker than recently.
[06:16:51] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'll let you go, and I will TTYL.
[06:17:00] Christopher C.W.C.:
Sleep well, Julie-Heart. :-*
[06:17:06] Christopher C.W.C.:
Ickvenschwal.
[06:17:10] Christopher C.W.C.:
(L)(L)(L)(L)(L)
[09:16:07] Christopher C.W.C.:
I've just gave my father the information, and spelled out the name of Lagodekhi to him. He's having trouble finding that in his map books. problems seem to be that he needs a more current atlas; he has books published in the late 60s.
[09:17:14] Christopher C.W.C.:
I plan on going to the Alderman Library this afternoon and check out an Reader's Digest atlas from the 1990s; a map of Molvania should be in there, since it was established in the 80s.
[09:17:34] Christopher C.W.C.:
My mother is still sleeping; I will show her your ID as soon as she wakes up.
[09:17:49] Christopher C.W.C.:
The country-search is frustrating me too.
[09:18:21] Christopher C.W.C.:
Importantly, I believe you, and I believe in Molvania.
[09:19:05] Christopher C.W.C.:
I can relate on being made a mockery of to a point of being non-existant. That happened to me among the Troll-Talk within the past couple of years.
[09:19:27] Christopher C.W.C.:
anyway, I will continue to do my best to find Molvania on a map and show it to my father.
[09:20:14] Christopher C.W.C.:
something else puzzles me, it was said before that it was close to Romania, yet Lagodekhi is on the east line of Georgia, far from Romania.
[09:20:30] Christopher C.W.C.:
But I don't want to bother you with too many thinks to thunk.
[09:20:35] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'll check in again later.
[09:20:41] Christopher C.W.C.:
I Love You, Julie-Heart. :-*
[10:48:22] Christopher C.W.C.:
Also, on a positive note, I have your ID on my PSP; that proves you for you, period. :)
[10:49:12] Christopher C.W.C.:
and after I get another black in cart, I will print it out for my paper reference, to go with you letter and pictures.
[10:49:27] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'll check in later after I see what I can find at the Alderman.
[11:27:19] Christopher C.W.C.:
Just checking in again.
[11:28:10] Christopher C.W.C.:
I have good news, my mother feels better about you now; I showed her your ID, and she has warmed up a bit towards you now.
[11:30:06] Christopher C.W.C.:
A spot of bad news, though, she is still against me going to Ohio at the moment, but I think she is leading to a point where she will grant me emotional support in the trip, so still good news there.
[11:31:30] Christopher C.W.C.:
and I am looking in my congregation for an escort to Ohio, if my mother doesn't want to come with me. Fortunately, Rocky, my Pastoral Counsolor has relatives in Ohio, and she goes there like every few weeks, months or so.
[11:32:17] Christopher C.W.C.:
So, I will be talking to Rocky more about you, our relationship and the trip to Ohio.
[11:33:35] Christopher C.W.C.:
Hopefully, I'll be able to make the trip in March, depending on how soon things turn up, aside from the money, which I will have at least 50 or 100 dollars, aside from what I use to pay my family, and my bills.
[11:34:16] Christopher C.W.C.:
I know that I am an adult, and I shouldn't have to go through these restrictions, but at least I am finding safe routes that my mother can agree on.
[11:35:15] Christopher C.W.C.:
Also, she has expressed her concern about the international diseases that can follow one from another country. But I have assured her that you have confirmed for me that you are free of such diseases.
[11:36:31] Christopher C.W.C.:
I've added that you've had a medical check-up to confirm that, before or after you arrived in Ohio. Please feel free to correct me if I was incorrect.
[11:37:19] Christopher C.W.C.:
Final Point: My family is feeling more positive and trusting towards you.
[11:37:55] Christopher C.W.C.:
I need to restart my PC to install a VirusScan update, so I'll restart my Skype and talk to you again later.
[11:38:18] Christopher C.W.C.:
Be happy, Sweetheart. Things are working better for our coming together. :)
[11:38:28] Christopher C.W.C.:
Ickvenschwal. :-*

[13:43:36] Christopher C.W.C.:
Hey, Julie.
[13:43:56] Christopher C.W.C.:
I've just got back from buying a new black ink cartridge.
[13:46:03] Christopher C.W.C.:
anyway, I've just received a call on my cell; they left a voicemail, then I deleted it. "She" called you a troll, and made a claim that the sex video I sent you was uploaded onto YouTube, then deleted. My first thought was shock, but then I realized that it might have been your brother up to his tricks again. Please verify that for me later today in a PSN Chat; I will be waiting for you to log in and send me an invite.
[13:47:09] Christopher C.W.C.:
I was expecting some "Troll Claims" since I've revealed you as my Sweetheart; the same thing happened before with Panda.
[13:48:24] Christopher C.W.C.:
It just makes me shudder to know that people can be soo cruel and jealous, even to LIE and "hand on a Bible" say that they themselves were not trolls, when I know better.
[13:49:49] Christopher C.W.C.:
Even to hear about the detail of the "Video of me having sex with a doll" just put me in a state of surprise. and you were the only one who got that file, so the only conclusion is that your brother must be up to his old tricks again.
[13:51:52] Christopher C.W.C.:
Again, I'll wait for you to verify my theory as true on the PSN Chat later today. Also, please talk to your brother, and ask him to stop it. I have been doing big favors for you and him (since he can play your downloaded games as well); I had trusted him when he said he would not Troll me again.
[13:52:09] Christopher C.W.C.:
I need to rest this stress off. I'll TTYL, Sweetheart.
[13:52:26] Christopher C.W.C.:
I still fully trust you, Julie, and I still Love You with my heart. :-*
[16:53:28] BlueSpike:
Chris, I tried to keep it hidden, but I think he found it. I left my computer on while I worked, and he must've found it.
[16:53:40] BlueSpike:
I beat him up, though, and he promised he wouldn't do it again.
[19:44:01] BlueSpike:
Hope you don't mind if I go on...
[19:51:51] BlueSpike:
Chris, I've wondered, you think you could maybe write/draw a Hentai story? You could put it on the Luv Shack.
[21:25:24] Christopher C.W.C.:
Zlkavszka, Julie-Heart. :)
[21:26:38] Christopher C.W.C.:
a hentai story.
I will give that much thought.
[21:27:00] Christopher C.W.C.:
but it's looking good.
[21:28:20] Christopher C.W.C.:
I have a good number of hentai stories to get an idea from, and I can make it relate to a Sonichu/Rosechu story.
[21:29:38] Christopher C.W.C.:
anyway, I'm happy to hear that I was right. You didn't have to beat him up, but I'm glad you talked to him for me about that.
[21:29:50] Christopher C.W.C.:
Thank you, Sweetheart. :-*
[21:33:50] Christopher C.W.C.:
Also, I'm sorry I missed your chat window earlier; I was busy doing some work at the time.
[21:34:00] Christopher C.W.C.:
drawing
[21:37:54] Christopher C.W.C.:
I also have been preparing myself for the funeral tomorrow. I need to hit the hay earlier tonight, so I will be able to drive my share of the trip when my parents feel unable to.
[21:40:27] BlueSpike:
Hello, Chris...
[21:40:37] Christopher C.W.C.:
there you are. :)
[21:40:38] BlueSpike:
This is Max.
[21:40:41] Christopher C.W.C.:
oh.
[21:40:47] Christopher C.W.C.:
Julie's brother?
[21:40:50] BlueSpike:
I bet you were excited just now..
[21:41:00] BlueSpike:
Julie chose to take a nap..
[21:41:19] Christopher C.W.C.:
okay.
[21:41:32] BlueSpike:
I'd suggest you join Mumble, you may find it in your best interest.
[21:42:00] Christopher C.W.C.:
what's going on?
[21:42:18] BlueSpike:
You may find it in your best interest.
[21:42:23] BlueSpike:
I'd hurry, we're not very patient.
[21:42:31] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'll be there shortly.
[21:44:37] BlueSpike:
Hurry up, Chandler.
[21:45:29] Christopher C.W.C.:
I understand. I've got to clean up the mess you started.
[21:45:40] BlueSpike:
Oh, it's more than that.
[21:45:59] BlueSpike:
Heheheh, I see you found out what I've done?
[21:58:53] BlueSpike:
Angered, Chrissy?
[21:59:16] Christopher C.W.C.:
Why can't you see the kind human being that I am?
[21:59:25] BlueSpike:
Because, the things you do.
[21:59:26] Christopher C.W.C.:
I have cared for all my women very much.
[21:59:41] BlueSpike:
The...awful way you act, in attempts to get a 'Mate'.
[21:59:49] BlueSpike:
A 'boyfriend-free girl'.
[21:59:55] BlueSpike:
It sickens me that you'd be that way.
[22:00:03] BlueSpike:
I don't even know why my sister would want you.
[22:00:17] Christopher C.W.C.:
Look, Julie asked me herself to make that video, and I did as she wished, because I cared and respected her wishes.
[22:00:41] Christopher C.W.C.:
because she cares about me deeply and she respects me truly. And I care and respect her in the same way truly.
[22:01:00] BlueSpike:
It's too late now, Chris.
[22:01:06] BlueSpike:
I'm taking Julie to Clyde.
[22:01:13] BlueSpike:
Maybe you can convince me to do otherwise, come back in Mumble.
[22:01:46] BlueSpike:
You have 5 minutes.
[22:01:47] Christopher C.W.C.:
look, I plan on spending my good money and drive to her in your house.
[22:01:54] BlueSpike:
I'd hurry.
[22:02:01] BlueSpike:
Talk to my leader, Clyde.
[22:02:13] BlueSpike:
Answer him.
[22:18:15] BlueSpike:
I'm driving Julie there now, Chris.
[22:18:18] BlueSpike:
Heheheh.
[22:18:24] BlueSpike:
Any last words before I depart?
[22:18:47] Christopher C.W.C.:
Leave her be; do not drive her anywhere.
[22:18:56] BlueSpike:
That's not working, Julie's coming with me to HQ.
[22:19:01] BlueSpike:
Inform Clyde for me, would you?
[22:19:14] Christopher C.W.C.:
NO
[22:19:19] Christopher C.W.C.:
Don't go anywhere!
[22:19:31] BlueSpike:
As JKH said, 'toodles'.
[22:20:09] BlueSpike:
Oh, almost forgot.
[22:20:19] BlueSpike:
Tell Clyde for me, and maybe I'll let Julie go a little sooner.
[22:20:22] BlueSpike:
It's a deal.
[22:20:35] Christopher C.W.C.:
tell clyde what you're telling me?
[22:20:44] BlueSpike:
Tell Clyde Julie will be at HQ in 10 minutes.
[22:21:05] BlueSpike:
Hurry it up.
[22:21:25] BlueSpike:
Now, toodles.
[22:21:35] Christopher C.W.C.:
LEAVE HER ALONE
[22:21:43] BlueSpike:
I will not.
[22:21:48] BlueSpike:
It's not gonna work, Chris.
[22:21:52] BlueSpike:
Anything that may win me over?
[22:22:00] BlueSpike:
Or is that all you'll say, like a broken record?
[22:22:01] Christopher C.W.C.:
what do you want?
[22:22:05] BlueSpike:
Hmm...
[22:22:11] BlueSpike:
Nothing, I'm taking her to HQ.
[22:22:24] BlueSpike:
Maybe I'll give her limited internet access.
[22:22:25] BlueSpike:
Maybe.
[22:23:20] BlueSpike:
I'll talk to you after I get back.
[22:23:21] BlueSpike:
Wait for me.
[22:33:28] BlueSpike:
Hello, Chrissy.
[22:33:43] BlueSpike:
My sister is now safely kept in HQ.
[22:34:22] BlueSpike:
You there, Chris?
[22:34:32] BlueSpike:
You may want to keep in close contact with me if you wish to see Julie.
[22:35:35] BlueSpike:
Come on now, Chrissy.
[22:36:50] BlueSpike:
I expected better from you.
[22:45:51] BlueSpike:
I do however, expect you to hide.
[22:46:12] BlueSpike:
Like now.
[22:52:19] BlueSpike:
If you truly love my sister, you'll answer.
[22:58:55] BlueSpike:
Hahahahaha.
[23:10:17] BlueSpike:
My anger is reaching a point, Chris.
[23:10:40] BlueSpike:
Fail to respond tonight..
[23:19:18] BlueSpike:
You think I'm BLOWING SMOKE?
[23:19:24] BlueSpike:
This is quite a thing to say, Chris.
[23:19:37] BlueSpike:
I figured you'd run off to the PS3.
[23:20:20] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'm here.
[23:20:30] BlueSpike:
You DARE take me for a liar.
[23:20:33] BlueSpike:
I'm saddened, Chris.
[23:20:43] BlueSpike:
Tell me..
[23:20:45] BlueSpike:
How do you feel?
[23:20:59] Christopher C.W.C.:
emotionally terrible and crestfallen.
[23:21:05] BlueSpike:
Wonderful.
[23:21:08] Christopher C.W.C.:
why are you doing this to me?
[23:21:14] Christopher C.W.C.:
I thought you were over this, Max.
[23:21:19] BlueSpike:
Would you care to speak to me through your mic?
[23:21:45] BlueSpike:
Hello.
[23:21:54] BlueSpike:
Heheheheh.
[23:21:59] BlueSpike:
You don't deserve my voice.
[23:22:14] BlueSpike:
You really wanna know?
[23:22:23] BlueSpike:
I don't want my sister to be with you.
[23:22:27] BlueSpike:
You think games can buy me over?
[23:22:33] BlueSpike:
You take me for one easily bribed!@?
[23:22:38] BlueSpike:
FOR ME?
[23:22:43] BlueSpike:
You hated me as far as I know!
[23:22:48] BlueSpike:
I barely do!
[23:23:10] BlueSpike:
You forgive me for taking my own sister away?
[23:23:13] BlueSpike:
Ah.
[23:23:15] BlueSpike:
That.
[23:23:29] BlueSpike:
Chris, why do you love my sister so?
[23:23:40] BlueSpike:
I don't know why myself.
[23:23:53] BlueSpike:
I doubt that, Chris.
[23:23:58] BlueSpike:
Yes, but she lived with me.
[23:24:03] BlueSpike:
She had no other place to go.
[23:24:07] BlueSpike:
I took her in.
[23:24:21] BlueSpike:
Yes, it is.
[23:24:29] BlueSpike:
Just to see that she came here for THIS, you.
[23:24:50] BlueSpike:
Yes, and the fact I SAW THAT AWFUL VIDEO.
[23:24:55] BlueSpike:
COMPARING MY SISTER TO A DOLL!
[23:25:18] BlueSpike:
Really.
[23:25:29] BlueSpike:
...
[23:25:33] BlueSpike:
I couldn't put it better myself.
[23:25:36] BlueSpike:
It can't be unseen.
[23:26:01] BlueSpike:
I don't know why she said that.
[23:26:23] BlueSpike:
I'm her older brother, my family entrusted me to look after my sister!!
[23:26:30] BlueSpike:
Not inside a fucking doll!
[23:26:59] BlueSpike:
I can't, you know.
[23:26:59] BlueSpike:
Do that.
[23:27:06] BlueSpike:
I can't talk to her exactly.
[23:27:10] BlueSpike:
She's at HQ, remember?
[23:27:16] BlueSpike:
I'd rather not.
[23:27:27] BlueSpike:
I don't think I should.
[23:27:29] BlueSpike:
She needs time.
[23:27:36] BlueSpike:
Listen..
[23:27:38] BlueSpike:
You truly love her?
[23:27:42] BlueSpike:
Then come and get her.
[23:28:08] BlueSpike:
You have 5 days to come to my home in Ohio, I believe you have the address. To come here, and I shall show you the way.
[23:28:32] BlueSpike:
Well, that's your problem.
[23:28:33] BlueSpike:
Get a job.
[23:28:43] BlueSpike:
If you don't come within 5 days, dire things will happen.
[23:28:56] BlueSpike:
That is how things are done, you need a deadline.
[23:28:57] BlueSpike:
I do.
[23:29:02] BlueSpike:
I'm trying to make sure she gets a suitable man!
[23:29:05] BlueSpike:
I want you to prove it!
[23:29:14] BlueSpike:
Rocky, yes.
[23:29:31] BlueSpike:
...
[23:29:35] BlueSpike:
You're a lazy fuck!
[23:29:40] BlueSpike:
I demand to see you here in 5 days.
[23:30:04] BlueSpike:
What will it be?
[23:30:08] BlueSpike:
Your true sweetheart..
[23:30:11] BlueSpike:
Or your mother's law?
[23:30:17] BlueSpike:
I had a choice like that once.
[23:30:38] BlueSpike:
I believe that's correct.
[23:30:58] BlueSpike:
No.
[23:31:00] BlueSpike:
Let me tell you.
[23:31:09] BlueSpike:
You come to my home, you know the address.
[23:31:15] BlueSpike:
I show you the way to our base.
[23:31:31] BlueSpike:
The base..
[23:31:34] BlueSpike:
Of the Miscreants.
[23:31:42] BlueSpike:
Run by Clyde Cash.
[23:31:59] BlueSpike:
My and Clyde will escort you to Julie.
[23:32:03] BlueSpike:
You and her will be free to leave.
[23:32:17] BlueSpike:
Yes.
[23:32:28] BlueSpike:
But be warned, if you try ANYTHING, measures will be taken.
[23:32:43] BlueSpike:
If you do things like you're told, yes.
[23:32:57] BlueSpike:
Fail to comply, and..I don't think I should tell you.
[23:33:04] BlueSpike:
I'm sorry for your loss.
[23:33:19] BlueSpike:
Tell me..When should we expect you?
[23:33:27] BlueSpike:
Clyde tends to love to set up the 'party'.
[23:33:49] BlueSpike:
I'm not setting up anything, I swear on my life.
[23:33:53] BlueSpike:
You come here, take my sister, that's it.
[23:34:03] BlueSpike:
Oh, I see.
[23:34:08] BlueSpike:
I meant set up by decorate and shit.
[23:34:19] BlueSpike:
He actually likes to make the area look nice.
[23:34:38] BlueSpike:
I assure you, you can tell him yourself in Mumble.
[23:34:57] BlueSpike:
Then..
[23:35:00] BlueSpike:
We will talk after.
[23:35:08] BlueSpike:
See you after.
[23:35:38] BlueSpike:
Say hello.
[23:36:34] BlueSpike:
Ask about Clyde.
[23:36:41] Christopher C.W.C.:
Clyde's not there, now what?
[23:36:46] BlueSpike:
Just ask where we went.
[23:36:51] BlueSpike:
You may gather information.
[23:37:14] BlueSpike:
Tell them everything.
[23:38:43] BlueSpike:
Tell them what I did.
[23:38:44] BlueSpike:
Please do.
[23:50:18] BlueSpike:
I'm sorry about that, I'm actually watching family guy.
[23:50:31] BlueSpike:
Mine thing is on voice activated.
[23:50:37] BlueSpike:
The one where Meg becomes pretty.
[23:56:44] BlueSpike:
T them that I'm a troll, and ask them what they think. They don't seem to care..
[23:57:10] BlueSpike:
W...
[23:57:14] BlueSpike:
I said TELL THEM I'M A TROLL.
[23:57:16] BlueSpike:
NOT THAT I'M NOT.
[23:57:17] BlueSpike:
SILLY.
[23:58:27] BlueSpike:
Tell them what I did.
[23:58:35] BlueSpike:
Hmm.
[23:59:03] BlueSpike:
I'd prefer if you call it Miscreant HQ.
[23:59:40] BlueSpike:
