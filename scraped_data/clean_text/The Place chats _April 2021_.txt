Chris
Hey, @everyone.
Today is @MKR’s Birthday.
Happy Birthday, Meghan!
😊⚡️💙⚡️
Kyle
That's sweet.
Have a fat frog.

Yay
Thanks guys, its been a pretty good day so far
Chris
Also, @Deleted User, to answer your question, it is best for @Nova to answer you directly about that.
Birth date signs are one method as well.
But, there are also Totem spirit animals as well, and to determine those, the individual need only but ask for their respective spirit animal to present themselves.
Kyle
Least they managed to get the correct animals this time, even if this concept is ambiguous at best, as most slightly racist liberal idealism on new age ideals are.
As in, they're all tentatively found on the correct continent.
Chris
So, Kyle, based on the birth sign chart, what is your Spirit Animal?
Or if you have asked them personally to present themselves, what are they?
Kyle
I don't really get the whole calendar thing cutting so cleanly.
Chris
I could press on further by asking for your birth date, Kyle.
Kyle
Apparently beaver, via internet spirituality.
Chris
Oh! So, you’re a Taurus.
Kyle
Although playing a game for these kind of things, it's a very interesting phenomenon in psychology.
As a sample.
Chris
Considering our past conversations, it does make much more sense that you have that heavy, and rather temperamental, birth sign.
Kyle
"your reserve is almost as well-developed as your sensitivity. While your peers and coworkers may categorize you as shy or timid, this is only because you are more comfortable working in the background. Similarly to your lack of comfort with the spotlight, you also find it difficult to open up about your feelings and inner thoughts. Luckily, you are very open with your loved ones and can express your most intimate thoughts to your friends and family with ease."
1-5 how accurate?
I just believe in Sturgeon's law, I'm an optimist.
Chris
#BullKyle
Play on words with “bulk” and your name to make your sign a bit more clear.
4
Kyle
And that's a description of a sign I chose randomly to demonstrate.
I haven't pitched someone through a window recently enough to really qualify as temperamental. That Penn and Teller show was interesting though.
The idea being that it's possible to write fluff that's almost universal because you have some constants.
Everyone thinks they're above average by some arbitrary amount, so just give someone boilerplate niceties and hope they'll part with some cash.
Chris
Yeah, you’ve actually pulled what I’ve got earlier in analyzing myself with Numerology.
Kyle
The philosophy behind zero is probably better written.
Chris
And using this chart, I took my oldest name for this life, “Christopher Weston Chandler”, and converted them to numbers, and did the math.
I ended up with Three.
Kyle
Check 25, it'll probably also rate a 4, although maybe a 3 now.
Statistics always beats attempts at clairvoyance.
Chris
Yeah, 25 is Not so accurate.
Kyle
Like that psychic chicken episode of PoM.
Chris
Only a 1 or 2 out of 5 at best.
Kyle
It's a two part test for really any concept, has it been weaponized or sold.
Like hypnosis.
Chris
But you are right about one thing: while this information is good for identifying some of your faults that you can then better address at that time if you haven’t already, it’s only partially relevant in future moments when you’ve matured further and got a better understanding of everything.
More or less, to most.
Kyle
Aside from narcissism, which is remarkably on the low end considering and barely rates, I'm not aware of any.
So any specifics?
Deleted User
Cool
Chris
Well, we have learned something new here: @MKR and @Nova are both Taurus signs.

Actually, I don't think the Indians ever invented calendars.
Least not the NA ones.
Deleted User
@The Fool
this is the fool , they're new but I think they'll fit in fine , there name spoke to me it reminded me of the tarot card
Their *
Kyle
Rider Waite has nice art.
Deleted User
And this is para she's also cool @Deleted User
The fool is also a Buddhist
Kyle
I just know a lot of Indian things are entirely made up, or incorrectly attributed in a monoregional way.

Kyle
It's as dumb as saying France and Britain are the same.
Deleted User
[quotes Kyle's "I just know a lot of Indian things are entirely made up, or incorrectly attributed in a monoregional way." line]
@Nova everything is made up innit
Kyle
A lot of etiological or origin mythos is blankspace.
Chris
What you considered “Made Up” in this universe is actually real and manifested in other alt-universes and timelines, in addition to the future moments in This universe, here, on its own time.
Kyle
Explaining the world in a way we attribute to analogy, but may have once been literal.

Fairies are cute
Kyle
The dimension of the gas station Indian, at least something that broadly contradictory seems like it would have even less consistency and longevity.
Chris
So says the BullKyle.
