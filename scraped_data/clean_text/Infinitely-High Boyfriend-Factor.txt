“
With the infinitely high Boyfriend-Factor, I am not fond of about 99.999999999996% of the total male population, with a margin-of-error of the 4 billionth of a percent (for about 100 men) of whom are okay acquaintences. Those doofs get all the luck, having a Sweetheart to care for and to be cared from, getting all the hugs, kisses and e motional support and the security of a solid future without lonliness and with love and children.

Get used to it, Chris.
The Infinitely-High Boyfriend-Factor is Chris's primary concern on his Love Quest. It refers to the incredibly high probability that any given girl he speaks to will already have a boyfriend, making it impossible for him to find a sweetheart. The fear of this factor leaves Chris all-but paralyzed when he even thinks about speaking to a woman in real life, a fear he has named noviophobia.
Mathematicians have worked in vain for years to disprove Chris's theorem, but the proof is in the pudding. Chris is still single, so it must be because all the JERKS have taken all the pretty girls. This realization led him to narrow his search and focus on boyfriend-free girls.
If one uses the recently passed number of 8 billion people, and assuming that half are men, applying the Infinitely-High Boyfriend-Factor means that there are 4,000,000,000 * 0.000000000004 = 0.016 males in the world that Chris doesn't hate.
