Silvia 06:20 PM

what the fuck happened to his wall
it's full of holes
Silvia 06:22 PM
Probably punched it or somthing
The Fool 06:22 PM
that would be funny as fuck
The WCT 06:22 PM
holy shit.
The Fool 06:22 PM
I didn't know he was capable of that
The WCT 06:22 PM
[Replying to "holy shit."]
Chris is MATI.
Silvia 06:22 PM
I’m just guessing.
The WCT 06:23 PM
[Replying to "Probably punched it or somthing"]
is he that strong?
The Fool 06:23 PM
it's just drywall
even chris can punch drywall
Silvia 06:23 PM
What we in the mental health case call retard strength
The WCT 06:25 PM
guess he's better off without the Watchmen after all. lol
The Fool 06:26 PM
my idiot retard brain is thinking "well maybe he was just trying to crush a bug but is too stupid to do it properly" but I'm fully aware he intentionally is hitting his wall out of rage
The WCT 06:27 PM
I also notice how Chris's hair is black.
which I believe is his natural hair color.
The Fool 06:27 PM
he sucks at dying his hair
he half-asses it and doesn't maintain it
thats where his infamous green hair came from
The WCT 06:44 PM
[Screenshot of Chris and WCT chatting in DMs, with WCT expressing concern for Chris's well-being and Chris responding he won't hurt himself and that G5 is meant to be canceled.]
Silvia 06:44 PM
I…..what
sonichulol[emote 1]
The Fool 06:45 PM
so not gonna talk about the wall?
The WCT 06:45 PM

The WCT 06:48 PM
[Screenshot of WCT asking Chris about the wall, and Chris explaining what caused the damage.][note 1]
The Fool 06:48 PM
he tried to open the portal to cwcville by ripping his wall down?
he had to have been drunk
Silvia 06:49 PM
Oof
Lainchu (Anaxis) 07:06 PM
Well, the portal was on his wall in the comics, right?
Silvia 07:06 PM
I believe so
Lainchu (Anaxis) 07:06 PM
Don't see that as an illogical thought process for chris
The Fool 07:06 PM
behind his door, yeah
thats not behind his door but w/e
reminds me of that twilight zone episode where a family found a weird portal on the wall under their child's bed that you could expand the size of with chalk
[REDACTED] 08:13 PM
At least it was just the wall he damaged and not part of his body like the taint wound.
Too bad he doesn't want therapy for his delusions.
NOTE: The following conversation took place after Chris had begun explaining his actions in the #general channel of the Knights of CWC.
[REDACTED] 08:38 PM
lol, triggered by the toy aisle. Blarms all over again...
Think snapping his fingers to vanish the toys is CPU-speak for moving the toys around to hide them?
The Fool 08:48 PM
can you imagine being chris in that moment
he's in a store, the church of consumerism, the place he feels the safest, and then there's something that reminds him of change
I can see why he defaced the xbox and sonic boom displays lol
I guess he finally learned he can't do that so he just pretends the offending item doesn't exist anymore
[REDACTED] 08:52 PM
Good point, explains a lot.
The Fool 08:54 PM
never forget
[Cropped screenshot of a quote by Chris taken from the Meditation article on the CWCki.]
average beastars fan
The WCT 08:58 PM
I’m glad he came here to vent, but it seems like he’s in complete denial over the ending of G4.
[REDACTED] 09:02 PM
Yeah. lol, Wikipedia says G5 starts Sept 24 with a Netflix special.
Synopsis for it says, "Set years after the events of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic, the film will center on Sunny Starscout, an outcast and young activist earth pony who still sees hope in Equestria where Twilight Sparkle's teachings on friendship and harmony have been replaced with paranoia and mistrust, and where all three species of ponies live segregated from one another."
He's gonna be so pissed when watching that.
The WCT 09:02 PM
Sounds incredibly racist.
Yeah I can see why Chris will complain.
The Fool 09:37 PM
lol maybe he will hate it
if it's about that
Lainchu (Anaxis) 09:55 PM
I'm a little disturbed about the "punching holes in the walls" thing
Even if he isn't hurting himself, he's still doing structural damage to an already decaying home
The Fool 09:56 PM
I'm sure he was drunk
Lainchu (Anaxis) 09:56 PM
In no way is that a reassurance lol
The Fool 09:56 PM
I dunno how much he drinks, I heard it's more than usual now
Lainchu (Anaxis) 09:56 PM
Hm
Ironic, considering his hardline sobriety of years past
But I guess that could be said about a lot of facets of Chris's life at this point
The Fool 09:57 PM
even in the "classic" era he abandoned that and started drinking lol
I'm surprised he cared at all given his parents drank like a fish
but he certainly stopped caring after he went to a bar and got that "long island iced tea"
then he started putting sugar in his beer
🤢
but apparently recently-ish he's started drinking a lot and even doing weed (at least he did with the teen troon squad)
honestly surprised it took him this long to start abusing, but, not surprised he's abusing now
tbh I would consider it a reassurance that he's only punching drywall from being drunk, at least then it's because of a substance and not because he wholeheartedly believes he should be shoving his fist into the wall
if he was doing that shit sober then I'd actually be very worried
Para 10:52 PM
he put sugar in his beer
lol
The Fool 10:53 PM
did you expect any less?
28 July 2021
The WCT 03:49 PM
[Screenshot of Chris and WCT continuing to discuss MLP G5 in DMs, with Chris encouraging WCT to make a video denouncing the series and WCT enabling him by stating that Randy Stair agreed with Chris's opinions.]
The Fool 03:51 PM
hahahaha
you're not actually going to make an anti-G5 video are you
The WCT 03:51 PM
of course not.
I'd be seen as a Lolcow.
The Fool 03:52 PM
(more of) a lolcow
The WCT 03:52 PM
I'd rather just be a goof than a Brony.
[Continuation of the above conversation between Chris and WCT, with Chris encouraging WCT to act on his behalf as soon as possible.][note 2]
Para 04:40 PM
this is just beyond delusional
does chris sincerely believe in this garbage
or is he playing pretend
The Fool 04:43 PM
it's pretend, but it's also coping
like I keep saying, he has no reason not to be delusional
there's nothing in his life forcing him to be sane
also he is amazing at believing his own lies, so it's almost like a proto-delusion
he can still be snapped out of it, he just doesn't want to
Lainchu (Anaxis) 05:09 PM
Is he expecting you to parrot his beliefs about G5?
If only he was half as passionate about his own comics as he is with this, Christ
Silvia 05:27 PM
It’s a little scary how much they want this mlp to stop……I mean I’m a brony but g4 is over. Nothing can change that lol
They’re only gonna hurt themselves with this. I wouldn’t even be surprised if they get kicked out of a store for trying to throw away merch or throw a fit. Also worries me bc the con is coming up and I’m sure they’re are g5 vendors and all.
The WCT 05:34 PM
[Replying to "Is he expecting you to parrot his beliefs about G5?"]
because I'm a Youtuber with 3k subs, yes.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 05:34 PM
He wants you, as his loyal disciple, to spread his gospel
Although there's no better mouthpiece for chris than chris himself. He does have over 50k subs on YT...
The WCT 05:35 PM
[Replying to "Although there's no better mouthpiece for chris than chris himself. He does have over 50k subs on YT..."]
he literally doesn't need me.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 05:35 PM
Getting people to take it seriously is the issue, I guess
But nobody would parrot chris unironically about this issue
Not the way he's been going about it, at least
Silvia 05:36 PM
True boycott on hasbro is to not watch it lol. Not buy the merch lol.
The WCT 05:37 PM
I might do a watch party here.
where we can pick it apart. lol
Lainchu (Anaxis) 05:37 PM
Won't that just piss him off more?
The WCT 05:37 PM
oh wait that's right.
he's trying to stop it from even being released.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 05:38 PM
When it inevitably does, he'll probably just say that it actually doesn't exist because he thanos-snapped it out of existence, or whatever he said with the toys of G5 he saw at the store the other day
Silvia 05:39 PM
(Probably threw the merchandise away)
The WCT 05:39 PM
that's the best case scenario tbh.
Para 05:39 PM
hes probably going to get arrested again
[1 sonichuthink[emote 2] reaction]
Silvia 05:39 PM
He got arrested before?
The WCT 05:39 PM
[Replying to "hes probably going to get arrested again"]
hopefully not.
The WCT 05:40 PM
[Replying to "He got arrested before?"]
remember the Sonic Boom protests?
Lainchu (Anaxis) 05:40 PM
And the michael Snyder incident before then
Silvia 05:40 PM
Ohhhhhh! I thought it was bc he hit the dude micheal before then. Yea him
I didn’t know he got arrested for the sonic boom thing
Lainchu (Anaxis) 05:40 PM
Hopefully this won't escalate to sonic boom protest levels
Because it'd be Chris's third strike
The WCT 05:41 PM
how long before I get blamed? lol.
Silvia 05:41 PM
Wait I thought he got removed from the GameStop for pepper spraying not arrested
The WCT 05:41 PM
fortunately, nobody on Kiwi knows I'm the new head guy.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 05:41 PM
[Replying to "Wait I thought he got removed from the GameStop for pepper spraying not arrested"]
It was both
[1 ✅ reaction]
He got banned and arrested
Silvia 05:42 PM
Oh damn.
What happens if it happens a third time
Lainchu (Anaxis) 05:43 PM
Idk, but something tells me the court system might not go as easy on him as they have in the past once this looks like a behavioral pattern
But who knows. Chris has a remarkable talent for escaping consequences.
The WCT 05:43 PM
he's like DSP.
unstoppable.
Silvia 05:44 PM
Fair.They probably see him as a mental case and let him go most likely. But if it’s reaccuring then they may put him in a week long mental hospital
Lainchu (Anaxis) 05:45 PM
They have given him counseling before, and it obviously didn't work...
The WCT 05:46 PM
Here's what I believe:
If the courts feel that Chris doesn't pose as an actual physical threat to anybody, they'll let him go.
if they believe the opposite, he'll be put on probation.
Silvia 05:49 PM
I don’t think he will be put on probation. Personally. Unless he like throws a fit and ruin someone’s g5 vending or something
Para 06:40 PM
hes a large man he kind of presents a physical threat with his tantrums
The WCT 06:42 PM
[Replying to "hes a large man he kind of presents a physical threat with his tantrums"]
do you think the solution is institutionalization?
Para 06:45 PM
yes
The WCT 06:49 PM
I think a group home is the best solution for Chris.
but that will only come Post-Barb's death.
