I have been paid to go; we’ll see if I can go (Seriously To Be Determined) is a video of Chris thanking "Jack," a fan who gifted him $600+ so that he could attend the 2018 BronyCon, after Chris begged on social media for eBay sales to afford the trip[1].

Hello everybody, this is Christine Chandler, coming to you live from home once again.
[takes off cap]
With a most hearty thank you to... Jack! That was a Jack, from up north, who... essentially paid me to go to BronyCon.
Awesome, very awesome! So, with a few more other arrangements I need to make, hopefully I will be there this year. So, that's awesome news.
Thank you Jack, and... we still - [mumble] aside from that, we're still gonna need as much money as possible to help us with the bills around here, and the mortgage, and everything, but - so, I urge you all to please go ahead and buy the Transformer toys that I listed, and will be listing, on eBay.
Thank you Jack, and thank you all for helping me. I feel something better. Have an awesome day!
