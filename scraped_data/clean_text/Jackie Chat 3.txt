================================================================================

This chat took place on 29 September 2010. Highlights of the chat include Chris discussing (or lying about) applying at McDonald's. Jackie also asks how Chris got onto Social Security despite him appearing to be fully capable of working; Chris believes that his father possibly committed fraud to get him on SSI, but also says that his father thinks he cannot possibly live on his own.
[7:40 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
CWC (ChrisChanSonichu) is available 7:40 pm
[7:40 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
<3
[7:41 pm] CWC:
Hey, Jackie. :) h
[7:40 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
hello ~ ~ ~
[7:41 pm] CWC:
How was your day?
[7:41 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
long and stressful
[7:41 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
lots of homework :-(
[7:42 pm] CWC:
classes were hard?
[7:41 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
yeah, they're getting ther
[7:41 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
there
[7:42 pm] CWC:
Hang in there; you'll pull through greatly. ;) h
[7:42 pm] CWC:
I've had an okay day.
[7:42 pm] CWC:
I've applied online for a cashier job at the new McD today; the manager called me a couple of hours to schedule an interview tomorrow. :D h
[7:43 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
:-D :-D :-D
[7:43 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
thats great!
[7:44 pm] CWC:
I've got the resume put together; I only need to retype the "Job Objectives", and I will wear a green shirt for the interview.
[7:44 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
hey, could i see a copy of your interview? i'm curious
[7:45 pm] CWC:
I've heard on John Tesh's Radio show that when going to a job interview, wear green, because when the boss sees green, he/she thinks good money.
[7:45 pm] CWC:
or something like that anyway.
[7:46 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
copy of your resume i mean, not interview
[7:46 pm] CWC:
do you mean a copy of my resume?
[7:46 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
yeah
[7:46 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
typo :-)
[7:46 pm] CWC:
I'll e-mail it to you later after I retype the J.O. part.
[7:46 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
ok!
[7:47 pm] CWC:
I just checked my e-mail; some troll pretened to be Lars "Luxor"; what a kook! LOL
[7:47 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
speaking of Lars, guess what I got in the mail today?
[7:47 pm] CWC:
Like as if I would fall for a Troll's Ploy.
[7:47 pm] CWC:
a letter from him?
[7:48 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
a toy boat made out of popsickle sticks
[7:48 pm] CWC:
close enough.
[7:48 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
with a condom for the sail
[7:48 pm] CWC:
fresh or used?
[7:48 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
fresh. but it was one of those lubricated kinds, so it feels all oily
[7:49 pm] CWC:
yep. either way, I'd say dang.
[7:49 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
its a magnum too
[7:49 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
wanted to remind me that he's black
[7:49 pm] CWC:
I use Trojan.
[7:49 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
I wasnt impressed by his little gift.
[7:49 pm] CWC:
I would not be either.
did it come with a letter?
[7:50 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
yeah.
[7:50 pm] CWC:
what was the subject of the letter?
[7:50 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
he said a bunch of stuff.
[7:50 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
mostly
[7:51 pm] CWC:
Like a "Come back to me, baby?", "I'm soo sorry for being selfish" or something like that?
[7:51 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
he said he hoped i was feeling better after the recent video i had you made
[7:51 pm] CWC:
???
[7:51 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
and that he still has lingering regrets from the violence i made you show
[7:51 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i wrote back to tell him once
again that i hated him
[7:51 pm] CWC:
That violence was voluntary; you did not make me do it.
[7:51 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
and that my message should be clear
[7:52 pm] CWC:
Hells yeah, Sweetheart! :D h
[7:52 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i also told him not to do that again, ever. I wasn't impressed with his little boat. I threw it away
[7:52 pm] CWC:
Good for you.
[7:52 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
magnum sail and all
[7:52 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
as big as his dick was, it wasn't worth it
[7:52 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
his problem was always his ego
[7:52 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
he's so full of himself that no matter how clearly i tell him its over, he still thinks he can just wear me down and get me to come back to him
[7:53 pm] CWC:
I hear that; too big for the britches he was tryin' to front.
[7:54 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
hey, could you make one more video and direct it at him?
[7:54 pm] CWC:
I hear you; like in this episode of "Stacked" where Pamela was in the same situation... it was the one where she was trying to get her grandmother's watch back I'm thinking of, but there was also a similar story in the Pilot.
[7:54 pm] CWC:
Yes.
[7:55 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i'd like you to tell him once again that he wasted all his money on stupid boats and that i left him because he would never take me out because of it
[7:55 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
tell him that i got fed up with all the boats all over the goddamned apartment, half of them not even taken out of their package because he just bought them for the sake of buying them
[7:56 pm] CWC:
I'll shout it out directly to him that you are soo over him. And I'll put more pain into it; I'll hump a bit, telling that I'll be doing that with you from now on. YEAH!!!
[7:56 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
and this time, you don't have to try to be civil. be smug, laugh in his face, anything like that. you tried to be civil last time and he just ignored you. all he understands is bluntness
[7:56 pm] CWC:
And yes I will tell him about how he valued boats over you.
[7:56 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
yes!!! thats perfect!!
[7:56 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
do all of that
[7:56 pm] CWC:
Oh, Yeah!
[7:57 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
oh, and maybe you should show his picture up close in the video. i think he wouldnt expect you to do that, he probably thought only you would see it when he showed it
[7:57 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
he'll be really surprised if you show it publically [sic]
[7:57 pm] CWC:
Good idea.
[7:57 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
like, show the picture, and then maybe draw a stupid mustache on it or something, and then rip it in half
[7:57 pm] CWC:
Perhaps the Trolls will dub him the New "Black Man in the Pickle Suit".
[7:58 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
lol
[7:58 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
he was always more of a gourd man
[7:58 pm] CWC:
Or, I can make a cut-out pickle suit to put over everything but his face, THEN tear it all to pieces.
[7:58 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
ooh, that would be nice!
[7:58 pm] CWC:
gourd... that's like a Squash, right?
[7:58 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
yeah
[7:59 pm] CWC:
I thought so.
[7:59 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
give him a pickle suit or a squash suit
[7:59 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
whichever strikes your fancy.
[7:59 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
CWC (ChrisChanSonichu) is idle 7:59 pm
[8:00 pm] CWC:
How about a pickle suit and a squash hat; in a pickle suit, it will really make two birds with one stone, because that will be a strike against the trolls too.
[8:00 pm] CWC:
*and a squash hga
[8:00 pm] CWC:
*hat
[8:00 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i kind of like the idea of a squash suit. and call him the "man in the squash suit" too. the trolls will know its about them too because pickles and squash are related
[8:01 pm] CWC:
I think I can work with that.
[8:01 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
:-)
[8:01 pm] CWC:
cool.
[8:01 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
ugh
[8:01 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
those damn boats
[8:01 pm] CWC:
yeah.
[8:01 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
would you believe he bought paint and accessory kits for boats he didn't even own?
[8:02 pm] CWC:
I hear that.
[8:02 pm] CWC:
Actually, I can relate.
[8:02 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
oh?
[8:02 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
CWC (ChrisChanSonichu) is available 8:02 pm
[8:03 pm] CWC:
On the PlayStation Store, I checked-out a bunch of FREE Add-Ons for games I don't have the games for, so they're just sitting there in my queue, very likely NOT to be downloaded.
[8:03 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
ah, i thought you were going to mention your dad
[8:03 pm] CWC:
At least I did not have to pay for any of those.
[8:03 pm] CWC:
Yes, him too with his model planes, and he sometimes heavily splurges on himself with something expensive, like a new used car for himself, like his Honda, an HDTV, and a few other things.
[8:03 pm] CWC:
But he did get good deals on those when he bought them.
[8:05 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well, you should mention that sort of thing in the video
[8:05 pm] CWC:
Still, spends more on himself then than he does for mom.
[8:05 pm] CWC:
I'd rather not.
[8:05 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
no?
[8:06 pm] CWC:
I already am on his bad side with how much I've already revealed on the internet, between nude photos and videos of myself, and Especially the videos touring the house.
[8:06 pm] CWC:
Greene County could kick us out of the house for heavy fire hazards with all that junk my family hoarded.
[8:06 pm] CWC:
What I have out of all that is a pale comparison; boxes of toys. They pale in comparison to Heavy, Bulky Furniture, like a couch a my mother insists she'll place and use, but she will not.
[8:08 pm] CWC:
I'd like to just store all of that stuff in a shed, or have it all donated to Goodwill, but I can't because my mother would throw fits against me and then some. Maybe even buy all that stuff back.
[8:08 pm] CWC:
And I have suggested before Storing it all, but neither parent will go for that.
[8:09 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
aww, poor baby... :-(
[8:10 pm] CWC:
Yeah. It makes ONLY a few rooms of the house accessible.
[8:10 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well, you could always get your own place
[8:11 pm] CWC:
I estimate... about half of the total rooms have space to even walk through, and my room is the roomiest in comparison.
[8:11 pm] CWC:
Not yet; lack of funds for one thing, and I have a lot of ties to this house and my family. The only way I would be able to move out is A) when I can actually afford to or B) hang out at my girlfriend's place.
[8:11 pm] CWC:
Are your parents similar to mine in that characteristic?
[8:12 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
no, mine are fairly clean
[8:13 pm] CWC:
You are lucky, plus I'm certain they're a lot younger than mine.
[8:13 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
they're in their 50's, yeah
[8:13 pm] CWC:
Robert and Barbara; 83 and (about to turn on Friday) 69 respectively.
[8:13 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well, once you get the job at mcdonalds, you'll be rolling in cash
[8:13 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
ooh, wish her happy birthday!
[8:13 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
for me
[8:14 pm] CWC:
Yes, I'll be able to better pay my family back more quickly, plus have more pocket money for myself.
[8:14 pm] CWC:
I think I've told you about me being able to make 980 a month and keep my SSI; we've had a discussion about that, I think.
[8:14 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
yeah, i rememeber that
[8:15 pm] CWC:
A slight exageration.
[8:15 pm] CWC:
For every Two Dollars I make OVER the 980 limit, they take away ONE Dollar from my SSI.
[8:15 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
and as you get settled into a job, you can get yourself off the welfare and supporting yourself entirely!
[8:15 pm] CWC:
IF I was making 1000 a month, they'd take away
[8:15 pm] CWC:
come to think of it, it's not as bad as I had thought before.
[8:16 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well, once you get a full-time job you wont need the SSI anymore anyway, right?
[8:17 pm] CWC:
Maybe, if I was making like 2600-3000 a month, in which case THAT would completely wipe out my SSI.
[8:18 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i dont mean if your job pays so much that it puts your SSI at zero.
[8:18 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i meant that if you get a full-time job, you wont have a reason to be on SSI in the first place, right?
[8:19 pm] CWC:
Firstly, my family worked really hard to get me on it in the first place nearly a decade ago; once I say NO and get rid of it, I may never have that safety net ever again. Plus, at even 1000 a month from the job, add 800 to that, and that still makes a good 1800 a month.
[8:20 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
chris, no one else gets that sort of safety net.
[8:20 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
if you have a full-time job why would you need it
[8:20 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
SSI is meant for people who are unable to work. but that isnt true in your case.
[8:22 pm] CWC:
Well, on one hand, you are right, I would not require the SSI upon having a job... (hang on I have more, which is what I mean by "...")
[8:22 pm] CWC:
but on the other hand, having that option is a Rarity, and it is a major blessing to me to even have it.
[8:23 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
sounds more like fraud than a blessing, but if thats how you look at it...
[8:23 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
wait, here, i'm reading the SSI application form:
[8:23 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
it says
[8:23 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
"For the state agency to decide that you are disabled, your medical condition must significantly limit your ability to do basic work activities—such as walking, sitting and remembering—for at least one year. "
[8:23 pm] CWC:
Plus the job market is fickle; there is a chance I may get fired even by a technicality.
[8:24 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
you are able to walk, sit, and remember well enough. you can do other more complex things too
[8:24 pm] CWC:
I'm sure my father had read that rule as well, but he found a loophole.
[8:24 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so he committed fraud?
[8:24 pm] CWC:
I think.
[8:24 pm] CWC:
I do not know, but I do not think it would be called a fraud.
[8:24 pm] CWC:
If it was a fraud, then it would have stopped years ago.
[8:25 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well, if he lied, thats fraud
[8:25 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
sometimes they dont catch it.
[8:25 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
the rule says you have to be incapable of basic tasks. you are not incapable of basic tasks. therefore you should be working
[8:26 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
besides, you always say you want to be taken seriously and accepted as an equal because of your high functioning autism, but nobody else who is equal to normal people needs SSI
[8:26 pm] CWC:
I feel uncertain on how to address those details, and I am not ignoring the issue. I will talk with my father about it, and I will have a better answer for it then.
[8:27 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i know low-functioning autistics who take tickets at the movie theaters or things like that, they hold down jobs
[8:27 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
sweetie, are you actually low-functioning? you can tell me, i wont judge
[8:28 pm] CWC:
I was classified "High-Functioning"; that's all I know. Yet sometimes it does take me a while to fully think the details.
[8:28 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
thats all you know? i would think you would be more curious to know your own medical and legal status
[8:28 pm] CWC:
And I am still classified as high-functioning from a more current test just a few years ago.
[8:28 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well, then, you dont need your SSI
[8:28 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so once you get a full-time job, you can get off of it! :-)
[8:28 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
you mentioned earlier that sometimes people lose their jobs for dumb reasons, and its true that that happens
[8:28 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but thats what unemployment is for. it holds you over til you get a new job
[8:30 pm] CWC:
I do not know all of the details, and processing all of this is making me feel uncomfortable. I would appreciate it if I can have time later to think further and process all of this to feel better able to accept and address it.
[8:30 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well, its ok if you need time to think up answers.
[8:30 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
ooh i know!!
[8:30 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
your first video for the October contest can be your answer!
[8:30 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
you could take a few minutes and explain why you think you need/deserve your SSI
[8:32 pm] CWC:
I don't feel I can come up with an answer that quick, plus again, I do not want to reveal too much more information to the Trolls, and that IS a Private Detail.
[8:32 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well i've asked you about this before though, months ago
[8:32 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
you havent thought anything new up in all that time?
[8:33 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
and im not asking you to reveal sensitive data. the trolls already know you're on SSI, you could just explain why you feel you deserve it
[8:33 pm] CWC:
Well, I do have a new detail I will confide in you.
[8:33 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
oh?
[8:33 pm] CWC:
I have talked to my father a bit about it...
[8:33 pm] CWC:
And he has informed me that he feels not confident in my own Social abilities outside the house.
[8:33 pm] CWC:
Plus, again, the information I've revealed on the internet before were of NO help towards his feelings about me.
[8:33 pm] CWC:
either
[8:34 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well i'll quote again for emphasis:
[8:34 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
" For the state agency to decide that you are disabled, your medical condition must significantly limit your ability to do basic work activities—such as walking, sitting and remembering—for at least one year. "
[8:35 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
the state has determined that is the cutoff point for a person to receive SSI
[8:35 pm] CWC:
Socializing is a basic work activity, and Autism is a Social Anxiety.
[8:35 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
you socialize with me well enough
[8:35 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
if you can go into mcdonalds and order without causing problems, how is it any harder to be on the other side of the counter?
[8:36 pm] CWC:
Yes, with few people, like you, after getting to know you better, and that you made the first contact with me with a pure friendly gesture, I felt comfortable talking with you.
[8:37 pm] CWC:
let me think about that a moment...
[8:37 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well when you're working a job, people will be coming up to you all the time to start conversations
[8:38 pm] CWC:
When I order, generally, I'm not making eye-contact, I know or am thinking of what I want to order, I order it; little conversation is made...
[8:38 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but you can do more basic things like walk, sit, and remember
[8:38 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
and not all jobs require you to talk to customers anyway. get a job that doesnt make you
[8:39 pm] CWC:
On Taking someone's order, I Listen very well, I take it down accurately, I take the money, I give the correct change, I give the food to the correct customer; I don't have to make much conversation.
[8:39 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
you could be one of those heavyweights that stocks shelves or something
[8:39 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so you know that you can work.
[8:39 pm] CWC:
No, I need to practice being social, especially at work.
[8:39 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well you cant practice without having a job in the first place
[8:40 pm] CWC:
I feel I can work and stand for hours.
[8:40 pm] CWC:
Exactly.
[8:40 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
there you go!
[8:40 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
problem seolved
[8:40 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
*solved i mean
[8:40 pm] CWC:
yeah.
[8:40 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so you're looking forward to your interview tomorrow?
[8:40 pm] CWC:
yes I am.
[8:40 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
I'm sure your mom and dad are rooting for you too
[8:41 pm] CWC:
Regardless of comfort, I will make constant eye-contact with my interviewer and be polite. I've done this before in past interviews as well.
[8:41 pm] CWC:
Concentrated (forced) self-control.
[8:41 pm] CWC:
I think I'll do well in the interview.
[8:42 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
is your mom or dad driving you, since your car is in the shop?
[8:42 pm] CWC:
yes, my father will be driving me.
[8:42 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well good luck! :-)
[8:43 pm] CWC:
Thank you. :) h
[8:43 pm] CWC:
Let's talk about your ideas for my TrollBuster Pilot comic to wrap this up.
[8:44 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
ok
[8:44 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
have you drawn any pages yet? looked like you had the plot pretty cemented
[8:44 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
done any storyboarding?
[8:45 pm] CWC:
I have not drawn any pages yet, and the storyboarding is in my head; still I have the save game photos of the Truck, Cal and Dee Dee.
[8:46 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
oh, so you havent done anything yet
[8:46 pm] CWC:
I just need more ideas for specific topics. not yet.
[8:47 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
maybe you can use some of the unused sonichu plots you have saved up
[8:47 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i know you had tons of plotlines, years worth, you had been planning to use right?
[8:47 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
now that you've decided to end sonichu, you can still use some of those plotlines
[8:48 pm] CWC:
I have not ended Sonichu; I only lost inspiration to draw, thanks to the people online.
[8:48 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so you just decided to not pay attention to it anymore?
[8:48 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
or are you going to have both comics going at once? that'll be tough
[8:49 pm] CWC:
Right now, I'm concentrating on this one Pilot Comic for the TrollBusters.
[8:49 pm] CWC:
It's going to be a P.A. book as well.
[8:49 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
here's an idea for a plotline:
[8:50 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
how about your trollbusters get a call from a victim
[8:50 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
the victim was called to go on a first date with a girl at burger king
[8:51 pm] CWC:
okay
[8:51 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but when he got there, turned out it was a plot
[8:51 pm] CWC:
ooh. and then what?
[8:52 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
it was trolls who wanted to steal his pendant, which was a family heirloom handed down for generations
[8:52 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
and so the trollbusters have to go hunt down the thieves and get it back
[8:52 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
and at the end they find out that the trolls they beat were just flunkies of more powerful trolls that they would face in the future.
[8:52 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i figure its kind of something you could relate to because trolls tried to get your medallion, so your feelings could go into it easier
[8:55 pm] CWC:
that is good, and yes. But I'm not sure about the pendant being the stolen item; I feel it is TOO Close to home, and it does sound trite. But it can be an actual item, perhaps a Golden Pocket Watch.
[8:55 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
yeah, a golden pocket watch would work fine too
[8:56 pm] CWC:
very good. :) h
[8:56 pm] CWC:
next question is Where the Trolls are?
[8:56 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
uh...
[8:57 pm] CWC:
should they be in the US, or should they be in another country?
[8:57 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
make up a country for them
[8:57 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
"Trollvania"
[8:57 pm] CWC:
LOL
[8:57 pm] CWC:
yeah
[8:58 pm] CWC:
Another country is good, then they can show off their Sponsored Private Plane they fly in to take their truck with them.
[8:58 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
sponsored by whom?
[8:58 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
which corporation
[8:59 pm] CWC:
I'd say Jet, but a Private Jet is more lightweight, IMHO. Sponsored by me and the city of Cwcville.
[8:59 pm] CWC:
Cal and Dee^2's home base is in Cwcville.
[8:59 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
where does CWCville get such funding from?
[8:59 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
costs a lot to run a jet
[9:00 pm] CWC:
yes, but they don't use it that often; a lot of the trolls are found in the USA.
[9:00 pm] CWC:
CWC (ChrisChanSonichu) is idle 9:00 pm
[9:00 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
what is the tax rate in CWCville? what is sales tax set at
[9:01 pm] CWC:
no more than anywhere else.
[9:01 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
its different everywhere, though
[9:01 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
