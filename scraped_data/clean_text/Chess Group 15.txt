Title: Chess Group 15

================================================================================

Not to be confused with Chess club, another Discord server in which Bella and her Texas Tech friends chatted.
chess group #15 is a Discord server created by Bella. The server contains friendly conversation and games of chess in text format, in contrast to Bella's Chess Club server which used edgier language.
Chris, The WCT, and Fiona were among the members in this server. On 19 July 2021, Bella invited them in. There, WCT discussed his feud with Naught, asking for Bella's help in doxing Naught, Fiona and Bella discussed Everfree Northwest plans, and Chris made only one comment stating he was busy drawing.
All excerpts quoted below are from the server's "general" channel.[1]

Sockness
20 July 2021
01:12 AM Fiona: Sockness is like the worst of A-logs
01:13 AM Bella: yeah from what i heard
01:13 AM Fiona: Does he actually have a crush on Christine, or is it a facade to hide behind?
01:13 AM Bella: i citrus-filed his number a while ago i have it logged somewhere
01:13 AM The WCT: both tbh
01:13 AM Bella: hes probobly trying to mess with her to get a reaction is all
01:13 AM Fiona: Sockness was on a server I was in, and he sent me to an ERP server that we raided
01:14 AM Bella: that would make a hell of a romance if he was
01:14 AM Fiona: Wanting to r@pe Christine goes way past messing with her
01:14 AM Fiona: Because that's what I heard he wanted to do
01:14 AM Bella: did he say that or attempt in anyway to do that?
01:15 AM Fiona: Yeah, I remember knowing that he said that he wanted to film it too or something
01:15 AM Fiona: I forget where
01:15 AM Bella: bc its messed up definatly but hes trying to instigate reactions by being extreme and getting clout
01:15 AM Bella: he told someone from praector that
01:15 AM Fiona: I think it's because Christine is internet famous and he wants in
01:15 AM Bella: oh yeah definatly
01:15 AM The WCT: I was the one that stopped him 2 years ago.
01:16 AM Fiona: How did you stop him?
01:16 AM The WCT: When Chris got word that he was going on a train trip, he asked me to record a message for him.
01:16 AM The WCT: [WCT linked to Chris Releases A Statement Regarding Jacob Sockness]
01:16 AM The WCT: I recorded this bit.
01:17 AM Fiona: I'm glad Christine knew to stop him before it got messy
01:18 AM The WCT: After he uploaded the clip I made, people for once stopped trolling Chris and went after Sockness. And he was intercepted while he was on his way.
01:18 AM Fiona: Sockness deserves trolling these days
01:18 AM Bella: yeah me too, its especially hard bc alot of the "friends" who hung out with
01:18 AM Bella: christine tried to manipulate her into talking with him again in praector
01:19 AM The WCT: there's conflicting reports on where he got picked off, some said he was stopped in Chicago, some say he never made it out of California.
01:19 AM Bella: or at least they told me so and i had to get them to stop
Wanting to dox Naught
20 July 2021
Following from Watchmen infighting drama in which Naught had posted WCT's dox on Kiwi Farms, WCT tells Bella that he is attempting to dox Naught and Bella volunteers to help.
Transcript note: The conversation also involved cross-talk on unrelated matters between Bella and her friend Allen, which is not included in the transcript below but can be viewed in the chess group #15 - general chatlog.
01:42 AM The WCT: The Watchmen (mainly Kyle and Meghan) had a big hate boner for the Praetor group.
01:42 AM The WCT: and hell, when they were trying to make me look like the bad guy, they accused me of being a part of Praetor or at least collaborating with them.
01:42 AM The WCT: In reality though, I was working with Former Kiwi Farmers to bring down the Watchmen because everybody had enough of Naught. (or Dominik)
01:43 AM Bella: if they hated praetor they hated them for the wrong reason, there are some reasons i could understand though
01:44 AM The WCT: keep this within these borders, but I'm currently looking for Dom's dox atm.
01:44 AM The WCT: he's an evil man that needs to be stopped before he can hurt more people.
01:44 AM Bella: dom who? i could find it
01:44 AM The WCT: Dominik.
01:44 AM The WCT: I'll send you a DM.
01:44 AM The WCT: @NP2348 I sent you a friend request.
01:46 AM Bella: got it
01:46 AM Bella: i tried to send u one but it wouldnt let me
01:47 AM The WCT: alright, i'll give you details.
