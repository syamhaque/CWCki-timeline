Chris's reflection on Shrek Retold[1]
Shrek Retold
Information
Released
29 November 2018
Shrek Retold is a crowdfunded shot-for-shot remake of the 2001 film Shrek, released on 29 November 2018. It was organized by 3GI Productions for their annual Shrekfest convention. 200 people contributed their own versions of scenes from the movie. 3GI is a follower of Chris's and reached out to him the year before the release date asking for his participation in "a project".[2] Notably, Bryanfrogboy is also a contributor to the project.
Chris was assigned scene #23 out of 200, in which Shrek is convinced by Lord Farquaad to go on a quest to rescue Princess Fiona so he can have his swamp back. Chris's scene features voice acting and crudely colored stills that were surprisingly animated (though the animation was done by others).[3] His scene is a little over a minute long. The audio on his scene also continually skips numerous times and the video has the characteristic piss filter, indicating that it was filmed on his abused PSEye.
Shrek Retold was a rare instance where Chris was asked to be part of something, Chris did it and completed the task on time, and no drama was started as a result of harassment by weens or Chris himself. This was not the case for the sequel Shrek 2 Retold, from which Chris was axed over his incest scandal.
Shrek Retold has amassed more than 10 million views, making it the most-viewed video in Christory by default.

Transcript
Chris: This is Christine Chandler, I'll be depicting scene 23.
As Shrek enters the ring, the crowd cheers.
Shrek: "Yeaaaauuuuuh! Uuuuuuuuuuuuuugh! Daaaaaaaaaaugh!" [Chris groans]
Chris: The bad guy— I forget his name— communicates to the armed forces and Shrek becomes a bit offended and Donkey is scared...?
Knight: "Shall I give the orders, sir?"
Farquaad: "No, I have a better idea. People of Duloc, I give you our champion!"
Chris: The crowd cheers.
Shrek: "What?"
Farquaad: "Congratulations, ogre, you have won the honor of going on a... great... and noble....... quest..."
Chris: ...says that guy, I forget his name still.
Shrek: "I'm already on a quest! A quest to get my swamp back!"
"What kind of quest?"
Farquaad: "Your swamp?"
Shrek: "Yeah! My swamp! Where you dumped those fairytale creatures."
Farquaad: "Okay. All right, ogre, I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me and I'll give you your swamp back."
Shrek: "Exactly the way it was?"
Farquaad: "Right down to the last slime-covered toadstool."
Shrek: "And the squa-terrs?"
Farquaad: "As good as gone."
Shrek: "What kind of... quest?"
Chris: And I guess that's it for scene 23 of Shrek. [snorts]
[In the original version, the video cuts off. However, in this version it continues]
Chris: Thank you 3gi, for- having as a consideration, I shall have the uh- I shall have the drawings up, for you, and sent as soon as possible. Thank you all, and have a great day. I'll talk to y'all later.
