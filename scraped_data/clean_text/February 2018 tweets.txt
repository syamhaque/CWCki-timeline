@MLPGal:
You got an easel - have you ever tried painting? I would love to see a self portrait or a watercolour painting of Sonichu, or something.
Looking good!
Chris replied:
Thank you. I have painted, sculpted and many a other arts and crafts before in my many art classes. I feel better with my good ol’ pen and markers, though. 😃
@PhoenixGiratina gives Chris artistic advice
you really should use a pencil first them go over it in pen so up can erase before you do final line art might make you art look better

Mourning Aunt Corrina
23 February
In response to a Twitter user mourning the loss of their grandmother
I hear you, @MelissaJoanHart.
In 2009, my Aunt Corina passed on, and the funeral was soon held on my own Birthday that year.
You can rest assure that your Nanny’s soul lives on in you and your family’s hearts, as well as in her current life today.

Talking about Starlight Glimmer
27 February
Chris talks about Starlight Glimmer with another Twitter user
Hey @CWCSonichu, how do you feel about Starlight Glimmer? She's a pretty great character, wouldn't you say? https://derpicdn.net/img/view/2016/5/8/1149043__safe_twilight+sparkle_trixie_magic_big+macintosh_food_cutie+mark_starlight+glimmer_telekinesis_cake.png
I like Starlight Glimmer for who she is in the more better aspect. 😊❤️
Just, that “The Cutie Map” Season 5 Premiere; I don’t hold that against her nowadays, but the Conformity thing in that two-parter REALLY Made Me Cringe and Cry.
Gah!
Yes I agree. Between her and Sunset Shimmer, you would most certainly choose Starlight, wouldn't you?
I have been pondering between Starlight Glimmer and Sunset Shimmer; which one I like better.
I actually like both of them a lot, and I can relate to both of them between their similar circumstances.
But, if I Have to choose one, because she had more epiphanies, I choose Sunset.
