Chris in May 2023.
May was the fifth month of 2023, and most notably the first month in which Chris had been seen in public since his arrest in August 2021. Judging from the locations he was sighted at, Chris seemingly started living somewhere in or around Chesterfield County, Virginia, after his release from jail earlier in March, and was attempting to keep a low profile. Although this evidently did not stop him from wearing his Sonichu medallion in public, or from signing his name as "J. Christ Chan Sonichu". It is also speculated that Chris may have been placed into some type of group home.
At the beginning of the month, Chris's hair was also its natural brown color, but at some point between 3 May and 27 May he decided to dye it a shade of bright blue.
Notable events
1 May - Chris shops at a Walmart in Midlothian, VA. He is photographed, and the contents are posted online,[1] marking his first public appearance in nearly two years.
2 May - Chris is spotted playing a trading card game at Battlegrounds, a game store also in Midlothian, VA.[1]
3 May - Chris is spotted outside a Donatos Pizza in Chesterfield Towne Center in Chesterfield County.[1]
7 May - 14 Branchland Court is photographed, showing Chris's junk and a well-kept lawn, and an alleged sighting of Barb.[2]
19 May - A Chevrolet Aveo becomes the latest iteration of Son-Chu.[3]
27 May - Chris is sighted at Earthbound Trading Co. by a cashier who takes photos of him and his signed receipt; he has taken to signing his name as "J. Christ Chan Sonichu".[4] According to the cashier, this was the second time he or she rang him up at Earthbound; the first time was in late April or early May.
29 May - Chris shops at Earthbound Trading Co. again.
30 May - Chris is spotted playing Magic: The Gathering at Modern Table Top Gaming.
