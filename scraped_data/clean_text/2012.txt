Chris at thirty. (self-portrait)
2012 was the fourth year since the discovery of the Internet's favorite autistic manchild, Christian Weston Chandler. Chris turned 30 years old this year.
This year did not see much activity online aside from his occasional Facebook posts, possibly due to Bob's death and stress from Chris's run-in with the law. Chris was actually punished for something he did, alongside his partner in crime; Chris was sentenced with a year of probation and was ordered to see a licensed psychiatrist. He was also ordered to perform community service, arguably the first time he worked in over a decade.[1] If either of them had violated their probation, Chris and/or Barb would have spent some of this year in prison; the two ultimately behaved themselves for the most part.
There was a dry spell of activity compared to years gone by; this was the first year since trolling began where Chris didn't personally upload a YouTube video, with any released being leaks. The events of the previous year led to the ceasing of organized trolling, with many deciding to leave Chris alone for the most part.
This was Chris' fattest period, with his weight being self-reported as 223 lb (101 kg).[2]
That being said, this year is quite notable for it seeing Chris finally losing his much-hated virginity, albeit to a prostitute.

Chris and Barb faced another hearing. In the meantime, Chris grew desperate enough to lose his virginity that, when a friend of his relayed an escort ad, he readily accepted its offer and used his tugboat on an hour-long session of hanky-panky. He then posted a Facebook message in which he claimed he lost his virginity.
