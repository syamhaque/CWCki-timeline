================================================================================

The ShowerClean videos are two short videos Chris uploaded on 30 October 2010. In the first video, Chris points out an area on his extremely dirty, stained shower wall that he's going to clean, that appears to be covered with a mixture of Serratia marcescens, responsible for bladder infections, and Aspergillus niger (black mold), responsible for respiratory illnesses in those with weakened immune systems. In the second video, he shows us the finished result. Chris then hints that he can achieve this same cleaning result on the rest of the shower, but then hesitates to explain when exactly he intends to do that, which would suggest he didn't clean any more of the shower later.
It would be confirmed that Chris never cleaned his shower again after this video - three years later.

[Chris focuses on a group of tiles with moldy grout and an orange stain, freshly sprayed with a cleaner.]
Focusing on this one stain, right here, in the shower wall, for now.
[Chris moves the camera to focus on his face and the cleaner.]
With this Shower Shine™…
[Chris picks up a roll of paper towels.]
…these paper towels… I'm gonna get that spot out.
At least make it look better.

[Chris focuses on his face.]
All right.
[Chris moves the camera onto the same set of tiles, slightly cleaner but still full of grimy grout. Some of the stain is gone, exposing the white tiles underneath.]
Here we are. Take a look at that, huh? Stain is gone. Big stain is gone. And give me more time, I can have the rest of it down— the rest of that mess off, too. But for this— for this video footage, I'll just concentrate on the one spot for now.
[Chris moves the camera back onto his face.]
