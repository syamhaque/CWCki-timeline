================================================================================

On 12 August 2015, the Blake Amiibo is announced.
On 29 August 2015, Chris attends OmegaCon.
August was the eighth month of 2015, and did not see much activity. Starting off very quietly with no posts from Chris for over a week, Chris eventually announced that he would be selling custom Amiibos for Blake. He ended the month by cosplaying at a convention, catching the attention of a few attendees.
