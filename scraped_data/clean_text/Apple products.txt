6s
On 8 May 2018, Chris listed his iPhone 6s for sale on eBay.[1] He noted in the description that he had upgraded from 6s to 8s for free, so wanted to sell the 6s. Autographed with Chris's signature, he initially listed it for $350, then reduced it to $100, when it was purchased by Null.[2]

SE (3rd generation)
This model was released in March 2022. Chris acquired one at some point post-Jail Saga. In August 2023, Chris uploaded a batch of artwork to his DeviantART account; some images have metadata indicating they were photographed with this phone model during that same month.[3]
iPad
Chris purchased an iPad and some accessories, including a wireless keyboard, in May 2020 using his COVID-19 stimulus check.[4]
