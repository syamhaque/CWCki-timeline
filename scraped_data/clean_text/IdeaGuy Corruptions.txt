Description
Massive and Chaotic Turmoils were what IdeaGuy had in mind, but the tables ended up being turned.
Late Octover of 2017 started a life-changing sequence of fated events for me, Chris Chan, and everyone in Dimension C-197, that also crossed into this very Dimension 1218, thanks to this Dimension's IdeaGuy, and his OC self-counterpart in C-197, Johnson Wiles. There were so many Awful things the two of themtogether had wrought up til April, 2018, when the chaos and havoc were finally cleaned up and undone. I have had to develop and learn from Everything that has happened. And in the end of it all, I ended up becoming fully awakened as a Goddess: the CPU Blue Heart of the Commodore Consoles.
And now the the few alternate Sonichus and Rosechus, and some of the events, come into play into the Secret Shipfic Folder. Time to stomp out and undo a bunch of seriously awful events.
This Expansion Pack is a companion to the events Chronicled in ("Sonichu" #13): "The Awakening of a CPU, a.k.a. The IdeaGuy Corruptions".
TSSSF Sonichu Deck or Core Deck are required for playing the game with this Expansion Pack. Contains 15 cards.
Cost:
$26.00[1]

"Do you understand, Sonichu? The CPUs had never ever taken me away from you at all. They were teaching me, so I can become a better chronicler, leader, fighter, and individual! I am really, truly and awfully sorry for my own reckless actions and deeds that had fallen upon you. Please, forgive me. I Love You with all of my heart, soul and being. -Awakening of a CPU

Aether in the Goddess's Ring
Goal
Checkmark
Win this Goal when: you change five Villains to Heroes (including adding the Hero Keyword) with Keyword Changes in a single turn.
Throughout it all, despite the experiences further shaping me, the gorified turmoil was simply shaming and degrading; trying to keep up to resolve it all was epically difficult and tough. If I had it all to do all over again, I would have never given IdeaGuy a penny. I had the overpower and will all along, and I needed to learn that. And in the end, aside from the key events that would have happened anyway, I undid His Corruptions! -Chris Chan Sonichu

Come March 19, 2018, I powered up into my Super Angelic Evolved Form with a combination of my own emotions, soul power, prophecy and CPU-link and the seven Chaos Emeralds; I closed the tear up completely. -Awakening of a CPU

During the time the Nazis were attempting to eradicate the Sonichu and Rosechu species, they had captured most of them. Simonla was captured, but she got out, but she had come down with a terrible syndrome. I tried to heal and restore her, but a transfer from a recently experienced nightmare I had caused her to mutate. Nazis came in to burn her; self-projected, I set up psychic barriers to protect her from the barrage of flames. -Awakening of a CPU

The purpose was to put chaos, destruction and turmoil upon the inhabitants and the Earth of C-197. There was a bunch of NSFW content in what he wanted to pave into the Dimension, and Chris Chan into the streets, broke and homeless. -Awakening of a CPU

She had become old and paranoid. I had the pleasure of talking with Hilda during her final moments. She liked the cut of my jib. She told me what she could share about E115 and her stories. Next day, she commits suicide. And then the souls of the five American Sailor Scouts came to me and they all had blessed me with their soul and power energies into my heart crystal. -Awakening of a CPU
