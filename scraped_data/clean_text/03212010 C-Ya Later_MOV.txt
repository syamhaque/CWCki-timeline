03212010 C-Ya Later.MOV is a video Chris uploaded on 21 March 2010 in which he swears he will leave the Internet (again). Of note is that this is the last video in which he wears the Sonichu medallion, which would then go missing for about half a year until 6 September 2010.
Chris has made similar promises before, most notably in his YouTube Finale video of 30 March 2009. Historically his departures have lasted around a week or two. His hiatus in November 2008 was much longer, but that was only thanks to LittleBigPlanet. This particular break lasted a grueling thirty-six hours before Chris returned to the internet to whine about voice actors on a Family Guy spin-off.

March 21st, 20...10. I have noticed that my absence has, uh, brought on a bit of chaos, on the... CWCipedia, and it has gone on beyond- behind my back. I have been depressed lately, because of my... cr- because of my girlfriend having left me, because of the tor- because of what this one guy did. He created that page, I know that. He tried to intrude my life. Once I find- once I find him, he will... be he- he will be tortured bad. But aside from that, I have let my- I have let the trolls torture me because of my re- because of my real life... stories having been leaked on the internet. But now the chaos is going to be done. I have shared my stories and t-arts of my electric hedgehog Pokemon. I have established my own, on my own, my main oh- my power of ownership as the original creator and author. I have established (gasp)... so much, and learned a lot in socializing and dealing with the good, and the bad. But I am not the quit, I am not quitting, this-and the comic series will continue. But you'll have to wait until the comic book pages hit the stores, before it, in order for you to read more. I have already won, because I have learned so much. I am famous worldwide, and I own the main copyrights to everything about it. About Sonichu, Rosechu, and the city of CWCville and everything therein. And I am going to take it a step further after this.
But first, I am making my- I am removing mys- I am removing myself from the internet. Because I have let- because I have put too much of my personal life online to be ridiculed so much. Let's see how you trolls plan to deal with me when I am not there to be dealt with! Even though I ignore your phone calls THAT'S ONE THING! And I will, and I, y'all do your treachery behind my back, your treachery and your mockery. But that chaos ends now, because I am going to enjoy real life. I do not need the internet, nobody needs the internet! They just need to enjoy real life, go out and socialize! Talk to people! E-mails are so yesterday! Going out and finding people to talk to, and talking to them face to face is always IN. So you can forget the damn Facebook, and the MySpace, and those other social sites, because the only true social site... is... all around you. At your shopping mall. At the salons, and schools, and colleges! Everywhere! Even at churches, and bookstores, the game stores, the GameStops, everywhere all around you, is a social site. And you don't need a computer to access it. All you have to do, is just go outside, and eh- and see for yourself. And say "Hello." Internet is one thing to go talking to another country, but you don't need to be talking to others in the country, when you can talk to everybody else, around you locally. Because those are the most important people to you, the ones that are closest to you.
So I leave you all with tha- with those words, and it is not "Good-bye," but more like "See ya later." For me- for me and my Sonichu, Rosechu and everybody, because we will be back. And we don- but we don't need the online websites to... be famous anymore, because we have established world famedom. We have established my ownership of everything therein. We have established the pow- the mental education of having to deal with the good, and the bad, and the worse. Damn trolls. Your bullying is not appreciated, even locally. So you can just take your bullyings, and bully yourselves. If you want to do- if you want- if you're bored, go work around the house. Go take a walk. 'Cause you don't need the internet. You don't need to stay cooped up inside, you just need to go outside, and enjoy life, and the sun, and the days you have to live. I'm Christian Weston Chandler, of Ruckersville, Virginia. Birthname Christopher, Spanish nickname Ricardo, original creator of the electric hedgehog Pokemon, Sonichu and Rosechu, and the city of CWCville, Virginia. I bid you all, stay safe, and good day.
