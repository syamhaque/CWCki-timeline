Fiona's Arrival
The WCT states that he is inviting in Bella on Chris's request, a move that Anaxis questions but does not push back on. He expresses a hope to coordinate with Praetor on Chris's security at the convention. When Fiona under the alias ScootalooSister joins, WCT confirms that she is "Fifi" and not Bella, then states that she is autistic and describes her physical appearance. Anaxis warns WCT about sharing too much information with Fiona, concerns that he largely dismisses. Later, I remark on how long Chris's textwall is getting, and how Twitter's short-form posts aren't really suited to his needs.
The WCT 12:58 PM
@everyone a member of Praetor might be joining the Knights of CWC.
Chris told me in DMs that Bella is coming in.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 01:04 PM
Is that the best idea?
The WCT 01:05 PM
[Replying to "Is that the best idea?"]
I'll give her and anybody we may not completely trust to an extent the Charlie role. (First Layer only)
Lainchu (Anaxis) 01:06 PM
Sure
The WCT 01:07 PM
I intend on not repeating the same mistakes as the Watchmen.
We need to know more about Praetor, not destroy them.
Para 01:09 PM
thats legit stupid
chris is a simp
The WCT 01:12 PM
[Replying to "chris is a simp"]
we knew that 12 years ago. lol
[Screenshot of Chris asking WCT to invite in Bella and the Suitress.][note 1]
@The Fool I'm hopeful that the Praetor kids will coordinate with us to ensure Chris's physical safety at Everfree NW.
The Fool 01:23 PM
so is scoot bella or fifi
The WCT 01:23 PM
[Replying to "so is scoot bella or fifi"]
Chris told me it was Fifi.
I'm confident Bella will also end up joining, but I hope Caden follows.
Para 01:32 PM
they both got onlyfans?
The WCT 01:33 PM
no
The Fool 01:33 PM
aw damn I wanted to see if I could jerk off to her or not
The WCT 01:33 PM
Bella and Fifi from what I know aren't like Anni. lol
The Fool 01:33 PM
thats weird, bella is such an e-girl name
The WCT 01:34 PM
Fifi is autistic according to Chris.
The Fool 01:34 PM
there was an extremely high chance of that
Para 01:35 PM
probably a larp or a troon
The WCT 01:35 PM
Chris gave me a picture of her.
The Fool 01:35 PM
there's no way a girl can be autistic
girls cannot be autistic and never poop
The WCT 01:36 PM
[Replying to "Chris gave me a picture of her."]
its a woman without question.
she looks thin and has pink hair.
(cue SJW memes)
Lainchu (Anaxis) 01:36 PM
Be wary of telling this new person too much right out the gate
The Fool 01:36 PM
no shit
Lainchu (Anaxis) 01:36 PM
She needs to know only the basics, she doesn't need to know everything
The Fool 01:37 PM
I only speak in public information outside of here
Para 01:37 PM
show
The WCT 01:37 PM
[Replying to "She needs to know only the basics, she doesn't need to know everything"]
the Watchmen breaking apart is public knowledge.
The Fool 01:38 PM
thats why I said there's a cwcki article on them
The WCT 01:38 PM
unless you're talking about something else.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 01:38 PM
I know, but the treatment of Praetor within said group isn't
The WCT 01:38 PM
oh okay.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 01:38 PM
Aside from the one info release about the taser
The Fool 01:39 PM
if chris knows about it then it's probably safe to assume his other friends/contacts do as well, except for the shit he explicitly told us to keep to ourselves
The WCT 01:39 PM
The Praetor folks also know. lol
The WCT 01:46 PM
that's a lot of writing chris.
This is definitely the place 2.0.
The Fool 01:49 PM
I really wish I set up a XLnet bot so I could have it summarize that shit lol
Para 01:49 PM
its fucking nonsense
The WCT 01:49 PM
its Chris.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 01:50 PM
Oh my god, he's still going
[1 sonichulol[1] reaction]
I stepped away for like five minutes
The WCT 01:54 PM
looks like his essay finally ended.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 01:57 PM
Chris should really start a blog where he can ramble to his heart's content
He can call it "My Two Bolts and a Heart"
Twitter's short-form messages don't really suit him
The WCT 02:01 PM
[Replying to "Chris should really start a blog where he can ramble to his heart's content"]
Josh should set that up for him.
The Fool 02:11 PM
he could just make a tumblr
thats what I use for my schizo rambling
because I know nobody actually wants to see that
Para 02:13 PM
lets see it
ChibiFemto[2]
Para 02:24 PM
who is that
Lainchu (Anaxis) 02:26 PM
Then again, Twitter is definitely the platform where he gets the most attention (and validation)
Bella's Arrival
NOTE: Chris was not directly involved in this conversation.
Anaxis asks who the new person is and WCT confirms that it's Bella. The Fool makes fun of Bella's Pepe the Frog avatar, sarcastically remarking on his certainty that "she's a very mature and well-adjusted member of society." Para questions why "zoomers" care about Chris, to which WCT states is because COVID gave them a lot of time to kill.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 02:26 PM
Who's the new guy?
The Fool 02:28 PM
tumblr actually has a twitter integration so all new posts automatically get tweeted
The WCT 02:36 PM
[Replying to "Who's the new guy?"]
Chris told me its Bella.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 02:36 PM
Ah
The Fool 02:37 PM
>woman
>peepo
I'm sure she's a very mature and well-adjusted member of society[note 2]
The WCT 02:38 PM
[Art of a smiling Pepe the Frog.]
Para 02:56 PM
>zoomer
why do zoomers care about chris
The WCT 02:56 PM
[Replying to "why do zoomers care about chris"]
because zoomers have a lot of time to kill
If there was no COVID, I don't think Praetor would be here right now.
