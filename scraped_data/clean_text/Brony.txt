Chris attends BronyCon 2019.
A brony is a teenage-to-adult male who has become a fan of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic; female fans in their age demographic are sometimes called pegasisters.
While one would think Chris would be proud, or even claim responsibility for, bronies given the contents of his FUTURE MESSAGE, Chris manages to once again defy expectations and common sense. Chris seemed to hate all bronies simply because they have ducks and are therefore JERKS. When Chris became a tomgirl, he considered himself a pegasister. It was only a matter of time before he started making demands on Facebook for bronies to bow down to their pegasister counterparts. He seems to blame the parts of the fandom which offend him, such as PONY.MOV (a satirical internet cartoon series that's actually
– believe it or not – an affectionate parody of the show), on the wretched brony MALES and their twisted perversions while assuring himself that the female fans of the show are no doubt responsible for all the elements of the fandom he admires and mass debates to.
From 2017 to 2019, Chris attended the final three years of BronyCon, a pony convention held in Baltimore, Maryland. During these events, he appeared in an immeasurable number of photographs and videos:
BronyCon 2017
BronyCon 2018
BronyCon 2019
As of BronyCon, his stance against men who like ponies seems to have softened somewhat. He was photographed smiling in the presence of other men and didn't accuse any of them being discriminatory towards him. However, by all accounts (including his own) he still gravitated towards talking toward women at the convention. It's likely that he secretly still finds men he doesn't know to be offensive, regardless of if they are wearing a pony hat or not. The other possibility is that he simply isn't interested in Bronies because, despite his claims, he is still only interested in socializing for one thing that no man can give him.
With the conclusion of BronyCon, Chris set his sights on a new convention to fill the gap; it was his intention to attend BABSCon, which is based in the San Francisco Bay Area. Despite being delayed twice to 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Chris did not give up. Chris made plans to attend the brony convention Everfree Northwest with the help of funding from Kiwi Farms, in August 2021. After the fallout from the incest leaks on the 30th of July, Chris was pretty much declared persona non grata and preemptively banned from Everfree,[1] and subsequently sent to jail. Everfree 2021 occurred without Chris, and no shenanigans were to be had there.
