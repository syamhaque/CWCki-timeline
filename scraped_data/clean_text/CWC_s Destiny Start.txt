================================================================================

CWC`s Destiny Start is a video Chris uploaded on March 23, 2016. The video showcases Chris's non-existent FPS skills, and is shot in the style of a Let's Play which would be fine if Chris hadn't forgotten to turn his mic on, though audio from the game exists.
In addition to forgetting to turn on his mic, Chris also forgot to disable comments and likes/dislikes, resulting in the comments section being flooded with weens. He amended this mistake soon after, however.
