Lost media refers to media that once existed but has been lost or destroyed or media that has never been released publicly.[1] This article aims to document the following kinds of lost media:
Media made by or featuring Chris which was once publicly available on the internet but has since disappeared or is fragmentary.
Media made by or featuring Chris which is known to exist but which has never been released to the public.
Media made by trolls that Chris has responded to or acknowledged which was once publicly available on the internet but has since disappeared or is fragmentary or which is known to exist but which has never been released to the public.
Relics of Fail whose current whereabouts are unknown or were destroyed (excluding those that Chris is known to have sold to fans).
Because of the broad scope of the article, it is unlikely to ever be complete. Of course, some lost media is of greater interest to Christorians than other lost media.

Autism papers
See also: Autism papers
The Autism papers were a series of papers detailing the mental state of Chris and to what extent he has autism. Most of these papers appeared to have been destroyed in the 2014 house fire as none of them have appeared since. Even if not destroyed in the 2014 house fire, the hoard that is 14 Branchland Court makes finding these papers next to impossible, making these papers almost certainly lost. However, one paper from 2004 survives as it was e-mailed to Kacey by Chris who passed it on to Liquid Chris who then distributed the paper online in November 2009.
Christian Weston Chandler...Yep, I'm on TV :) (Master Copy)
See also: Christian Weston Chandler...Yep, I'm on TV :)
An extended edition of Chris's 2007 homemade DVD allegedly featuring over six hours of original content. Chris offered to share it with Regina in their emails. It was given to Joseph Draft in 2019 during planning for the cancelled Chris Chan VS. The Internet documentary.
CWC's Diary
See also: CWC's Diary
CWC's Diary refers to a series of entries published between 2004-2005 in a diary format. It is unknown if these entries came from a physical diary or from Chris's blogs on MySpace and Facebook. It must be remembered that the entries available are the ones Chris made public on Encyclopedia Dramatica and that the diary in its entirety has not been found. With Chris's MySpace being deleted in mid-2008 and a physical diary not emerging CWC's Diary in its entirety is lost.
CWC's Pokésite 1
See also: CWC's Pokésite 1
CWC's Pokésite 1, originally known as CWC's Pokésite, was Chris's first website launched between 25 April and 3 July 1999. Chris appears to have abandoned the site in late July as on 22 July CWC's Pokésite 2 was launched. The content of CWC's Pokésite 1 is lost as the site is no longer up and the archive of the site only has three pages with the rest not working.[2][3][4] Also, the site guestbook is still available.[5] A Spanish version of the site also existed, however, the site is down and it was never archived making this lost as well.[6]
How to Attract an 18 - ... -Year Old Female Companion Without Saying "Hi" (For the Very Shy Man)
See also: User:RachmaninovDESU/How to Attract an 18 - ... -Year Old Female Companion Without Saying "Hi"
The work is a pamphlet created by Chris on how to attract women. The date of creation is unknown however as Chris uses the pseudonym "Reldnahc Netso' Naitsirhc" a misspelling of Reldnahc Notsew Naitsirhc which was created on 24 March 2005 it is likely that the pamphlet was created sometime after though a terminus ante quem has not been established. While the front cover exists the rest of the pamphlet has not emerged either because it does not exist or because it is lost.
Report cards
See also: Honor roll
The report cards are a series of papers from Chris's education detailing his grades and academic progress. There has been no mention of these documents since the 2014 house fire, likely being destroyed and thereby lost. Even if not destroyed Chris, claimed before the house fire in 2009 within Mailbag 19 that he could not access the documents.[7] Considering how cluttered 14 Branchland Court is and Chris not having access to the documents, to begin with, it is unlikely that the documents can be found, making them lost if they have not been destroyed. However, Chris's grades can be seen in the assignments that have survived in the Manchester High Leaks, so Chris's grades are not entirely lost.
Sonic the Hedgehog Watch & Win Sweepstakes (items)
See also: Sonic the Hedgehog Watch & Win Sweepstakes
The Sonic the Hedgehog Watch & Win Sweepstakes was a contest held in 1993 in which the person who wrote down every "Sonic Sez" segment and sent it in would get the chance to win certain prizes, with the biggest prize being a $1,000 shopping spree at Kay-Bee Toys.[8] Chris won this contest in 1994 and got the $1,000 shopping spree; however, only five items have been known to be purchased:
Batman Returns ($49.99)
Sonic CD (unknown price)
Sonic Spinball ($49.99)
"Star Trek" (probably Star Trek: The Next Generation: Echoes from the Past) (unknown price)
"Power Rangers Megazord" (unknown price. Estimate $29.99)
It is unknown what other items Chris bought with the remaining $857.04 (not including the prices of Sonic CD and the Star Trek game) and are thereby lost. Furthermore, as revealed in a 21 June 2021 message on The Place Discord server,[9] only Sonic CD was still in Chris's possession at that point, with the rest either having perished in the fire or sold off.
The First PS3 Attempt
As the title suggests, this is presumably Chris's first attempt at his Pixelated PS3 video. It was included in the "Director's Cut" of Christian Weston Chandler...Yep, I'm on TV :) as an exclusive feature. According to the Director's Cut cover, it was filmed on 18 November 2006, the same date as the final take of the video. However, the regular DVD cover says that the Pixelated PS3 video was filmed on 28 November, so it may have been filmed on that date instead. Although the Director's Cut was obtained by Catherine and other material from it was leaked to the Internet, this video has never surfaced, possibly because it was just too uninteresting.

See also: March 2024 livestreams#Christ Chan Live Stream: Over the Shoulder Colouring and Drawing 2 (accidental streams)
This video was the latter of the two accidentally started livestream recordings, which consisted of Chris singing the same song as the last time, before realising he pressed the stream button instead of recording it. While the first one has been saved, the latter was deleted far too soon for anyone to download it, making it forever lost.
CWCki Forums posts (paintingatree)
See also: CWCki Forums posts (paintingatree)
paintingatree was Chris's CWCki Forums account. However the posts preserved under this account come from the second account made in early 2013 as Chris's first account, also called paintingatree, was made sometime in 2012.

See also: Dillin Thomas DMs

Two DMs are known with the former, leaked on 23 December 2019, only having one quote from Chris preserved with the rest of their communication being lost.
eBay Purchases and Listings (2001-2008)
Chris has been using eBay since all the way back in 2001. While this wiki has archived most of Chris's eBay listings (and purchases) from 2008 onward, the same can't be said for his previous ones prior to that year. There have been a few records of his purchases from that era, but not a whole lot, and especially nothing of his potential listings. Chris's bans and suspensions from eBay, as well as potentially using sockpuppets, also make archiving these difficult, so it's possible these bits of info are lost.

Julie Reveals Herself (Video)
See also: Julie Reveals Herself
Julie Reveals Herself is a Mumble chat between Bluespike and Chris on 3 March 2009 which involves shoving the Sonichu Medallion up his rectum and Julie revealing herself to be a boy. While the audio of the chat exists, the video that accompanied it, which includes footage of Chris shoving the Sonichu Medallion up his rectum, is lost. It's worth noting that Chris claimed he didn't record himself doing so, so it's possible a video recording never existed to begin with (and given the rest of the trolls were disgusted at what was going on, it's possibly unlikely they didn't have a recording of it either).

Red Forest (other audio files)
See also: Red Forest
Red Forest is one of several audio files created by Joshua Wise in the autumn of 2017 used to manipulate Chris's beliefs on reality. Other files aside from Red Forest are known to have existed with the only known one being revealed by Wise in the Idea Guy Q&A in which Wise used modified audio of Chris to manipulate him.[18] This audio has never been released, and it is unknown how many other audio clips existed as none aside from Red Forest have been leaked, making them lost.
Rollin' and Trollin' (raw footage)
See also: Rollin' and Trollin'
On 17 July 2009, Chris uploaded a video filmed by the Magical Man in which he attempted to convince viewers that his entire internet history had in fact been a trolling scheme. The video was evidently filmed with a camera that had a 16:9 aspect ratio, before being stretched to a 4:3 aspect ratio and exported in 480p quality. Additionally, the camera used to record the video also seems to have used a hard drive, as evidenced by the lack of tape or disc noise. This suggests that the raw footage of Rollin' and Trollin' could be the earliest known video of Chris recorded in HD, though any raw footage from the video's production has yet to surface and is likely lost.
Simonchu
See also: Simonchu

However the uploaded interview was an edited version, with the unedited version only being accessible if someone pledged to the $100,000 tier on Keffals's Patreon.[27] Currently no one has pledged to this tier and considering the price point it is unlikely that anyone ever will, making this work currently lost.

While many of their interactions with Chris are known, Marvin has confirmed that a significant amount of chats and calls the Miscreants and Chris had have not been released.[30][31][32][33] Considering how long ago these interactions happened and the fact it is unknown if anyone has these unreleased chats and calls, these interactions are likely lost.
Web Soup Appearance
See also: For G4s Web Soup
Web Soup was a television series on the defunct network G4, which served as a spin-off of the E! network's long-running series The Soup and, like that series, focused on satirical commentary on then-recent pop culture events, specifically Internet media and viral videos. One episode, aired in July 2009, featured an appearance of Chris's I Got a Fish video, the second time it popped up in the mainstream media. However, even though Chris himself acknowledged this appearance, the episode with that segment has been lost to time. While several other episodes of Web Soup have been recovered and archived over the years, the one with Chris's appearance has yet to resurface, not helped by the series being off the air since 2014 and never having been given an official home media release.

See also: Red String of Fate
The Red String of Fate was a string with a paper heart attached on the end designed to attract a boyfriend-free girl that Chris created on 1 August 2004. In anime like Excel Saga, of which Chris likely got the idea from as he watched Excel Saga before creating the Red String of Fate,[37] the red string is used as a metaphor to in courting love. However, Chris did not see the metaphor and would throw the red string at women in the hopes of "reeling" them in.

Fiona Facetime Video - Hair Twirling
See also: Fiona Facetime Videos
Three videos of Fiona and Chris interacting over Facetime were censored on the CWCki. This was due to the Suitress Policy, which at one point called for censoring Fiona's appearances.

The source for the original video was later found.

However, on 23 April 2018, Chris listed ShecameforCWC.JPG for sale on his eBay, which was bought by the Teen Troon Squad. It turned out that Chris had not truly destroyed the drawing but cut it up into squares - making it easy to reassemble - before placing it in the Crumple-Lope. It is unknown what the Teen Troon Squad have done with the drawing but it can be presumed they still own it, though they have not shown it off.

Unknown Lost Media
While this article has listed lost media associated with Chris, this is the only lost media known to have existed and is now lost. It is almost certain that there are hundreds if not thousands of pieces of lost media around Chris that were never known or never released publicly or were never archived and have been lost. One can only speculate what has not been released or what has been lost over the course of Chris's life. Moreover, one can only speculate on what is waiting to be found.
