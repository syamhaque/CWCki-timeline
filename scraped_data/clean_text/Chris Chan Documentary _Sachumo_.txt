Christian Weston Chandler (uploaded on YouTube as Chris Chan Documentary) is an unofficial fan-made documentary film based on Chris's life from his birth to January 2015, directed and created by Kiwi Farms member spylobster (also known as Sachumo on YouTube). It was successfully completed and released to YouTube on 2 February 2015.
Made as a high school project, the film takes a look at Chris's troubled life in a mostly serious and factual fashion, utilizing photos, videos, and interviews, although it does have its moments of comedy. Notably, the film presents no bias towards Chris as a whole; at the end, it leaves it up to the viewers to decide how they feel about Chris. Sachumo has since uploaded another video showing his teacher's (mostly positive) responses towards the video.
The documentary was highly anticipated when it was first announced on the Farms. This was the very first actual film produced about Chris; previously, there were only fake movie trailers made out of Chris. Upon release, Christian Weston Chandler was well-received, gaining over 2.4 million views and 54,000 likes as of January 2023. The success of the film led to Sachumo confirming plans for a sequel;[2] however, these plans have largely fallen into development hell ever since.
The film features "Still Alive" from Portal as its ending theme. While "Still Alive" is a song primarily sung about the ending to the game and the character of GLaDOS herself, the lyrics to the song take on a strangely fitting and bittersweet tone in the context of Chris's life. Lyrics that serve as an example of this are "There's no sense crying over every mistake", and "I prefer to stay inside". Despite its inclusion, Sachumo has stated that he is not a big fan of Portal.

Chris recounts "viewing" the documentary.
According to Chris, he was aware of the documentary's existence for some time, but withheld from watching it, as he believed it would prove enduring. Indeed, in 2016, Chris expressed knowledge of the video's existence in the BraveryJerk Interviews, calling it "insensitive". In mid-September 2017, artist Merryweathery interviewed Chris for his latest Internet Dream Lounge podcast. During their first recording, Merryweather remarked on Chris' status on the internet, labelling him as a "legend". Chris questioned the label, to which Merryweather attributed the plentiful documentation of his life. The podcast interview would motivate Chris to view Sachumo's film, with the optimism that it may offer a positive response.
On 22 September, Chris "viewed" the documentary. He refused to watch the documentary - opting instead to listen via his iPod. Despite his precaution, the film was an emotional experience. In particular, he noted feeling sentimental for his life before 2004. Continuing through the remainder of the video, beyond his 2007 discovery, Chris did not tolerate the content, and as a result, gave the video a thumbs down.
Upon completing the video, Chris mentioned in an overly-dramatized Facebook post that he had a hard time viewing the documentary. He wished that someone would compile "recorded video testimonies" from everyone "touched" by his work, kindness, and efforts, in the process showing that the good he had done outweighed his hate.
The following day, Chris offered further advice on how to improve the documentary. Chris suggested that the interviewees be people whom he believes he has had a positive impact on (such as attendees of BronyCon), as well as shortening the sagas to a simple overview. He also proposed including the events from 2014 to 2017, with the purpose of showcasing the more positive events in Chris' life. In summary, Chris's amendments would turn a non-biased production into an hour of one-sided admiration.
In the Internet Dream Lounge interview, Chris stated that he appreciated the complementary documentary response video, as critiqued by Sachumo's teacher.[3]
