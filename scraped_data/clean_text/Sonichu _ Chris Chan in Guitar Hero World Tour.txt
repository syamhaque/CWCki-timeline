================================================================================

Sonichu & Chris Chan in Guitar Hero World Tour is a video uploaded by Chris on 27 October 2008, which shows him playing the Pat Benatar song "Heartbreaker" in Guitar Hero: World Tour. It was primarily uploaded to show off the Sonichu customizations that he added to the game, and to help get votes for his entry into a GameStop Guitar Hero contest that occurred at the time.
As in his comics, he portrays himself as thin and fit. While this is partly due to the fact that that game doesn't have an overweight character model, it would still be possible for Chris to give his in-game self some degree of huskiness.
Description
I've created the Sonichu Band Icon from scratch, as well as my Character and Guitar. Enjoy the further testaments of my capabilities and creativity in tune to Pat Benatar's "Heartbreaker." Also, I am up in the "Auditions" on Gamestop.com; please Vote for my Rockin' Picture to get me as a Playable Character with Sonichu & Rosechu in my Band in a Future Guitar Hero Game.
