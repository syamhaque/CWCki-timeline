Retrospective Tweets
Chris has commented on some events in his life which were depicted in the comic.
Barb's hoard
3 January 2018
@BryanFrogBoy:
Page 2 of my @CWCSonichu prequel comic. Not planning on finishing - just practicing
Chris:
Please, Do complete this prequel comic; I am very curious of your take of Cwcville Christian's Past, or otherwise your interpretation of my past. For Your Information, the Pack-Ratting and Hoarding DID Bother Me a lot. Thank you.
Venting about trolls
8 January 2018
@BryanFrogBoy:
Page 6 of my @CWCSonichu prequel comic
Chris:
Wow! That was exactly how I Felt! It makes so much more sense to me why I impulsively put too much of myself into the earlier books like I did. I Was venting a lot. Spot on, @Bryanfrogboy. Thank you for seeing and appreciating that of me. 😊❤️
The Love Quest
9 January 2018
@BryanFrogBoy:
@CWCSonichu prequel page 7
Chris:
I really worked too hard on something I should not have pushed too much on, the “Love Quest”... I Really should have focused more on Sonichu, his life and all of that. Instead, I did too much with myself.
I was more selfish back then. I really regret that I was. It has done a lot of damage to everyone around me.
shecameforcwc
11 January 2018
@BryanFrogBoy:
Page 9 (pretty sure, losing track) of @CWCSonichu prequel
Chris:
How Could they have been mutual after that, Period?!
And now, despite the Original Piece being Totally Torn apart, it still reappears to haunt me.
When will that symbol of my sin of lust be long forgotten?
Soon, I pray.
I continue to Repent.
Apology to Alec
21 January 2018
@BryanFrogBoy:
@CWCSonichu prequel page 19 - the death of Alec Benson Leary
Chris:
Oh, My Goddess! That was really dark. And such a potent look at myself in the mirror of my past. And Asperchu was only a minor thing that I took too far so many years ago. I’m sorry, Alec.
Apology for saying "JEW!" to Snyder
24 January
@BryanFrogBoy:
@CWCSonichu prequel pg 22
Chris:
Not his Heritage, more like his cold-hearted personality.
@BryanFrogBoy:
I just figured it was a nicer thing to write than when younger Cwc called him a Jew.
Chris:
I agree, that Was most insensitive of me back then.
I was more upset at Him than Judaism; I really have nothing against the Jewish people, and I am sorry for using the term as an ending insult upon him.
That is not cool to do Anytime, or any situation.
Chris on Biographies
Argument over Reality Cartoons
On 3 February 2018, Chris argued with Bryan over Twitter:
Bryan:
I don't believe that cartoons are real in any reality, but I can't influence what Chris believes. All I can do is encourage her.
Chris:
That is a Real Shame that you say that, @Bryanfrogboy, because our “Fictional” Individuals ARE REAL, and they Do Exist; they are Alive, and Breathing and Living, just like you, I and everyone else in This World. You should Open Your Mind and Heart to them, Fully.
Bryan:
Okay I'll keep an open mind to this but I have questions. Does the Chris in my comic live a life independent of yours?
Chris:
To answer this question, before I answer the rest of your questions in PM: Yes, that Chris does live, as depicted in your book, independent from the Christine Chandler of Cwcville’s main dimension, but in another dimension.
Another Twitter user replied:
Scary. You shouldn't feed into delusions. Do you not see the prob with this given the person i brought up who thought his char where real and killed people . Do you see no link. Its sad and just plain wrong if you are encouraging a person to believe that cartoons are real. SAD
Bryan:
I don't think cartoons are real and don't encourage it, but I can't change her view. Chris isn't a child, if she thinks cartoons are alive she should consult a professional.
Chris:
“Consult a professional” is another insensitive comment. That is Strike Two, @Bryanfrogboy.
More appropriately, you should see it for yourself, to try to Understand for yourself.
Bryan:
I guess if I truly believed my cartoons existed in another world, they would all be very happy and have no villains or drama. I'd owe it to my characters.
Chris:
That is a lovely thought, but there is going to be drama and tough situations for everyone, no matter which dimension; they Earn their Happiness, as they all have fought through their trials and endeavors, like everyone.
And That is why you do owe it to your character family.
Because they have fought about as much as their creator, and parental figure, which is you, has.
handofgalochio:
So, does that mean that every interpretation of your characters constitutes a separate world?
Chris:
Situation-wise, and to link it to Cwcville, yes. But like the Sonic the Hedgehog OCs, the OCs from Sonichu and Rosechu co-exists with the originals in the same dimension, which include Asperchu and his friends/family. But some FanFics actually do hit spot-on to the Originals in the same dimension, such as Trickie’s “Rosechu's Story”, because those situations Are mostly matching to the Original Rosey Rosechu.
Now, with regard to @Bryanfrogboy book, for one example from within, Neither I, nor Christine of the original dimension, has had boxes fall upon either of us as the fire started, and no unconscious moment right after either. Although, while Christine is essentially like my Avatar in Cwcville, she has had Many a different situation, mental and personality aspects from myself, but she still is High-Functioning Autistic, and linked with me Mentally And Emotionally. DEFINITELY in the Emotions!
But I Digress. @Bryanfrogboy’s Story, while Mostly Matching And Reflective Of Christine and I, and our relationship with Sonichu, it would still exist in an alternate dimension where every one of those differing situations would have happened, from Cwcville’s Prime Dimension.
Announcing store opening
6 February 2018
Yes, by my personal Approval, this store is good to go. 😊 https://twitter.com/bryanfrogboy/status/960835663477161984
Chris linked to Bryan's tweet, which read:
Feeling blessed to have my merchandise available on

merch for her graciousness!

Lulu print quality
7 February 2018
Bryanfrogboy
@CWCSonichu the proof came in! Do proofs always come in washed out or should I expect every lulu project to be like that?
[uploads another photo of the pages]
Chris
Depends on your definition of “washed out”, but compared to my copy of book 12 on its cover, being glossy and shiny, and the pages looking like they were printed on normal paper, then Yes.
Bryanfrogboy
There must be something I didn't tick. I'll Send the files to you to take over =)
Book sales agreement
7 February 2018
Alex Smith @starcraft al
Any chance of reprinting the prequel comic?
Bryanfrogboy
Yes, I have a draft coming in the mail, have to figure out how Christine wants to sell it
Chris
That is a good question.
Bryanfrogboy
You can sell it on a handshake basis. Keep whatever profit the books is worth. I'm getting enough selling the leftover pages I drew. =)
Very nice art
12 February 2018
I just got this in the mail today!
Thank you, @Bryanfrogboy!
I’ll keep it on my canvas until when I can get a proper frame for it.
Chris gets the prequel comic
16 February 2018
I got my printed copy of the Prequel Comic in the mail today, from my printer, remaining as drawn and written by @Bryanfrogboy, but with two additional pages in the back. 😊

#MakeBryCry
28 April 2018
Bryanfrogboy:
I wanna do a mean art contest. Whoever draws me in what I deem the meanest way (beat up, bleeding, looking like a ren & stimpy closeup etc) will get 50 dollars! Just tweet them at me (nothing nsfw please) ;D #MakeBryCry
Chris:
Here’s one for #MakeBryCry , with a poetic bonus that makes him want to join us. :)
Gay for Bryanfrogboy
30 April 2018
Bryanfrogboy:
@CWCSonichu Rumor has it you might be attracted to me. Can such rumors be substantiated?
Chris:
You are Very Attractive, Bryan; I could kiss your good-looking face anytime.  ;)
Bryan walks away
5 May 2018
Bryanfrogboy
Chris I said this once and if I'm honest it needs to be said again. PLEASE see a doctor about this. Healthy functional humans don't see cartoons everywhere. I know this is hard for you but I just want to see you be a healthy breadwinning adult.
Just frustrated with Chris berating her fans on patreon for not paying her when she has given her fans next to nothing.
Chris gets all the money for the book[1] and that’s fine. I don’t want my name on it anymore.
I wouldn’t care so much. My goal this year was to break into comics with real people. 1 Page a day minimum. I just wish Chris could make... 20-30 pages in a year would be something. It’s just sad. I feel weird making more Chris content than she has this year.
weta_ink
yo crispy western Chandler , I've been quite about this, i want you to not sexualize my boyfriend please.
Chris
@BryanShickley @weta_ink Y'all think I don't read this? My heart is Broken! I was being playful and flirty! You should check out the show "Polyamory" on Showtime. It's on Amazon Prime, too! I hope I didn't make you feel jealousy!
Afterwards, Bryan began ignoring Chris. The Captain, not wanting Chris to lose a potential income stream from sales of Prequel (as Chris's finances were dire after having given money to the Idea Guys), then intervened, reaching out to Bryan and facilitating contact between him and Chris by telling Bryan that Chris was sorry for what he'd said and that the two should talk it out because Chris would need the money.[2]

Happy @CPU_CWCSonichu Love Day!! The FULL animation is out. Many Thanks to @vadimnewquist/@creationistcat, @gabcas210 @the3GI and (SPOILERS) Christine as well. None of this was possible without your support and great talents!
Chris
Thank you all for this lovely compilation. 😊 ⚡️💙⚡️
I thank @gabcas210 and @vadimnewquist for their voice acting; very good work.
Also, thanks to @Heckbent for being part of it as well; just a cool dude doing his thing.
