YOUR TAX DOLLARS AT WORK!The contents of this page have been bought with taxpayer money!
Confirmation e-mails, a testament to Chris's financial responsibility.
The PlayStation Network is an online digital media service introduced with the PS3 with its launch in 2006. It allows users to buy games, movies, TV shows, and other stuff, as well as social media features, music and movie streaming, and cloud gaming. Being as irresponsible with money as he is, Chris went into overdrive with this feature of the PS3's online capabilities. Chris spent so much on the PSN that it contributed most of his credit card debt at the time (roughly $3,500 circa early 2010).
You might ask yourself how he could've spent that much and what he could've spent it on. Chris seemingly bought (and still buys) everything possible, from game content to movies to several episodes of terrible harem anime. A list of Chris's PSN purchases reveals that he frequently bought DLC for games he doesn't even own.
Chris spent at least $6,127.64 in American taxpayer dollars.

Spending history
The following table chronicles Chris's deposits into his PlayStation Network "wallet" between April 2007 and February 2010, the period for which detailed records of his transactions are available (thanks to the work of expert hackers).
Some interesting patterns can be spotted in his spending habits. He was relatively thrifty for most of 2007 and into early 2008 when he still had a few other outlets for entertaining himself outside of his room. There's a sharp spike around the time of his first ban from The GAMe PLACe in the spring of 2008, although that signal spike might have been augmented as a result of his concurrent "breakup" with Megan Schroeder in a bid to salve the emotional wound with the desperate application of virtual toys. Likewise, it's probably not a coincidence that after Chris was permanently booted from The PLACe in the summer of 2008, he began spending a shit ton more tugboat money on PSN.
In light of the second wave of the Vivian Gee e-mails, Chris's spending in early 2010 is impressive. Despite being supposedly put on a strict budget by his father at the time (in order to pay down debts created by his earlier PSN spending), he still managed to spend around $100 or more a month.

Due to the trophy data not visible to the public and people reporting hearsay as fact, a lot of people were under the assumption that Chris had 100% of the trophies in Sonic 2006 (which doesn't even have trophies). Now, we're equally perplexed by the fact that Chris has only 75% of trophies in a bona-fide 3D Sonic title.

Comparing to the list of games he owns, there was a bunch of them that he hadn't even booted up a single time. There are some games he had touched maybe once and then left to the wayside; for example, all of his BioShock trophies are from the beginning of the game, and he received all of them on October 23, 2008, over a couple of hours. (The logical conclusion is that the second level of BioShock will blow your mind.) In public, he also prominently featured games he never really played; the PS3 History Level shows many games that he touched only a few times (Mirror's Edge and BioShock, for example, currently sit at 11% and 9% respectively), and in the PS3 tutorial, Chris says he thinks PAIN is a "fun" game, yet he let it sit at 0%.
Hacking
Main article: Jack_Thaddeus#PSN_Hacking
As a result of his online notoriety, his poor choice of passwords, and his innate gullibility, Chris’s PlayStation Network account was hacked or otherwise wrested from his control on multiple occasions. BlueSpike, in his guise as Chris’s sweetheart Julie, was able to convince Chris to break the first fundamental rule of cybersecurity and "share" his password in February 2009, which was later used as a wedge to control and torment Chris. That summer, Jack Thaddeus seized the account, resulting in detailed revelations concerning Chris’s insane online spending habits, as well as the video with eight minutes of console humping. Chris managed to keep control of his accounts for a surprisingly long time after his run-in with Thaddeus, but his luck ran out on 24 February 2010, thanks to a certain Hawaiʻian.
Post-jail activity
Chris's status from August 2023.
Chris leaving a PS chat.
On 12 August 2023, about four months after his release from jail, Chris changed his PSN profile description from "I am Christine. <3" to "I'm Christ Chan Prime" to reflect the revelation he made while in jail.[2] If Chris is using "Prime" in the same way he used it when referring to Sonichu as "Sonichu Prime" (meaning the first and most important Sonichu), then Chris is possibly referring to himself as the most important incarnation of Jesus Christ, which is debatable.
On the same day, a screenshot of Chris leaving a PlayStation chat was posted to r/ChrisChanSonichu by user lambda115.[3] With zero context or other potential messages being added with the screenshot, it was assumed that this was Chris saying that Sonichu (the character) had left, though the OP clarified that this was just Chris, whose username on PSN is "Sonichu", leaving the chat.[4]
