Business with Chris
Main articles: Praetor and OfficialCWCmart
In September 2020, Caden, along with two associates, visited Chris at 14 Branchland Court to propose the idea of doing business with him. Caden's group - calling itself Praetor, proposed using a mold press to create and sell Sonichu medallions.[2] The medallions were sold beginning in December 2020 on Praetor's online shop OfficialCWCmart, with Chris being paid a royalty for Praetor's use of his Sonichu character.
In July 2021, Caden had plans to buy Chris a PC so he could do more streams,[3] however this plan was cut short by Chris's arrest after he fucked his mother. After Chris got kicked out of his house for this, he contacted Caden to try and get his assistance in finding a hotel, though it is unknown how Caden responded to this.[4] Chris later found a room himself at the Regency Inn Richmond, but was then arrested, kicking off the Jail Saga.
Enabling
Caden has played along with at least one of Chris's delusions, though has also shown restraint by discouraging Chris from going too far.
In February 2021, Chris became fascinated by the concept of piezoelectric crystals and thought he could apply it to help activate the Dimensional Merge by using a taser to zap two of his quartz crystals. Not owning a taser of his own, Chris wanted to borrow one of Praetor's to conduct his experiment. Caden planned to allow Chris to use one, but would supervise to ensure Chris wouldn't be in danger and take back the taser afterwards.[5] The Watchmen then interfered, and during a three-way call between Watchmen, Caden and Chris, Watchmen member Val sarcastically suggested Chris tase himself on video, and Chris half-jokingly replied he would as he considered himself immune to electricity from being part-Sonichu. Caden became concerned at Val's prompting and advised Chris that it would be a bad idea.
Jail Saga
“
Caden (Praetor) is genuinely one who is able to speak on my behalf when appropriate, and is in friendship and business association with I in mutual agreements
”
Chris[6]
During the Jail Saga, Caden continued doing business with Chris.
It is unclear when Caden began contacting Chris at Central Virginia Regional Jail. Early on, Chris appeared under the impression Caden was still his business partner - in a November 2021 phone call, Chris said he was likely to have Caden do work on publishing the "Goddess Log", his jail diary.[7] At some point, Caden was listed as the recipient of Chris's medical billing,[8] although he was not the only person to be listed as such.[9]
In May 2022, OfficialCWCmart began selling more items relating to Chris, including his jail drawings.
In June 2022, Chris started mentioning Caden in his letters, expressing his desire to have Helena Fiorenza collaborate with him,[10] though Caden did not respond when Helena attempted to do so.[11]
Chris's fundraiser plan
In July 2022, Chris began writing in letters about his newfound hatred of his mother Barbara. He told Caden to check if she was still at 14 Branchland Court, which he apparently did. Chris then pulled several theoretical crimes out of his ass and instructed Caden to call the police on Barbara, though there is no evidence Caden agreed to his request.
“
By Caden’s confirmation, Barbara was still at the Sonichu Temple; Redneck and Stubborn. So, giving him the list of her charable crimes, including pet negigance/mistreatment, suicide threats, emotional manipulation and abuse upon I, and ADA’s law of using someone else’s SSI, I have instructed Caden alone, to call the police on her.
”
Chris[12]
In another spate of selfishness, Chris, still desiring to live at 14 Branchland Court (but was allegedly legally forbidden from living with Barbara, the owner of the house) decided on starting a $150,000 fundraiser to pay off the house's mortgages and debts, and to put Barbara in an elderly care home. Chris hoped Caden, Kenneth Engelhardt and Helena would assist with his scheme.[11] Chris claimed to Helena that Caden was attempting to persuade Barb to move:[11]
“
But Barb is being a Majorly Stubborn Individual in relocating her self. Caden is working on persuading her and presenting her with the Truths of the Legality.
”
Chris[11]
Chris also claimed he sent a letter to Caden directing him to organize the fundraiser. No such fundraiser has been announced.
“
I have just sent a letter to Caden with all the specifics, and the one public letter and drawing on the matter, in organizing an online fundraiser to raise $150,000 to pay off the mortgage and debts, and some left to pay for her to start off in an Elderly Care Home
”
Chris[11]
Kenneth attempted to suggest Chris speak through a lawyer instead of Caden.[13] Chris fired back angrily.
“
And don't you judge Caden in that vain. He's not flawless, but he is more Perfect of himself and at what and how he does as a legit Friend and in working on my behalf; He actually works well with his flaws and limits, and he's made breakthrough with Barb, and he is not intimidating.
”
Chris[14]
Chris's fundraiser scheme predictably failed, and contributed to Kenneth, Helena and Eels cutting ties with him.[15]

All theories connecting Caden to Post-Jail sighting photos are based purely on conjecture, and no such cases of this have been confirmed

Big Island house
Main article: Lynchburg and Big Island, VA
Photo of the house from Zillow
In June 2023, a property in Big Island was transferred to Caden Peck, along with an LLC called "Essential Estate LLC", for $235,000.[16] Chris moved to the house after his stay at Gateway Homes.
It is unknown if Caden currently lives with Chris. In 2023 he was reported to be living in Maryville, Missouri. This was shown when, a month after buying the Big Island house, three felonies were filed against Caden by Maryville authorities for illegally manufacturing and delivering psilocybin mushrooms. On 28 August he pleaded guilty and received 5 years probation and 19 days in jail.[17][18][19][20] Further indication that Caden was not living in Big Island was in the October 2023 livestream The Return of Jesus Christ Chan Sonichu Prime, in which Chris turns off the stream in order to respond to a phone call from Caden. However, his address is listed as Big Island, VA in the case details for his February 2025 speeding charge which occurred in Amherst County.[21]
Discord
Caden runs a Discord account named Praetor#1330 and has been a member of at least two servers associated with Chris.[22]
The Place
On 15 October 2020, Caden was invited into the Watchmen's Discord server The Place, (albeit as an untrusted guest), and discussed his business plans.[22]
Golden Church of Sonichu
Main article: Golden Church of Sonichu
Caden managed the Golden Church of Sonichu server, a perk for customers of the golden medallion item sold on OfficialCWCmart. Chris was a member of the server and posted in it. Caden also posted to coordinate business plans for the shop.
