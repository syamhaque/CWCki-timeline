More than autism
Chris has shown serious retarded behaviour during the course of his life. He claims to have been diagnosed with HFA (which even isn't an official diagnose yet), which would explain a lot of his socially awkward behaviour. Yet he shows such a disturbed view of the world around him that even other autistic people wonder just what the fuck is wrong with him. There just has to be more to it than autism. Narcissistic Personality Disorder or simply narcissism is an obvious choice.
A personality disorder is an enduring pattern of inner experience and behaviour that deviates markedly from the expectation of the individual's culture, is pervasive and inflexible, has an onset in adolescence or early adulthood, is stable over time, and leads to distress or impairment. People with narcissism show a pervasive pattern of grandiosity (in fantasy or behaviour), need for admiration, and lack of empathy. According to the DSM-IV TR the disorder begins by early adulthood and is indicated by at least five of the following:
An exaggerated sense of self-importance (e.g., exaggerates achievements and talents, expects to be recognized as superior without commensurate achievements).
First one of the list and we've already struck gold. We're talking about a manchild that thinks drawing a shitty comic every 6 months entitles him to his own personal army. He has shown this behaviour at other times in his life, such as at his graduation from high school where he wanted to receive an art award for his beautiful artwork and was shocked to see it go to other, more talented people. Chris also believes he can give solid advice on dating, sex and women in general. We all know how far that's gotten him.
Preoccupation with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love.
His sweetheart to build from the ground up as a holy quest given to him by God himself. Chris believes himself to be better at designing games than Shigeru Miyamoto himself as Chris is the creator of Sonichu. His life is so special, it warrants its own game and movie. His "artwork" is often laced with reworkings of actual events to play out in his favor.
Believes he is "special" and can only be understood by, or should associate with, other special or high-status people (or institutions).
Chris believing he is "special"? As an autistic he refuses to associate with or at least date other autistic people. Just look at his list of requirements for a sweetheart and see how far he is aiming above his worth.
Requires excessive admiration. The infamous comment and some of the reactions that it sparked
Chris searches Youtube to find videos about himself. He once commented on a video for some girl who named herself Chris-chan, thinking he was the only one in the world who could be the subject of a Youtube video for Chris-chan. When Christian found out he was featured on G4 in a segment on stupid YouTube videos, he posted a new video inviting all women enticed by his idiotic spasming to check him out.
Has a sense of entitlement.
Chris doesn't just try to garner praise and attention, he feels that he's entitled to it and flips out every time he doesn't receive the praise he believes to deserve. Just look at his graduation and the infamous PaRappa the Rapper Contest. His behaviour towards perceived rivals in love, and responsible working adults who try to put a stop to his idiocy shows he feels entitled to behave like as a superior being to whom simple rules of civil behaviour don't apply.
Selfishly takes advantage of others to achieve his own ends.
Just a short list of victims: Cole Smithey, Megan and Emily
Lacks empathy.
He may lack empathy because he's autistic. It's mentioned here again because we may never know the real cause. Just look here for examples.
Is often envious of others or believes that others are envious of him
His attitude towards other men as having taken "ALL THE PRETTY GIRLS AND LEFT NONE FOR ME!!!" shows a lot more envy than most human beings should ever show towards anything. Another proof of his envy was the personal hate that he aimed at Adam Stackhouse, the winner of the PaRappa the Rapper Contest. Chris also rationalizes his jealousy of men as what he calls Noviophobia, a "fear" that any woman he talks to might have a boyfriend.
Shows arrogant, haughty, patronizing, or contemptuous behaviours or attitudes
Again lots of examples are possible, yet for this you only need two words. "STAY STRAIGHT"
