I've actually done it to myself so many times, even with a hunk of- even with an inflatable plastic woman [...] I've done it so much, it's like, you know, I can't even feel that much of a rush from it, doing it to myself like that [...] It's like, you know, my body got used to it

Chris to Kacey[1]

Based on a chat in a Watchmen server, Chris first came at the age of 15 from watching softcore porn on HBO and Cinemax. He would lay belly-down on a bed on top of a clean washcloth. He also claims that he wouldn't actually perform the act until graduating from high school, learning that he could rub his penis to stimulate it. [2]
“
And this goes far back as the very first time I came while I was Fifteen years old. Throughout High School, I never actually touched my penis. I watched soft core porn between HBO and Cinemax, while laying belly-down on the bed, with a clean washcloth under it. I watched the porn, and it came on its own. I didn’t put my hand on it until some time after graduation from High School, and learning that I could have put my hand on it to rub one out.

Based on a PSN chat with PandaHalo and an IRC chat, Chris would also begin masturbating after he figured out how to bypass the parental controls on his parents' TV:
“
actually figured it out for myself, in my room one night after having unlocked the parental lock; I found the pool scene in "I Like to Play Games 2" [sic], and I just figured it out for myself.
”
The pool scene in question
Chris would go on to clarify in BlueSpike PSN Chat 3 that the scene that taught him how to masturbate featured a man and a woman having sex in a swimming pool. No such scene exists in I Like to Play Games Too, however a scene fitting Chris' description appears in the first I Like to Play Games.[3]
When he first started mass debating, he did so by lying face down on his bed (also known as prone masturbation) and rubbing his duck with a washcloth.[3] In early 2009 he would sit on the bathroom washbasin during the act.[3] In Ivy's Q&A it was mentioned that Chris has used his pillow, folded in half, as a masturbation tool.
He has informed his mother of his masturbation habit.[3]

And to keep myself from flying crazily off the handle at a random time, I keep my hormones in check at least twice a week by myself.

A March 2021 comic panel from the Workaholics Anonymous comic acknowledging Chris's low sex drive
While it is assumed by many that Chris has a voracious sex drive and spends all day whacking it, the truth is quite different. Possible factors for this include the fact that he has a bent duck which would most likely make masturbation painful, and he probably struggles to get/maintain an erection owing to his obesity and general poor health. The sex audio with Julie seems to indicate that it takes Chris around 20 minutes to orgasm, which means that masturbation for Chris must be physically exhausting. Chris also believes that he has a limited sperm count which may have him limit his sexual activity. Also, Chris was at one point prescribed the antidepressant paroxetine (Paxil), which (from what was heard from him) caused some sort of sexual side effect, perhaps slowing down his ability to orgasm.[5]
Chris also told Kacey that he has masturbated so much that it no longer brings him much pleasure. However, this was a misguided ploy for pity sex.[1]
In January 2018, Chris claimed that he no longer masturbates.[6] While Christorians had speculated that this could have been the result of his oestrogen treatment, which is known to decrease libido in men, he told Miss Cherry in a conversation on Christmas 2019 that he had given up self-abuse as early as 2011, back when he had first described himself as a tomgirl but limited his activities to cross-dressing.[7]
On 18 November 2018, Chris's Twitter uploaded a video of himself mass debating his flaccid duck while singing the song "All-Star" by Smash Mouth. Chris is noticeably stressed and uncomfortable during the act. It was later found that Chris was manipulated into filming the video by the Idea Guys. The video was posted onto Chris's Twitter either by the Idea Guys, or by Lillie of the Teen Troon Squad, using the Idea Guys as a red herring.
In February 2020, Chris blamed the trolls for the decline in his sex drive, saying that "I will admit I was self-sexually active; WAS. You all turned me off of Sex LONG Before I even thought of coming out as Trans in ‘14. I am going to say it now: I HATED SEX FOR YEARS, because of you lot!"[8]
Chris would continue discussing the act with the Watchmen, discussing how he felt he was born the wrong gender. He had claimed that masturbation for him takes up to fifteen minutes, and an incredibly tiring task for him.

"I found the first porno movie I ever watched. Called 'I Like to Play Games... Too.' And, uh, basically I tuned into the part where, there were, where the guy and the woman was having sex in the pool. The swimming pool."
Anyway, anyway since then I, uh, just began lying face-down naked on my bed with a washcloth, uh...uh, in front of my uh...duck.
[…] I've found like, you know, a good place to masturbate is while sitting on the front edge of the bathroom sink.
[…] I did confide in my mother and tell her, and tell her about, uh, my, uh, masturbation history there. And uh, about how often, and that sort of thing.
