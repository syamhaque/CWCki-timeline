CWC's Hallmark Negative Life Events is a list Chris posted to Facebook on September 3, 2013. Written in iOS Notes, it purports to document the series of events that led to Chris's downfall.
“
After listing them, it was most Definitely Megan Schroeder, Michael Snyder, and Mary Lee Walsh, and the countless, unidentifiable Trolls and Jerkops, who have seriously hurt me towards the point of the near easily stressed out, blood-pressure-sensitive, emotionally and mentally scarred type of alternate person who I am not at normal, calm or sound mind.

Chris, Facebook, September 3, 2013
Curiously absent is the death of his father Bob Chandler in 2011. However, this list appears to only include negative life events for which people were directly responsible.
Chris may have been prompted to write this list following his ban from the Ruckersville Wal-Mart on 2 September 2013 for vandalizing an XBox One display. In other posts around the same time period, Chris followed a similar pattern of blaming various authority figures for his stress and life problems.
