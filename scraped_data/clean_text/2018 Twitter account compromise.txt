“
I tried to login to the account to check the IP addresses and the password was changed.
I messaged Chris and asked him what was up and he simply said "Magi-Chan" is looking out for his best interests.

[Chris's passwords are] autistic combinations of letters, numbers and symbols that no one would be able to figure out. He just hands them out to "magichan".

A tweet from the CWCSonichu Twitter account, location stamped as being from Auckland, New Zealand.
From October 2018-December 2018, Chris's CWCSonichu Twitter account was compromised by a troll posing as Magi-Chan who socially engineered him into giving his password. They would login and post tweets without his knowledge or consent. Some tweets which affirmed Chris's fantasies were kept up; others such as those leaking content from the Idea Guys would be swiftly deleted.
According to comments by Marvin, the Teen Troon Squad was behind the trolling.[3]

Suspicious activity
Location stamps
A tweet from 13 October 2018, which posted fanart depicting Mewtwo with sexual overtones, was location stamped as being from Sydney, Australia. The tweet was quickly deleted.[4]
The Captain speculated that a VPN was used by "Magi-Chan" to tweet from CWCSonichu due to strange location stamps on some tweets. He reported that he asked Chris about it, and that "he didn't seem concerned about the location tag."[5]
Another tweet from 14 October 2018 was stamped as being from Auckland, New Zealand.[6]
On 14 October, Chris changed the CWCSonichu password and gave the new one to The Captain, who logged in to check IP addresses, to find that the "Places I've Been" feature got switched off.[7]
On 2 November 2018, two more tweets were posted to CWCSonichu. The first was an exaggerated beg for money for Chris's kittens Liza, Patches and Sylvia, who were ill - the tweet was tagged as being from New Zealand.[8] Shortly after, another tweet was posted, alleging that Snoopy had killed one of the kittens, with an image of a cat corpse.[9] A Kiwi Farms user claimed it was also tagged as being from New Zealand.[10] The tweets were quickly deleted.
The image of the cat corpse was traced as originating from an article on special effects in horror movies.[11]
Quick deletions
Some tweets were quickly deleted after their posting. This was especially the case for several tweets leaking content from the Idea Guys saga.
In another case, on 14 December 2018, CWCSonichu tweeted claiming that Barbara had died.[12] The tweet was deleted a minute later, then Chris quickly recorded Barb confirms she isn't dead as a rebuttal.
Leaking of Idea Guys content
Three video clips from the Idea Guys saga were leaked onto the CWCSonichu Twitter account. All three tweets were then quickly deleted.
On 18 November 2018, CWCSonichu leaked a clip of Chris masturbating to All Star.[13]
On 11 December 2018, CWCSonichu leaked a clip of Tour of Chris's House III.[14]
The following day, CWCSonichu leaked a clip of Chris slaps himself.[15]
According to comments by Marvin, the leaks were done by the Teen Troon Squad, who social-engineered Chris into giving them access to the Idea Guys-era files.[3]
