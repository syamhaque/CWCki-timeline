Delusion disclosure: This article or section takes place during Chris's phase of role-playing as Sonichu. He may refer to his Christine Chandler personality and physical body in the third person by using terms such as "mama".
Before starting his livestreamed reaction of the fourth part of the episode Red vs. Blue from Analysis Anarchy, Chris recorded a proof-of-life video of Barb so he won't be pestered by viewers over her current state.
Chris also prompts his viewers to ask questions in the comment section despite it being disabled.
