The Fool 04:14 PM
so we good for the call today or was it rescheduled?
Chris 04:15 PM
For tonight, yes.
The WCT 04:15 PM
[Replying to "For tonight, yes."]
sup Chris!
hope you're having a great day.
The Fool 04:15 PM
nice, what time?
same
Chris 04:16 PM
Going good.
Making another commentary Tweet on something Don reminded me of in the book.
The Fool 04:16 PM
nice

730 I’m guessing
The WCT 06:02 PM
[Replying to "730 I’m guessing"]
correct.
Silvia 06:03 PM
Alrighty.
Chris 07:28 PM
Hello
Silvia 07:29 PM
Hello I’m hopping in call now
The "Older Lady Friend" Call
5 July 2021
Anaxis's summary
The scheduled call with Chris takes place. Most of it is mundane, discussing the Watchmen and their suspicions around me and Praetor, as well as Funko and the Matrix franchise. WCT continues self-aggrandizing, and I request (again, in vain) that Chris answer the Q&A questions I've provided him with. However, the most notable aspect of this call is Chris mentioning having an "older lady friend" who he has supposedly been having regular sex with. The Knights congratulate him on this and ask some minor questions, though Chris divulges little.
After this call ends, a second one starts in the second layer, where the Knights discuss the call, and speculate on the identity of this supposed mystery woman and why she had stuck around Chris.
The next day, in the second layer, WCT summarizes the lesser aspects of the call to another user, and again discusses the flaws in the Watchmen.
NOTE: This call with Chris and the subsequent private one without him were unfortunately not recorded, so the only evidence I have of them taking place are these chat transcripts of myself and others who didn't have their mics turned on, reacting to the call. Keep this in mind when trying to evaluate context.

Hello everyone
Sorry, I've got a bad mic. I'm just going to hang out if you don't mind.
They didn't trust me for some reason. They were paranoid that I was some sort of double agent of Praetor.
MKR believed I was part of some trolling group too
It was all very bizarre
Any sneak peaks [sic] on what your next joint business venture is?
I was trying to get the others to negotiate with Praetor and come to a compromise
And they wouldn't hear any of it
It just made them more suspicious
That's great! I hope the trip goes well.
Nice!

Lainchu (Anaxis) 08:44 PM
That sounds great! Best of luck on the business ventures.
Bye!
Have a nice day
Congrats!

We don't need to dwell on the old group's mistakes
That sounds awesome, chris!
Oof, take care of yourself
Stay safe
It was envy
They were competition for your attention
It was Val, actually
Ironically
No, he hated me
I mean, [Klop] gave me the invite initially
But Val sent the actual link
He's washed his hands of the watchmen
She might be too loyal to MKR
Josh's discord account was banned too
I think he's got his hands full
He's got bigger problems than discord lol
He's ambivalent
And after years, I don't blame him
By the way, chris, I know I sound like a broken record, but if you have the time, I'd really appreciate it if you can answer the questions! When you've got the time of course.
Thank you!
Kawaii[emote 2]
I'm glad to hear it

Lainchu (Anaxis) 09:02 PM
Nice!
Funko makes figures of everything (edited)
I think Funko focuses more on characters than people
You're writing a chapter for the book??
That's so cool!
Chris wrote short stories
You can feel changes in your very bones sometimes

Lol, yes, definitely listen to Morpheus

Lainchu (Anaxis) 09:07 PM
Matrix as a franchise kind of died a while ago
I love the Animatrix!
Oh that doesn't shock me lol
But yeah, the animatrix is really cool. Guy who made Aeon Flux did one of the shorts.
I had a great time chatting, Chris!
Even tho I technically can only type, lol
The Defenders!
The CWCville Order
Nah, leave the old ways behind
I've been calling it the Protectorate
Thanks for coming by!
Have a good night!
#private-voice-chat (Second Layer)
NOTE: Chris was not directly involved in this conversation.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 09:15 PM
Remember, more people there are, the harder secrecy and order will be to maintain.
@Neko
Yeah, the sex thing surprised me
I wonder who this mystery woman is
I don't think he's gonna be able to keep the secret for long, especially if they get more "serious"
For Chris's standards at least
She's definitely gonna get that
Without a shadow of a doubt
Maybe she already knows and doesn't care
Para 09:19 PM
wat
The WCT 09:20 PM
you wanna join private vc? @Para
Lainchu (Anaxis) 09:20 PM
I think she might be more put off by potential harassment
Subtlety has never been Chris's strong suit (edited)

[REDACTED] 1:21 AM
How'd the call go?
The WCT 01:21 AM
[Replying to "How'd the call go?"]
it went well.
I chose not to record it (probably for the best) but it sounds like Chris is done with Meghan and Kyle.
And despite whatever they might be planning on, it won't end well.
[REDACTED] 1:22 AM
Cool.
The WCT 01:22 AM
Chris told me that Caden is gonna help him buy a PC so that he can do more streams and such with the money they've earned from the partnership they've been having for a while now. (edited)
If Caden actually goes through with that, he will have earned my respect.
Silvia 01:23 AM
Hear hear.
Baby steps with Caden
The WCT 01:23 AM
like I said previously, I want to talk with him first.
giving him a second chance.
[REDACTED] 1:24 AM
[Replying to "Chris told me that Caden is gonna help him buy a PC so that he can do more streams and such with the money they've earned from the partnership they've been having for a while now. (edited)"]
Did he say what kind of streams?
The WCT 01:25 AM
[Replying to "Did he say what kind of streams?"]
not really, but I wouldn't be surprised if it were the kind that he did last year.
Silvia 01:25 AM
Probably reading
The WCT 01:25 AM
MLP and Red vs Blue reactions, or Dmensional Merge stuff.
I really wished the Watchmen did listen to Anaxis's suggestion of coming up with a compromise with Praetor so that there wouldn't be any beef between us.
looking back though, it was probably based on jealousy. lol
Silvia 01:27 AM
I think that’s their core flaw. Jealous
The WCT 01:28 AM
Jealousy and lack of control.
The Fool 02:58 PM
you when chris was like "you ever sit in your room and just feel wavy? thats the merge" and I was just saying to myself "no thats diabetes dude"
like is he seeing a doctor?
The WCT 02:58 PM
I don't think so from what I know.
The Fool 02:58 PM
he should probably get on that
he already had a heart attack[note 1]
he knows he's mortal, just remind him the merge hasn't completed yet and he hasn't fully merged with his immortal body
so he should be mindful to take care of his body while it's still mortal
he already had to save his alt-universe counterparts (edited)
cuz like legit I'm surprised he hasn't had a stroke
The WCT 03:06 PM
I don't know if he'll live to be 50.
The Fool 03:07 PM
he is 50 in chris-chan years
the body is very durable, when it shits out then it really shits out
Chris Describes His Lady Friend to the WCT
14-15 July 2021
Anaxis's summary
Chris describes vague physical details about his "lady friend" to WCT in DMs, namely that she is in her 70s, has gray hair, is shorter than he is, and has blue eyes. WCT comments that her age is very close to that of Chris's mother. The Fool remarks that Chris has found his "replacement Barb" and Silvia states her hope that it isn't actually Barb, considering Chris's Oedipus Complex. WCT states his intention to never let these details leak out, and Silvia expresses concern at such an elderly person having sex. WCT nicknames her "Step Barb," and Silvia wonders if this woman is one of Barb's friends. The WCT caps off this discussion by stating his confident belief that Chris will be "fine" after their talk.

Silvia 11:57 PM
No the philosophy of the serial killers and other odd folks are what I like
The Fool 11:57 PM
>grey hair
Silvia 11:58 PM
Grey hair and over 50 and blue eyes……
The WCT 11:58 PM
uh...
[Continuation of the same discussion between Chris and WCT.][note 2]
The Fool 11:59 PM
well
Silvia 11:59 PM
Oh boy….
The Fool 11:59 PM
he found his replacement barb
Silvia 11:59 PM
Yupppp
The WCT 11:59 PM
ok
thats old
very very old
Silvia 11:59 PM
I hope it isn’t his mom.
Bc didn’t he have a thing about his mom
15 July 2021
The WCT 12:00 AM
this is something that I will never let leak out.
this will piss some folks off. (edited)
Silvia 12:00 AM
And most escorts and all don’t continue their work in their 50s or 60s
The Fool 12:01 AM
barb is older than 50
Silvia 12:01 AM
Does she have blue eyes or anything
Or green
The WCT 12:01 AM
at least Chris got what he wanted.
a mommy girlfriend.
or actually...
a granny girlfriend.
Silvia 12:02 AM
Mommmy kink (??)
Silvia 12:02 AM
[Replying to "at least Chris got what he wanted."]
Yea I agree Neko
What worries me is her older age. Do people normally have sex at this age? And if so you would have to be extremely careful
The WCT 12:04 AM
[Replying to "What worries me is her older age. Do people normally have sex at this age? And if so you would have to be extremely careful"]
its not impossible.
for her, it can be problematic.
For Chris though, it doesn't matter.
Silvia 12:05 AM
Yea that’s what I’m worried. She could hurt herself
The WCT 12:05 AM
Guess we can codename her...
Step Barb
Silvia 12:06 AM
Noice. Did Christine ever tell u how they met?
The WCT 12:06 AM
I believe so.
they met up somewhere I think.
Maybe the next time we VC him he can explain.
Silvia 12:07 AM
I don’t think she told me. Alrighty.
I wonder how barb thinks about it all
I wonder if it’s one of barbs friends
The Fool 12:08 AM
Starb
I hear from people working in homes that old people jerk off all day
I dunno if that applies to women
Silvia 12:10 AM
My mom used to work at a retirement house and it was mostly the men bc of easier access. Women were more settled down. But I wouldn’t be surprised
The Fool 12:11 AM
when you're that lonely I can't imagine what else you can do
for some reason old people have nothing to do
I can only assume they spent their whole life playing hoop-stick and now that they can't they simply jerk off and sleep
The WCT 12:13 AM
after talking to Chris, I'm confident that he'll be fine.
Notes
↑ The Fool is incorrect; Chris had once claimed to have a heart attack, but it turned out to just be heartburn. His father Bob, however, had four recorded heart attacks and eventually died of heart failure, and given Chris's highly unhealthy lifestyle and genetic disposition, a heart attack is not impossible in Chris's future.
