Chris, at Cville Pride, in September 2016

He attended the Cville Pride Festival, the annual Charlottesville LGBTQ pride festival, for the third year in a row. He got a new cat called Sorbet. He ramped up his criticisms of presidential candidate Donald Trump, a trend that would become more acute in the coming months. Otherwise, Chris continued to dick around with his toys and occasionally make posts on Facebook.
