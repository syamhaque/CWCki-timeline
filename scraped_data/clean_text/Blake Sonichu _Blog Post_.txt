Blake Sonichu
For this Blog Post, I am going to talk some about Blake Sonichu.
As known, Blake was cloned from Sonichu Prime's fur sample with an accidental dose of cherry coca-cola.
He met Naitsirhc and Giovanni and was trained and tested under Giovanni's order and with Naitsirhc's and the scientists' observations (GiBi and Bill included).
Blake was, indeed, heavily trained.
He was also tested with doses of the "R" compound that makes Pokemon go "Shadow", or feral; Blake's genetics had blocked the "R" and all of its components, so he was immune to them.
Not to mention the indirect connections with the Chaos Emerald and gems also taken from Sonichu's DNA.
Blake had proven himself time and again and was often paired with Naitsirhc and even Liquid Chris Sonichu (AKA Liquidchu (while in Sonichu Form) on missions.
It should also be noted that Blake was also trained to wield a firearm, as some Team Rocket members had wielded them.
His training was really army or military-like and very tough, yet Blake very often would best the physical challenges and battles.
Liquidchu would lose to Blake a lot in battle.
Blake does not often use a gun, but when it comes with self-defense and downing a serious foe it is an option.
He'll more often resort to his physical strength and speed, as well as his electric attacks.
At one point, using one experimental focused Ditto-made injection, he also has an indirect Psychic typing, though he is not classified as an Electric/Psychic type; he remains purely Electric Type.
Most everyone is aware of the time when he was on a mission to spy on Christian at the mall with Liquid, he had met Bubbles Rosechu for the first time at the mall on June 14, 2004.
This happened before when he stole the Master Sunstone on July 23, 2004.
On a future meeting while he was in camouflage disguise by having dyed his fur yellow and donned green coloured contacts and basic Sonichu shoes on December 17, 2004, while on mission to be "Secret Shopper" and steal Pokemon and gifts from shoppers at the Mall.
Blake knew it was a failed cause due to the Psychic Squadron often undoing the deeds in tetraseconds in advance.
He encountered both Angelica and Bubbles Rosechu as they were doing the charitable Christmas shopping.
Blake was speechless and could only get out a few shy and awkward words out of infatuation with Bubbles.
Angelica intuitively tells Bubbles that he was a young Sonichu on a Soul Search out the company of distant ones.
Bubbles had sensed something about Blake in that moment, something deeply good inside him.
So she gifted him a sterling silver bracelet that had the engraved message, "You are not alone".
Blake always treasured that bracelet.
The following Christmas in 2005, he found and helped Bubbles and Angelica deliver food and gifts for the homeless and soup hotels.
During that time, Liquidchu was on to Blake's infatuation, so he kept quiet and covered for Blake for a favor.
Naitsirhc ended up finding out and indirectly called Blake out on it.
Over the time with Team Rocket, he realized Naitsirhc (turning Reldnahc), Liquid and the others there were really stupid, thus further affirming his reasons to eventually leave Team Rocket on November 25, 2006 for Bubbles and being an Anti-Hero, though siding with Sonichu, Rosey and the side of justice.
There are a lot more details, as chronicled in my G.L. Pages, but this will suffice to offer to you all this much more about Blake Sonichu.
