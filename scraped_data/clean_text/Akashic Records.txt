This article is still yet to be completed due to stress. We get a lot of stressful torture in our lives that makes us crash into slumber. Given that inspiration is a big variable, and we may have been lacking of it, this article will be completed as soon as possible, at our own pace... HONEST!
"Essentially, I'm taking another visit to the infinite library of the Akashic Records for the new information to download into my Brain from there next."
The Akashic Records are believed to be a compendium of all universal events, thoughts, and emotions ever to have happened throughout all of time, regarding all existing lifeforms. Chris started expressing a belief in the records during 2021 while he was in jail, mostly so he could further delude himself about his messiah complex and expand upon his recently self-created religion dubbed "Neo Spiritual Christianity". According to Chris, a mysterious "Akashic Guardian" gave him insights and helped him chronicle his religion, as well as helping him write material for his jail diary, which he calls the Goddess Log.
Chris also believes that he can speak the supposedly lost "Akashic" language. Though in reality, no such language is known.
Mentions by Chris
On 20 October 2021, in a jail letter to a fan, Chris claimed that he had "direct access to and with this Earth; Both of our Earths of the recombining Universe, the entire Multiverse, the Akashic Records and All other Greater and Ultimate Knowledge; Insights, and Wisdoms." Two days later, he reaffirmed once again to the fan that he had access to the Akashic Records, allegedly with his hand over his heart as he wrote the sentence.[1] He used this an excuse to assert that he is confident and correct about his beliefs. Chris's first mention of the records already begins with the assertion that he has access to them, which is a common delusional belief not just held by him.
On 25 October 2021, in a jail letter to Kenneth Engelhardt, Chris once again mentioned that "meditation" allows him to "dive even deeper and deepest into EVERYTHING out of this Earth and All Universes, Cosmos, and Dimensions of this very Timeline, but also the infinite Multiverse and beyond, and even the Akashi [sic] Records, among which." Right after, he claimed that this meant that he had "access to ALL Greater and Ultimate Knowledge, Insights, Wisdoms, and Everything, and I Know all there is of the past, present and future."[2]
On 8 November 2021, in a jail letter to a YouTuber, Chris answered an unclear question, writing "I Astral Manifest; I'm always free while my Body works hard within the Cosmos, Universe, and Akashic finer details."[3]
On 30 November 2021, in a jail letter to Eels and the Egg-man, Chris writes that he apparently "asked the Guardian of the Akashic Records" to "field" one of their questions regarding why he calls himself "the real player one." Chris writes down an alleged quote from Akashic Guardian, using it as proof and an explanation. Chris also claimed that if Eels and the Egg-man wanted to learn information on how they could too access the extraordinary records, they could just Google the term, writing "Now, if you’d like more greater truths and insights, the Akashic records are always open to all who are highly enlightened, open and not blinding themselves from said ultimate truth. And if you’d like to know more what the Akashic records are and how you may be able to access them, Google the term."[4]
