Saga
KwaiiSandbag
KwaiiSandbag is a former enabler who pretended to be a psychic to influence Chris. KwaiiSandbag initially reached out to Chris through Instagram after watching Chris-Chan: A Comprehensive History just for fun, but this effort resulted in a series of conversations that would convince Chris to stop LARPing as Sonichu. KwaiiSandbag, upon being confronted by outside parties explaining why Chris should not be directly contacted, eventually expressed remorse for his actions. Around the same time, he came clean with Chris by revealing that he was not actually a psychic as he had claimed, which Chris acted like he knew all along (when he very clearly did not, as otherwise he wouldn't have been tricked into giving up his pretense of being a fictional character).
On one hand, this intervention was a somewhat positive experience for Chris in that it unwittingly allowed him to overcome one of his many maladaptive coping mechanisms, but on the other, it demonstrated how easy it is for someone to reach out to him to manipulate him further, even with groups of white knights like the Watchmen trying to "protect" Chris from this kind of thing, and may inspire future weening as a result. It also demonstrates how bringing more attention to Chris, even with good intentions for doing so, can lead to an increase in these sorts of interactions.
Multiple voice chats were released by KwaiiSandbag on 20 March 2021.[2]

Reaching Out to Chris
The Calls
Kwaii made a series of five calls with his partner Lily while he was talking to Chris.
Interviews with Kwaii
On the same day that the calls were released, KwaiiSandbag was interviewed over Discord by Anaxis, the owner of the Official CWCki Server, about his interactions with Chris and his manipulation tactics. This interview was released a few days later, along with screenshots of KwaiiSandbag's chats with Chris, on 23 March 2021. KwaiiSandbag's messages are color-coded green, and Anaxis's messages are color-coded orange.
Contacting Chris
So, when did you first get into contact with Chris, and how?
on february 6th she posted a picture asking for psychic help on instagram. I thought maybe I could do some good by posing as a psychic and nudging her into a normal life.
on february 9th to my surprise she responded to my instagram dm
if you want I can also send screenshots of all discord and insta chats
Sure, that'd be helpful
[KwaiiSandbag sends numerous screenshots]
a friend of mine who also felt bad about chrischan, helped out on 3 of the calls. her name is lily.
I mean this when I say this, I had no foul intentions, I just want chris chan to have as normal as a life as possible, and if there was something that I could do, I think i did it
I see
This is a lot of stuff
yes ik how meticulous the cwcki is when it comes to this stuff
For sure
Influencing Chris
Did you influence Chris to do anything particular during this period in which you were talking?
Did Chris add any lore that you suggested?
Well for starters, I helped get chris back into her body
she kept talking about merlin and how she was born hundreds of years ago.
and i dont fully remember but there was some talk about how she became barbs child
i also tried to make sure that she and barb were going to get the covid vaccine
Yeah, that all lines up with some of the stuff Chris shared over the last few weeks
yeah
KwaiiSandbag's Goals
You said your end goal was to try and help Chris towards a normal life, right?
yes
What were you doing to try and achieve that goal?
try and make it seem like maybe seeing a therapist or saving money might be good and using fake psychic powers to make it like I knew what I was talking about
And did Chris listen to any of your advice on that front?
unfortunately i dont think so, but I think it was my push that helped her stop the sonichu delusion
Ending the Sonichu Roleplay
What did you do that you think ended the Sonichu roleplay?
I just said maybe christine should be in her body for her birthday, and sure enough, she was
she made a public annoucement the next day as well so it lines up
Interesting. Is this in the voice call collection?
yeas
Cool
Chris's Drinking and Smoking Habits
Did Chris share any interesting information with you that was new, or previously unknown to the public? Regarding her life, or merge lore, etc?
She confirmed that she drinks heavily sometimes and has smoked weed before idk if that was confirmed but i asked a question about psychedelics and she said "like weed"
Lol, gotcha
Drinks heavily, huh? Did she specify what kind of drinks? And how often?
like a lot of beers and she said like once every few weeks but like for someone who denounced alcohol in the past that seems like often
For sure
Don't suppose Chris specified the brand?
no she just claimed to have a very high alcohol tolerance and that was that no branding unfortunately
Interesting, okay.
End of KwaiiSandbag's Involvement
I'm assuming that you posting all this info means that you and your friend (Lily) are no longer in contact with Chris?
yes she stopped responding last week and unadded lily on discord
What caused the relationship to end?
I have no idea, it just kind of ended. I tried to make another call session and she never responded, and frankly i did not think I could help anymore
And when was that?
march 11th
Gotcha.
Alright, those are all the questions I have for now. I'll listen to the audio recordings.
Thanks for chatting.
Coming Clean
I needed to come clean
before this officially ends
i dont think what she said is true but here it is
Confirming the Call Dates
Upon being asked on 21 March, KwaiiSandbag also confirmed the dates that each call took place on.
