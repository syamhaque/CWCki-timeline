Take that Page DOWN NOW! is a YouTube video posted by Chris on 30 March 2009, in which he demands that his Encyclopedia Dramatica page be taken down. Later, Chris takes the video down, and updates a longer version, with added footage of him growling at the camera and making threats to Clyde Cash. Speaking of which, Chris actually uploaded this video a few hours before unveiling the first video exposing Cash's appearance to the internet, when conventional wisdom would indicate that releasing the videos the other way around would be the more reasonable option.

Transcript - Part 1
Just a major up-, just a small update. Well, I just wanted to, uh, ask a small favor. You know what would really inspire me to continue doing the comics? I tell you what--[removes glasses, grows more stern]--you take down that ED page forever. Take it down. It and al-, everything about it, including the, the discussion pages. Everything. Delete it.
[sighs] Because you don't, because that thing has been bothering me for so ma-, for that long time. And you know how the expression, "Too many cooks spoil the broth?" Well, call it, this was "too many crooks." Too many crooks! TOO MANY CROOKS! And that ED page is one of those crooks. Every page, every word on the discussion page, is a crook.
[stress sigh] It just makes me really [tries to flex nonexistent muscles] angry! Nnngh, nngh! Nnnngh! You know how it makes me angry? [reaches off-camera; after jump cut, picks up the Clown Doll with Clyde's picture taped to it] This is Clyde.
[jump cut to Chris holding doll in right hand and making fist with left] And this is how angry I am for every waking moment that that ED page is up. [punches doll so hard the paper comes off of it; he punches it some more, then reaches down to retrieve picture and rips it in half] NNNGH!
[looks into camera, sneering] You want me to calm down? [voice cracking] YOU WANT ME TO CALM DOWN? You want me to draw the comics? YOU TAKE DOWN THAT ED PAGE! [picks up piece of picture, puts it back on doll] Or Clyde is...BAM! [resumes punching his clown]
Transcript - Part 2
[jump cut, apparently later in the day; Chris is tensing is arms and either hulking up or trying to fart]
EEENNNNRRRRGGHHHH!!!
[picks up Clown Doll again and tries to tear its head off, but it slips through his hands] EENNGH—GGH!
[begins beating it more savagely] NGH! NGH! [throws it to ground, reaches down to punch it repeatedly, causing the camera to turn slightly towards the left] NGH! NGH-NGH-NGH-NGH-NGH-NGH-NGH-NGH! [pops back up to bare his teeth, taking a deep breath before giving a primal growl]
ERRRNNNRGGGHH! URRRGH! RRRGH-HAAAGHH! EERGHHAAGHH!
[gives Claw of Fail as he stares off into space, talking like the Ultimate Warrior] Are you hear me? You are DEAAAD!
You are dead! [hiccups] You are deeaad! And so is that page. RRARRGGH-[hic]-RRRGGHH!!
[snorts]
EEEEENNRRRHHH! [begins smacking his fist into his palm]
[jump cut; Christian is speaking normally again] Mmm! You despi-, you are so despicable, Clyde! I am going to beat your lights out! [performs Claw of Fail again] I am going to drag you right in front of everyone if we ever meet in public! I am going to shove your ass down your throat... [Ultimate Warrior voice] And make you eat your UNDERWEARRR!
ENGHERRRR!!
[jump cut; Chris steps back and slams his arm right into the PSEye, making it tumble]
NNNAGGHHHH!!!
