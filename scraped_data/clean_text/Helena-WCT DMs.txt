NOTE: Chris was not directly involved in this conversation.
The dimensional merge is upon us! It has been suggested that this article be merged with WCT DMs. Discuss on the talk page.
This page contains DMs between Helena Fiorenza and The WCT. The messages take place after The WCT took over as leader of the Watchmen group. Helena says she had heard the group had her old phone number and promised not to leak it, and asks what their plan was with it. The WCT responds that the Watchmen are now under his control and says that, while he thinks she is cringe, as long as she does not harm Chris he doesn't care what she does, drawing a line between his policies and those of the previous leadership of the Watchmen. Helena describes some of her goals, saying she wants to make Sonichu and its fans more accepted and to make visual novels with people in the fandom.

Hi. Before you block me wanna know why you joined the watchdogs. I heard you guys have my old phone number and promised not to leak it. Idk if is useful anymore but wanted to know what you guys were planning when tried to get my information. Everything about me is public. I guess I just wanna say is that I can’t hate you guys or the kiwifarms. I looked like a threat. There are people trying to make money out of Chris but they will always fail. All I do is gonna be for free unless is a commission. So, that. Just wanted to let you know even you are in a group of mean people, I don’t think you are mean and who really cares what I think anyways? Heh. Hope you have a good day.
The WCT
Hello there Helena.
btw, the Watchmen are under my control now.
Helena
Oh. Hope you manage to keep Chris protected
The WCT
I’ll be honest with you right now:
I think you’re cringe, but as long as you don’t harm Chris and such I don’t care what you do.
Helena
Oh, I am chringe. I come from the creepypasta fandom. I am acting like the fan I am. That is why I am doing fan games. All hard work for free. Might be my autism but who knows. Besides Chris decides who to talk to. Only reason she drew Pickchu was because of Dillin
The WCT
unlike the previous leader of the Watchmen (who recently doxed me) I will give anybody who befriends Chris a chance until it becomes clear to me they have awful intentions.
Helena
That is great. I won’t disappoint. My goal is super gay. I want to make people who legit like Sonichu feel comfortable saying they like it. I want to make dual monthly visual novel games with people in the Sonichu fandom. Got the blessing of some Chris YouTubers to put them in my gay game. It is gonna be so much fun
The WCT
thats a little much to ask for, but I wish you luck. lol
Helena
Thanks a bunch. Maybe will fail but that is my goal. To make games all on my own or groups. The one coding one of my games wants to charge for it and I don’t wanna so that game might never come out but hope the visual novels I do are liked by the like 10 people I talk to. Heh
The WCT
keep your expectations low and you’ll never be disappointed.
Helena
I will. Thanks
