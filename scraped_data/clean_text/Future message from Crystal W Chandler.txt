I am not naive nor dumb. I am very keen and psychic, and I had foreseen his arrival and discussion in a dream long beforehand.

Chris
On 3 April 2019, Chris enlisted someone's help to record Future message from Crystal W Chandler. The troll (or just some guy being held at gunpoint), role-playing as Reginald Chandler and donned in a white suit, hat, mask, sunglasses, and – most concerningly – a slave collar, reads a poem relaying a message from his sister, Crystal, on the state of the Dimensional Merge.

Masked Man: Hello everyone, far and near. I have something you want to hear, so please use your ears before I disappear. Let's make something clear before we start. I have a good purple heart that won't fall apart.
We are all about to take part in a new event segment which will indent what you call the cement. My intent is to present the news which will eliminate the torment and discontent.
Chris: [spoken like he's holding the man at gunpoint] Just keep reading.
[The camera zooms in and tilts to the side.]
Masked Man: I am that supplement to a lesser extent.
[Camera backs away.]
Christine has been hell-bent on being a parent, so she made a pleasant investment- investment and got my mother pregnant. I am a Fluorescent Adolescent, a direct descendant, and not the only attendant.
There is one other: Crystal.
[Camera zooms up close to the reader's lower body.]
And I am her brother.
[Camera backs away]
There is much you don't know unless I show. But that is a no-go. Right now I am here solo, but soon I will have my shadow: a lovely combo.
There will be no tiptoe around the tempo. I must let go of my manifesto and go back to the golden good old Babylonian weeping willow below the Jim Crow plateau. I hope I have walked this difficult tightrope well under a light microscope. Nonetheless, God bless. Thanks for working with me in this process. More or less, it's still a work in progress. I hope to bring happiness for all...
[Pauses as he flips through his papers to get to the next page. The camera moves in, then out.]
...parties. And please don't sniff those gnarly Sharpies.
Tweets
MKRNightVee clarified the subject matter:
For those who are confused: This is a message from Christine's son about the merge. I hope that helps clarify things ^-^
In the comment thread, another Twitter user, with a private account, made a few comments expressing doubt about the video's content. Chris's responses:
FUTURE Son, at least in reincarnated-to-be soul.
Yeah, you can shut up; you do not fully understand how Fate and Destiny works.
I realize the more likely; I am not naive nor dumb. I am very keen and psychic, and I had foreseen his arrival and discussion in a dream long beforehand. And I genuinely do not get many face-to-face troll visits at my home. ⚡️💙⚡️
In July 2020, Chris (pretending to be possessed by Sonichu) tweeted about the video, implying that he still thought it was genuine.
