On 12 May 2015, Chris shows off his manboobs.
On 21 May 2015, Chris reveals that Chris Chan Sonichu is now female.
May was the 5th month of 2015. Chris's fourth court date for the events of 26 December 2014 occurred on 7 May, and it was delayed yet again for 11 June 2015. This was a quiet month in Chris's life, as he spent most of his time with Facebook and his iPhone camera.
Events of May
5 May - Chris signs a petition to let rock singer Melissa Etheridge into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. While Etheridge is a great musician, it's certain he only signed it because she is a lesbian.
7 May - Chris's fourth court date. It is continued until 11 June.
10 May - Mother's Day.
12 May - Chris posts some new Facebook pictures. Comments from Kim Wilson indicate that he believes he is undergoing hormone replacement.
