CosmicKeyframe
CosmicKeyframe blocks Chris
On 11 January 2024, CosmicKeyframe blocked Chris's CPU_CWCSonichu Twitter account. She had posted a poll asking her followers which pin design to make, and one had replied asking for a character from the G5 series of My Little Pony. Chris then angrily replied, claiming that G5 does not exist and demanding a G4 pin instead. CosmicKeyframe then blocked Chris, mentioning that she did not want to deal with the drama.[1]
DRWolf
Main article: DRWolf
Chris is a fan of DRWolf's content and has appropriated his ponysona several times, including in comic pages and a video.
Jasper Pie
Jasper has Chris blocked on Twitter. When asked the reason for the block by Tinyhorse1942 (a Twitter alt suspected to be used by Chris), Jasper replied, "I found her behavior to be inappropriate, she made me feel very uncomfortable at a convention where she stared at me and tried to follow me, and I really just didn't want to get involved in the drama."
Notably, TinyHorse was highly defensive and retorted that Chris might've merely been a fan who had a tough time recognizing Jasper.[2]
ILoveKPALot
ILoveKPALot
ILoveKPALot, also known as KP, is a YouTuber known for making videos discussing animated media and having produced MLP Animation: Discord Meets the Princess Bride, a fan animation in which Chris was a contributor.
On 1 May 2025, Chris posted her video titled "What RUINED Saberspark and DAGames" on Bluesky, writing that "#Saberspark is not so Sabersmart."[3] He also later gave his opinion on the subject, saying that fans and celebrities should not casually date each other.
Chris posted about KP again on 12 May 2025 in a Twitter thread.

Lightning Bliss
This article is still yet to be completed due to stress. We get a lot of stressful torture in our lives that makes us crash into slumber. Given that inspiration is a big variable, and we may have been lacking of it, this article will be completed as soon as possible, at our own pace... HONEST!
Sonichu and Rosechu meet Lighting Bliss
In the Chaos Crystal Control comic which was partially released October 2023, Chris appropriated Lightning Bliss's ponysona. In the story, Lightning Bliss is sent back in time to 2006 and is distraught over it. Sonichu and Rosechu encounter the crying Lighting Bliss and offer help.
On 27 January 2025, Chris made a post on Bluesky, giving his thoughts on Lightning Bliss' recent Christmas video. He said it "resonated" with him, then mysteriously mentioned how he didn't want to say more due to wanting to keep "personal details" off the Internet.[4]
On 28 March 2025, Chris made a post on Bluesky, praising Lightning Bliss' recent music video.[5]
Black Gryph0n
