Summary
Julie initiates the conversation, but cannot contact Chris. Chris responds too late, and then gives out his “to do” list, which includes hiring an attorney. Chris brings up his sleep cycle, and Julie tries to contact him again. When Julie finally gets a hold (pardon the disgusting pun) of Chris, she says that fans wish to communicate with him via Mumble. Julie keeps checking up on his progress, but he prefers to chat with “Sarah-Heart” than talk to his fans. Julie mentions that it’s getting late, but Chris still doesn’t seem to give a shit about his fans. Finally, he seems to get through to the Mumble chat. Chris and Julie exchange farewells after about fifty minutes, and the next day, Chris stresses the importance of keeping passwords between him and Julie. However, it seems that trolls have been able to see his Skype conversations (ORLY?).
Chris and Julie discuss Panda, and Chris reiterates that he refuses to believe that Panda is happily living with Clyde. Chris asks when Julie is planning on making her trip; he believes that Clyde deserves death at that point more than ever. Chris claims that he is not a man who “likes to keep rage constantly in [his] heart,” and agrees with Julie that Clyde is a homosexual. Julie mentions that she would like a child, and Chris arrogantly assumes that she would want a child with him. He states that he is not sure about that, but he would still like the threesome. He shares his fantasy that he would like the two women involved to “scissor” each other and that he would “put [his] dick in between [sic] the kissing [v]aginas. ;)”
Julie’s brother then takes control of the computer and attempts to goad Chris into replying. Julie gets back on, and Chris states that he can “take abuse like a stone wall.” Apparently, Chris told Max off by using South Park character impressions. Chris interrogates Julie about her age, education, high school, career aspirations, etc. Chris forgot where Julie lives, and mentions how great the U.S.A. is. Chris mentions how he loves Family Guy, and how he loves Meg for her physical appearance and “charming personality.”

Hey, Julie, are you there?
[05:00:55] Christopher C.W.C.:
I guess not.
[05:01:10] Christopher C.W.C.:
anyway, I am personally safe, healthy and well.
[05:02:09] Christopher C.W.C.:
a few minor bumps on the business road, but the Window is still open for me when I have my act here put together.
[05:03:44] Christopher C.W.C.:

Importantly, I hope you are safe and well too.
[05:05:05] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'll check in again later.
[14:39:45] BlueSpike:
Hi, Chris! Sorry I couldn't reply. I was busy today. I'll start making sure I don't leave Skype on! Let me know when you return!
[18:19:11] BlueSpike:
Also, I noticed that you're up sort of late, which may be why I don't catch your messages.
January 30
[04:16:58] Christopher C.W.C.:
Actually, my biological clock has taken a turn for an opposite; I've felt and fallen asleep during or late afternoon/early evening to like 3-6 AM.
[04:17:32] Christopher C.W.C.:
It's got me on a more appropriate schedule than before when I slept from 3-6 AM to Noonish
[04:17:51] Christopher C.W.C.:
But I feel it could be better.
[04:18:01] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'll check in again later.
[09:45:06] BlueSpike:
So, I got your PSN messages.
[09:45:10] BlueSpike:
The secret's safe with me.
[15:53:20] BlueSpike:
Are you there?
[22:47:47] BlueSpike:
Chris, a couple fans want a true and honest voice chat with you, they say. We have a server.
[23:30:57] BlueSpike:
Chris?
[23:31:11] BlueSpike:
I knwo you're there. >.<
January 31
[03:24:02] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'm sorry, Julie; I forgot to switch to "Not Available" last time I was on my PC. And I fell asleep during the 9 PM Hour.
[03:24:43] BlueSpike:
Oh, I see!
[03:24:46] BlueSpike:
Luckily, I'm here.
[03:24:56] Christopher C.W.C.:
okay.
[03:25:10] Christopher C.W.C.:
You kinda surprised me.
[03:25:19] BlueSpike:
Sorry about that.
[03:25:31] BlueSpike:
Anyway, what do you think of the true honest voice chat with the fans idea?
[03:25:58] Christopher C.W.C.:
can you explain what they meant from "We have a server."? And how does the voice chat work; on Skype or something?
It's cool.
[03:27:32] BlueSpike:
It's called Mumble, one of our true Sonichu fans created a server. All you need to do is download Mumble, I'll link you to the site where you can download it.
[03:27:43] BlueSpike:
It's a voice that program that people use for gaming or just hanging out.
[03:27:47] BlueSpike:
Chat*
[03:28:17] BlueSpike:
http://mumble.sourceforge.net/Main_Page
[03:28:22] BlueSpike:
You can get it here. :)
[03:28:23] Christopher C.W.C.:
I see. alright.
[03:30:00] BlueSpike:
When you open it, just skip the audio setup, and I'll give you the server info.
[03:30:07] BlueSpike:
Let me know. :)
[03:30:15] Christopher C.W.C.:
okay, please wait.
[03:37:37] BlueSpike:
Any problems?
[03:37:49] Christopher C.W.C.:
no, please be paitent.
[03:38:05] BlueSpike:
Okay. :)
[03:42:04] BlueSpike:
I'll brb.
[03:42:32] Christopher C.W.C.:
ok
[03:42:58] BlueSpike:
Back. :D
[03:49:48] BlueSpike:
No problems, right?
[03:50:05] BlueSpike:
Also, I'd skip audio configuration.
[03:50:36] BlueSpike:
Do you want the information?
[03:50:51] BlueSpike:
You know, for the server?
[03:50:59] Christopher C.W.C.:
I understand.
[03:51:30] Christopher C.W.C.:
I have the webpage up in a different tab; I've been sending a message to Sarah-Heart.
[03:51:41] Christopher C.W.C.:
That's my delay.
[03:52:57] BlueSpike:
Ah, alright.
[03:53:42] BlueSpike:
Remember, we're waiting for you, eagerly. :)
[03:54:01] Christopher C.W.C.:
I appreciate y'all's paitence. :)
[03:56:20] BlueSpike: :)
[03:56:44] BlueSpike:
Okay.
[04:04:35] BlueSpike:
It's been kind of a while. :( I know you love talking to Sarah, but some of us have to go to bed soon. :( We'd love if you can hang with us for a while.
[04:05:09] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'm sorry; I've just finished.
[04:05:18] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'll download the program shortly.
[04:05:27] BlueSpike:
Okay. :)
[04:10:58] Christopher C.W.C.:
I have it running now; which server do I select?
[04:11:18] BlueSpike:
Okay, let me get the info.
[04:11:23] BlueSpike:
A few seconds, please.
[04:11:33] BlueSpike:
You have to select add.
[04:11:51] BlueSpike:
The address is 125.75.200.182
[04:12:07] BlueSpike:
Username and Label can be whatever you want.
[04:12:14] BlueSpike:
And remembr!
[04:12:19] BlueSpike:
Do this in custom servers.
[04:12:29] BlueSpike:
The port is 64738
[04:13:14] BlueSpike:
Should I go through that again?
[04:13:40] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'm having trouble finding it; I'm in the window that comes up after the audio setup window is cancelled, "Mumble Server Connect"
[04:13:54] BlueSpike:
You click the custom server tab, you see it?
[04:14:01] Christopher C.W.C.:
yes
[04:14:11] BlueSpike:
Then 'add', then input the info as I've said up there.
[04:14:15] Christopher C.W.C.:
the port says what you typed, 64738
[04:14:29] BlueSpike:
The address is 122.87.125.170
[04:14:33] BlueSpike:
You got that, right?
[04:14:51] BlueSpike:
The label and username can be whatever. Of course for Username you should use 'ChrisChanSonichu'
[04:15:40] Christopher C.W.C.:
I got it in; the "Add" button was unpressable, and I pressed, "Connect"
[04:16:01] BlueSpike:
Then it gave you a warning, right?
[04:16:23] BlueSpike:
Accept that, and you should come in.
[04:16:29] Christopher C.W.C.:
okay.
[04:17:37] Christopher C.W.C.:
yeah, I made it. How do I type in it?
[04:17:45] BlueSpike:
You don't need to.
[04:17:46] BlueSpike:
Just talk.
[04:17:51] BlueSpike:
Your mic should pick it up.
[05:08:55] BlueSpike:
Sorry it's taking so long, my computer's being slow. >.<
[05:09:11] Christopher C.W.C.:
it's okay
[05:10:39] BlueSpike:
Maybe I should show the mumble, you think so?
[05:10:46] Christopher C.W.C.:
if you wish.
[05:10:53] BlueSpike:
I will. :)
[05:25:17] Christopher C.W.C.:
me 2
[05:25:40] BlueSpike: :)
[05:35:12] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'll TTYL, Julie.
[05:35:13] Christopher C.W.C.:
you take care.
[05:35:25] BlueSpike:
You too.
[05:35:30] BlueSpike:
<3
[05:35:50] BlueSpike:
Wait.
[05:35:56] BlueSpike:
Be sure to talk to me later today. :)
[05:36:02] BlueSpike:
I'll be here all day myself, promise.
[06:06:27] BlueSpike:
mumble://122.87.125.170:64738 this address will connect you to this server
[06:06:38] BlueSpike:
Just though I'd drop that by. :)
[06:51:51] Christopher C.W.C.:
Hey, Julie.
[06:51:54] Christopher C.W.C.:
I just wanted to drop a note that I've just created an apology video addressed to Mr. Miyamoto and Fils-Aime for the previous video, and explained the intention of getting them here to my pad to meet my folks and reinstate their faith in them and our business together.
I've also asked them to uncancel the Sonichu Project and pigeonhole it for until I am able to make the trip to Redmond with my mother, sweetheart or female attorney.
[20:09:45] BlueSpike:
Thank you so much, Chris. :)
[20:10:04] BlueSpike:
Question, though.
[20:10:17] BlueSpike:
Is it alright if I download everything I would like? That you've already downloaded, that is?
[20:10:44] BlueSpike:
Or should I just download a few things, like LBP costumes?
[23:36:16] BlueSpike:
Chris?
February 1
[00:45:42] BlueSpike:
Chris, I wanna talk to you in Mumble, if you can make it. :)
[04:53:25] Christopher C.W.C.:
Hey, Julie.
[04:53:55] Christopher C.W.C.:
Yes, you have my permission to download any of my previously downloaded software as you wish.
[04:54:47] Christopher C.W.C.:
as long as you keep that password ONLY between you and me; do not type it here, though; apparently some Trolls have been able to read from my Skype Windows.
[04:55:23] Christopher C.W.C.:
As for Mumble, I don't feel like it tonight; I have Church later today, and I've had a rough week from the bad news half.
[05:02:47] Christopher C.W.C.:
I gtg eat; I'll TTYL.
[11:18:41] BlueSpike:
Chris, thank yuo so much! I have so many games now, and all the LBP costumes. :)
[11:22:52] BlueSpike:
Another thing I just need to check. I'm not allowed to buy Burnout Paradise, correct? I'm sorry if I'm asking a question that's already been answered. But I noticed it's only 20 dollars at this point, a great deal.
[13:02:27] Christopher C.W.C.:
I've deleted my credit card temporarily from my account. So, if you have the money, you may purchase Burnout Paradise.
[13:03:16] Christopher C.W.C.:
from your own credit card, or buy a 20 dollar PSN Card from your local Gamestop or somewhere that sells them.
[13:10:18] BlueSpike:
Ah, alright. I guess I don't exactly need it anyway, given all the awesome things you've given me so far. :)
[21:23:43] BlueSpike:
It says I can still buy it, it'll add funds automaticly.
[21:24:07] BlueSpike:
Well, I think that's to be saved for another time.
[21:24:12] BlueSpike:
How was your day, Chris?
February 2
[02:23:36] BlueSpike:
Are you there? :o
[05:10:36] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'm safe and well.
[05:22:11] Christopher C.W.C.:
For your information, I have not enabled my account to add funds automatically; if that was the case, I would had to have my credit card still on file.
[05:23:24] Christopher C.W.C.:
I had an okay day; I took a day of rest and fished in ACCityFolk.
[05:24:24] Christopher C.W.C.:
Are you still in the USA? Last I heard from you, you said you were in Ohio, right?
[05:25:17] Christopher C.W.C.:
You are still welcome to come visit me at my pad and hang out when you are able to.
[05:25:39] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'll check in again later.
[05:25:44] Christopher C.W.C.:
Love and Peace.
[14:38:05] BlueSpike:
Yes, Chris. I'm still in America. :)
[16:34:16] BlueSpike:
I bet fishing was really relaxing, I hope you caught a big one.
[16:49:33] BlueSpike:
Chris, maybe you can be in the Mumble tonight?
February 3
[00:04:44] BlueSpike:
I hope you reply soon, most of us wanna see you today, it's fun conversing with you. :) Not alot of us are up at 5 AM. :(
February 4
[15:42:24] Christopher C.W.C.:
Hey, Julie. Are you there?
[15:43:21] BlueSpike:
Yes.
[15:43:23] BlueSpike: :)
[15:43:30] Christopher C.W.C.:
cool. How are you?
[15:43:43] BlueSpike:
I'm great, yourself?
[15:43:47] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'm safe and well.
[15:43:55] Christopher C.W.C.:
did you get my recent PSN message?
[15:44:07] BlueSpike:
Hm? I've not logged into PSN as of late.
[15:44:09] BlueSpike:
Let me check.
[15:44:35] Christopher C.W.C.:
okay. I've noticed you were logged out for about 37 hours or so.
[15:44:53] BlueSpike:
Yeah, I was taking a bit of a break from the PS3.
[15:45:04] Christopher C.W.C.:
I see.
[15:45:22] BlueSpike:
Okay, I'm gonna read the message.
[15:45:43] BlueSpike: :o !
[15:45:46] BlueSpike:
Awesome!
[15:46:00] BlueSpike:
Chris, thank you sooo much! <3
[15:46:03] Christopher C.W.C.: :)
[15:46:20] BlueSpike:
So, how was your day?
[15:46:33] Christopher C.W.C.:
Consider it me giving back a bit for your loyalty and all that. Okay.
[15:46:39] Christopher C.W.C.:
My day was okay.
[15:46:47] BlueSpike:
Aweosme to hear. :)
[15:47:25] BlueSpike:
Maybe you can perhaps join Mumble tonight? You know, maybe in an hour, two maybe?
[15:47:34] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'll try to make it.
[15:47:41] BlueSpike:
Cool. :)
[15:47:51] Christopher C.W.C.:
Anyway, all things considered, I fully trust you now.
[15:47:51] BlueSpike:
I'm downloading Burnout now, BTW. :)
[15:48:17] BlueSpike:
I'm very happy to see you understand I'm a gal-pal worth trusting. :)
[15:48:36] BlueSpike:
BRB
[15:48:40] Christopher C.W.C.:
ok.
[15:48:40] Christopher C.W.C.:
Yes. Also, we at least can have confidential messages between you and me on the PSN.
[15:50:23] BlueSpike:
Back.
[15:51:16] BlueSpike:
So, how's Sarah?
[15:51:31] Christopher C.W.C.:
which one? Panda or Sarah-May?
[15:51:38] BlueSpike:
Panda.
[15:52:16] Christopher C.W.C.:
I have not heard from her in over a week or two. All I've been able to hear about that were the words from that Doof, Clyde.
[15:52:27] BlueSpike:
I hate Clyde so much. >:(
[15:52:47] Christopher C.W.C.:
He says that she is with him and such. I'm not believing it until I hear it from Sarah-Heart herself.
[15:53:23] BlueSpike:
I hope she still loves you. :(
[15:53:28] Christopher C.W.C.:
So at this time, I am emotionally in a spot of confusion, because I do not know for sure.
[15:53:38] BlueSpike:
I wouldn't want that jerk, Clyde, to ruin what was such a great relationship.
[15:53:39] Christopher C.W.C.:
I pray she does too.
[15:53:55] Christopher C.W.C.:
You're preachin' to the choir.
[15:54:01] BlueSpike: :)
[15:54:35] Christopher C.W.C.:
Let me go off-topic for a bit. Are you still planning to come visit and hang out with me?
[15:54:39] BlueSpike:
Is it bad to wish death upon Clyde? :(
[15:54:45] BlueSpike:
And yes, I'm planning to.
[15:54:52] BlueSpike:
It's somewhat harder than I thought getting the money, though.
[15:55:20] Christopher C.W.C.:
I hear you. And I look forward to your visit whenever you can make the trip.
[15:55:29] BlueSpike:
As do I. :)
[15:55:41] Christopher C.W.C.:
Also, IMHO, he deserves it WORST.
[15:55:49] BlueSpike:
Yeah. :)
[15:55:59] Christopher C.W.C.:
so I feel it's right at the moment.
[15:56:13] BlueSpike:
I actually have a hunch he may be actually homosexual.
[15:56:19] BlueSpike:
And just trying to make you angry!
[15:56:20] Christopher C.W.C.:
But I'm not a man who likes to keep rage constantly in my heart.
[15:56:28] Christopher C.W.C.:
probably.
[15:56:31] BlueSpike:
I understand completely. :)
[15:56:40] Christopher C.W.C.:
But I do not know for sure until I hear from Panda.
[15:57:02] Christopher C.W.C.:
On the flip-side, Sarah May has been most confiding and helpful for me.
[15:57:10] BlueSpike:
I've heard. :)
[15:57:24] Christopher C.W.C.:
I would say more about it, but apparently the Trolls can see what I type on Skype.
[15:57:34] BlueSpike:
Really? :o
[15:57:36] Christopher C.W.C.:
I hope I haven't said too much.
[15:57:37] Christopher C.W.C.:
yes.
[15:57:40] BlueSpike:
I see why you want to use PSN!
[15:57:46] Christopher C.W.C.:
or the Wii Network.
[15:57:48] BlueSpike:
Smart idea. :)
[15:57:55] Christopher C.W.C.:
She and I have exchanged Wii Console Numbers.
[15:57:59] BlueSpike:
Cool.
[15:58:12] Christopher C.W.C.:
and I have a WiiSpeak now.
[15:58:30] BlueSpike:
Cool. :)
[15:58:34] BlueSpike:
Hmm..
[15:58:38] Christopher C.W.C.:
I have been unable to schedule a Home meeting lately, but I'll let you know on the PSN when I do.
[15:58:51] BlueSpike:
Somehow, I just started to wonder what it'd be like to have a child. And cool, I'm looking forward to the next meeting.
[15:58:52] BlueSpike: :)
[15:59:16] Christopher C.W.C.: :) R U thinkin' a child with me?
[15:59:23] BlueSpike:
Maybe. ;)
[16:00:00] BlueSpike:
If Panda doesn't get there first, then 100 percent, yes. :)
[16:00:02] Christopher C.W.C.:
lol. I can't say for certain at the moment about that. But I would honestly invite you for a do and a threesome after I lose my Virginity.
[16:00:21] BlueSpike:
I don't know about a threesome, I need to think about it a little. >.>
[16:00:32] BlueSpike:
But it does sound fun.
[16:01:06] Christopher C.W.C.:
I am willing to share a fantasy with you, and even any Trolls watching can quote me on this...
[16:01:33] BlueSpike: :)
[16:02:21] Christopher C.W.C.:
When I have a threesome with two women, and that is the only type of Threesome I would Want ever, I'd like the two women to do the scissor-position that I've heard about, but I'd put my dick in between the kissing Vaginas. ;)
[16:02:31] BlueSpike:
My brother, the troll, keeps telling me to type awful things. :(
[16:02:38] BlueSpike:
And it sounds nice, Chris. :)
[16:02:58] Christopher C.W.C.:
Tell your Bro to BACK OFF.
[16:03:08] BlueSpike:
He won't listen to me. :(
[16:03:17] BlueSpike:
Maybe you could try? :o
[16:03:33] BlueSpike:
I could let him type to you if you wish.
[16:03:50] BlueSpike:
?
[16:03:52] BlueSpike:
Hnn?
[16:03:59] BlueSpike:
Yes.
[16:04:02] BlueSpike:
Me and him can hear you.
[16:04:10] BlueSpike:
He's laughing. :(
[16:04:33] BlueSpike:
He's pushing me off!
[16:04:41] BlueSpike:
Hey, dummy.
[16:04:42] BlueSpike:
It's me.
[16:04:51] BlueSpike:
So, you think you're smart?
[16:04:55] BlueSpike:
I'm rubber, you're glue?
[16:04:57] BlueSpike:
Don't make me laugh.
[16:05:25] BlueSpike:
You really are stupid.
[16:05:36] BlueSpike:
Well, I do like South Park.
[16:05:41] BlueSpike:
Hmm.
[16:05:55] BlueSpike:
Alright, fine.
[16:05:58] BlueSpike:
I'll leave you be.
[16:06:01] BlueSpike:
I'll let Julie back on.
[16:06:12] BlueSpike:
Hi, Chris. :)
[16:06:15] Christopher C.W.C.:
Hey, Julie.
[16:06:34] Christopher C.W.C.:
I've just ended the call.
[16:06:37] BlueSpike:
Sorry about my brother, he's a jerk. >:(
[16:06:40] BlueSpike:
And I know.
[16:06:57] Christopher C.W.C.:
I hear you. But I can take abuse like a stone wall.
[16:07:12] BlueSpike:
I know, but me..Not so much. :(
[16:07:52] BlueSpike:
So, I was out of the room to vent, what did you say to him?
[16:08:12] Christopher C.W.C.:
Just telling him off with Kenny and Cartman impersonations.
[16:08:27] BlueSpike:
I wish I could of heard you tell him off. :(
[16:08:37] Christopher C.W.C.:
and I also told him that I did you a favor.
[16:08:43] BlueSpike:
What did he say? He closed the window before I got back on.
[16:08:55] Christopher C.W.C.:
He said alright, I'll let you be.
[16:09:04] Christopher C.W.C.:
Window?
[16:09:20] Christopher C.W.C.:
why didn't he use the door?
[16:09:21] BlueSpike:
The skype chat window.
[16:09:23] Christopher C.W.C.:
oh.
[16:09:40] Christopher C.W.C.:
I see.
[16:09:54] BlueSpike:
I think he erased some of the history, too. :(
[16:09:59] BlueSpike:
That jerk, I hate him so freaking much!
[16:10:27] BlueSpike:
I'll be happy to never have to see him again after I move in at a Hotel in Virgina. :)
[16:10:28] Christopher C.W.C.:
I hear you. did you tell your family about how you feel about him.
[16:10:50] BlueSpike:
No, but he won't listen anyway. :(
[16:11:11] Christopher C.W.C.:
I see. Wow! a hotel. how will you make the rent?
[16:11:37] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'd think an apartment would be more suitable, with monthly rates.
[16:11:37] BlueSpike:
I'm not sure, I'm still trying to figure that out. :(
[16:11:49] BlueSpike:
Yeah, I meant to say apartment.
[16:12:00] BlueSpike:
I'm still getting used to living in America.
[16:12:05] Christopher C.W.C.:
cool.
[16:12:15] Christopher C.W.C.:
Refresh my memory, how old are you?
[16:12:26] BlueSpike:
19, why?
[16:12:35] Christopher C.W.C.:
just checking.
[16:13:04] Christopher C.W.C.:
how far did you get education-wise?
[16:13:19] BlueSpike:
I haven't gotten far into that, yet.
[16:13:31] BlueSpike:
As far as right now, I'm working small jobs, before I do anything else.
[16:13:41] Christopher C.W.C.:
were you in High School before you moved to the USA?
[16:13:54] BlueSpike:
Yes, I was.
[16:14:02] Christopher C.W.C.:
that's good. graduated?
[16:14:10] BlueSpike:
Yup.
[16:14:14] Christopher C.W.C.:
Excellent.
[16:14:25] Christopher C.W.C.:
At least you have that feather in your cap.
[16:14:33] BlueSpike:
Yup. :)
[16:14:57] Christopher C.W.C.:
What kind of skills you have do you feel would work best for you in a job? Or in another way to put it, what is your dream job?
[16:15:02] BlueSpike:
Hmm...
[16:15:05] BlueSpike:
My dream job..
[16:15:12] Christopher C.W.C.:
you all are welcome. :)
[16:15:15] BlueSpike:
I guess maybe a Doctor.
[16:15:18] Christopher C.W.C.:
good.
[16:15:52] Christopher C.W.C.:
You can get proper education towards being a doctor at like PVCC or UVA here, and get a degree.
[16:16:07] BlueSpike:
Ah, cool!
[16:16:21] Christopher C.W.C.:
a feather in Charlottesville's Cap is having UVA basically in the backyard.
[16:16:28] Christopher C.W.C.:
but PVCC is cool too.
[16:16:36] BlueSpike:
I'll BRB again, sorry. But please, keep going on what other things I can do in America. I'm starting to grow fond of this country.
[16:16:45] Christopher C.W.C.: :)
[16:17:21] Christopher C.W.C.:
Off the top of my head, I can't really say. But there are LOTS to do here.
[16:18:10] Christopher C.W.C.:
At least there is the freedom our american forefathers fought hard for to earn.
[16:18:43] BlueSpike:
Back.
[16:18:44] Christopher C.W.C.:
more than in other countries (with none in my head, but in general anyway).
[16:18:49] BlueSpike:
And yes, it is very nice. :)
[16:19:29] Christopher C.W.C.:
You arrived from a country with less freedoms, I hear, although the name escapes me.
[16:20:05] BlueSpike:
Molvania, remember?
[16:20:06] BlueSpike: :)
[16:20:29] Christopher C.W.C.:
Molvania, Yes. I remember it was _____vania.
[16:20:50] Christopher C.W.C.:
Molvania. I will imprint that into my memory.
[16:20:56] BlueSpike:
Thank you. :)
[16:21:16] Christopher C.W.C.:
I do remember hearing from your relatives that I have heavy fan support for Sonichu and Rosechu there.
[16:22:40] BlueSpike:
Yes, quite.
[16:22:41] BlueSpike: :)
[16:23:11] Christopher C.W.C.:
I want to let you know, Julie, that I feel really flattered that you came all the way from Molvania to meet me. :)
[16:23:26] BlueSpike:
It's honestly my pleasure. :)
[16:24:01] Christopher C.W.C.:
I was also reminded of that pleasure of having someone come from far away to meet someone else from the anime I've started downloading from the PSN, "Shuffle".
[16:24:08] Christopher C.W.C.:
It's fun.
[16:24:09] Christopher C.W.C.: :)
[16:24:18] Christopher C.W.C.:
I have about the first six episodes so far.
[16:24:26] BlueSpike:
Cool, I should check it out online some time. :)
[16:24:42] Christopher C.W.C.:
BTW, which country is your PSN account linked to?
[16:25:06] BlueSpike:
I set it to US when I registered, I figured it'd be better to do as such.
[16:26:03] Christopher C.W.C.:
I see. Did you have your PS3 before you left Molvania?
[16:28:05] Christopher C.W.C.:
or did you get your PS3 after you've arrived in the USA?
[16:30:55] Christopher C.W.C.:
Julie?
[16:36:04] BlueSpike:
Sorry about that.
[16:36:20] BlueSpike:
I was called for something by my brother.
[16:36:23] BlueSpike:
He needed help with something.
[16:36:36] BlueSpike:
But I'm back now. :)
[16:36:40] Christopher C.W.C.:
ok.
[16:36:45] Christopher C.W.C.:
cool.
[16:36:48] BlueSpike:
Anyway, I had it before I left, yes. And I got it after I arrived.
[16:37:22] Christopher C.W.C.:
Okay, so you didn't register until after you've arrived in the US?
[16:37:39] BlueSpike:
I registered it before I left.
[16:37:51] Christopher C.W.C.:
ah.
[16:37:53] BlueSpike:
I just set it to US instead of Molvania, which I don't think was on the list.
[16:38:02] Christopher C.W.C.:
I see.
[16:38:05] Christopher C.W.C.:
and I hear you.
[16:38:07] BlueSpike:
I'm not sure why, it's a very small country.
[16:38:41] BlueSpike:
So, anything you wanna talk about?
[16:38:42] Christopher C.W.C.:
just like Ruckersvills is a Smallville, neighbored by Charlottesville.
[16:38:50] BlueSpike:
Yeah, I suppose. :)
[16:39:21] Christopher C.W.C.:
Was Molvania neighbored by Germany or which country?
[16:40:25] BlueSpike:
Yes, Germany was one of them.
[16:40:34] Christopher C.W.C.:
Ah. Cool.
[16:40:55] Christopher C.W.C.:
Did you say you liked "Family Guy"?
[16:40:59] BlueSpike:
I'm so happy to be here in America. :)
[16:41:05] Christopher C.W.C.:
me2
[16:41:15] BlueSpike:
And yes, I do. I was able to watch it online while I was in Molvania. :)
[16:41:25] Christopher C.W.C.:
cool.
[16:41:33] Christopher C.W.C.:
which character do you like best?
[16:41:38] BlueSpike:
Hmm...
[16:41:52] BlueSpike:
I'd say I like Brian the best.
[16:41:52] Christopher C.W.C.:
You know I like Megan Marie Griffin the best.
[16:41:58] Christopher C.W.C.:
Brian is a cool dog.
[16:42:09] BlueSpike:
I wish I had one like him. :)
[16:42:22] Christopher C.W.C.:
"Hey, Barkeep, whose leg do you have to hump to get a dry martini around here?"
[16:42:39] BlueSpike:
I LOVED that. :)
[16:43:08] Christopher C.W.C.:
that quote is popular from Brian, granted it was not portrayed as a catchphrase.
[16:43:16] BlueSpike:
Hmm.
[16:43:29] Christopher C.W.C.:
I mean he dosen't say it that often.
[16:43:36] BlueSpike:
Yeah.
[16:43:59] Christopher C.W.C.:
what of Brian do you like best?
[16:44:09] Christopher C.W.C.:
personality trait or something like that.
[16:44:20] BlueSpike:
Hmm..
[16:44:24] BlueSpike:
I don't know, actually.
[16:44:31] BlueSpike:
He's just a character I like, I need to think why.
[16:44:38] Christopher C.W.C.:
it's cool.
[16:44:45] BlueSpike:
Because I think he's somewhat funny, I suppose.
[16:45:38] Christopher C.W.C.:
I like Megan, because she IS a pretty woman, although she is portrayed as not as such and gets the raw end of the deal. I feel for her, and I really liked her charming personality.
[16:45:53] BlueSpike:
I like Megan too. :)
[16:46:19] Christopher C.W.C.:
BTW, do you have a picture of yourself you can send to me over Skype now?
[16:46:45] BlueSpike:
Sadly, not as of yet.
[16:46:55] BlueSpike:
I have no camera or pictures to send. :(
[16:47:01] BlueSpike:
I'll try to get a camera, though.
[16:47:02] Christopher C.W.C.:
That's okay.
[16:47:05] Christopher C.W.C.:
ok.
[16:47:27] Christopher C.W.C.:
you can get a disposable digital camera; they sell those at drug stores like CVS or Walgreens.
[16:47:36] BlueSpike:
I should.
[16:47:44] Christopher C.W.C.:
with a USB cable to transfer the pics to PC or maybe PS3.
[16:47:48] BlueSpike:
Hey, when do you think you can join the Mumble?
[16:48:10] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'll show up about 8PM tonight, is that cool?
[16:48:23] Christopher C.W.C.:
est
[16:48:37] BlueSpike:
8PM sounds wonderful. :)
[16:48:40] Christopher C.W.C.:
okay.
[16:49:01] Christopher C.W.C.:
I gtg do some things in ACCityFolk and stuff. I'll TTYL.
[16:49:12] BlueSpike:
Okay.
[16:49:14] BlueSpike:
<3
[16:49:16] Christopher C.W.C.:
Love and Peace.
[18:53:07] BlueSpike:
Chris, you there? :)
[20:09:02] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'm here now. :)
[21:24:49] Christopher C.W.C.:
Hey, Julie.
[21:31:48] BlueSpike:
I'm sorry about not being present sooner, I kinda feel asleep. :(
[21:32:03] Christopher C.W.C.:
It's okay.
[21:46:07] Christopher C.W.C.:
Maybe, we can race on Burnout
[21:46:20] BlueSpike:
Yeah, I'd enjoy that. :)
[21:51:43] BlueSpike:
I guess I'll talk to you later, Chris. :)
[21:51:59] Christopher C.W.C.:
Yeah, I'll check in again later, either on here or on PSN.
[21:52:06] Christopher C.W.C.:
be sure to be logged in.
[21:52:12] Christopher C.W.C.:
TTYL
[21:52:14] BlueSpike:
Okay. :)
