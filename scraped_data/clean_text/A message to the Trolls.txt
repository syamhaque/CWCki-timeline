================================================================================

A message to the Trolls (video name: A message to the Trolls.MOV) is a video Chris uploaded on 10 March 2010, a while after learning that The Wallflower had discovered the CWCki. In it, he, while noticeably not wearing his medallion or the high school ring, mostly whines to the trolls for interfering with his life, but doesn't go into specifics--mentioning only that trolls have been messing with his friends. He ends the video by punching the camera.
It's worth noting that, despite blaming the trolls for much of his emotional pain and troubles in life, most of that has been self-induced by him. For example, making The Wallflower's identity public to begin with; much like how ShecameforCWC.JPG was his own doing as well. The fact that Chris has been told at several points, by several people to stop engaging the trolls gives a new meaning to this video, considering it's purposefully addressed to his trolls and he went on to upload it for them, and in doing so ignored the advice of those who were trying to help him and renewing the trolls attention once more.

Transcript
[A visibly upset Chris begins the video by speaking in a barely-audible, whining tone] This message is for every last god damn troll that has been pestering me for the past number of years, even the recent ones. I have been in a number of moments finding peace and losing it later. Because
YOU WON'T LET ME BE!
You are su- You are a bunch of damn immature DUMBASSES who have no lives of your own.
You don't want me to have a little life of my own, you don't want me to find long-lasting peace and happiness for myself, you don't want me to find the whole true love for myself because you are so self-absorbed in yourselves, you don't wan- you only want me to give you more got-dang stories and art then I can give because of my... inspiration comes in and out... it mostly comes in when I'm happy and have peace.
You are nothing but god damn greedy, impatient, unloved, and [shows the claw] corrupted fools. Heartbreaks and heartaches, they really hurt. I've let you all done so much whatever you want emotionally than me...but...it is...goddamn another story when you tryta hurt my friends AND GET THEM INVOLVED like you've been doing! [Chris punches the camera and we go bright orange for a microsecond before cutting off.]
