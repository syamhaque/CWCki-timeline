Chris's dream restaurant. At least he's honest about how fat that crap will make you.
Chris isn't much of a cook, nor were any of the current or former residents of his previous house, 14 Branchland Court. When Chris isn't eating reheated frozen dinners, he's usually chowing down at a variety of local restaurants. Keeping with the theme of commercial consumerism, all of Chris's favorite restaurants are chains.
Many of these restaurants do not offer many, or any, meals that provide good nutrition.

Applebee's
Applebee's is a popular chain of sit-down restaurants. Chris has occasionally eaten here, but it's generally too dear for his budget. His most notable visit was his date with Catherine and her cousin Al on 31 October 2014, where he horrified staff and patrons alike. During the father call, he mentions taking Kacey there and leaving a 15% tip on a bill of (somehow) ten dollars – a whole $1.50. Chris would also have a date with an obese woman; he later revealed her name as Faeryn.
Arby's
Arby's is a large quick-service sandwich chain known for having the meats. In one IRC chat, Chris considered Arby's as one of the possible restaurants to which he will take his first date.
Arnold's
Arnold's is a chain of coffee shops in Finland. Chris and Flutter were seen eating in one in April 2025.[1]
Baja Bean
Baja Bean was a small chain serving Mexican food. A look at their website suggests they now have only one restaurant.[2] Interestingly, their location in Richmond was located only blocks from where Barb raised Cole Smithey near campus of Virginia Commonwealth University. They also had a location in Charlottesville that Chris is known to have visited[3], but this has since closed down.
Chris tried to set up a meeting with Regina at Baja Bean.[4]
Burger King
Main article: Burger King
Chris favors McDonald's, whereas Bob preferred its rival, Burger King. Thus, Chris usually only ate here when he was out with his father.
Chick-fil-A
Admittedly, the store might've been a literary influence.
Chick-fil-A is a fast-food restaurant chain originating in the American South that Chris frequents, famous for its chicken sandwiches and lemonade and for always being closed on Sundays (due to their founder's Christian "seventh day of rest" beliefs). Chick-fil-A is generally considered to be one of the healthier fast food options in the United States.[5] However, Chris has mentioned it much less often than its artery-clogging big brother, McDonald's. The reason for this is unknown; possibilities include its lack of marketing campaigns aimed at children or an absence of foolish sweepstakes or "reward programs". As such, Chris has never been banned from a Chick-fil-A in an epic showdown battling jerkops. Even when the company came under fire for its founder's anti-homosexuality views and its involvements in "family values" movements, both of which would likely endear it to Chris, it did not seem to curry any favor with him.
Chris met up with Emily in front of the Chick-fil-A at Charlottesville Fashion Square. Or at least tried to by calling out to the patrons (who were undoubtedly amused and perplexed).
The Fashion Square Chick-fil-A was the site of one of the missed meetings between Chris and Surfshack Tito's agents during the drama over destroying Chris's PS3.
Chris and Flutter ate at Chick-fil-A in River Ridge Mall in June 2024.[6]
The CWCville Shopping Center includes a lone Chick-fil-A on the second floor.
Collegeville Italian Bakery
Collegeville Italian Bakery Pizzeria Napoletana is an Italian restaurant in the Philadelphia suburb of Collegeville. Chris visited on 23 June 2018 after he was booted from the TooManyGames convention for inappropriate behavior. He plugged the restaurant on Twitter and suggested a new pizza called "The Sonichu Zap!" made with yellow peppers.[7]
Country Cookin
Simonla calls for Country Cookin.
Country Cookin was Chris's not-quite-fast-food restaurant of choice. It was a Virginia-based chain of rustic steak house/buffet and grill restaurants, akin to Golden Corral, Roadhouse Grill or Ponderosa/Bonanza Steakhouse in the US, and Harvester, Beefeater or Brewer's Fayre in the United Kingdom.
Chris had mentioned it on several occasions and even had taken his troll friend Joshua Martinez there.
The company closed all of its locations in October 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In an e-mail conversation with Anna McLerran from 2007, Chris mentioned his regular trips to the restaurant with Joshua.
In Mumble 2, Chris mentioned Country Cookin as one of his favorite restaurants.
A Country Cookin branch is located in the CWCville Shopping Center.
In Sonichu #11, a newly-resurrected Simonla recommends going for some Country Cookin food.
In a 2011 email to LoveYouLongTime, Chris said he had tried an "Autistic Treatment" ("Silent, Deaf and No Eye-Contact") during a family dinner with his parents at Country Cookin and that doing so had "wrecked" the dinner. He had done so in a vain attempt to manipulate them into allowing him to proceed with his plan to go to MAGfest despite not having budgeted money for it.[8]
Crozet Pizza
A pizzeria located in Crozet, Virginia, a town 12 miles (19 km) west of Charlottesville. Anna McLerran had her 20th birthday party here in August 2005, which Chris attended and allegedly helped to plan.
El Agave
A Mexican restaurant chain with a location in Ruckersville where Chris and his parents have eaten.
In Jackie Chat 8, Chris mentions going to El Agave with his parents using his tugboat money.
In September 2013, Chris scraped a woman's car while backing up in the El Agave parking lot.[9][10]
The $500 gift card shows that Chris made four separate visits to El Agave between 19 September and 30 September 2015, spending a total of $39.88.[11]
Golden Corral
Golden Corral is an all-you-can-eat buffet chain, well-known in the American South and Midwest as the place to go for a maximum ratio of calories consumed to cash expended. Just don't think too much about where it all came from. During Chris's date with Emily, Bob mentions that he had a heart attack there while paying for the family's meal, but was caught by Barb before he fell to the floor.[12] Despite this, it was one of Chris's favorite places to eat, probably since he could stuff his face with fatty, low-quality food at a low price. However, the Charlottesville branch went out of business in 2010[13] and became a Chinese buffet.[14]
Caitlin, a waitress Chris had a crush on for a day or so, worked at Golden Corral.
In Mumble 2, he mentioned that it's one of his favorite places to eat.
Describing his ideal date spots in an IRC chat, Chris proposed Golden Corral as a second-date destination.
Chris's visits to the Corral with his family seem to be tightly scheduled. In a MySpace conversation from 4 September 2005, he noted that they'd be there from 3:30 to 4:45 the next day.
Perhaps because of that precise schedule, or perhaps because he was simply overwhelmed by stress, during his final Skype conversation with BlueSpike Chris unexpectedly abandoned the conversation to take off for the Corral.
Chris listed it as his favorite restaurant in his profile at The HooK Cafe.
In a May 2014 Facebook post, responding to news that a fire had destroyed the Chinese restaurant where the Golden Corral once stood, he angrily demanded that his favorite restaurant be rebuilt on the site.
IHOP
A restaurant chain best known for its pancakes and other breakfast foods. Chris's parents would go there for dinner every week during the classic Chris era to take advantage of the senior discount.[15] Chris was usually not brought along (ostensibly because it would disqualify them from the discount), but his parents would get takeout with their meal and bring it home to him afterwards. Chris was fond of their grilled chicken sandwiches.[16][17]
Chris discusses IHOP with Julie in BlueSpike PSN Chat 1.
Chris discusses IHOP with Kacey in Kacey Call 6. Kacey takes issue with the fact that Chris's parents go to a pancake house for sandwiches.
Chris mentions IHOP in Kacey Call 11.
Chris mentions IHOP in DayOut.
In Common Questions Chris mentions IHOP as one of the restaurants he goes to besides McDonald's or Burger King.
In Jackie Chat 8 Chris claims that he treated his parents to dinner at IHOP twice in one month using his tugboat money. Since Chris has previously said that his parents routinely go there without him and that it is cheaper for them to pay for the food using their senior discount, this claim is dubious.
In the Rebeckah Bentley E-mails Chris mentions going to IHOP on his 32nd birthday for the free ice cream dinner.
Isabella's Italian Trattoria Restaurant
An Italian restaurant in Lynchburg, VA. Chris and Flutter were spotted and photographed eating dinner there in December 2023 by Redditor JacksonStarship, who posted about it to r/ChrisChanSonichu. JacksonStarship claimed that Chris ate spaghetti like a toddler and that Flutter paid for the meal and kept Chris's behavior in check.[18]
Matt's Pub & Comedy Club
A pub in the Shockoe Slip district of Richmond, formerly Matt's British Pub and nicknamed "Matty's Pub", "Maddy's Pub" and "Manny's Pub" by Chris. Bob worked there as a sing-along leader in the late 1970s,[19] and it is here where he would later meet and fall in love with Barbara.[20] The pub closed in 2004.[21]
McDonald's
Main article: McDonald's
Chris's cheap-and-easy fast food of choice. When he wanted to cut down on his Big Mac and McNugget intake, he stopped eating there... more than twice a week or so.
Mission BBQ
An American barbeque restaurant chain based outside of Baltimore, with stores in 16 states, including the Richmond area.
Chris mentioned in a February 2024 stream that he went to Mission BBQ a few times during his stay at Gateway Homes in Chesterfield County.
O'Toole's
An Irish pub Chris briefly referenced in his KCWC broadcast from 1998, with two locations in Midlothian and Richmond.
Papa John's Pizza
A pizza chain with a location in Ruckersville. It was reported in August 2019 that Chris was banned from receiving deliveries from a location in Charlottesville, with trolls having regularly contacted the location to make bogus orders under Chris's name.[22]
The $500 gift card to Chris shows that he made a $12.46 purchase from Papa John's on 24 September 2015.[11]
Red Lobster
A seafood restaurant chain with a location in Lynchburg, VA. Chris and a woman, presumably Flutter, were spotted dining there in August 2025 by the mother of Twitter user lunarpatriot.[23]
Rylie's Diner
Rylie's Diner (misspelled as "Riley's Diner" by Chris) is a diner in Ruckersville where Bob and Barb once ate. Barb got in an argument with the "bitchy" owner for bringing a q-sand from McDonald's into the restaurant and continuing to eat it even when told by the owner to stop. Barb was told to leave, at which point she walked out to her car with her cup of tea from the restaurant in hand and filled up her own personal cup with it. Unsurprisingly, Chris took his mother's side in the quarrel.[24]
Sheetz
Chris at Sheetz, posing with a fan, Reddit user EdBoySenpai, in August 2020.
Sheetz is a hybrid gas station/mini-mart chain based in Pennsylvania, with stores in five other states (including Virginia) in the United States. Among the chain's selling points is an array of fast food options.
Chris ended Mumble 5 by saying he needed to duck out to Sheetz to get his mother a sandwich.
In the e-mail revealing the muscle bra, Chris mentioned that he'd sought a job application at Sheetz.
Chris bought gas at a Sheetz in Streetsboro, Ohio on his trip to Cleveland in February 2009.
Attempting to defend his dietary choices in one of the Kacey phone calls, Chris claimed that he enjoyed fruit smoothies from Sheetz (which can easily crack 600 calories apiece). Note he ordered no pickles
On 4 June 2011, Chris told Jackie that recently he was at Sheetz with his mother, where a man approached Chris and asked him if he were a homosexual. Chris replied that he was a Tomgirl.[25]
On 2 September 2013, Chris wrote on Facebook that a couple of weeks earlier (presumably at August) he met Michael Snyder in Ruckersville at Sheetz and at McDonald's in the same morning. During the Sheetz encounter Snyder gave Chris the finger, while at the McDonald's encounter Snyder told Chris that he won't hurt him.[26]
On 15 June 2014, Chris gave Sheetz a five-star review on Facebook.
On 29 July 2018, Chris, driving his mother's Dodge Caravan back home from BronyCon, found that the car had broken down while at a Sheetz gas station in Bealeton, VA. He recorded Waiting for the tow truck.
On 22 August 2020, Reddit user EdBoySenpai met Chris at Sheetz and snapped a photo with him, posting it to Reddit two years later.[27]
On 9 September 2023, Discord user DooDoo fard2874 harassed Chris, following him by car and shouting at him. Both pulled into a Sheetz parking lot during the fiasco, then Chris drove away.[28]
On 11 March 2024, Chris was spotted shopping at a Sheetz in Lynchburg, VA.[29]
On 25 September 2025, Chris was spotted shopping at a Sheetz. He politely declined taking a photo with the Reddit user who saw him, and instead gave the Redditor a fist bump.[30]
Sonic
Sonic Drive-In is a fast food drive-in chain which coincidentally has the same name as our autistic hero's favorite video game franchise. It has no locations in Chris's area, so he is not a regular patron. During his Ohio trip, however, Chris visited a Sonic location in Streetsboro, Ohio, perhaps intrigued by the restaurant's name. He ordered a hamburger with mayonnaise and no pickles and a lemonberry slushie "made from real fruit."[31]
Starbucks
Starbucks is a very popular Seattle-based coffee chain which Chris has used as a place for dates and meetings with strangers as well as to satisfy his craving for sugary drinks. There is a Starbucks café near Charlottesville Fashion Square, and there used to be a Starbucks kiosk inside the mall as well. Chris has patronized both locations.
The CWCville Shopping Center includes a Starbucks on the first floor.
Hanna worked at the Starbucks kiosk at Charlottesville Fashion Square. Her "date" with Chris involved getting drinks from the kiosk.
Chris went to the Starbucks kiosk with Kacey and Kim sometime in 2009.[32]
In the Jackie E-mails Chris repeatedly tries to set up a date with Jackie at the Starbucks café throughout summer 2010.
Chris arranged to meet Tito and Clyde's agent at the Starbucks kiosk on 31 August 2010 to receive his reward for destroying his PS3. He waited around there for over an hour but nobody turned up.[33]
In two Facebook posts from April 2017 Chris praises Starbucks's Unicorn Frappuccino.
Toffee and Punchy's first date takes place at the CWCville Shopping Center Starbucks.[34].
Subway
Subway is the world's largest fast-food chain, selling cheap and mediocre submarine sandwiches. There are several Subway locations in the Charlottesville area, including one in Ruckersville.
In the Sarah May Skype Logs, Chris mentions a Subway located in a Walmart in Streetsboro, Ohio.
Chris mentions the Forest Lakes Subway in DayOut5.
"Foglechu", named for former Subway mascot and convicted pedofork Jared Fogle, was one of The 69 Destined Sonichus and Rosechus.
Chris says that he likes Subway in Jail Call - 1 November 2021.
Taco Bell
A "Mexican-inspired" fast-food chain with a location in Ruckersville.
The $500 gift card to Chris shows that he purchased $5.47 worth of food from Taco Bell on 26 September 2015.[11]
While coming home from the post office, Chris stops at Taco Bell for "a little edibles, a little filling, a little good stuff".[35]
TGI Fridays
TGI Fridays is a casual dining chain where Chris used to hang out with his friend Joshua Martinez. Chris usually paid for both of their meals. On one occasion Chris had no money for food, so Josh paid for his own meal and ate while Chris looked on in envy.[36]
As of 2013 Chris would still go to TGI Fridays on occasion, even though he and Josh had long ceased to be friends. He claimed in an email to Kim that it was the only bar-like establishment which he still patronized at the time, although he did not make it clear whether he came there to drink or merely to eat.[37]
The chain's Charlottesville location, probably the one which Chris frequented, has since closed.
Tropical Smoothie Cafe
Tropical Smoothie Cafe is a restaurant franchise in the entire United States. Chris has mentioned it on at least two occasions, talking about its wraps, smoothies, and flatbread sandwiches with chips, etc. Chris said his friend Joshua Martinez introduced him to Tropical Cafe.[38][39]
The franchise has at least two locations in Charlottesville.
Twisted Branch Tea Bazaar
A restaurant specializing in tea and vegetarian meals, located in the Charlottesville, VA downtown mall.
LoveYouLongTime, whose friend wanted to meet with Chris, set up a group meeting here circa 2018. She told the story of the meeting on Kiwi Farms two years later, mentioning Chris's bizarre fashion, him introducing Magi-Chan and Mewtwo as his spouses while indicating at empty chairs, attempting to show off his electric powers, and dumping his bag of magic stones on the table to ramble about each of them for over half an hour.[40]
Wood Grill Buffet
A buffet chain with a location in Charlottesville. Despite being a buffet restaurant, Chris seems to think of the place as a high-quality eatery.
In an email to one of LoveYouLongTime's personas from November 2009, Chris mentions that his parents stopped at Wood Grill Buffet to buy dressing.[41]
In a Facebook post from January 2014, Chris asks for gift cards for restaurants such as Wood Grill Buffet, iHop, McDonald's and Burger King. He then disparages the latter two restaurants, claiming that they are "last choices" and that he prefers "good food".[42]
In an October 2019 chat in The Place Discord server, Chris mentions he and Barb went to Wood Grill Buffet for lunch on her birthday.[43]
