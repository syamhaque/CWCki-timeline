Chris, dispensing excellent advice as always.
The first IRC fan chat with Chris, from 16 October 2008. The chat covers a large variety of topics, giving trolls insight into Chris's life for the first time.
The most notable part of this chat is probably Chris's somewhat heartless thoughts on how Rocketfox should cope with the loss of his father. Chris also takes a few moments to discuss the 2008 US presidential election, basically revealing he has no idea what the issues are, and that talking about politics is just another source of stress. Chris also gives some monumentally stupid advice to Vivian Gee, who is apparently struggling with her sexual identity.

[01:53] * PandaHalo sets mode: +v Robotnik
[01:53] <+Robotnik> You mentioned in the last chat, you had grown past a phase involving the curseyehame and jelousy.
[01:53] <@ChrisChanSonichu> yes
[01:53] * Guest (~Guest@Rizon-815543FC.hsd1.fl.comcast.net) has joined #sonichu
[01:53] <+Robotnik> Is Wes still in the comic for other reasons?
[01:54] * Guest_ (~Guest@Rizon-33D7253B.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) has joined #sonichu
[01:54] * PandaHalo sets mode: -m
[01:54] * Guest (~Guest@Rizon-815543FC.hsd1.fl.comcast.net) Quit
[01:54] <@ChrisChanSonichu> at this, only the fact that he has turned villian, since the loss of Sarah Hammer as his sweetheart.
[01:54] * Guest_ is now known as Konata
[01:54] <Evangs> Someone wanted me to ask if Patti would show up in any new comics, Chris.
[01:54] * Konata is now known as DarkKonata
[01:55] <@ChrisChanSonichu> yes, Patti will.
[01:55] * jimmyhill was kicked by PandaHalo (jimmyhill)
[01:55] <GarthCrooks> I didn't realise you were a Monty Python fan Chris. what other comedies do you like?
[01:55] <@ChrisChanSonichu> there was a question about Sonichu and Rosechu Types?
[01:55] <RocketFox> I have a question about the hedgehog element types if you have time
[01:55] <RocketFox> yes
[01:55] <Solarius> what does sonichu and rosechu evolve from or into?
[01:55] <@ChrisChanSonichu> I like a LOT of comedies.
[01:55] <RocketFox> sonee and rosee = babies
[01:55] <@ChrisChanSonichu> for the ORIGINAL Sonichu and Rosechu, at least, Sonee & Rosee for babies (Eletric).
[01:56] <Evangs> Sonichu was originally a Pikachu and Rosechu a Raichu, I thought. But I wouldn't know as well at the big man himself.
[01:56] <@ChrisChanSonichu> Metonic evolution with Sonichu + Metal Coat and Trade (Electric/Steel)
[01:56] <RocketFox> Are there going to be any ice, rock, or steel Sonichu or Rosechu? [Or is the plural Sonichu and Rosechus?]
[01:56] <RocketFox> well what do you know
[01:56] <@ChrisChanSonichu> Vamprosa evolution with Rosechu + HIGH FRIENDSHIP, level up during the midnight hour.
[01:56] <@ChrisChanSonichu> maybe; give me time to create as I draw.
[01:57] <GenesisRosechu> Why are Sonichu and Rosechu the only ones without defining names, like Angelica Rosechu? and if they are the same species, how come they are all so very different?
[01:57] <Solarius> will Knuckles or tails make a cameo?
[01:57] <Evangs> Will we see Metonic or Vamprosa ever, or is it only factual information that won't be used?
[01:57] <GarthCrooks> Vamprosa sounds cool :)
[01:57] <@ChrisChanSonichu> Sonichu and Rosechu are the FIRST of Many Sonichus and Rosechus, so I added names to define everyone else from the original.
[01:57] <@ChrisChanSonichu> Vamprosa is Dark/Electric.
[01:57] <RocketFox> awesome
[01:58] <SonichuGal> I have a question. What is the significance of your Black Sonichu medallion? In other words, why did you make a medallion of Black Sonichu and what is the significance of it?
[01:58] <RocketFox> vamprosa sounds gothic
[01:58] <@ChrisChanSonichu> Metonic and Vamprosa made a brief appearance in a comic strip in Comic #0, with a short joke.
[01:58] <Chrischu> JIMMY HILL IS THE REAL CREATOR OF SONICHU, DON'T ACCEPT IMITATIONS
[01:58] * Chrischu was kicked by Physaris (Caps abuse - 100%)
[01:58] <superawesome> lol
[01:58] <RocketFox> owned!!
[01:58] <@ChrisChanSonichu> Kick Chrischu OUT
[01:58] <Evangs> What a loser.
[01:58] <GarthCrooks> haha, troll owned
[01:58] <Solarius> lol
[01:58] <@falsion> Continue please.
[01:58] <Evangs> He has been kicked.
[01:58] <superawesome> What an idiot.
[01:58] <GenesisRosechu> Well Chris, it's been nice seeing you again. But I do have to go!
[01:58] <jurishiku> Where is Rosechu's friend from the begining?
[01:58] <@ChrisChanSonichu> take care.
[01:58] <+Robotnik> I'm glad that was taken care of swiftly.
[01:58] <GenesisRosechu> I hope to talk to you on a regular basis again soemday :3
[01:59] <@ChrisChanSonichu> Rosechu's friend?
[01:59] <RocketFox> Kel
[01:59] <MachPunch> Kel, the trainer from #0.
[01:59] <RocketFox> I think he was talking about Kel
[01:59] <jurishiku> Yeah
[01:59] * GenesisRosechu (~Guest@Rizon-EA96D36D.hsd1.sc.comcast.net) Quit
[01:59] <Evangs> Also, one I'd like to suggest an idea--what if Naitsirhc had his own, evil version of CWCville, RNNville? (Reldnahc Notsew Naitsirhc)?
[01:59] <Knuckles> Do Sonichu and Rosechu reproduce asexually?
[01:59] <Evangs> I'd like to know about Kel too.
[01:59] <RocketFox> oh that'd be awesome, it could be underground
[01:59] <@ChrisChanSonichu> oh, she's been living at the college, until she decided to venture on to better her Pokemon Trainer Skills.

[02:04] <@ChrisChanSonichu> just for the Dark Half that is my Opposite.
[02:04] <+knuckip> when will the next comic come out?
[02:04] <+Evangs> Oh man, so many questions I'd love to ask...but everyone else has plenty, so I gotta go.
[02:04] <@PandaHalo> Naitsirch?
[02:04] <@ChrisChanSonichu> yes
[02:04] <+RocketFox> Chris, if another question is alright: Is Bill the scientist the same Bill from Pokemon, or a totally different dude? ^^; Will he come back? xP
[02:04] <+Evangs> Good luck answering all the questions, Christian!
[02:05] * PandaHalo sets mode: +o Solarius
[02:05] <+Evangs> Oh man, Bill the scientist is my favorite character.
[02:05] * PandaHalo sets mode: +v Solarius
[02:05] * PandaHalo sets mode: -o Solarius
[02:05] <+RocketFox> He's such a dork and I love him xD;;;
[02:05] <+Solarius> what do you think of the pokémon Mudkip?
[02:05] <@PandaHalo> Do you like shorts? I heard that they are comfy and easy to wear.
[02:05] <@ChrisChanSonichu> I don't remember the Bill you're talking about, but Bill the PokeScientist is a Bill I'd talk about a lot in the Sonichu World, if I do.
[02:05] <@falsion> That one's a personal favorite of mine. I love mudkips.
[02:05] <@ChrisChanSonichu> Mudkip is okay.
[02:05] <+Solarius> :(
[02:05] <@falsion> A lot of people here like mudkip too
[02:06] <+Evangs> Bill is the lighthouse guy in Cerulean City, Chris-chan.
[02:06] <+RocketFox> Bill in Pokemon games, the guy who makes your storage box
[02:06] <+Evangs> Which is your favorite Pokemon besides your electric-hedgehog children?
[02:06] <@ChrisChanSonichu> Shorts are okay, but I don't like to show off my hairy legs.
[02:06] <+SonichuGal> Bill the Pokemaniac, you mean?
[02:06] <+RocketFox> yep
[02:06] <@ChrisChanSonichu> Pikachu, Scyther and Sneasel.
[02:06] * PandaHalo sets mode: +v GarthCrooks
[02:06] <@ChrisChanSonichu> are my TOP 3
[02:06] <@ChrisChanSonichu> no particular order.
[02:06] <+Robotnik> Have you pursued legal action against Jimmy Hill?
[02:06] <+RocketFox> Bill is a very common name xP (was my dad's name, rest in peace) so I can understand if they're two different guys
[02:06] * Guest_ (~Guest@Rizon-CE589056.nycmny.fios.verizon.net) has joined #sonichu
[02:06] <+Solarius> could we perhaps see more Mudkips in future installments of you comics?
[02:07] <@ChrisChanSonichu> I have, and Cassandra, who is in on the chat is helping me resolve that.
[02:07] <+Evangs> And ONE last thing for real now: Will any other Pokemon from the games show up? I always liked how you tied the Pokemon world into Sonichu in the stories of the Chaotic Combo members.
[02:07] <+GarthCrooks> Chris, will you be getting legal advice about Jimmy Hill's crimes or do you hope for a peaceful settlement?
[02:07] <+knuckip> do you have an email where i can send you my fan pictures?
[02:07] <@ChrisChanSonichu> IDK about mudkips in my comics, but I'll see what comes up.
[02:07] <@falsion> Everyone, one at a time.
[02:07] <@ChrisChanSonichu> ChrisChanSonichu@aol.com
[02:07] <+Evangs> Not specifically mudkips. I'd love to see Sonichu fight Regigigas.
[02:07] <@ChrisChanSonichu> Dragonite made an appearance.
[02:07] <+RocketFox> oh, David?
[02:07] * Guest_ (~Guest@Rizon-CE589056.nycmny.fios.verizon.net) Quit
[02:08] <@ChrisChanSonichu> yes, Kel's Dragonite, David.
[02:08] <@PandaHalo> If you are Sonichu's trainer, why doesn't Sonichu live in his Pokeball? Is he like pikachu from the original animated series in that regard?
[02:08] * Guest_ (~Guest@Rizon-CE589056.nycmny.fios.verizon.net) has joined #sonichu
[02:08] <+Evangs> I didn't think Sonichu had a trainer. Anyway, I'm going for real now. See you all in a bit
[02:08] <@ChrisChanSonichu> yes.
[02:08] * Evangs is now known as Evangs|Away
[02:08] <+Solarius> does Sonichu marry Rosechu in the near future?
[02:08] * avathecat (~Guest@Rizon-E60F540E.home3.cgocable.net) Quit
[02:08] <+RocketFox> bye Evan
[02:08] <@PandaHalo> If Robert Simmons the first male friend you have had?
[02:08] <+SonichuGal> I have the same question, Solarius.
[02:08] <@ChrisChanSonichu> I think he will.
[02:09] <+SonichuGal> What about Sonichu and Rosechu having children?
[02:09] <+RocketFox> That'd be an awesome ending IMO
[02:09] * Guest (~Guest@Rizon-FC5108B4.eriepa.dsl-w.verizon.net) Quit

[02:09] <@ChrisChanSonichu> NO, I have a few male acquaintences.
[02:09] <+concreteman> CWC, I am playing Mega Man 9. Did you download MM9 yet and if so, did you download it for your PS3 and your Wii? (The hexbox360 shouldn't have this game but it does grr)
[02:09] <@ChrisChanSonichu> eventually.
[02:09] <+Solarius> think? so there is a chance he won't
[02:09] <@ChrisChanSonichu> yes, MEGA MAN 9, PS3
[02:09] <@ChrisChanSonichu> with BOTH ADD-ONS.

[02:10] <@vivitheg> And Issue 9?
[02:10] <+Solarius> what do you think of the news that MGS4 is coming to Xbox360?
[02:10] <+GarthCrooks> chris, as a nintendo fan and a sonic fan, how excited were you to see sonic and mario team up in games?
[02:11] <+SonichuGal> I was wondering the same thing, vivitheg.
[02:11] <@ChrisChanSonichu> November at the latest for 8; IDK about 9 or 10 at the moment.
[02:11] <@ChrisChanSonichu> I'll post any updates I see fit on Sonichu.net, the Official Blog Page, YouTube Video, or in this chat window.
[02:11] <@falsion> Sounds good.

[02:13] <+Solarius> is Sonichu a creationist?

[02:18] <+SonichuGal> I think the real question is whether Chris is a Pepsi or Coke man.
[02:18] <@vivitheg> Will you ever do audio dramas with Sonichu? Many animes have audio dramas. I think Sonichu should have some too.
[02:18] <@ChrisChanSonichu> Goodwill.
[02:18] <@ChrisChanSonichu> CWC Cola (Pepsi-Based.
[02:18] <+Parakarry> cool

[02:19] <+Knuckles> So how's it going with Blanca, Chris?
[02:19] <@falsion> running old games on your computer
[02:19] <@ChrisChanSonichu> I did think about the TRUE Audio Videos for YouTube done by me and my Sweetheart.
[02:19] <+Robotnik> Yeah, that's what I meant. Sorry if I wasn't specific.
[02:20] <+EXKeine> Hey Chris-kun, will you ever do special holiday comics, like for Christmas or Halloween?
[02:20] <@ChrisChanSonichu> things are okay between me and Blanca, thank you.
[02:20] <@ChrisChanSonichu> maybe, but not at the moment.
[02:20] <+concreteman> That'd be the best, CWC. I'd love to hear your dramatic readings, honestly.
[02:20] <+concreteman> No offence, Vivi.
[02:20] <+RocketFox> Blanca is a pretty name :3 she sounds pretty

[02:20] <@vivitheg> But will you write new stories involving Sonichu? You wouldn't have to draw and maybe give us more Sonichu adventures?
[02:21] <@ChrisChanSonichu> Comic 9 Spoiler: Episode 19 involves Wild and Punchy attending a Dating Education Class at Cwcville Community College; Wild meets and falls for Simonla.

[02:21] <@ChrisChanSonichu> and Episode 20 is the EPIC BATTLE Between MOST of the Electric-Hedgehogs and ALL THE INTRODUCED VILLIANS SO FAR.

[02:32] <+Evang-y> Seriously though, have you ever watched Gurren Lagann? I think you'd like it a lot as Simon is all about drilling a straight path for the future of society and staying straight himself

[02:42] <@ChrisChanSonichu> I have enjoyed the works of R.L. Stein.
[02:42] <@vivitheg> Would that still be okay?
[02:42] <+concreteman> CWC, what did you think of the classic NICKELODEON show, "Are You Afraid Of The Dark"?
[02:42] <@ChrisChanSonichu> is it, and I AM ONLY USING THE WORD TO ANSWER VIVI'S QUESTION, Lesbian?
[02:42] <@vivitheg> Yes. Yes it is.
[02:42] <@ChrisChanSonichu> I liked it.
[02:43] <@falsion> Chris. I just wanted to ask this, back to your comics..
[02:43] <@falsion> Chris, do you feel that your stories have taken a more adult tone over the years, and why has it changed so much in that regard?
[02:43] <@ChrisChanSonichu> I grew up more, mentally, so it does get reflected now and the.
[02:43] <@ChrisChanSonichu> then
[02:43] <+Robotnik> Did you like The Dark Knight?
[02:43] <+SonichuGal> Christian, do you plan on attending any more anime conventions in the future? If so, do you plan on getting a table for Sonichu? I know I would totally go to a con if you were there.
[02:43] <@ChrisChanSonichu> did not see that.
[02:43] <@ChrisChanSonichu> maybe.
[02:43] <+SonichuGal> I'd cosplay as Rosechu if that was the case.
[02:44] <@PandaHalo> Have you ever been outside of Virginia?
[02:44] <@falsion> Okay, I just was wondering. Because it seems like you let other people get to you too much, and it seems to reflect in the comics.
[02:44] <+GarthCrooks> that's a good idea SonichuGal
[02:44] <@falsion> Before the bullies found you, the comics were a lot more innocent in a way
[02:44] <@vivitheg> Alright, my boyfriend finished and he's going to head back home now. He says he'll try to think of something for next time.
[02:44] <@ChrisChanSonichu> Vivi, you may watch Lesbian video, but wait for him to return to you, so he can watch it with you; he can get ideas on how to turn you on from them.

[02:46] <@falsion> Chris, all I'm saying is I hope you don't let the bullies get to you too much. It seems like you've been pressured to draw sexual imagery in response to the bullies as protest. But I feel as though that your earlier comics were the best.
[02:46] <@falsion> But I still enjoy your latest works
[02:46] <@falsion> however your stress does show
[02:46] <@ChrisChanSonichu> I try to stay away from stress as much as possible.

[02:46] <+SonichuGal> Good for you, Chris!
[02:46] <+knuckip> how do you releive stress?

[02:47] <+Evang-y> Keep plugging away, Chris. You're our hero.
[02:47] <+GarthCrooks> i liked in the new preview that the anti-Jimmy Hill bit was quite humourous rather than just angry :)
[02:47] <+SonichuGal> Thanks for reminding me Chris.
[02:47] <+SonichuGal> I <3 South Park.
[02:47] <+Evang-y> Oh, I'm watching it too. See you, Chris-chan
[02:47] <@falsion> As soon as you take care of them in the comic, I hope things go back to the basics, like the earlier comics

* PandaHalo sets mode: -v SALVIAAAAA
<@ChrisChanSonichu> well, don't sweat it; all you can do is try to start a general conversation with the woman.

<@ChrisChanSonichu> A Super Sonic crashes onto Pikachu's head; Pikachu disappears, a rainbow with the unconsious Pikachu turned Sonichu on the beginning of it drops, and at the other end of the rainbow is the Raichu, that disappears to reveal Rosechu.
<@falsion> i mean apart from phone or text

<@ChrisChanSonichu> and, RocketFox, I'm not sure.

[20:08] <+ElectroZap> I think then, Chris, you should reassess your beliefs, because I don't think you know why it is wrong, only other people have told you. Please consider what i've said.

[20:09] <@falsion> where were we?
[20:10] <@Physaris> CWC, you don't seem to like the Xbox 360, care to elaborate a reason?
[20:10] <@ChrisChanSonichu> I just do not like XBox
[20:10] <@falsion> No specific reason? Lack of games, something like that?
[20:11] <+MayorMcCheez> you like the wii, though, right?
[20:11] <@ChrisChanSonichu> yes
[20:11] <@Physaris> I used to not like the Xbox til I got a 360
[20:11] <+MayorMcCheez> why did you get one if you didn't like it?
[20:11] <@Physaris> I love my 360
[20:11] <+RocketFox> My brother has one D:
[20:11] <@Physaris> My ex bought me mine
[20:11] <@Physaris> :D
[20:12] <+MayorMcCheez> I really want to get a PS3 so I can play your level, chris, but I don't have the money right now

[20:12] <+RocketFox> did you see the video of the guys smashing the hexbox?
[20:12] <@ChrisChanSonichu> save up; it is well worth it
[20:12] <@ChrisChanSonichu> no
[20:12] <@falsion> Chris, is it possible for people to illegally download Little Big Planet to the Wii or Xbox? I thought that was impossible.
[20:13] <@Physaris> Do you own Rock Band?
[20:13] <+RocketFox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFcz0FmGiLc guys smashing the xbox360, you should bookmark it for later
[20:13] <@ChrisChanSonichu> it is possible, falsion, and It Is Wrong. I have PS3 Rock Band.
[20:13] <@falsion> Chris, Parakarry wants to know if you have played the game "Spore" for PC?
[20:14] <@ChrisChanSonichu> I'll watch it later
[20:14] <@ChrisChanSonichu> no
[20:14] <@falsion> Hmm... but PS3 uses cell specific machine code. It wouldn't run on the Wii or 360
[20:14] <@falsion> strange...
[20:15] <@falsion> anyway, any other questions?
[20:15] <@falsion> anyone?
[20:15] <@ChrisChanSonichu> yes, any more questions?
[20:15] <@falsion> "Knuckles" wants to know why you haven't had a job in such a long time and what's been keeping you from having one?
[20:16] <@falsion> Parakarry asks what's your favorite game genre
[20:16] <@ChrisChanSonichu> hardly anyone's hiring right now.
[20:16] <@ChrisChanSonichu> and I get by from what I get from my autism.
[20:17] <@falsion> Chris, I'm getting a lot of questions asking why you don't accept friend requests on PSN
[20:17] <+MayorMcCheez> Chris I am working on a Sonichu fan game
[20:17] <@ChrisChanSonichu> adventure or puzzle
[20:17] <+MayorMcCheez> adventure
[20:17] <+MayorMcCheez> I'm using a program called ZZT for the base version
[20:17] <@ChrisChanSonichu> good; send me a copy or link so I can play the finished version.
[20:17] <+MayorMcCheez> ok, I'm just starting to write it right now

[20:22] <@falsion> like a chat like this
[20:22] <@falsion> but with webcams
[20:22] <@ChrisChanSonichu> I do not.
[20:23] <@vivitheg> Refer questions to me, I'll screen and ask them.
[20:23] <@vivitheg> And now I expect to be flooded with requests. So many CWC fans!
[20:23] <@falsion> I'll try to help too, but I'm not very good at this.
[20:23] <@vivitheg> What do you think of the 3d animations on Youtube Chris?
[20:24] <@ChrisChanSonichu> they are excellent, but I have talked to the animator on correcting Sonichu's lines.
[20:24] <@vivitheg> Do you play the Earthbound or Mother series?
[20:24] <@ChrisChanSonichu> no
[20:24] * PandaBRB is now known as PandaHalo

[20:24] <@vivitheg> Do you have a friend code for the new Pokemon DS games?
[20:25] <@ChrisChanSonichu> I'm looking forward to that, as well as Sonic Unleashed.
[20:25] <@ChrisChanSonichu> yes.
[20:25] <@ChrisChanSonichu> diamond/pearl
[20:25] <@vivitheg> Some people would like to trade with you Chris
[20:25] <@vivitheg> Or battle
[20:25] <@falsion> ChrisChanSonichu, do you play Smash Bros. Brawl? If so, do you have a friend code for that as well?
[20:25] <@PandaHalo> I have a shiny pikachu and a shiny mudkip if you want them chris :)
[20:25] <@ChrisChanSonichu> well, I'm not on my DS as much as I used to be. yes and yes.
[20:26] <+MayorMcCheez> who are your favorite brawl characters?
[20:26] <@ChrisChanSonichu> well, Cassandra, I'll consider trading with you for one or the other later.
[20:26] <@ChrisChanSonichu> Sonic and Link
[20:26] <@falsion> Do you like the Zelda games?
[20:26] <@ChrisChanSonichu> yes
[20:26] <@falsion> Which one is your favorite?
[20:26] <+MayorMcCheez> Cool, Link is my favorite too!
[20:26] <@ChrisChanSonichu> I guess Ocarina of Time
[20:27] <@falsion> good choice. i agree
[20:27] <+SonichuGal> I remember waiting 2 hours in line when Orcania of Time came out.
[20:27] <@vivitheg> A concerned gay fan would like to know despite you wanting them to stay on the straight path, do you support to killings of gay and lesbian members of society?
[20:27] <+RocketFox> when did it come out? I'm only 11 :<
[20:27] <@falsion> Like they do in mid eastern countries
[20:27] <@ChrisChanSonichu> killing is wrong.
[20:28] <@ChrisChanSonichu> Ocarina of Time came out on N64 YEARS AGO.
[20:28] * +Bluecheese (~bloocheez@Rizon-CBC2A9B6.dyn.embarqhsd.net) Quit
[20:28] <+MayorMcCheez> have you ever played this fanmade sonic game? http://www.srb2.org/
[20:28] <@vivitheg> Chris, have you watched Captain N?
[20:28] <@falsion> What is your opinion on war though? Is it never justified, or is it justified in case of self defense?
[20:28] <@falsion> Since killing is indeed wrong...
[20:28] <@ChrisChanSonichu> no, yes, I do not care for war.
[20:29] <+SonichuGal> I think Orcania of Time came out like 10 years ago.
[20:29] <+SonichuGal> Yeah, November 1998.
[20:29] <@ChrisChanSonichu> that sounds right.
[20:29] * Medic (~Guest@Rizon-48276116.char.east.verizon.net) Quit (Quit: Medic)
[20:29] <+RocketFox> omg I was 1 when it was out D: anyway speaking of youngness
[20:29] <+RocketFox> will there be more Sonee's and Rosee's?
[20:29] <@falsion> Chris, have you ever played any FPS (first person shooter games) and if so, which is your favorite?
[20:29] <+MayorMcCheez> 1 That makes me feel old
[20:29] <@ChrisChanSonichu> I have the re-released version of Ocarina of Time on Gamecube.
[20:29] <+SonichuGal> OMG me too!
[20:29] <@ChrisChanSonichu> maybe, yes, Metroid Prime Hunters.
[20:30] <@vivitheg> Chris, what would you do if a gay fan was coming on too strongly to you?
[20:30] <+MayorMcCheez> how much weight can you benchpress?
[20:30] <@ChrisChanSonichu> I don't know.
[20:30] <@ChrisChanSonichu> but I am strong.
[20:30] <@ChrisChanSonichu> I've never benchpressed.
[20:31] <+MayorMcCheez> oh ok
[20:31] <@ChrisChanSonichu> I have lifted weights and trained myself at the YMCA while I was living in Chesterfield County.
[20:31] <@ChrisChanSonichu> I'll take ONE MORE QUESTION.
[20:31] <@ChrisChanSonichu> then I want to go rest my head for a short while.
[20:32] <@vivitheg> Why do you still hate Mary Lee Walsh (a former member of PVCC)
[20:32] <@ChrisChanSonichu> former? what happened to her?
[20:32] <@vivitheg> They will not reply.
[20:32] <@vivitheg> I assume something terrible had happened to them.
[20:33] <@ChrisChanSonichu> anyway, because she got in my way and thwarted my earliest attemts in my Sweetheart Search, and she made it plainly obvious that Virgina is for Virgins; Not Lovers.
[20:34] <@falsion> Chris, just one thing I would like to know. I was just wondering what it means when someone has been loitering? I mean, a bunch of security guards kicked me out of the mall and said I was loitering. I assume the same thing has happened to you, I was just wonder what the heck is loitering?
[20:34] <@vivitheg> I should copy and paste directly, they wanted to know why STILL
[20:34] <@vivitheg> after many years had gone by
[20:34] <@ChrisChanSonichu> well, frankly, I just never got along with that old bat.
[20:35] <@ChrisChanSonichu> in the first place.
[20:35] <@vivitheg> Well, according to google. She seems to be nice.
[20:35] <@vivitheg> I mean she wrote a book apparently.
[20:35] <@ChrisChanSonichu> that's ONE opinion.
[20:35] <@ChrisChanSonichu> anyway, it's been fun; I'll join the chatroom again next time.
[20:35] <@ChrisChanSonichu> until then, take care and stay safe, and thank y'all for your support.
[20:35] <@falsion> alright, later then
