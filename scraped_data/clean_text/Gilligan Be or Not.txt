[Chris appears, humming a fanfare of some sort before proceeding to sing]
Parumpumpum. I ask to be or not to be, A rogue or peasant slave is what you see. A boy who loves his mother’s knee, and so I ask to be or not to be. So here’s my plea, I beg of thee, and say you see a little hope for me. To fight or flee, to fight or flee, I ask myself to be or not to be. I ask to be or not to be, that is the question that I ask of me. Ask you can see, as you can see, that is the question that I ask of me. I am curious, where I should be, (and what is our community?) To fight or flee, to fight or flee? I ask myself to be or nooooot to be? Parumpumpuuuum.
