Very First Media Share Suggestion Live Stream
"I support Israel! Palestine[...] they have more... demons and devils within them"
Chris intended for this stream to allow viewers to share various media clips with him.
However, he was plagued with technical issues ranging from being unable to play the clips, to having the audio cut out on him, and after failing to get it to work for about 15 minutes, he gave up and switched to the regular Q&A format.
About halfway through the stream he was finally able to get the clips to work, although the audio only played for him, not the viewers.

02:12: [Stream begins]
21:58 Chris stands up to take down the canvas behind him.
26:44: Chris unleashes a behemoth burp. Chris: "Mhm, pardon me."
28:09: Chris: "Oh, I actually- you know what, I answer the que- I will answer this one question that's not a Superchat, but I just saw it in the side-stream here, but- yeah. [Dramatic pause] I SUPPORT ISRAEL! Palestine's there... or they have more... demons and devils within them- they have lots more doubt within them as opposed to Israel. So... there you go. [Snaps fingers and sings an aria] [Claps hands]
28:23: User "Jenny Reads" donates and says: "you hurt snorlax. how do you sleep at night?". Chris: "I don't know what you're talking about, all my Snorlaxes have been kept in their Pokeballs within the Pokemon home-storage... and within my games and whatsoever- at least the... ALL the numbers of boxes I have... on the C-197 half of the Earth." [Trademark Hm]
29:10: User "Azearia" donates and says: "do your dimensional powers change your hair color". Chris: "In a way... yes. Yes, they do."
35:28: User "Moosequester" donates and says: "Christine what do you have to say about the Israel Defence Force blowing up a few of the oldest Christian churches in Israel?". Chris: "Hm, yeah... okay, that's not... great."
38:06: User "tealichu" donates and says: "chris do you have a discord that True and Good hearted fans can join :33". Chris: "Um, we're gonna- that's- uhh... not at the present moment, but we may end up bringing that back up as soon as possible."
38:20 Chris brings his hands to his temple, clearly distressed about something. Chris: "I- I'M GOING TO SAY THIS RIGHT NOW, SO... I... have a Discord... I still do, but... I don't use it as much. There, I said it."
39:52 Chris changes his background and rants whilst muted until switching back to his original background and regaining sound at 40:38.
41:03 Chris adds the widget to his stream to show his media submissions. It cannot be heard by the audience.
41:40 Chris and his audience learn that his very first media submission is the first episode of Ongezellig, which opens with the lead character getting caught watching soft-core hentai.
42:00 The second video shared with Chris via media share is a "Skibidi Toilet" meme with a spinning Black Sun symbol used by neo-Nazis. Chris is aware of Skibidi Toilet, but not the symbol.
42:14 Chris changes scenes and is once again muted for 5 seconds till he changes back.
44:06 Chris drinks a can of regular Coke with one pinky raised, eyes closed and loud, powerful slurps.
46:43 User "TedKaczynski" donates saying: "Hey CWC! Hugh fan!!!!! Can you shout out my bestest friend ever Nick Gerlips?". Chris very nearly falls for it, saying the first name and stopping just in time.
57:45 User "TwentyRex" donates saying: "Christine!! what conventions do you think you will be going to this year?" Chris: "I told you, I'm taking a break from conventions. I will not be going to any more conventions for a long long long time. Period.... Anyway..."
58:07 User "BrassBus" donates saying: "Jesus. I need your help. Please. Can you tell me who will win the SuperBowl. The Chiefs or the 49ers? I bet my life savings. I need this. Please Lord. SmokeyMcC wont help me at all." Chris proceeds to tell them to put their money on the Miners.
1:04:28 Chris says that the Israel Palestine conflict will affect the dimensional merge.
1:04:37 Chris sings: "One way or another, I'm gonna' find ya... and you will not take any pictures, CAUSE I'LL" [Imitates smashing someone's camera]
1:12:55 Stream ends.

place just the only one real bad thing I will mention they strap you to a chair if you're really at bad if you really
were like possessed or really outright just do anything they bad they will do that which I have not done anything of
the sort I was blessed to not have to suffer any of that I mean but just an empathy I mean
can you imagine this having your restrain of your legs restrain of your just restrain that's no

the sort whatsoever um oh yeah of course I do

events NOP you know what the one that is the Ian that would be Barbara and Weston
Chandler because she had the IB a Weston license plate that's where that stupid
thing came from there is no such there is no Ian there never ever was the they only one that came about this is because

looking to be spiritually healed and everything making further progress getting out of the slums getting out of
the H bad vibes and whatever as long as they know what their attentions
are pardon me
yeah
anyway yeah anyway uh I'm bet just weird off
track oh I mean that's what you get I mean when one it when one is really good
it pyic Powers genuinely authentic and all that
just you're very sensitive to things oh boy we got a few Super Chat
comments coming in I am looking forward to spawning oh oh
positive affirmations meditations maybe cut the habits of those bad things I mean you take the first step in
acknowledging that they were bad for you maybe go like a supportive support
group to help you get out of that habit but anyway you are blessed and you
will be blessed as long as you keep on the light power path and help and help yourself in the recovery
anyway oh actually you know what I answer the qu I'll answer this one question it's not super chat but I just
saw it in the side stream here but yeah I support Israel Palestines they they
have more demons and Devils within them they have lots more doubt within them as opposed to Israel so there you
go huh I don't know what you're talking about all my Snorlax have been kept in
their pokeballs within the Pokemon home storage and within my games and whatsoever at least the all the numbers
of boxes I have on the c197 half of the earth
otherwise yeah I would be able watch I would watch that but obviously if I put that on right now I would not be able to
see the super see the super chats or the videos coming in I do not know who this
is I do not know who that is well I mean if you want me to watch that video you feel it's like mentioned
it's the tip link just uh copy the link to that video and pop it in there I'll
watch at least a little bit of it in a way
yes yes they do
anyway be
think [Music]
oh you know I will mention this kind of a Oddball random thing but kind of a
metaphysical thing but hey so you're at a con so you're at a convention you got some fan art for one of your f for one
of your favorite individuals there
oh there were bad things for you which you did not need anymore there's going to be better things for you down the
road if they if they were removed from your life it's just things that were not going to be meant for you working out
for you long term so count the blessings along the way and find more blessings that would be coming your
way not long from now anyway so I had some f so like you
know hey so I got like fan art so it's like want to give it to some of my favorite people while I was there were
at a convention years ago and I managed to give them off to to a few uh you know
here and there especially like in the vendor Halls so like this one individual I had this lovely little uh s lovely
little unicorn piece of whatsoever which it had them and their unicorn I see
within right beside them hi hi guy all so it's like so okay I thought I
believe I recognized him in the vendor Hall I had the picture in my I had the drawing in my hands I was going to give it to him but it's like I could hardly
tell couldn't confirm it was him or not because I could see his name name tag I mean shoot for all I know the
[Music] individual ah on the way yes I was a normal
individual as it were but hey nobody I mean what's normal these days and all the way back down in Jerusalem
literally but anyway but a certainly service level normal but the within all
the powers that were coming out to be then and so forth I mean there's details
in the Bible that maybe
ohos so the Bible takes one things one way in regards to my life back then but takes things another way but they were
interpreted by it in those respective books it's just from their perspective as opposed to my perspective directly I
mean you don't see you know I mean there's the Book of John and book book of uh Matthew and so on and so forth
that those are read from their perspectives I said from my own personal perspective way back then I mean you
don't see like you know Book of Jesus within the Bible for one thing but still holy
oh ah well I mean okay so normally I would be open for energy drinks but um
Prime's okay good I have showered last
night I showered last night and I'm gonna shower again
tonight anyway what's up oh yeah so I could so
back to the thing I was talking about a moment ago some me just an empathy uh so I was like trying to recognize the guy I
wanted to give him the drawing at the same time was like okay so maybe if he was Maybe Might been a little paranoid
maybe just like oh this person looking at me I feel very Comfort
uncomfortable okay maybe maybe on that I mean of course anyway yeah I feel very
uncomfortable I don't know why they look they looking at me more than he like thank you you know
it's mentally emotionally everything yeah I like the three stoes
they're fun I got of them I'm
mortified yeah
anyway I de memory so far
oh uh um yeah I would consider that NSFW so I
so that's my response to that question so anyway just just where my B Miss
interpreted me in that in the in the moment just obviously that was from their perspective and they had misunderstand they didn't know I had a
drawing to offer them so they might just uh had the wrong impression about me at the moment but hey I what do you expect
you don't know the already you don't know they didn't know I was autistic at that point and they might have been in their their they got their own mental
problems I mean who doesn't have a mental problem these days I mean what's normal these days period I mean who's a
normal individual nobody is neurotypical oh yeah I have watched the
entirety of Sci Prime really good you could be donating and putting
the link into the tip jar so they can watch at least a few seconds of that that's the point of this media
share and I am not responding to that whatsoever I'm not even looking at this
because you're the fake and I'm the real
deal um you know what that's a good question
because considering what happened at the anime rally I'm thinking that yeah might
be taking a Frank from conventions for quite a long time
so y okay thank you just I wish I could actually watch the video in here I mean
that's what we're doing with the tip jar we man get that one video that two videos so far why can't you just put the link in there and
and pay for a few seconds oh yeah okay that's that's not great I
mean if you want you want me to watch the video right here right now this pop up in the cor corner here along with
that Matthew John I Consciousness I can't remember
them all at the same time I'm only focused on what I need to know in a moment H but it's like I mean you go

gum uh meet the view
count well I don't know too much about that right now just I mean all I know is just
you copy and paste the link you pay for the number of seconds for the videos video till I watch it just yeah I

one you know what here's your signi reference oh pretty good not bad I gotta get
out ah thank you very much [Music]
yeah okay humorous username you got there
guy and yes I was being sarcastic I said that we just did this didn't we I did he
Nick oh wait that was a different Nick okay by anyway hello there you go there's your shout out and as I'll
repeat again I don't typically do shout outs because you know for got these
question questionable individuals mentioned I don't consciously know who what they are are so like they think
it's all that all anyway uh let's start so hus been
hotel I have not watched that I have not watched that I have not watched that don't know consciously what that is
anyway yeah of course I like Charlie and uh and vaggie that's a really good
they're a really good couple I'd like that I like that vaggie was an angel
I can't you just copy and paste your link to the URL thing when the dipping
jar under that straight to the
tap if I was too loud videos you well

if you can afford that car now great otherwise I suggest you wait a little
while [Music] longer maybe get some help on that obviously you can if you got if you got
the credit you can take out a loan for the
car paron me what am I
doing yeah I like
baggie like you know best of wars and I love to spoiler the one individual from
the has Hotel Lally went up to heaven in the last episode one million
times how did you you okay that was a good one that was
good okay thank you for that okay um
okay that song's going to get stuck in my head now I've actually heard that song
before okay that was good upside downside
yeah well essentially we're filtering out the NSFW videos as well so if you're putting in the video for the that has
some NSFW or questionable content in it and it's not getting through well because that's
why okay that was a thing that was a thing
at least we know it is working and I'll consider that mildly
this FW but I'll let it slide it's all
good yeah oh a dick dick dick dick dick dick dick dick dick
dick here got there your Nick shout out that's enough Nicks
and and that's enough shouting
outy thank you oh thank you there you go that was
simple was a that was a good
one toat H you know
what okay I'll give you this one it's just like you know yeah the one time it's un ref
[Music] reference over there oh please who who hasn't thought
about sending in word from time time anyway thank you thank you so much Ethan there you go I mean I think it's okay if
I just read the username and as long as it's a safe for work
username anyway
goodness um all right my brain went blank I'm
thinking think about what about next I know something's GNA come up
shortly something come up shortly

good man although I will ask this if just if you respond any point whatsoever that'd
be great otherwise I won't worry about it but would you actually consider voicing DJ Pon Tre again I have a
feeling in my intuition that despite the Deep tone you my put
up but yeah I just in my intuition despite the deep voice you can always pick up your F your chit and F in the
nose so that you can still get the old DJ part 3 that is good you did the DJ part 3 the
best I feel like even do it better than I think it was the Lost n rare that did it it on that Magpie Pony ass Pony video

hey everybody he this Christ Team w Channel son you prime here once again and I'm taking more media requests
obviously you got the link right there so you just donate copy and paste the
URL post the time limit you want or just as much as possible what you're paying for but anyway we're doing this trying
to get this ner try so as you can tell so simply put so I'm trying with two
mics so I'll read from the comments and let's see does this definitely sound like it's a stereo to you and there's
definitely no mic issues I can confirm that from this sense so I'm ignoring all of
that anyway so ah so where we
begin my brain is blinking out ah okay anyway so we got the
speakers going so I'm not going to hear anything from here I'll be hearing it from the computer
speakers anyway so aside from that I'm continue on with other with my projects
as usual and just it's been such delay cuz I had to focus
on sleep varing sleep schedule for one thing I'd like to be able to get up earlier but then just just another
thing gotta be a try to go to bed earlier so Le so I can get up earlier I
got readjust my time back to as it was when I was over at Gateway but
anyway anyway so yeah trying again for the media live stream I'm afid for with
do better we're going to go longer this time so more time for the commentary between the paid comments and uh the
paid media share so without further Ado so I do have a little bit of content
just obviously random thoughts and whatand but I thought I might start off with a little something from the old
guys log Pages share with y'all about uh my experience my very first time I
survived Co I survived Co literally more than five
times I'm strong I meditated I affirm anyway I feel I feel like y'all
would be able to benefit from my experience as I wrote it down so when I
first had Co was back on February 5th 2022 obviously I was in the jail at the
time anyway h so yeah it's like got a supplemental
pages okay thank you all right so on February 5th I tested positive with
covid at around 9:45 p.m. Eastern Standard Time
precursor my body was working very heavily lately in some reprogramming of
this universe to be less restrictive and all that plus there was some heat from
frustration on her part when I refer to her I'm talking about my body at this
point all right from her part anyway her part it went up to a massive flame prior to the
court date on February 3rd at least it feeling that way so day one which was February 5th my entire body felt really
weak and partially limp like noodles moreover we felt quite disassociated
from the reality of the 1218 half of the universe we felt a scratchy throat after
midnight the previous night and between about uh 2 or 3 and 5 a.m. we were awake
and felt really like we were separated and going faster than time throughout the past night and that day but my body
was massively even more sensitive to the vibrations we also experienced some coughing and coughing up bits of flam
some disorienting dizziness we felt chilled even under the three layers of thermal tops bottoms and socks and the
and the uh thick blanket yeah it's just a in the jail it's just like a general
you know uh single layer blanket also had like a pair of sheets and the mattress but yeah thermal Toops thermal
bombs pairs of socks I wore three of each three pairs of socks three thermal
bombs three ther it got that cold it got really cold there's no air conditioning in the cells period it's always cold in
fact the deputy that work there even in the summer he comes to work in the office he has to wear a jacket because
it gets cold in there period go figure J's in there looking to
cut cut cost and everything anyway so where was
I and socks and think blet mild decreased appetite as my B felt only
able to eat the vegetable and fruit sides from the trays felt able to stomach the spicy bean meats and Rice
and Noodles fever yes but also psychic headaches as usual and my right side
broken to Broken my right side broken Toth nerves you know prior to it being removed I got to get that replaced at
some point it's going to happen shortly enough anyway and the gum line underneath it were sore like hell not part of the
virus but having this alongside that was most UNR was a most unrestful [ __ ]
and the virus affected my voice from the throat and there were mild hits in the chest prior to the swab we must look at
consciously as a chest cold February 6 day two my body had
recovered some strength energy and stability we were able to stomach and eat the spaghetti from the lunch tray we
experienced some diarrhea and increase in flim being coughed up and some deliriousness for a while after waking
up from another of our analytical process processing dreams though this one was partially a fever dream as well
throughout the day we have managed well and good to find our focus and bear thoughts and insights amidst the
processing of and recovery from this virus I listen very well to and work
with my body and what we were we are able to do and able to consume keeping epic observ observant that keeping epic
observant that neither my body or I are demonic influenced and we remain
continued strong on Heaven Universe cors inner light power and rainbow power with
our divine and God powers and abilities as I I stated sa supplement pages about
greater Divine truths and reasoning of the virus I forget which part that might on these Pages anyway Co is a great test
sent down as described in Revelations of the Bible to sort out the stronger
capable and highly enlightened individuals with at least good sense to listen into their body and working to
make the beer choices on how to heal and recover of the virus based on the
vibrations of good viruses I mean good versus bad felt by their Aura energy
field so they can survive and continue onward towards their destined and Faded shift while staying alive and within and
with their bodies with the collective who are the better enlightened and able majority from this 1218 herur have to se
when ie have and the com and the combination of the
two I feel like more over my Uncle Tom and a Harry are more the NASCAR fans
but this guy um yeah I don't think it'll come in first
place I I had to be from uh think episode four the song that angel and the
and the bartender sign together
and you are
blessed anyway find where I left off yeah
survive continue ah and and decrease the number of toxic
individuals Left Behind from those that stayed strongest and survived the
virus day three last night was without sleep sleep yet with physical rest and self-healing from about 2: to 600 or 7
a.m. the meditations while sleeplessly resting proved mentally stimulating and
entertaining pardon me I also note my broken toothache linking with the nerves
and my right ear being uncomforting I've had to stuff the tooth Gap repeatedly
with chewed up chewed by me pretzel D at least it works the covery exposed tooth
nerves for uh or up to a decent amount of time before slipping out and being
swallowed the the pretzel do being swallowed also to know from getting up
at about 10:30 a.m. to this present moment as upon ryness our throat is feeling no longer as scratchy mild like
a Whisper In The Wind now coughing and Flame appears to have decreased the wavering in the chest area has decreased
as
well just a m be kept but don't expect them
to win decrease decreas our appetite store
remains cautiously selective and not wh the richness or high spiciness of The Bean patties are filling foods such as
rice noodles and bread a lot of the time the mock chicken tofu strips I was on
the kosher tray I volunteered myself to be put on the kosher trays after after
staying there for a while and I found out I like the kosher trays much better than the regular trays and we got to eat the fish on the Friday so that was a
good thing that was a good thing anyway my chicken tofu strips were safe and go by the way in regards to tofu I love
tofu by the way I like the white bear than a brown I mean I realize I realized between the two the brown is meant to be
like the alternative to beef and the white alternative to chicken but just obviously The Taste between the two I
like the white better they were safe and good from today's love lunch tray as well as the
tuna from yesterday's Oliver we still very good thank you overall we do
still eat the vegetables and fruit sides as well as grits or oatmeal so cautiously we've been feeding the fever
very well I wrote quotes around feeding the
fever my mother and I
my ignore
that yeah power world did a mockery more over on Pokemon than of any the sa and Rose shoes
period anyway so was that easier time oh okay I had started this page so day four
my body and I had an easier time falling asleep the previous night this morning at brunch we felt some mild disorientation and had to lay back down
for a meditative healing rested at the brunch ate all but the bread on the tray the typical symptoms had lessen but with
my further hind psychic senses we ended up sensing blood pressure spikes a few
times as the bond suddenly suddenly literally lit up like a light bulb and I had to consciously
focus and ground myself well to hold on partly virus effects but as lar
confirmed on WTOP 107.7 FM radio news station a rocket was launched during
that time and my literal Rift and solar storm I mean and a literal Rift and a
solar storm shocked the rocket and not for satellites at
orbit into the Earth's atmosphere yep another met sign of Vladimir Putin's
World War III attack on Ukraine either way I'm still going to recover of the virus stay alive and save
the majority of the earth's population in the collective shift
which was going on at that time between those that were moving forward from 1218 half to se I 7 half to C parts so
counterparts body and so forth as opposed to those uh of the toxic
minority yeah just obviously the survival of the Fizz there between the two halves anyway day five last night
was rough as an internal attack by virus cells attempted to hit my heart the upper half my left lung my throat
bronchial tubes and even my core which by the way the core is between the heart and solar plees so it's like the
core is right about here the core is right there and not something off not the Inson controller off pardon
me ah okay I have watched has been L I went
over that the last stream thank you for asking thank you for the donation
anyway I was in meditative rest and focused on healing my body destroying the virus and infections and remaining
spiritually grounded at the time after about 900 p.m. in the bed under warm blanket with felt these impacts and
contined to stand strong for ourselves and consciously focus on the counter measures inspiring our white blood cells
and defenses to fight we had some help with a few very kind and hardworking angels and Heaven
soldiers as well as a few Herer type Souls from our pocket subdimension my
body and I are genuinely most humbled and thankful for their service I also personally struck down a good number of
virus cells spiritually we won the battle and
fight all of you are blessed thank you for your support and
kindness all right I also personally struck down a good virus oh yeah and we
contined the healing and viral cleanup Works throughout the night and onward we awoke this morning feeling more even
more recovered and in better health but we continue to remain onc conscious meditative guard and spiritual physical
defensive also at present our octave note singing is's clearing up slightly off key from my normal now but
improving it's a good show it's a good show and yeah Adam definitely had what
was coming to him on that front he's not me he won an avatar
period anyway continue day five we had another
attack it targeted the center bronchial tube core and throat round two was enduring but we survived throughout the
day the shifts events Cosmic and metaphysical and the sore flares and storms did not do our brain much help
made more tough on top of all this we contined to remain focused strong wield and spiritually grounded on healing our
body and destroying the virus and clearing the infections day sits we last night we saw
encount encountered a round three from our core up the Broncho tubes and Center
to the throat and mildly annoying disruptions in the brain from that after hitting the hay but I am my body with
our anog and psychic allies and on backup continue to stay and stand strong grounded healing and subduing the virus
attack keep on practicing you get better with your hand drawing skills and even if it may not per look perfect just
obviously nothing's perfect nobody's perfect everybody is flawed what is
neurotypical these days hey guy hey guys all three of you shout out to all you
your names are mentioned right there but yeah I mean so there's really nothing for you to be mocking anyway so
just stop it the cringe and then cringing just thank you very much the
only thing that's cringe is all of you
cringing on me on anyone and even on yourselves
period okay didn't just saying okay for that
okay anyway there is presently very little remaining of the co virus infections in
my body had naturally all my life and it became more conscious of it within the
past half to full day decade and I've been on practice and and
further endurance and progression of it ever since
mhm the individual has their own blessings let them be on
that I'm going to see that for later anyway what was
I on the upcomings oh I have heard that yes the multiple things multiple
creatines even out even a gun mode just yeah that's a really good figure I agree all right
anyway okay great you rake that lawn all there's very little remain of
the co virus infections in my body my throat became less sore my co core and respiratory areas feel less stressed and
be [Music] stabilizing breaking along breaking
along perfect look like
Waluigi wait why are we doing with two of those hang on a second I'm going to check
here in the tropical Seas with the coconut trees the air is fresh and the
people are free but here in the mountains there's no Freedom like that there's a man in jail and his name is
hat oh I see what happened
in TW in there twice sure
anyway all right feel less stress okay waking up
this morning my body my my throat is almost fully healed and the rest of my body feels even more healed and
recovering lots better also the first time since day one of this infection back on February 5th my poop has become
green of this I know green poop means well virus in the body virus in the
belly but in this instance I do believe this green poop symbolizes virus
recovery they of your
blessed as well fireus recovery as destroyed fire remains get released and
dumped we remain on continued healing and grounding meditations on guard and observing until better confirmation
last page of last sheet of paper I promise so day seven still
recovering ch's best pizza yeah they're good I kind of feel
like it papa johnas is good quality although of course the better quality is from
those that are individually
established I feel like I am safe from that even though I do not consciously know what that

small house on a hill Isaac kept to himself drawing pictures and playing with his toys as
his mom watched Christian broadcasts on the television yeah obviously Isaac did
not have the best upbringing and they were both happy that was until the day Isaac's mom Heard
a Voice from above maybe I can turn this up a little become corrupted by sin he needs
to be saved I do to save you my lord Isaac's
mother replied rushing into Isaac's removing all that was evil his life poor
guy again the voice called to her Isaac's soul is still corrupt
he needs to be cut off from all that is evil in this world and confess his sins
your nanny I will follow is blessed and healed I have faith in the like this little larger his mother replied as she
locked Isaac in his room away from the evils of the world one last time Isaac's mom heard
the voice of God calling to her all she did just big and watch TV but I still
question your de that I will ask one more thing of you oh yes did anything oh
that's possible I did go to Mission Barbecue a few times for a gway happy birthday happy birthday happy

demons in her head there was a bit of misguidance in there KN from the kitchen

scrambling around his to find a hiding place he noticed a tra door to the
basement hidden under rug that door without hesitation he flung open the
hatch just as his mother burst through his door oh I do not you I do not misuse
it because I work between the cosmos throughout the Multiverse physically and
an astral projection and an astral manifestation so I really do

love and relationships and friendships all that wizard knew was
just essentially get it to the outcome and that's
it

sorry I take pride in my my [ __ ] job Chad what do you take pride in huh you
sitting jerking off I do take pride Jer the new uh you know what that reminds me so
pride is not the sin it's arrogance arrogance is the real Sin and that about
when you have too much pride and sense of self and whatnot which which ve on
into the narcissism and all that done done so again pride is not the sin it's
arrogance I'm getting sick of this [ __ ] I don't want to get [ __ ] every
time I turn around just obviously you don't want too much pride CU otherwise then you can become like Smur it oh my
gosh I [ __ ] Jesus Christ God what did you
[ __ ] do get what you want done done at the handyman okay so that's what that
is that's the handyman so that's what that is okie
dokie we have watch some handy people being handy and
Brandy whatever that means it means whatever you want to make it out to me okay and there's your new series it's a
show about nothing [Music]
yeah even though heavy Meadow is my least favorite genre music I'll still
tolerate it I mean it's just obviously otherwise I would not watch a gret
go H well perhaps another time
but right now I'm doing [Music]
this doing this thing with Tetris talking to y'all and singing a song and dancing for
Christmas y ERS in the park hamsters in the park
got say hamsters in the park
do hey look gst's in the park that's rare you don't see that every
day they commission that there's like amers in the park while son Sonu and Rosie were on a
picnic and yeah essentially there's not too many hamster type Pokemon in nor ham
Taro or a h look alike in quickfill or in Virginia really
I mean there's no more P or Den they in the United States of America a bunch of Pokemon but there were obviously that
was just somebody that brought them in came from another region or like you know just traed in
from the [Music]
[Music] GTS
Okie do in yeah she Stupid
s imagine yourself curing just talking about random
Electronics just like why am I doing this I don't want to do this I can PID some money so all this
do this what they be like what they
said in the end what [Music]
it they really had to heal themselves after let their energy be drained out
all that
[Music] boom boom goes the thing does it like to
sing Bing
[Music] and you know what I will answer that
because your definition of trolls and trolling that's been around a long time
just all throughout the history of time I mean look in the in the musical movie Gigi The Spectators were just trollishly
looking at the incoming people that came in the that came into the party that
point possibly but I don't know about that I mean just all the gossiping rumors going on
so yeah I mean that's what y'all essentially were doing just gossiping and and making [ __ ] up I mean you know
what here's a burn for all you all the minority and even those it's on the Reddit I I read that formula for from
time to time if I was essentially sharing
everything I do with y'all like y'all kept on going then I would be doing that
more often and you would actually know what i' be doing presently y'all would actually know what's going on with whoever may be involved or whatever
not and I told yall everything that there was and what happened in the past and so forth in this timeline and
everything and what's to be as needed as y'all are needed to know it's on a need to know
basis but yeah essentially you don't know everything cuz I'm not sharing everything with all of you you don't
know you don't
[Music] know
anyway oops okay time to make a recovery
move y um okay I'm going to give it one more
try I'm going give it one more try for Maximus on this [Music]
stream I got a we're have to make a r okay there you go all right you got
your fish but you can't order you can't wish for a side dish because you're already get a side dish with that
wish so the wish for a s side dis just all you're doing is getting fat off that
you don't want to do that you don't want to do that anyway all right one more try
see if we can get Maximus on this string
[Music] oh and just poor Elliot he paid a100
paid a lot of money to get 100 copies of Texas another one the menuette
versions but still that was a good effort it's like trying to get a base set borderless
Charizard out of out of a $1,000
box
okay well it's your move you play and then you get to stay well let's see that's to be
determined and confirmed we'll figure it out how we can do Yu-Gi-Oh one
point yeah anyway down
there because I didn't want to be involved in your melal drama if your drama did not
exist then nobody would be blocking you
either and who's the manifestation who's the individual that
manifested that drama it was you I did not cause the drama you
manifested by literally commenting and saying bad things in response to it
if there was no penis draw there was no drawing of Rosie Rose chew with a
penis then there would have not been none of that drama either so that was on you
[Music] all and I reiterate I'm not into
anything in this FW anymore except for the fact just to be blunt and directly mention it
[Music]
I little change soon enough I'll be laughing out the other side of your
[Music] faces
[Music] oh I think the last time I played Tetris on one Tetris 991 streams I did get
Maximus yeah yeah play a little bit of Sonic

gibberish you know what that's okay she was not meant to be long turn anyway and at
least she knows that I have progressed and developed further immaturity which is more than I could say for her at that
point in time but at least she's still enduring on her

crap okay these guys can all right actually I feel like that's some
decent timing considering what game we're playing right now

take a lot of special attack hits and what we're doing is
using bubble that's the move that Isaac is using bubble oh

[Stream begins at 2:25]
Chris: Hey everybody, hey-zeus Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu Prime here once again. [Stammers]
Hang on. [Mouse clicks] There, I think that turned down the echo. I can tell the audio is working so I'm going to ignore those comments. [Chuckles]
Anyway, so, as you can tell from the title, we're doing something a little bit different. [Adjusts camera] Ok, technical things, I'm still figuring things out and all that.
Anyway, so as you can tell from the title, hm we got a Lego set right here, we're gonna put together, on-screen. So in a moment, I'll be switching to the uh... other camera.
Just offa' here it's gonna be uh [pats table] table right here. But just to give ya'll a little bit of preface and mentions, so, of course, we're doing the uh, media share and options. [In the business we call this foreshadowing]
Oh, I [Clicking with mouse] gotta' check a detail right quick. Alright, good speakers, make sure y'all could hear the uh... video... the videos that come into the media share as well. [Nervous breathing]
And uh, obviously there's going to be... there's likely going to be time- cuz we're going to go on for like a few hours. So like, obviously, you can click the... [Points to onscreen donation link] this link.
You'll be able to uh, [exasperated sigh] donate and make your comments. Whatever, i'll read the ones that are good. I read only the positive ones and uh...
yada yada yada.
Whatever that means, just details taken care off-screen. Anyway- um. [Nervous breathing] And all the other good stuff. Considerable to the pre-considerable related to the previous times... adjusting details yada yada yada.
Ya know what um, just I'll slide this keyboard over here. That'll make things a bit easier. ['Sighs and hums a tune]
Alright, but I moved the monitor closer to me so I can still read all that. Read the comments as they come in, so anyway. Without further ado. [Switches to view of workspace]
Right, [pointing], table. [Nervously giggles]
And I've got some, some, some special guests that are gonna' roll in as well. I'll show you the Lego set in a moment. [Moving mouse around] I'm gonna put the mouse over here.
Off-, just nearly off-screen. Got my water right here. But yeah- [Mutters]
Here's a little blast from the plast[sic]. [Rolls a toy car into view] The go-kart. [In a childish voice] It's a go-kart. With a glow-in-the-part, dark, tailpipes and the classic... me mini-figure.
With the airport torso. We actually did have the airport set. I built aeroplanes way back then. [Laughs] Fun. Fun times, good stuff. [Nervous breath] I like that, just, ya know, I just feel like it worked my, little mini figure.
I liked it, [Piece breaks off the go-kart] doh! [Fixes it with nervous laughter] I like him, my little orientations. Anyway, we gonna' have some fun with that.
And of course, here's a bigger thing coming in. [Rolls a much larger toy car into frame] Woo! My big carrrrrr! [Holds car to camera] And with meeeee, [In an insane voice:] driving iiiiiiit! Yahhh!
Cause I broke the door off. [More high pitch talk:] I broke the door off. Boy, doy-oy. [Talking like a baby:] Make it a little easier to get out by popping 'dis off, now it's a convertible.
Now we be like, [Holds lego figure Christine to camera] [High pitch speaking for the toy:] 'Hi guys, welcome to my live streeeeam.' [Chris laughs at own joke] 'We're gonna build something cool today'.
And the auto-focus works good. Alright. [In an annoying voice:] Without further ado, let's close the door! Gonna' close the door. Fun. [Childish voice:] Just fun, fun times. Good times.
I got another surprise, that'll come up a little later. We'll get the car outa' the way. Iiii'm in the action. But yeah, I'll show y'all something else, uh, you know my lil Power Ranger deal back in the day. [Holds a lego knight to camera]
That was my C-197 half, so, here's that mini figure of mine that was the Power Ranger that drew- that drove that one go-kart that made the head of... the cart Megazord. [Chuckles]
Lovely little pieces going on... Alright well, I'll respond to that pay- that pay wall later, little bit later, but anyway.
There's that. We'll show you all that. Alright so, let's- so... my lovely assistant [Addressing lego figurine of himself] my lovely little, [unintelligible]
you're gonna pull in the, watch. [Makes straining noises, moving something off-screen]
[Talking for the figurine:] This thing is heaaavyyyyy. [Scoots a $40 Indiana Lego set on screen using the toy]
Ta-da! Indiana Jones! [More high-pitch speaking for the toy:] Adventure tiiiime, come on grab your friends! To go to fairly distant lands with... Indiana Jones!
[Adjust headset cables] Oh, my bad, just, I knot the... it's the extension cable of my headphones, um. Yeah, knot that off, that's what that is, anyways.
Ok. But anyway, we got plenty of table space so...
[Playing with lego box] Let's find where you open this thing.
[Receives a donation from "Jon Arbuckle" that says: "I love Sonichu! Can I get a shoutout? Emily"]
Ah, bottom of the box. [Chris leans in to read donation] Again, I don't do shout-outs by specific names... but you have been noted. Thank you very much.
And uh... [Laboured breathing] [Makes high pitched childish noises]
Anyway, uh, [Opens box with nails] I'll just open it up from the bottom, that'll work. [In a strange voice:] It's like opening a present, at Christmas. Yay!
I watched them go recently build that Polaroid camera which I, really liked that, that was fun. Anyway, we're gonna, bring in a little Indiana Joooones. And, uh... get it out the way.
We're not just jonesin... [Laughs loudly at own joke] There you go. You got your one... Anyway, let's see. Number of bags... I like... got my own little... thing- I don't organise the pieces... I just pick them out as I need.
So, obviously you do have them numbered, you got the four bag. That's the one bag, that's the two bag. Alright, there's a three bag. We'll stack the bags on top in order, so that's two, three, four going down.
Ok, we got... we've got some... decals. I like decals, they're good. Alrighty! So... We got a couple of... plates to work with for starters. Let's uh... [In an annoying voice:] open up the baggyyyyy.
And we're gonna have some pieces to fun. [Catches breath] And we got the bigger pieces right there. We're gonna- oop- hm. [Talking for the toy again:] Put me right there.
Put smaller pieces... just outa the way. Just outa' the way. One bag and the other. But yes, as I- just- like I said earlier, the comments and the paid comments and the... media share, they're in here, you are encouraged.
Up, okay, the link [Points to the donation link] is up there, and of course, the Etsy store is stocked. Alright. So let's uh, open up the [With a Spanish accent:] instrucciones.
[Extremely loud and high pitched:] Ayeeeee, que instruccioneeeeessss. [Laughs proudly]
Alright, lets have a look here. Ooh... ok so we don't get Indy just yet, but we get like a... the... the guy there. Um... I've only like uh... watched some of Indian Jones, but I am quite aware of Indiana Jones.
Just to give you that little... nori... description there. Obviously, we got a little mini figure here of the... kind individual. [Repeats in high pitch] Kind invdividual.
Oh! His name is... oh... Salah. Alright, good. I was right... uh... like from Arabia, Hindi, I don't really know. And I do apologise, I do not mean to offend anyone. But I appreciate all cultures very much, [Quietly] I do.
[Mumbles while struggling to assemble] Anyway, we got the head piece. Fit down there. [In a happy tone:] Ah! Hi, guy. hm.
[Talking for Salah:] Hello. Do a little fist-bump. Boop. [Fist bumps Christine toy]
Friendly fist-bump between nations. Boop. Yay. [Again but in high pitch] Yay!
[Breathes heavily on mic]
Friendly, friendly fist bump.
Oh yeah, I liked Lego, and I'm gonna mention- yes I like Lego movie, I've seen both Lego movies with Emmet. I've also seen the Lego Batman movie... and the Lego Ninjago movie. Was there another one? Oh yeah- um.
[Thinks for a few seconds] I think that was it.
But anyway, so obviously, as you know, all know, I'm a fan of- Le- all- alot of things Lego. Oop, don't wanna hurt our new little friend here.
[A donation from "Dark Mammoth" comes in asking: "Favorite Sailor Scout?"]
Oh! [Chris leans in to read the donation]
Favourite Sailor scout... I like Ami, Sailor- which is Sailor Mercury. And uh... Michiru who is uh... Sailor Neptune. Haruka which uh... I like her too.
[A donation from "Galileo Potato" comes in asking: "Will you invite Mega Man to Cwcville one day?"]
[Chris leans in to read] [Chuckles nervously at the question] Oh! Oh he do- he uh- he came- he comes in from time to time. Alright just [Sounds audibly concerned] alright I think we got a detail here.
Oh... um, something wrong here speaking-
[A second donation from "Galileo Potato" asking: "Would Mega Man and Sonichu be friends or enemies?"] Hm?
Friends, because they are heroes... ok? Ah, I think we got to ditch outa here because I'm not hearing... the... I'm not hearing the... ba-bing. Hang on a second. [Aggrivated mouse clicks]
What's going on with the speakers here? Oh don' tell me... hm speakers U... SB audio should be... why are they not... coming in? Ah, don't tell me. [Exasperated sigh] Dang nabit.
We... [Laboured breathing] I do not want to have to end the stream because I wanna' make sure y'all are able to hear the audio...
try something here. [Speaking what he is doing:] Switch headphones...
Alright then, switch back to... USB... speakers. [Mutters for a few seconds]
Okay, speakers... USB audio. I should hear a noise! [Accidentally drags camera screen across stream]
Just then, oops! [Corrects stream] I shoulda' heard a noise just then. Okay, we got a situation here... um...
I'm sory guys, but just um, I'm gonna pause right here, there'll be a part two for this stream, coming up shortly. Let me just check on the... on the other... pay ones that came in. I don't see any...

Highlights
Highlights
04:40: When asked "are you learning Finnish currently? If so why?" Chris says "I don't know what you're talking about, guy"
09:08: Receives donation from "alfredwoden" saying: "I want to come enjoy your streams but chat is really negative. Just mentioning again if you need moderation, get with me on Discord (same name) or maybe I email you?"' Chris: [Celebrates fixing donation audio] There we go! We solved it. Yeah, [Addressing donation] I know! That's why I nuked the comments on the uh, videos I upload. [Chuckles] So dumb. [Trademark sigh]
10:35: Recieves donation from "Total_Nick-Ker_Deth" saying: ”JULAYYYYYY” Chris: [Scoffs and hisses at the camera with a Lego snake]
11:17: Recieves donation from "KnexIsBetter" saying: ""F" is for Finnish! "F" is for Flutter! What a coincidence!" Chris: [Trademark Hm] If it is such a case, it might be, but it's not, so therefore [Singing:] everyone can sing and dance for Christmas.
18:45: Chris claims that he has plays binaural beats through a Bluetooth speaker "at all the times."
21:11: Receives donation from "KoolKid" saying: "Would you ever make the Bible again but like for autistic people? Would Sonichu or the other OCs be involved? Chris: Well, the Bible is in progress. It will be written by... other individuals, which I, I did inspire individual pieces here and there from within my 'God's Law' pages.

28:12: Receives donation from "KK" saying: "What would you say to the people that think you're a cult leader or will start a cult?" Chris: Hm. Oh. Ok, well um, there are good cults and there are bad cults. And the bad cults are the ones that do the sacrifice and the blood and all that. [Makes grossed out sound] And the good po- good cults actually promote goodness, light, power and righteous[sic] and in fact religions [Points to camera] literally... the good ones, they start out as... cult followings. Based on the scriptures, based on the predictions, based on the prophecies... so... you meditate on that.
30:14: Receives donation from "Total_Tr00n_Deth" saying: "How do you feel knowing Liquid Chris is a doctor, while you're just sitting at home in your dirty crapped briefs pretending to be a woman?" Chris: I'm not pretending to be a woman... my panties are CLEAN. And Liquid Chris is not a doctor. In fact he's just trapped in his own stupor and mentality and arrogance and everything... bad. So. I feel sorry for him. He's disappointing.
31:02: Receives donation from "TheRemedy" saying: "Considering that you're career is now being a streamer now. And that You're making money from donations now.

39:28: Receives donation from "Samster86" saying: "Hi loving the stream here is a family friendly joke what's another name for a Jewish discount? A hollow cost haha" Chris: [Laughs unconvincingly] Ok. That's a decent pun.
41:17: Receives media share of a video titled: "G**ks of hazard" (The title was not censored). [Chris laughs uproariously] Oh I called it, it wasn't the Dukes of hazard, but still, that was pretty good.
45:03: Receives another donation from: "Total_Tr00n_Deth" saying: "How does it feel to have a 35 degree bent duck?" Chris: Well, I tell you what, how does it feel to have a short one?
48:01: Chris holds up a hand-drawn picture of Sonichu and Rosechu looking toward the viewer] Sonichu: WHAT STILL BAFFLES ME IS THAT THEY ON THE 1218 HALF, SOME OF THEM CAN'T SEE THE SAME DIMENSIONAL TEARS ALL AROUND LIKE WE DO.

53:08: Receives a donation from "Chris_Belongs_In_Prisos" saying: "Is Borb [[1]] a squirter?" [Chris completely ignores this]
54:07: Receives a media share of a few seconds of the song "Skin O' My Teeth" by Megadeth. The Youtube video now lists this song as having been a part of the stream Chris: Okay, you know what, that sounds like a song from Shadow the Hedgehog despite it not being from Crush 40. Really good band, by the way, I really like Crush40.
59:18: Receives a donation from "David Hulse" saying: "Why do you like nsfw Ai pony art on twitter? Chris: I mean it's good art, It's decent. I mean it's there. I don't like it all, just... (rambles on for a few more sentences) ...Yall like porn too. I like porn. I have my share of pornography and everything. I know yall do as well so don't you be judging me for liking a few images of you know, be a little bit sensual.
1:04:38: Receives a donation from "Snorlax_Squirts_Hard" saying: "How many times did you crap your briefs today, Chris?" Chris: NONE. ZERO TIMES.
1:14:21: There is a visible superchat that says: "what's flutter like irl?" This never makes it onto the screen, proving her name is filtered or his donations are moderated
1:22:01: Receives a donation from "ICameforCWC" saying: "Hey Chris Chan, I purchased a medallion a month ago only to find that you are now offering Certificates of Authenticity. Can I purchase one separately to go with my medallion? Chris thinks about this for some time. Chris: So on these medallions, that were personally crafted by me, they don't necessar- they do NOT... really need the certificates of authenticity, it's just that it became by popular demand so we started adding them... so. [...] So, tell you what, hm... [...] alright so, I tell you what, so, anybody that has purchased a medallion that was officially from me personally... one of the ones... um... as opposed to the other ones that are less expensive... that I have personally approved and authorised and everything and I do get the money and proceeds from that... if you uh send us a DM in the Etsy store, only if you have purchased one, in the past, we will confirm this within the order detail... then we will see about sending you a complimentary certificate of authenticity to go with the medallion.
1:24:57: Recevies a donation from "Total_Tr00n_Deth" saying: "Where's Kimmi?" Chris: That balloons been popped... A LOOOOONG time ago. There's no , there's nothing like that around here either, so therefor... [Makes mocking sound]
1:27:58: Receives a donation from "Dnoot" saying: "Did you hear about Geno's Sonichu series he is doing? And if you did, what are your thoughts?" Chris: Umm... It is not authorised, it is not canon, therefore, I do not need to worry about it. And I only have to read about it because... essentially that's one alternate universe, one alternate thing, just [Blow raspberry] Eh. I can just take it or leave it. Very much like a certain other individual, who lives somewhere else, who put his own address all over the place. Pretty much lost his onions a few times. Yeah, that was just awful. And then of course there is the guy who was behind Asperchu. You don't... do... you don't do fanfictions or stories where you've got a lot of gore, and all that in there and then just, uh, lack of continuity throughout the series and all that. [Proceeds to scold the creator of Asperchu like a child]
1:31:37: Receives a media share of an old video where Chris says "Gaaaay" under duress. [[2]] Chris: And that was back from when I was... homophobic which that is no longer the case since I came out and realised myself. It is ok to be Gay, it is ok to be lesbian, it is ok to be bisexual, polyamorous and whatnot, cause you are identifying as yourself. LGBTQ even queer is good, I, A... plus. Everything, it's all good. As long as you are happy and content with yourself and everything. I never really could identify very good being... within the, [Clears throat] maaaale identity. [Chris does not see the irony that he mumbles "Male Identity" the way he used to mumble, "Gaaaay"]
1:50:47: Recevies a donation from "kakyoinzbich" saying: "Will you ever resume your love quest?" Chris: Oh, I don't need to! I'm married to Magichan, Cryzel, Sylvana and Mewtwo. You see these four rings? [Shows his many finger rings]
2:00:31: Receives a donation from "J" saying: "Have you watched any good hentai recently or recommend any artists?" Chris laughs angrily. Chris: You know what, I am switching to the other camera to answer this question! [Camera switches to show Chris front and centre] [He removes his glasses and raises a stern hand] [Speaking as though for an official record:] I have not watched any hentai anime... what-so-ever in YEEEEEARS. So I can't really answer your question about recommendations, at all, ok?
2:13:45: Chris pulls out his old Yu-Gi-Oh deck and shows his cards.
2:21:50: Chris changes to streaming his Nintendo Switch. He plays the Mario Vs Donkey Kong demo and then Tetris until the stream ends at 2:42:55.
