Teenage Dream is an audio file of Chris singing Katy Perry's song "Teenage Dream", leaked on 25 February 2012. In typical Chris style, he sings tunelessly over the original song, rather than finding a karaoke version.

You think I'm pretty without any make-up on
You think I'm funny when I tell the punchline wrong
I know you get me, so I'll let my walls come down
Do-o-own
Before you met me, I was alright
But things were kinda heavy, you brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my valentine
Valentine
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever
You make me feel like I'm livin' the
Teenage dream, the way you turn me on
I can't sleep, let's run away
And don't ever look back, don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now baby, I believe
This is real, so take a chance and
Don't ever look back, don't ever look back
We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece
I'm complete
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever
You make me feel like I'm livin' the
Teenage dream, the way you turn me on
I can't sleep, let's run away and
Don't ever look back, don't eve--(video cuts off)
