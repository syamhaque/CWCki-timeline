================================================================================

On 15 October 2023, Praetor began selling on OfficialCWCmart old commissions Chris had drawn in summer 2021 for the Help send Chris-Chan to Everfree NW fundraiser. Chris had never completed the fundraiser, since he was arrested for incest in the middle of it; consequently, the physical drawings he had made hadn't been sent to the buyers (Null, the organizer, had refunded the buyers). The drawings sat at 14 Branchland Court while Chris was jailed for the next two years. After Chris was released, he retrieved the art from the house, and Praetor put them up for sale.

This is a 8.5x11 colored piece done by Christine Weston Chandler. In a 2021 fundraiser held by KiwiFarms organizer Null, Chris Chan took custom requests for artworks to be drawn as a way to fund travel to a large convention. Unfortunately in the middle of drawing and prepping these, Chris was arrested. The nature of the charges brought Null to close the fundraiser and refund all buyers, and the completed pieces sat ever since at the Chandler Residence.
Christine has now returned, and is authorizing the reposting of those completed works here. A short description of each has been dictated by Christine.
