YOUR TAX DOLLARS AT WORK!The contents of this page have been bought with taxpayer money!
This article is out of date.
We suggest you keep up with the times.
American taxpayer money spent on Social Security Disability helps disabled people like Chris buy essential goods like…video games.
Chris doesn't understand the value of money. This is well-known, but nowhere is it better illustrated than in the log of his PlayStation Network game downloads.
Acquired by Clyde Cash and other trolls, the data show that Chris has spent in the vicinity of $3,700 (as of early March 2012) on videos, game content, and other purchases through the PSN. His video downloads are catalogued elsewhere. This list attempts to catalog the games and game "upgrades" Chris has bought so far.
Many of his spending decisions boggle the mind. He has, for instance, spent around $35 on nothing but furniture and character clothing for PlayStation Home, Sony's Second Life knockoff. Nearly $30 has gone towards new characters and ball designs for High Velocity Bowling, even though his trophy showcase indicates that he hasn't bothered to play the game. On the Soul Calibur IV front, he bought weapon packs, content he could have unlocked on his own had he bothered to play the game at all. The most ridiculous part of his SCIV purchases is that he bought the Yoda character; one can easily see why Hex-Box owners are eager to purchase Darth Vader, but purchasing Yoda for PS3 is pure unadulterated fraternization with The Enemy. Finally, the bill for his Guitar Hero downloads, of course, hardly bears thinking about.
Chris's rate of spending varies from month to month. In January 2009, he deposited a modest $90 in his PSN wallet, but that came after two months of heavy binging — he spent around $235 in December 2009 and almost as much in November.
Averaged out, Chris's PSN habit is enough to make short work of his monthly tugboat and then some. Since his downloads are paid for with a credit card, of course, they are responsible for the lion's share of his deepening debt. Chris's understanding of money has always been horrible, but only when he is freed from the constraints of a fixed income do we see just how little he understands the value of money. This is a man who has been wearing the same hideous salvation army clothes for years, only retiring a costume when he gets too fat to wear it, yet he spends thousands of dollars on games he's likely never played. As Chris only receives around $800 a month, this is the rough equivalent of a normal person spending 3 1/2 months of their entire paycheck on just downloadables.
This list is based on an accounting of Chris's purchases through the American PlayStation Network, and as such may not be complete. It's likely that Chris has also spent even more money on downloads from the Japanese and other PSN stores, such as the game Mainichi Issho, which he apparently played to completion, according to his trophy case. According to his communications with Samantha Thaddeus, Chris also set up accounts for use with the Spanish, French, German, Japanese, and Hong Kong PSN stores.
