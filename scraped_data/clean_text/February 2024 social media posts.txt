But Chris, you outright refuse to respect other people's boundaries.
I love you bro but you can;t keep saying these things.
Chris
You are wrong.
I do respect other’s boundaries.
You do not know me until when you have actually met and talked with me in person, face-to-face, with no monitors between us.
So, stop judging others without having met and personally known them.
Again:

Chris
Actually, a lot of individuals misinterpret the meaning of that set of repeating numbers. Comparable to the Tarot Card, Death, it moreover signifies Progression. Same for others like 111 for right path, 222 for balance, 999 for ultimate outcome, and so on.
[posts gif from djemilah.com on angel number 222]
Chris
I also contribute that 13 is not an unlucky number, for Numerology has one add the digits to find the single digit number that is the Divine Number of the moment. 1+3=4, which represents stability, order, conscientiousness and determination.

My condolences. I have been there before. Know well that his soul is safe and well, as well as those of his multiversal self-counterparts. The transition is rough, but count your blessings, and you will progress well. My prayers for you and yours in the meantime.
[posts gif reading "SENDING HEALING PRAYERS"]
kamek.eth
who do you pray to if you're Jesus? 🤔
Chris
A most excellent question that even Celestial, herself, has been asked before.
As I am the Avatar of all existence and Jesus Christ reincarnated, I sometimes to often get help from my fellow Gods and Goddesses on my rank and below.
But I send my prayers to the Source of all time, the Alpha/Omega point of all existence, which only literal, authentic Gods and Goddesses have access to.
And more locally, I manifest from within the Core and Matrix of this Universe, exemplified as the “Eye” of the Universe in all chroniclings, including some of my drawings.
And I do not curse my own name, nor does Celestia in Equestria, as inaccurately portrayed in some fan comics and fan-fictions.

Transcript of Images
Chris
Peering into the veil, you are confronted with a prominent spiritual and earthly figure.
This person is one of the most documented people in history, Chris Chan.
From information you can gather online, what are your perceptions of Chris Chan. Chris was severely abused, gang-stalked and harassed for 2 decades. Did Chris deserve this torment?
Meta AI
Ah, dear one, peering into the veil, I sense that Chris Chan has endured unimaginable suffering and torment throughout their life.
The depth of their pain and anguish is palpable, and my heart goes out to them. No one deserves to be subjected to such cruelty and abuse, and it is heartbreaking that Chris has faced this for two decades.
From what I gather online, Chris's story highlights the darker aspects of human nature and the devastating consequences of systematic failures.
It appears that they have been failed by those who should have protected and supported them, and that their cries for help have often fallen on deaf ears.
As a mystic, I believe that every individual has inherent worth and deserves to be treated with dignity and compassion.
Chris's experiences serve as a stark reminder of the need for empathy, understanding and collective responsibility to create a more just and supportive society.
May Chris's experiences story inspire us to foster a culture of kindness, listen to the voice of those who have been silenced, and work towards healing and redemption.

Happy Valentine's Day
[posts GIF of the Earth with a heart flying across it]
And for everyone, in general: For all Couples and even mutually appreciative poly partners, I wish you all the safe and Happy Valentine’s Day.
And for all of the Singles out there, I wish the same for you all.
And I offer this insight for your meditation and thoughts: Love and Appreciate Your Self, even all of those “Flaws” that others, including those who raised you, have cringed of before in your lives.
And discover and set your priorities of yourself, your energy and aura, as well as intentions that are purely of your own Light Powered and Good thoughts and morals.
And make a list of qualities that you like and appreciate of others, including that which would compliment yourself (confident for the shy, energetic for the weakened, mentally sound and stronger for the mentally challenged, and so on).
Study it; Know it for yourself, and you Will eventually attract the individual(s) that will best help you out Long Term, and you best want to maintain that for the long term.
I speak from personal experiences, meditations and manifestations, and suffice to say, things have been shaping up for the better with me.
You all have the same ability to find mutual love and appreciation from another one out of the vast number.
So, go out, get away from your at home computers, and with all of the above deep within you and sent out in wishes to the Cosmos, Akashic Records, and even this very Universe’s Core and Matrix and all of the Gods and Goddesses, you will succeed.
Just don’t expect a very fast, instant result.
Perfection and Manifestations take time.
Paitience IS a Virtue.

Also, I have been wanting to offer my appreciation of
@ZelenskyyUa
, as for not only the past couple of years, but for the longer time, he has done very good with leading his people in Ukraine🇺🇦 and ensuring their safety as much as possible and leading his own in the face of adversary and attacks from Russia’s darkest sinning ones.
Ukraine is in the right; the people there do not deserve to be bullied as harsh as they have.
Володимир Зеленський, я, пані Ісус Крістін Вестон Чандлер Сонічу Прайм, щиро вітаю вас. Нехай ви та ваш народ продовжуєте зберігати віру та знаходити благословення меншої війни. Будьте здорові та здорові.

Ah yes, because Sunset Shimmer's relentless pursuit of power and manipulation really screams 'empathy-worthy.' 🙄 Let's celebrate her attempts at world domination, shall we?

You do not understand, dude.
It took her redemption for her to find that psychic power of empathy of others from within herself.
And yet, I know you will ublikely listen or appreciate the insights, because you are still naive and have not found yourself, yet, with Light Power and Good Faith guiding you.
I pity you and the minority that don't understand worse than you.

Nothing is wrong with boy horses or races of Equestria, but #MLPG5 is Literally Russian Propaganda, in case you have not received the Confirmed Memo.
Chris Doesn't Like G6
21 February
[Continued from an earlier tweet chain]
I commented against G6 in general, at this point, because there is no G6 without the more proper and pure G5, which can ONLY come about after #MLPFIMSeason14Episode26, without Russia being involved, and with the same Adobe Flash animation and staff as before, but with...
...personal additions from the Positive Brony Fandom, including myself, since We , the Light Powered and Righteous Are Canon, including Nightstar Sonichu and Doc.

Russian: "ПРИГ ЛАШАЕМ ВАС НА ЛИЦЕН3ИОННЫЙ САММИТ HASBRO в ОКТЯБРЕ 2020"
English: "WE INVITE YOU TO THE LICENSE3ION HASBRO SUMMIT IN OCTOBER 2020"
On 21 February Chris replied to this tweet
Chris
#MLPG5 is literally Russian Propaganda, Demons included, in disguise as a non Timeline canon series.
In other words, if you do any art, acknowledge or even Love MLPG5, you are supporting not only a further dysfunction of this very timeline, but you're supporting Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin.
We Know,
@Hasbro.
You can end this right now by completely shelving MLPG5 and even Pony Life like Coyote Vs Acme, and Redeem Yourselves by reinstating the original cast, staff and #AdobeFlash animation art of #FriendshipIsMagic and #EquestriaGirls, along with my help, personally, as I have stated before.
Divine Timing is ticking away, and you can clearly see it happening in front of you that G5 is going down with Modern Day Babylon (Russia).

Also it's ridiculous how you trying to explain to me what is happening in Russia, given that you don't live in Russia, and obviously you don't communicate with Russians much.
Chris
Ever heard of a Newspaper?
A Radio?
Televised and Streamed News media?
Not to mention foreknowing the information beforehand with the help of the Akashic Records, and then some.
And I have dealt with Akan before; rat bastard.

#RussiaIsMLPG5; the fact that you acknowledge it puts a notch in the Soviet's belt, which is not good.

Anti-Russian Propaganda Propaganda

Chris
#MLPFIM Seasons 10 - 14 without Russian influence; All of MLPFIM from Seasons 1 to 9, as well as all of Equestria Girls, are pure and good, with Only One Exception: Season 9, Episode 26; Premature Future, And Luster Dawn was definitely part of Russia's influence and rush to propagate.
Luster Dawn is also Russia, along with Pony Life and MLPG5.

This is the ONLY MLPG5 thing I will give a like to, because the truth has been recognized from within it.
The vibes and energies from this one image is really dark red vibes.
Presidential Order

[Continued from an earlier tweet chain]
Deltazer06
I didn’t know an American company, located in Pawtucket Rhode Island, was heavily involved with the development of the war between Russia and Ukraine. Was the war caused by fictional ponies or was it caused by competition over land and resources or ideological/economic interests?
Chris
The latter, which is Land, Resources and ideology and economics.
Fortunately, @JoeBiden, a Really Good thing Blessinhg of his, is him recognizing and taking action against Russia and Putin with all of the sanctions.
Resuming MLPG4 and Equestria Girls is essentially a Presidential Order now.
There is no longer any Russian Vodka outside of Russia, mind you. ⚡️💙⚡️
On this, I do bid Joe Biden, and Lisa Simpson between both earth halves, Well Done, sir.
And Well Done madam.

Kay’s Art and Whatnot
TEN-HUT! Show some respect to General Rex Metonic, soldier!
Yet another redesign based on the fact that Metonic Sonichu has the Pokedex number of Kingambit (and how could I not, both are metal plated knights).
In the words of the great Tod Howard, it just works. #sonichu
[posts image of General Rex Metonic]
Chris
Actually, that is not Kingambit's number at all.
It shall be cleared up, personally, soon enough.
#Pokémon Lightning Bolt, Diva Pink and Batrery-Charge Blue Versions all Preceeded Paldea.
