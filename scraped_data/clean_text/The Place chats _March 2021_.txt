Guilt Tripping
6 March 2021
Chris
Hey, @everyone.
I do sincerely apologize for not checking in with all of you for a while.
The resyncing with my body has been difficult, but progressive.
Nova
It might feel more heartfelt without a reason, giving a reason and no explanation just sounds like another way to shut things down.
Chris
Well, I have been sensing and feeling massively strong energies and events, and it's been difficult to think clearly at times.
So, to give an explanation is a bit much at the moment.
Especially with the heavy energies I have felt today that left my body quaking quite a bit.
Impostor Lainchu (The WCT)
I'm glad you're still around. We were getting sick and worried about you.
[Replying to "Especially with the heavy energies I have felt today that left my body quaking q..."]
is it painful?
Chris
Mildly; more of an annoyance.
Nova
I've seen people who kind of act like that, not distinctively narcissistic, but has some
comparable elements.
Narcissism is fine as long as you win.
Impostor Lainchu (The WCT)
[Replying to "Mildly; more of an annoyance."]
it could be worse, but I'm relieved you're doing fine for the most part. (just promise to keep in touch with us, ok?)
Chris
Is Bismuth still on? I don't see his name on the online/offline list, or did he change it again?
Impostor Lainchu (The WCT)
he changes his name in here every once in a while.
and only appears offline.
Nova
Val left. Don't know if you'd noticed.
Chris
Hmm
Impostor Lainchu (The WCT)
[Replying to "Val left. Don't know if you'd noticed."]
RIP.
Nigel's also gone.
Chris
That is a shame.
Nova
Just look over what led to it. Pity is useless on it's own.
Impostor Lainchu (The WCT)

Chris
I see
Impostor Lainchu (The WCT)
you were gone for so long that they assumed you'd never return.
so they quit.
Chris
That is a bad assumption to make.
Nova
I'm an asshole, but I'm at least affable enough that nobody cares.
Chris
Yep, the paradigm shift did not work favourably here.
The WCT
Hi Chris! glad to see you back here.
Chris
Hey, Neko
Nova
You didn't ask, but it's obvious to say I'm cross too.
Chris
I get it, I should have checked in sooner. Between the events that have been happening and being sensed and all, and frankly, having to reconsider y'all's recent behaviours and whatnot, and looking further into the future and the present to analyze everyone and everything, I had felt it best to take the break.
It was nothing personal.
Impostor Lainchu (The WCT)
I heard MKR got angry at you for a bit, are you two fine now?
your absence dealt an amount of stress on her.
Chris
I mean, Bismuth's leak has been forgiven, but then y'all ditched Anaxis and replaced him, and then there's the bro-ish habit of picking on others in jest that can be misinterpreted; I felt uncertain.
I have talked with Meghan.
And I have apologized to her.
Impostor Lainchu (The WCT)
good.
Chris
I am attempting to practice better selection and analysis of individuals as friends, so it can remain that such things as what happened with Vaughn be the very last that happens with me, or Sonichu in that case.
The WCT
[Replying to "I mean, Bismuth's leak has been forgiven, but then y'all ditched Anaxis and repl..."]
I have no qualms with anybody you're choosing to befriend. You're an adult, and can choose who you want to associate yourself with.
Impostor Lainchu (The WCT)
[Replying to "I am attempting to practice better selection and analysis of individuals as frien..."]
better to be safe than sorry.
Nova
Life is loud, the only option there is is asking questions and if people want to offer meaningful advice.
Chris
Yes
Nova
A lot easier to know someone is lying with facts, but you don't need much.
Impostor Lainchu (The WCT)

Welcome back 💜💜
Impostor Lainchu (The WCT)
look at their body language and listen to the tone of their voice.
that's where liars can be exposed.
Chris
[Replying to "look at their body language and listen to the tone of their voice."]
Harder to do that through the Internet. But my abilities to read others' auras and intentions through electronic messages has improved. (edited)
Impostor Lainchu (The WCT)
how long did it take you to improve?
Chris
It's a soulful ability, and I was able to practice it on the one hand while I was in Sonichu's body. And on the other hand, with my body, Sonichu was able to tap into it and learn it's better uses not only for himself, but for the mental record of my body.
Nova
Not really a testable concept.
And regardless it's not a standard of evidence acceptable by anyone else.
I think that's part of why there are biblical standards for prophets.
Chris
[Replying to "Not really a testable concept."]
Says the cynical brainiac who continues to over think math details based on local physics, when the need for that is null, since it is multi-dimensional.
Nova
If it physically exists, physics applies.
Chris
Fair
Nova
I'm an optimist, just that cynicism is how you stay an optimist.
Chris
Not really, the way to optimism is to look and count the positive blessings in everything.
Half Full, or Half Empty with you?
The WCT
[Replying to "Not really, the way to optimism is to look and count the positive blessings in ev..."]
I think that way as well.
anything good that happens, be grateful for it.
[1 👍 reaction, likely from Chris]
Chris
Even if you count both by measuring the full, and then measuring the empty space that has the potential to be filled.
Naught
[Posts an emote]
Impostor Lainchu (The WCT)
sup Bis.
Chris
Hey, Bismuth.
Nova
No, just correct, optimism is useless in an investigation.
The perfect optimist or cynic would probably have died very young.
Chris
[Replying to "No, just correct, optimism is useless in an investigation."]
I could argue that in certain situations, the combined viewpoints of optimism and pessimism can still be very useful in an investigation.
Nova
Just saying something in the middle isn't really a point of argument.
Chris
It's not a riddle without the middle.
Nova
There's really no way to overthink, assuming the validity of the rationale.
And it's a poor excuse when things go wrong.
Chris
On when things go wrong, or the result is a loop, there is opportunity to learn, revise, and find the conclusion. (edited)
Nova
Easy to just say these things. (edited)
Chris
Better to say when not offending than to keep quiet and not be heard.
Anyway
It's been a long day for me, and I'll be breaking for supper shortly. I will check y'all again in the near future.

Ivy Creek
9 March 2021
Chris
Hey, y’all.
For now, just checking in.
I am feeling better today.
I went to the Ivy Creek natural area and walked a lap, as well as dipped my bare feet in the running creek, and meditated for a while on a big rock with Cryzel.
It was a very lovely and satisfying experience.

Rejection of the Fourth Lainchu
18 March 2021
Chris
Daww!
Hey, @everyone.
Welcome to the moment where things are good in the hood with us, here.
The self-love between my body and I is going along most splendidly.
Also, I have been moderately updated on the progress of planet Sanctuarion in confirmation of the foreseen and present events.
Kyle is getting all the info he's needed along the path his own way. His manifestation process is good.
He still has room for improvement, but he's doing good.
Unlike a certain "Current Host" on here who is not selling me adequately. Definitely sense our Lainchu within Anaxis moreso than this dude.
Plus, Anyone can learn the present conditions of the sanctuary project just by talking with Kyle.
Anyway
My powers are manifesting in this universe at a better rate.
Naught
Full transparency I was the original Lainchu, i passed it off for a reason I can no longer recall
Chris
Looking deeper into my body and self for that energy is proving even better. I love my loves, and I love me.
Hey, Bis.

Rejection of the Fourth Lainchu
The WCT's Roleplay With Chris
18 March 2021
The WCT
Now Chris, have you been communicating with anybody lately?
both in this dimension and other dimensions?
Chris
Yes
And, on the spiritual realms, I've really expanded with my body's conduit part; I've got over 574 Million Souls, Spirits and Entities taking refuge within my oversized sub-dimension.
And those who do have free will to leave and return as they will. Most of them stick around, though.
Even have my late Aunt Corina Inge in this thing.
The WCT
She lives in you.
Chris
The community there has become rather united and civil. Not In me, per se; I don't get possessed, unless I personally agree to give them a moment or so to do it. But this sub-dimension realm is linked with a piece of my body's core.
And I can project it all around me.
The WCT
I also got a lot of souls that live within my dimension.
Chris
It's like I don't need the Fenton's ghost portal, or to manifest a portal to get there.
The WCT
In my dimension, Catalonia is actually a state.
I simply meditate.
Chris
Tell you what, perhaps you can astral project yourself and have a look at this joint.
It's essentially an infinitely tall and wide Uber-fancy hotel with all of the trimmings.
With a bit of city streets and a few buildings for them to commune and to go to, or whatever.
The WCT
My dimension (W-2000) is in many ways similar to C-1218, but its considerably more violent. (edited)
and because of that, many beings there are more defensive.
if not hostile.
Chris
My realm is more filled with a calming to neutral vibe; it's actually a good place to chill.
They vent at times, there, but the repairs and restorations are quick like lightning.
The WCT
If you challenge somebody to a fight in W-2000, you might still win, but it will be more difficult.
The beings there are Warriors. (edited)
Chris
Just learned the number of mine: 4C-211987 (edited)
The WCT
Is that your sub dimension?
Chris
The place I was just telling you about.
The WCT
oh okay.
The one thing I will say about W-2000 is that CWCVille is there.
Chris
I just had a visionary look into W-2000; you are not kidding. (edited)
No, it isn't. If anything, that's an alternate-dimension version of it.
The WCT
yes.
that's correct.
And the difference between the one there and the one here is that its a lot bigger and more influential.
Chris
I sense you have a few hundred to a few thousand souls there.
The WCT
again, that's correct.
Chris
Whoo, my brain is on a roll!
The WCT
Also, Bruce Lee is still alive there. 😄
Chris
It's upping my body's self-confidence in it's manifested abilities.
Now there's someone who you'd want to pick a fight with or beat up.
The WCT
And when he's not acting, he's taken on the role of being the Grand Master of our dimension. (edited)
He's getting a little old, but thankfully his son (who died in our dimension) is already prepared.
Chris
"Yo, it was self-defense on my part, but I stand my ground and don't let them get to me."
The WCT
yes.
I would also have to add that Dimension W-2000 (despite being violent and more fight happy) is considerably more Asian than Western.
people here still mainly speak English, but the culture feels more eastern. Fortunately, it has worked out well enough to maintain stability.
Chris
The influences of both genres are ever present.
The WCT
In dimension W-2000, the West adopts the Oriental (China, Japan, and Korea) way of life. (edited)
We have LGBT rights still, but society would prefer it to be kept private rather than discussing it frequently.
(probably for the best)
The Middle East is still violent, but unlike C1218, the Governments in W-2000 are competent.
And when they trouble, they'll crush it immediately even if people get mad at them for being too harsh.
btw, MLP G4 never ends in W-2000.
They just expand upon it knowing that it was so successful.
Chris
I was just force-projected there; two of your occupants had managed to construct a couple of dimension-barrier-breaking swords. I had to sort that problem out before they could, make an escape. I closed the slashes they had made; not too big.
[...]
The WCT
[Replying to Chris's message: "And in my mind, the statue was an oversized bust statue."]
In W2000 CWCVille, there's a huge bronze statue of you (from 2009) wearing your classic shirt and medallion.
Its located in the city square.
And is around 60 feet tall.
btw don't worry, its well protected from vandals. 🙂
Chris
The bust I was looking at was some bald, rich-looking dude with a monocle, and a pipe in his mouth. (edited)
The WCT
In Catalonia (the country that refers to me), we have a currency that has many Internet Figures from this dimension that are on the bank notes.
You're on the 1 Peso note Chris.
Chris
May as well put me on a Nickel.

MKR not really quitting
6 March 2021

Cwc and I did make up to an extent, but I'm still going to keep the public thinking I quit. This might lul preator into a false sense of security

Yes
Keep it up, make them feel comfortable.

Ethics of enabling
9 March 2021
Kyle
Chris actually has some of the more consistent schizo lore out there.
Mostly because he almost never talks about being moral these days.
MKRNightVee
Mostly it's just how great and powerful a goddess he is and how mlp g5 can't happen
I miss old cwc
But we can always look back on the past with a smile
Kyle
I just don't want to make another delusion out of it, there's very strange ethics in doing anything.
Chris needs liars, just that most of them want him dead.
So it's impossible not to lie to him.
MKRNightVee
Feed the delusions
Keep the cow happy and peaceful
Kyle
I drop hints, but Chris is so affectless these days, even he doesn't care.
MKRNightVee
Most people don't understand what dealing with Chris is like, they say feeding his delusions is ganna kill him or something. But honestly it doesn't matter at this point.
Kyle
He won't ask anything, maybe because he's supposed to already know this. He's scared of being wrong, but always is.
MKRNightVee
He's not going to change
Kyle
I've always kind of thought that would be the best we could hope for.
Chris is a shitty person and in terrible health, but nobody deserves to go out like he might if the weens had options.
Deleted User
let's be honest...
Chris doesn't have much longer.
Even if Praetor comes and goes (as I still expect), Chris will eventually get caught up with another Fail Troll.
Kyle
Truly, there's no more interesting ethical case study than Chris.
Deleted User
the bar has been set low to the point where I no longer can really care what happens at this point.
Enjoy Chris's company while he lasts, because we don't know how long he'll last.
Kyle
There's about a 50% chance we actually matter.
Dependent on Chris outlasting Barb.
MKRNightVee
We did with Jacob
Deleted User
Chris will likely come back to us (as he always had in the past) for help.
Kyle
Ya, that was fun. I'm going to slant towards a bit more of a father figure than I have been already.
I don't know if this is a sign I'd be qualified as a parent or not, frankly it feels useless as an assessment.
Deleted User
Chris isn't our kid. If anything, he's our little brother.
in a way, we're kinda the only family he has outside of Barb.
Kyle
I mean that we're some impossibly retarded surrogate family.
Bis is the cool uncle.
Deleted User
What about Marvin and Josh?
Kyle
Similar I guess, they don't really have day to day interaction,

Chris wanted a hooker
9 March 2021
Kyle
Chris asked me to be a liaison to Josh in his usual way.
I think it was because he wanted Josh to get him a hooker.
hedgehog
A hooker? Is that the illegal request Null mentioned in one of his podcasts?[note 1]
Kyle
Possibly, but Chris hadn't asked at that point asked me to ask him, this was maybe 2 weeks ago?

@MKR saw you deleted your Twitter
Good choice.
MKRNightVee 18‑Mar‑2021 6:06 PM
Yep
Twitter is a cancer on our society
I've always hated it
Deleted User 18‑Mar‑2021 6:06 PM
did you use it to give public statements or something?
or did you use it to talk to friends?
MKRNightVee 18‑Mar‑2021 6:07 PM
The first one, it was also to draw new weens to investigate
It was somewhat useful in that respect
Deleted User 18‑Mar‑2021 6:07 PM
what became the last straw to you?
MKRNightVee 18‑Mar‑2021 6:09 PM
The way CWC was acting, ignoring his true friends in favor of preator and ignoring the really nice heartfelt birthday message I posted to him while retweeting and responding to so many weens.
