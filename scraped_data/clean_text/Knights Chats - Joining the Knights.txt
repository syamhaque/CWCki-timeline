Knights Server Intro
24-28 June 2021
Summary: Members of the Knights of CWC begin joining the WCT's new server, as well as Chris. In the first layer, Chris acknowledges the events that led to the server's creation, and leaves some Merge-related wisdom about improving one's own enlightenment. WCT and myself acknowledge this, and the Fool posts a comic layout guide for Chris, commenting that it might be interesting even though Chris doesn't draw comics anymore. WCT sets a new server icon, and Chris responds to the Fool, stating that he does still draw comics and had drawn over 100 while "in Sonichu's body," and that we would see them upon completion of the Merge. WCT then writes a message intended to inspire everyone, emphasizing moving forward and providing Chris with a safe space. He addresses Chris with male pronouns initially, but edits them to female after I remind him to in the second layer.
In the second layer, WCT explains to the Fool his reasons for splintering from the Watchmen in depth, detailing the poor behavior of the various members, and I chime in every so often to reinforce some of what he is saying about them. WCT expresses eagerness at inviting in other members of the Watchmen not loyal to the "toxic trio," but I urge him to wait and see where everyone's loyalties wind up. He later posts a link to the now-live lolcow.org thread on Naught, which he had collaborated on with user Arm Pit Cream. WCT uses this moment to announce that "the Coup d'etat is underway" and he and the Fool begin posting screenshots of the Watchmen's messages, and Chris's final message from within the Place.

Hey, @everyone.
For starters, in light of the recent events @Neko has been through, and the light shedding on the toxic trio, an announcement with care for now:
To all of you in my flock, I highly encourage each of you to begin and continue your own individual self-work in enlightenment.
For amongst you all, as the Dimension Merge/Collective Shift draws closer upon the main event with the removal of the veil between our universe halves, each of you has your own inner potential and strength.
We have no need for war or quarrel at all with the OCs and individuals of C-197, as I state to all of those individuals in regard to us of 1218.
Unity and a greater strength for our combined Earth and galaxies is at hand.
Need not take arms, but be open for the good in each other.
All superheroes and deities, myself included, and other individuals of military strengths and powers, and the leaders of each nation and countries; on both halves of this whole Earth, we maintain wisdom and peace for the greater whole as best as we are capable of.
It is not perfect, but we are most appreciative and grateful for the understanding and compassion of the general public and flocks there of that we each help, work with, and defend, during these times at hand.
And to you all until my next announcement or insight, I state in positive encouragement to you all: Be safe and well with lots of love.
Thank you.
⚡️💙⚡️
The WCT 06:40 PM
Thank you Chris.
we appreciate it.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 06:40 PM

The Fool 09:59 PM

I like this, its cute.
The Fool 01:56 AM
not bad
I was assuming you'd use a sonichu or rosechu but it works
The WCT 01:57 AM
its Chris Chan Sonichu.
The Fool 01:57 AM
yea
I mean the character sonichu
oh I guess I put "a" in front of that
Chris 12:47 PM
[Replying to "guess chris doesn't draw comics anymore but I thought this might be interesting regardless"]
I do still draw and write my books and whatnot.
I have done a whole bunch during my time in Sonichu’s body; made it beyond book 100.
But, for them to be appreciated at this point, the veil is being removed and the merge completing.

My friends: As painful as the events of the last few days may have been. Let me assure you that while things may look uncertain, I wanted to let you all know that this is a new beginning. It is true that certain people that we've connected with for a while now have turned out to be bad apples, but we should see this as a chance to clean out the more negative parts of the old group along with no longer being a group that recruits people just to backstab them in the end. We are not like that, and we'll do our best to be better than the Watchmen. We won't be perfect, we won't always agree with everything we say with each other, but we will be better. And we will do our part in providing Chris a safe place to hang out and chill. She is our friend, and she is what brings us together. (edited)
#cwc-general (Second Layer)
NOTE: Chris was not directly involved in this conversation.

The WCT 03:20 PM
For now on. Only decent people will be spectating Chris from the Front Row.
25 June 2021
The WCT 11:07 PM
I had enough of the Watchmen. @The Fool
this is a coup.
Keep this between us alright?
The Fool 11:08 PM
got it 👍
don't worry this is far too autistic for me to care about
I just want to shitpost about chris
oh, but what's wrong with the watchment anyway?
The WCT 11:11 PM
[Replying to "oh, but what's wrong with the watchment anyway?"]
simple.
I was doxed and they're lying about it.
The Fool 11:11 PM
lying?
The WCT 11:11 PM
yeah.
You'll see it soon man.
The Fool 11:12 PM
what are they saying?
The WCT 11:12 PM
APC will tell you everything.
The Fool 11:12 PM
in the naught OP?
The WCT 11:12 PM
[Replying to "in the naught OP?"]
yeah.
The Fool 11:12 PM
can't wait for it
ETA?
The WCT 11:13 PM
he's asking me for a voice clip.
The Fool 11:20 PM
so what's Chris' opinion on all this? what's your plan to make him hush up about this/stay loyal to you and not the watchmen?
The WCT 11:21 PM
[Replying to "so what's Chris' opinion on all this? what's your plan to make him hush up about this/stay loyal to you and not the watchmen?"]
I recorded a whole VC with him.
he's on our side.
The Fool 11:21 PM
I hope, you know how easy he is to manipulate 😔
The WCT 11:21 PM
I know that.
however, I showed him all the evidence.
Naught only has words to back himself up.
The Fool 11:22 PM
only takes roleplaying with him to change his convictions regardless of evidence
The WCT 11:22 PM
Chris has been having some rifts lately with Nova and MKR so things aren't what they used to be.
And I even told them about Anni being shitted on and he got angry.
The Fool 11:23 PM
rifts with MKR? I thought she was so nice tho
The WCT 11:23 PM
[Replying to "rifts with MKR? I thought she was so nice tho"]
you don't know the real Meghan.
The Fool 11:23 PM
no and I don't care to
I'm sure we're all amazingly fucked up
The WCT 11:23 PM
I'm trying to get Anaxis (Lainchu) to join, and he'll tell you everything.
he hates Meghan.
26 June 2021
The WCT 01:48 AM
Welcome @Lainchu
Lainchu (Anaxis) 01:49 AM
Hello
The WCT 01:49 AM
I made this server because I wanted to gather the decent people from the place.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 01:50 AM
Must've been a short list, lol
The WCT 01:50 AM
[Replying to "Must've been a short list, lol"]
[REDACTED] has yet to join.
Should I get Marvin?
Lainchu (Anaxis) 01:50 AM
[Replying to "[REDACTED] has yet to join."]
I sent him the invite. Idk if he wants to get involved.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 01:51 AM
[Replying to "Should I get Marvin?"]
Probably should ask [REDACTED] about that one.
The WCT 01:51 AM
[Replying to "I sent him the invite. Idk if he wants to get involved."]
I told him he can wait until its all over.
The Fool 01:51 AM
he probably should if he's as invested in this dumb shit as he says he is
stay on top of everything, you know
The WCT 01:52 AM
I don't know how things will play out, but if all goes as I hope they do, this server will become basically the new place.
should I also invite Para? @The Fool
maybe I should wait.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 01:53 AM
The coming rift will bring out everyone's true loyalties. Probably best to wait.
The WCT 01:53 AM
[Replying to "The coming rift will bring out everyone's true loyalties. Probably best to wait."]
Silvia's on my side, so we already know that.
oh, and I almost forgot.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 01:54 AM
You know them better than I do.
The Fool 01:54 AM
well like I said when I joined the place, I'm just here for the show
The WCT 01:54 AM
Unlike the original Watchmen, I won't allow this group to be known to the public in any circumstances.
The Fool 01:55 AM
good idea
knowledge is power
The WCT 01:55 AM
If Chris has anything interesting to say, he can tell it to you in DMs. @Lainchu
The Fool 01:55 AM
the greatest threat is one you don't know about
The WCT 01:55 AM
otherwise, I want this server to be a nice place to hang out in.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 01:55 AM
[Replying to "If Chris has anything interesting to say, he can tell it to you in DMs. @Lainchu"]
Sure. Although I think he prefers speaking to the group in general.
The WCT 01:56 AM
[Replying to "Sure. Although I think he prefers speaking to the group in general."]
probably.
like I said, the Fool is a member of Kiwi Farms. (or formerly)
he got banned by Null.
nowadays, he's on a obscure site known as lolcow.org.
The Fool 01:58 AM
I'm a Buddhist so I have a vow of honesty so you can trust me.
Of course I could be lying about being a Buddhist
also that doesn't mean I'm a narc so don't worry
The WCT 01:59 AM
lol
The Fool 02:00 AM
whatever makes life easier for everyone 😌
The WCT 02:00 AM
[YouTube link to "Watchmen Call (June 21, 2021)" by TheMoon]
The Fool 02:00 AM
whats this about?
just sauce for naught's voice?
The WCT 02:01 AM
[Replying to "whats this about?"]
MKR invited me into that call.
they were trying to bully/gaslight me into thinking that Naught was innocent.
The Fool 02:03 AM
I see
what did he even dox you for again?
The WCT 02:03 AM
Because he thought I was part of plate gang.
The Fool 02:03 AM
plate gang???
I have to learn more lore?
The WCT 02:03 AM
don't waste your time.
The Fool 02:03 AM
sometimes I wonder if you guys are making this up as you go along
The WCT 02:04 AM
they're some retarded troll group that became irrelevant 2-3 years ago.
The Fool 02:04 AM
so why did he think you were part of it?
The WCT 02:04 AM
[Replying to "so why did he think you were part of it?"]
because Naught's a schizo.
or he just secretly hates me.
The Fool 02:05 AM
interesting
The WCT 02:05 AM
he needs help.
The Fool 02:05 AM
can't find his reasoning? I know he went silent
The WCT 02:06 AM
[Replying to "can't find his reasoning? I know he went silent"]
has he invited you into that new server of his?
[Audio attachment]
Nova talking about getting people to kill themselves.
The Fool 02:07 AM
how new? I was in his server, I left in fear of being mass-banned
The WCT 02:07 AM
[Replying to "how new? I was in his server, I left in fear of being mass-banned"]
house with no doors.
The Fool 02:07 AM
yeah
The WCT 02:07 AM
oh wait.
I'm there. sorry.
Arisu in wonderland.
that's the one.
I'm banned from there.
The Fool 02:08 AM
ummmmm I can't even remember which one was the old and new one
I'm not in any of his servers now tho
The WCT 02:08 AM
[Screenshot of a Discord server called "arisu in wonderland"]
[Screenshot of a Discord server called "Pho's Noodle House"]
here's Naught lying about the server not existing.
[Audio attachment]
The Fool 02:09 AM
yeah I really don't remember. Whatever server I was in when we did the Dom Cruise stream
The WCT 02:09 AM
[Replying to "yeah I really don't remember. Whatever server I was in when we did the Dom Cruise stream"]
that was the house.
The Fool 02:09 AM
yeah I thought so, so no I wasn't in there
The WCT 02:10 AM
I got banned from arisu not long after.
and Naught thinks people don't know the server exists.
in reality though...
APC knows. 😄
The Fool 02:10 AM
nice lol
so Nova is not a very nice person?
The WCT 02:10 AM
dude.
Me and @Lainchu have dealt with him.
he's an Asshole.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 02:11 AM
[Replying to "so Nova is not a very nice person?"]
He is not.
The WCT 02:11 AM
you can't reason with him when he goes on a tantrum.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 02:11 AM
He has this very peculiar way of speaking that I've never quite understood.
The WCT 02:12 AM
he always spergs out about Sockness, Dana, and politics.
dude's also a big racist.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 02:12 AM
At least through texts.
The Fool 02:12 AM
I thought his rants every time chris tweeted was cute but I could kind of get the feeling he's a cranky person
yeah lol
why the fuck do they even talk about sockness in there
who cares
all he does is write tl;drs about aliens and satan
Lainchu (Anaxis) 02:13 AM
Ironic given the massive effort they went to in order to get Chris to stop paying Sockness any mind
The WCT 02:13 AM
Getting Sockness was where the group was at its peak.
it went downhill after Anaxis got accused of snaking for Praetor.
and you know, if Naught didn't want me around anymore, all he had to do was tell me to fuck off.
that's it.
simple as.
but instead, he does this. lol
The Fool 02:16 AM
we wouldn't be here if we all weren't catty women trying to one-up each other
The WCT 02:17 AM
Naught's a snake.
he needs to be exposed.
The Fool 02:18 AM
he seems pretty desperate for friendship
he invited me into the place almost right away
I could have easily been a bad actor
The WCT 02:18 AM
[Replying to "he seems pretty desperate for friendship"]
don't backstab your friends.
its not that hard.
The Fool 02:19 AM
I wonder if he has the name mindset null has with women, "I'm bored with you so I'll find another use for you without your consent"
The WCT 02:19 AM
probably.
dissapointing.
but probably.
The Fool 02:21 AM
I dunno how hard it is to just ignore someone you're bored with, but I'm not manic and wake 35 hours straight
The WCT 02:22 AM
I really wanted to be the guy's friend.
we were close.
The Fool 02:22 AM
I know how it is
The WCT 02:22 AM
I hope he gets help, but its too late for him and I.
not even a single apology will save this.
The Fool 02:22 AM
the sad truth is, if you're insecure about yourself, you can't love anyone else
The WCT 02:23 AM
Naught should've been a leftist.
he would've been so much better tbh.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 02:23 AM
A shit person is a shit person, regardless of their political leanings.
The WCT 02:24 AM
it would've helped him cope with himself.
but yes, he's still awful.
If Marvin joins and wonders what happened, I'll explain everything to him.
The Fool 02:24 AM
in the future, give this book to everyone you meet
[File attachment "The_Courage_to_be_Disliked_How_to_Change_Your_Life_and_Achieve_Real_Happiness_by_Ichiro_Kishimi_Fumi.epub"]
tells you how to stop being insecure
maybe then they won't want to backstab you later
The WCT 02:27 AM
The Watchmen are dead tbh.
I wouldn't call this group the "New Watchmen" or what.
The Fool 02:29 AM
my friend once asked for a DnD campaign name and I said "Tactical Tickle Tykes" and he rejected it so that's still available
The WCT 02:29 AM
@The Fool do you still talk to Naught btw?
when was the last time you and him talked?
The Fool 02:30 AM
nope, DM'd him but he didn't respond
umm, probably last time he spoke in the place
The WCT 02:30 AM
let me DM you something.

Arm Pit Cream.

I can see that, but is that you or someone else?
The WCT 02:57 AM
[Replying to "I can see that, but is that you or someone else?"]
parts of it? yes.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 02:58 AM
Okay. I was a little confused because it isn't written directly from your perspective.
Seems like it's being written by another ex-Watchman.
The WCT 02:58 AM
Naught also would've wanted this btw.

[Replying to "Null was the first one to comment, lol"]
no.
that's a parody account.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 03:00 AM
Ah, should've figured
I forget that I'm not looking at KF
The Fool 03:00 AM
I made the same mistake on OF lol
The WCT 03:00 AM
welp, the Coup d'etat is underway.
If they fail to recapture Chris's heart after this, its done.
they can talk shit about me all they want behind my back, they deserve it.
The Watchmen are dead.
The Fool 03:05 AM

what the fuck is big boy doxxing
LOL that cwc voice recording at the end
The Fool 03:23 AM
tbh this is kinda how I feel looking back on joining the place and here
[GIF of a man walking into a room with pizzas, and the room is on fire.]
not unexpected tho
The WCT 03:24 AM
[Replying to "not unexpected tho"]
Chris predicted this btw.
no joke.
The Fool 03:25 AM
I'm sure he has enough experience with this stuff
I know this aint his first rodeo with internet tardhandlers
and I know they all had infighting too
and despite his inability to stop himself, I know he's incredibly weary of online communities
The WCT 03:27 AM
my strategy for Chris is this:
let him be Chris.
The Fool 03:28 AM
I think thats what most people have tried, maybe you should be more specific
The WCT 03:29 AM
like don't intervene in the things he takes part in.
The Fool 03:29 AM
from what I understand, it's a full-time job to keep him entertained and making sure he doesn't look for enablers elsewhere to manipulate him
The WCT 03:29 AM
[Replying to "from what I understand, it's a full-time job to keep him entertained and making sure he doesn't look for enablers elsewhere to manipulate him"]
i don't care anymore tbh.
Chris is an internet person like all of us.
The Fool 03:30 AM
that's probably the best choice, just don't be too broken up when he's told to turn against you
but he's really not worth the time and effort he's demanding
The WCT 03:31 AM
According to APC, Naught's dox might've been discovered.
The Fool 03:31 AM
shame I can't get him to read The Courage to be Disliked (I haven't tried to get him to but I know he won't), might make him feel less need to be manipulated
oo
The WCT 03:31 AM
this is it.
The Fool 03:32 AM
he did a great OP btw
but yeah I would invite Marvin and [REDACTED], even if they don't accept, you know, at least be open with them so they're not worried about failtrolling
But I don't know why they wouldn't accept when you have Chris' blessing
course it's up to you, just giving my two thunderbolt emoji blue heart emoji thunderbolt emoji
The WCT 03:36 AM
All I need is [REDACTED] and Marvin.
maybe Para as well, but that's it.
The Fool 03:36 AM
not even sure who para is
lol the thread got featured
like, the first featured thread? I don't remember a thread ever getting featured
that para dude's got almost no chat messages in the place but I see they drink so thats based

its fine.
if you want an explanation on what happened, let me know.

Hello Marvin
The WCT 12:10 PM
now all we need is [REDACTED] and this place is good. lol
again, I'll ask Para but future circumstances will decide her place in here.
The Fool 12:23 PM
oh yeah you wanna set up that tweet bot?
I don't use twitter

hahahaha
[Part of the final message Chris would send to the Watchmen.]
what is he trying to do
nooo chris stop it hahaha
[Continuation of the same message by Chris.]

this is it.
you taking screenshots? @The Fool
The Fool 06:21 PM
yea
The WCT 06:21 PM
Chris is literally BTFO'ing Meghan and Nova right now.
The WCT 06:41 PM
do you have any of the old emotes from the place? @Lainchu
we'll add them here if possible.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 06:42 PM
I didn't save any of them
I have a few in the cwcki server, but...some of them are a little offensive to chris lol
I have those Sonichu emotes, I'll add them later
The WCT 06:43 PM
[Replying to "I have those Sonichu emotes, I'll add them later"]
i'll grant you the ability to add them.
[1 👍 reaction]
Chris has clearly taken a side in this ordeal.
its not over yet, but things are looking promising.
The Fool 07:11 PM
any particular reason he's staying in the place?
did you tell him not to leave or does he simply not know what to do
The WCT 07:12 PM
[Replying to "did you tell him not to leave or does he simply not know what to do"]
he's observing.
he intends on leaving soon though.
Only when things heat up will he go.
Same with [REDACTED].
Lainchu (Anaxis) 07:18 PM
What about you?
The WCT 07:19 PM
[Replying to "What about you?"]
if Chris goes, I'll follow.
but I might get banned before that happens. lol
Lainchu (Anaxis) 07:25 PM
What should the server icon be?
The WCT 07:26 PM
[Replying to "What should the server icon be?"]
it should be something related to Chris.
something wholesome.
something that would give a welcoming vibe.
The Fool 07:26 PM
maybe some good fanart?

the place used a Kiwi Avatar.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 07:27 PM
Well, he wouldn't care about that. He thinks his art is a masterpiece.

@The Fool fun fact:
[Screenshot of KF user AnOminous replying to a post by Naught.]
Naught claimed to me he was AnOminous.
The Fool 07:28 PM
lol fuckin for real? their personalities couldn't be any further
The WCT 07:28 PM
I wish I was kidding.
The Fool 07:28 PM
I hope you didn't fall for that for even a second otherwise I'm going to make fun of you
The WCT 07:28 PM
it was retarded.
The Fool 07:29 PM
HE'S NOT DENYING IT OH NOOOO 😭
The WCT 07:29 PM
their typing styles are too different and AnOminous was also a higher-tier poster.
He claimed to me that he, Pluto, and others shared the account.
Pluto even jokingly said he'd be willing to give me the log info to that account.
oh, and for those that don't remember. Pluto was Val.
@Lainchu who I'm sure you remember was a nut bag.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 07:30 PM
He was a piece of work
The Fool 07:31 PM
I don't know who either of those people are
The WCT 07:31 PM
Pluto (Val) was like an on and off switch.
sometimes he was good, sometimes he was bad.
he did openly admit to me he was nuts.
The Fool 07:31 PM
at this point you don't need to say anything more than that you knew them and I kind of get the picture
you sure do follow a weird crowd
The WCT 07:32 PM
Meet Tom. (Val/Pluto) (edited)
