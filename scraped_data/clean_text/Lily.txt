Saga
KwaiiSandbag
Lily is a former enabler who got involved with Chris as KwaiiSandbag’s partner during the KwaiiSandbag calls, where she also posed as KwaiiSandbag’s psychic apprentice. She identifies as a male-to-female transgender.[1] Lily took part in the last three recorded calls with Chris but mostly took a back seat during the conversations, asking only basic questions. She stated in the calls that this was because she believed that KwaiiSandbag and Chris were on a "higher spiritual level" than her. Lily later admitted when being interviewed by Anaxis that they partly got involved for amusement and their intentions weren’t entirely to help Chris get out of his Sonichu delusions.

Interview with Lily
On 26 March 2021, Anaxis interviewed Lily, the person who participated in the last 3 calls, and was part of the group chat with KwaiiSandbag and Chris, about their involvement in the affair. This interview would be released a few days later, on 29 March. Lily's messages are color-coded magenta, and Anaxis's are color-coded orange.
Lily's Role
What was your role when talking to Chris? Who or what did you present yourself as?
My role was essentially sandbag’s “psychic understudy” of sorts
His apprentice I guess, I presented myself as if I had recently discovered my innate psychic powers but was inexperienced with them
Coordination (or lack thereof)
Did you and Sandbag ever coordinate what you were going to say to or talk with Chris about before beginning your calls?
Not really, we kind of just winged it. Sometimes I would text him to see if I could/should ask something, and we had a couple things to ask/“psychic” stunts to pull that never came to fruition
Lily's Aims
What were your personal aims in talking to Chris? What did you hope to accomplish?
To be honest, it was pure curiosity. I had no ill intentions towards Chris, but I wouldn’t say it was out of wanting to help. I realize now it was probably not the best thing to do, but I don’t really feel guilty about it
I had no idea how bad chris’ mental state was
I hadn’t paid attention to Chris for a few years prior
So you were basically just along for the ride that Sandbag had set up? Because he explicitly stated that he wanted to help Chris.
Essentially yes. I can’t speak for Sandbag’s intentions but there was definitely an element of us just thinking it was kind of funny
Ultimately though I think we did help her get out of the sonichu bs
But it definitely wasn’t just pure wanting to help her on either of our part
How the Relationship Ended
What do you think caused the relationship with Chris to end?
I’m not sure. It might have been us not entirely being prepared for the fifth call, and Chris getting suspicious because of that
I noticed Chris started to become more flakey and unresponsive after she “returned” to her body
Sandbag said that one day, it just "ended" and that Chris unadded you on Discord.
I also noticed Chris started becoming more flakey and unresponsive to us after she “returned” to her body
Yes. We had the fifth call and then a few days later asked to schedule another one
We got no response and then I checked and saw Chris unadded me
Do you think it was because of Chris's suspicion of you guys?
Either that or she got whatever she wanted from us and lost interest
I definitely don’t think Chris knew the whole time. That’s total nonsense
