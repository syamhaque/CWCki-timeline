I have no clue who this guy is, but I'm getting some good vibes. Fill me in and I'll do what I can. Jump 04:24, 21 June 2009 (CEST)
He's doing good things. He's a celebrity on #sonichu, among other things, mostly because he knows Chris IRL and is friends with the jerkops at Fashion Square Mall. More will be revealed in good time. --Champthom 04:48, 21 June 2009 (CEST)
M'kay, I'm a patience guy. I'll just brace for epic. Jump 04:51, 22 June 2009 (CEST)

PodMonkey is out of the scene for now and most of what he's done won't come to light because of obvious concerns, so what do you all think of just moving this to a subsection of the Trolls article? --Champthom 12:18, 2 September 2009 (CEST)
I agree. It should be moved. --BabyGotBack 03:49, 27 December 2009 (CET)
Merged.
See Trolls.
