Title: The Place chats - Angefly

================================================================================

NOTE: Chris was not directly involved in this conversation.
On 23 February 2021, in the second layer of the Watchmen's Discord server The Place, MKRNightVee discussed creating a new OC named Angefly in an attempt to get Chris's attention and inspire him to make some lore.
When Chris does not quickly respond to the Angefly OC, MKR worries that Chris is ignoring her and that he may be done with her. Paranoia sets in as Kyle and MKR wonder if Praetor's Caden or former The Place member Anaxis may be interfering, and Kyle suggests to probe if anyone is talking about MKR behind her back.
Later in the day, Chris responds to MKR's texts, stating that he had been busy that day.

[Links to Chris's tweet about Magi-Chan and the Gate Crystal.]
At least he's back to playing with toys.
MKRNightVee
Magichan with a crystal up his ass
I'm happy he's doing something at least
I'm going to try a new approach to get his attention. It might help him focus on something different and make some lore or whatever

The Fake and Phony Medallions are back on sale.
I can't bare to look at them, they're far worse than Chris's original design. (edited)

Wow, really burnt the candle at both ends.
And of course they all sell out in an hour.
Deleted User
What's the server they linked?
Kyle
Didn't.
Comes with their BS gold medallions.
MKRNightVee
It's just gold colored paint...

@MKR Any updates?
MKRNightVee
Cwc wont respond to me
I've texted him and I'm pretty sure he's ignoring me
Kyle
Cute.
MKRNightVee
I thought trying to make new pokemon might be a fun wat to interact
Kyle
Angefly sounds like angina to me.
MKRNightVee
But maybe he's just done with me
Kyle
Odd, maybe Caden is being a fag today.
MKRNightVee
Maybe
Between him and Anaxis
Kyle
Texted me about 4 hours ago when I said something about the birthday.
MKRNightVee
There are lots of people who aggressively hate me in cwc's ear.
I'll text a happy birthday message tomorrow
But if hes done with me I don't think I'll be very helpful
Kyle
Maybe probe if someone is talking about you behind your back?
MKRNightVee
Yeah

MKRNightVee

Kyle
I did ask if he was alright, maybe that did it.
MKRNightVee
He's not mad he's just been busy today
Yeah
Kyle
Tetris or another meeting?
MKRNightVee
I'm asking so we'll see what he says
Kyle
At least Barb doesn't have to wait this long for her sandwiches.
MKRNightVee
Lol
We hope
No details
He's just ganna go to bed
Kyle
Kinda cheap.
Lainchu (The 4th Lainchu)
[posts an emote]
MKRNightVee
Yep
Kinda cold but at least he replied at all
Lainchu (The 4th Lainchu)
Looking at those messages, I think he's still a little mad. But he's making progress.
give him a little more time, he'll be willing to talk more.
