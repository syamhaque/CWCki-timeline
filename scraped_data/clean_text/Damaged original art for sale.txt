Hello everyone, this is Christine Chandler coming to you live from home once again. Now, uh, from my recent painting projects I had an accident. [holds up stained pages] I spilled some paint on... my sc— my hand drawn cover of Sonichu #14, as well as the first three pages, so I'm gonna be re— I'm gonna be tracing and redrawing these four items. So at this point, I'm going to be putting these up on eBay. So, if any of y'all would like s— something that was originally hand drawn with me from amongst my books... now's a good time, heh. Even though it's a bit damaged, but still... you know how it is with artists, that's what makes it more unique. And I'll personally put a certificate of authenticity on all these, and these'll come in a page sleeve. So, step right up and... pay some good money for a little bit more of something authentic from me. [thumbs up] Thank you and have an awesome day.
