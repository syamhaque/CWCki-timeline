Chris in August 2023.
August was the eighth month of 2023. August most notably saw the rather anticlimactic end to the Jail Saga, with Chris's incest charges being officially dismissed by the court on the 25th. Otherwise though, the month also saw Chris's return to the Internet for the first time in over 2 years, with him being sighted on several gaming services and social media platforms he used to use prior to his August 2021 arrest. As usual, Chris was also spotted in public several times throughout the month.
