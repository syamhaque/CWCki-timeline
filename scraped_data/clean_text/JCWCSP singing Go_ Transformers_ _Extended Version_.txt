Description
I am singing the Go, Transformers! song, personally.
Lyrics:
Transformers! Go Transformers! More than meets the eye. GO Transformers! Robots in disguise.
Autobots and Guardians defending the Earth and everyone, amidst the Chaos and evil's wrath. Fighting the evil forces of the Decepticons and Renegades, keeping them off their dark path.
The city of Cwcville is defended by the forces of good with the help of Chris Chan and the Sonichus and Rosechus. Infinite electrical power tempts the evil, so they call on the power of Psychic and Elements with their might. And when the evil is tall like a con, the Bots stand to defend and fight.
Go, Transformers! Go Transformers! More than meets the eye. GO Transformers! Robots in disguise.
Son-Chu leads his team, after the years of training on Cybertron. They keep watch for everyone’s safety. Knowing well of the battles and fights before them, keeping them well and alert.
Keeping on their feet, wheels and wings, they know to do right for the lives of all sentients. Til All Are One, the Matrix and Allspark show the future of the past. The wisdom of the Primes and ages guide and show the way. And when it becomes a dark hour, they light it up with the power of their sparks.
Go, Transformers! Go Transformers! More than meets the eye. Go, Transformers! Robots in disguise.
Mighty Robots, Mighty Vehicles and Beasts; they know how to fight from millennia in the least. Brotherly Rivalries... Lost Loves... Survival on Energy... Cybertron and Primus... Strong with Aura!
Go, Transformers! Go, Transformers! More than the meets the eye. Go, Transformers!
Lyrics inspired by Hasbro and Tonka; written by Jesus Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu Prime.
