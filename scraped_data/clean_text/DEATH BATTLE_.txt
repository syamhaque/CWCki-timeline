Death Battle (stylized as DEATH BATTLE!) is a web series that started in 2010, created by ScrewAttack!, the show primarily focuses on fights between fictional characters which are animated and commentated episodically. Chris is a self-proclaimed "long time fan" of the show,[1] and often gave his thoughts and asked for revisions of episodes to be done when he didn't like or agree with an episode's winner. Being a fan of the show since at least 2014, and as recent as 2024, combined with its imaginative universe crossover nature, Death Battle possibly indirectly fueled Chris's delusions.
History
On 20 April 2014, Chris left an episode suggestion comment on the Starscream VS Rainbow Dash episode:
I would really like to see a battle between MLP's Discord and Seuss' The Grinch. Would Discord instill joy into the Grinch, or would the Grinch grinch Discord? I would watch that over and over.﻿
In July 2014, Chris explained art he drew, writing that he took inspiration from a Death Battle episode:
Hey [omitted],
I have given the matter a Lot of thought, and I ended up drawing a three-piece set for you (a bonus, considering lack of background for Classic Pokemon Battle Style). I felt it a mismatch to pit Super Vs. Regular initially, so I took creative license to make Super and Ultimate Fury into Mega Evolutions for the turn-based gaming format. Also, taking a tip from ScrewAttack's Vegeta Vs. Shadow & Mario Vs. Sonic "Death Battle" episodes (on YouTube) to figure which Mega Evo. Form would last longer, and who could stand battling the other longer... Chaos Object Energy doesn't last as long as a woman's scorn, and considerably finds the end result in reasonable theory. But I would not see death to either anyway, because the Primes, Sonichu & Rosechu, are Not only Sweethearts and Married with Children, the couple are Best Friends with each other. You care, feel, understand and have true compassion for the other;... I would not want to hurt them in the least.
Do you understand?
Have a good day.

On 16 September 2015, Chris briefly gave his thoughts on the Donkey Kong VS Knuckles episode:
It still grinds my gears that in ScrewAttack.com's Death Battle, Donkey Kong slam bams Knuckles for the win.[3]
On 7 December 2016, Chris briefly gave his thoughts and prediction on a recently announced Death Battle episode in a Facebook post:
Lastly, On ScrewAttack: Deadpool Vs Pinkie Pie?! WTF?! Are they Actually going to take the creepy pasta into account? >:( Ugh. Pinkie will Lose against Deadpool. That is Sad.[4]
However, when the episode released on 21 December, Chris was pleasantly surprised, posting about it on Facebook:
This turned out to be a really Fun "DooBattie". I'm feeling down with another cold, but this video made me smile.[5]
On 7 March 2017, Chris posted to Twitter about using a food package delivery service called Blue Apron, due to Death Battle being sponsored by them:
I just got and made our first meal from Blue Apron: Soy-Glazed Chicken. The packing method is well done and organized. Wrapped in a cool foil lining in a box, the meats were surrounded by large ice packs. And they have a recycling program for the trash. Anyway, all of the premeasured ingredients were enclosed, the instructions were worded good, and it all came out real good.
Try it for yourself, and get three free meals with a two meal purchase, thanks to ScrewAttack with blueapron.com/deathbattle.[6]
On 7 February 2018, Chris replied to Equestria Daily's tweet on a Death Battle between Twilight Sparkle and Raven:[7]
Wow! Yes! Princess Twilight and Raven! @tarastrong must be loving this! I am rooting for Twilight in the battle, though. Sorry, Raven; you're still awesome.😊
Raven was the winner.
On 7 December 2018, Chris posted on Twitter to ScrewAttack, directing his "upset feelings" over Super Mario beating Sonic The Hedgehog to them, urging them to revise the episode:
Hey, @ScrewAttack; long time fan. I am feeling upset. Sonic WINS against Mario, No Matter What; you all even said that in the original Death Battle between the two. And to say Otherwise in your recent episode is outlandish! I do not want to feel upset at anyone or anything,...
...especially at Mario, because it is not his fault he was granted too many Power-Ups throughout his lifetime, and I do not want to risk ending up in war with Blanc over something so trivial.
BUT, I do know who, moreover, to direct my upset feelings towards:...
...All Of You at ScrewAttack, for Planting That Damn Blasphemy of Mario Winning against Sonic. As CPU Blue Heart of the Commodore Consoles, Comma and Cwcville, I urge you all to Revise That Death Battle Episode towards the ending that Should BE, Please.
I look forward to the revised and edited video of your 100th Death Battle Episode, as soon as possible. Thank You.

While roleplaying as Magi-Chan on 12 September 2019, Chris mentioned how upset he was over Sonic losing again on Twitter:
Ah. You’re a fan of the @DEATHBATTLE YouTube series as well? We and @CPU_CWCSonichu enjoy the works that have gone into their work. Christine was most Rage Quit on the most unfortunate 100th Episode with the second round between Sonic and Mario. Seriously: Sonic should have won.[9]
In a YouTube livestream on 26 October 2023, Chris says he has watched the Bill Cipher VS Discord episode, adding that it was a shame that Discord lost.[10]
In a YouTube livestream on 14 December 2023, Chris gave his thoughts on the Frieza VS Megatron episode after a donor asked him.[11] He says it was "fairly well-balanced" and says he doesn't care about Frieza's details, but the match was "fair enough."
On 2 March 2024, Chris did a YouTube livestream in which he watched YouTube from a playlist of his favorite videos.[12] Two out of the thirty-two videos are Death Battle episodes, specifically Starscream VS Rainbow Dash and Deadpool VS Pinkie Pie.
On 14 March 2025, while playing Sonic '06 on livestream, Chris mentioned Death Battle. "Okay, I can definitely see this reasoning on how Silver can beat Trunks in a Death Battle..."[13]
