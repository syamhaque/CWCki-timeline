================================================================================

In December 2008, Chris thanks us for helping him win.
December was the twelfth and final month of 2008. During this month, Chris talked a lot with his fans in several Q & A sessions on IRC, we learned about his fecal leakage, and he won the Guitar Hero contest. As the year drew to a close, one thing was certainly clear: whatever trolling Chris went through this year was nothing compared to what he would have to face in the next one.
