Everfree Northwest
6 June 2021
Chris
Hey, @everyone
So sorry for not being on as much, but my interdimensional work and efforts, as y’all know, do weigh on me, but it is worth it.
Also, the self-healing and loving is progressing very well.
For the moment, @MKR, Meghan! 😊
You will have a Local Brony Convention you can personally attend.
[Chris links to an Equestria Daily article about Everfree Northwest]
It is in Washington State.
Bit short notice with me, But on the likelihood of abundances, I’ll see if the trip will be possible.

MKRNightVee
I'm going to do it
Pretty sure jersh knows who I am and if he doesn't oh well
I need those rekhaps
Jersh can go fuck himself goy
The WCT
now you see why Naught in recent times has turned against Josh.
MKRNightVee
I already knew
The WCT
its weird because a shit ton of people on Kiwi Farms have alts themselves.
Kyle
I still respect his ethics.
MKRNightVee
He singled out anon because hes a dirty jew cunt.
Kyle
Maybe a bit egotistical, but I still see a reason.
The WCT
Josh in recent years isn't the same Josh people have come to know and love.
MKRNightVee
Neither is Chris.
The WCT
exactly.
MKRNightVee

Still love this one.
MKRNightVee
Ye
You sing it good
Kyle
Do I seriously not suck at singing?
MKRNightVee
No
The WCT
It was because of Chris that Josh got his early clout. So I think it would be appropriate for Chris to return the favor. lol
Kyle
I mean, given my paranoia seems to follow the usual nolens volens sense...
I am not going to say useless shit about someone who I still respect.
MKRNightVee
Eh
I'm just butthurt anon go banned
Kyle
Who does it help?
MKRNightVee
I'll get over it but right now I'm mad
