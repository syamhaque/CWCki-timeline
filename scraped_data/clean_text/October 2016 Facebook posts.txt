Still banned from Walmart
2 October at 8:33 am
The #Walmart of #Ruckersville, #VA, USA, has pressed a ban against me Five Years Ago for a minor misbehavior that was a result from a single bad day. I have personally tried to resolve the matter with a detailed document, and the management has refused to sign it, accepting that he has received and read it in the very least. This Walmart is hereby #Discriminating against the #LGBTQ, as well as people with #autism, and the employees and persecuting management are lowlife corporate Scum, equal to #DonaldTrump. The #HRC will hear of this posthaste.
Stay Away from this Walmart, and do not buy anything from there, as they are uncompassionate, immoral people.
Thank you.

Still banned from Best Buy
2 October at 11:50 am
The #BestBuy of #Charlottessville, #VA, USA, has pressed a ban against me Two Years Ago for an incident that has never transpired piror to the date when they dispelled me from the store, at said store, whatsoever (prior December 26, 2014. They also refuse to present video/recorded, date-labeled evidence to said event that never happened there. I have personally tried to resolve the matter with a detailed document, and the management has not only refused to read it or sign it, accepting that he has received and read it in the very least. The management was super hard-headed and stubborn, even after a five-minute discussion, including the request of presenting said visual evidence. I have tried very hard to be civil and polite, but these people would not let me get a word in edge-wise. And I did have to eventually counter their verbal abuse with hardest eye contact and louder attack. He, amongst them, has attacked me first, Persecuting unjustly verbally and with physical invasion of my personal space. This Best Buy is hereby #Discriminating against the #LGBTQ, as well as people with #autism, and the employees and persecuting management are lowlife corporate Scum, equal to #DonaldTrump. The #HRC will hear of this posthaste.
Stay Away from this Best Buy, and do not buy anything from there, as they are uncompassionate, immoral people.

Still banned from GameStop
3 October at 4:05 pm
The #GameStop, #129, of #Charlottessville, #VA, USA, has pressed a ban against me Two Years Ago for a minor misbehavior that was a result from a single bad day. I have personally tried to resolve the matter with a detailed document, and the management has not only refused to read it or sign it, accepting that he has received and read it in the very least. The management was super hard-headed and stubborn, they would not let me get a word in, edgewise. Most Uncouth, and their actions of blocking me out, looking to unrequitedly call the police. I have tried very hard to be civil and polite, but these individuals have forced me to make this critical review against their store. And I did have to counter their verbal abuse with hardest eye contact and louder attack. They have made the First offensive verbal Attack against me. This GameStop is hereby #Discriminating against the #LGBTQ, as well as people with #autism, and the employees and persecuting management are lowlife corporate Scum, equal to #DonaldTrump. The #HRC will hear of this posthaste.
Stay Away from this GameStop and do not buy anything from there, as they are uncompassionate, immoral people.
Thank you.

A philosophical question
Chris poses a fatuous "philosophical" question. Kim replies with a remarkably barbed tirade.
7 October at 1:22 am
I have a philosophical question to open for all: if you could build one, both of which would lead into the skies towards the heavens; would you build the Stairway or the Ladder to Heaven?
Perhaps one method of climbing is easier than the other? Or perhaps the task of building one with such support would be more difficult than the other?
Perhaps your individual answer may say something about you as a person. A lot to think about.
Comments:
Kim Wilson
This is not, at all, a good philosophical question. You're just asking your audience to muse upon physical limitations. Adding the "to heaven" part just makes it seem whimsical, without adding any actual substance to your question. You're effectively asking your audience to decide between taking local roads or taking the freeway.
It doesn't say anything about someone as a person. It's just a question about efficiency.
Kim Wilson
Christine Weston Chandler Here's a much better philosophical question: what if you could suddenly cure your autism? The positive consequence is that you could get on with your life now. It might even cure your horrible gender dysphoria. But the negative consequence is that you'd then understand all the faults you made over the years.
You'd realize how you screwed up with all the girls you've been with, especially (*especially*) Megan and Heather.
You'd realize the truth behind your criminal charges.
You'd realize the truth behind why you're banned from tons of places in town.
You'd basically have full understanding of all your fuckups. I'd imagine that'd be pretty horrifying. But at the same time, you'd have the tools to start fixing things.
Would you choose to get rid of your autism and face the truth behind the curtain?
It'd be kind of like the matrix. You'd be seeing the real world for the first time.
Fluffle Puff Tales

This is Super Cute and Fun.

How many licks?
12 October at 7:37 pm
How many licks does it take? A college has answered that. 3481 licks without biting.
Pmurt should take parodies in jest
Chris commented on a Lizzy the Lezzy post about Donald Trump's reaction to an SNL parody of himself.
17 October at 7:55 am
If he can't take a parody of himself in jest and not as a direct hit to his ego, he is definitely not mature; more like a spoiled baby brat.
Chris has a cold
17 October at 7:56 am
feeling sick.
Well, I have a cold in my throats at its worst yesterday and today. Chicken Noodle Soup, fluids and rest for me today.
Have a good and safe day.
Sexual assault allegations against Trump
Chris commented on a Lizzy the Lezzy post about the sex assault allegations against Donald Trump.
17 October at 8:01 am
Oh, My God! What a real sadistic bas****!
Confederate flag vs LGBT flag
Chris commented on a Lizzy the Lezzy post about a Trump supporter's flag.
17 October at 8:02 am
That imagery alone Pisses Me Off!
"Chritobel" is Trump
17 October at 8:27 am
I just realized something: the "Chritobel" in the book, "The Girl Who Fought The World"; THAT character is Donald Trump in a perverted nutshell. Vivian Gee portrayed Trump most accurately.
Note: "Chritobel" in the book is Christopher, aka Chris.
Memory of GamerGate
Chris had seen his own post from 2014, due to Facebook's On This Day Memory feature, and shared it.

Chris dislikes Trolls (the movie)
28 October at 3:49 pm
With the movie, #Trolls, from #DreamWorks, I wonder if this is going to not be one of DreamWorks' better projects, because of making Trolls to be a positive icon, followed by in ill-relation, internet trolls. I hate Internet Trolls and #CyberBullies.
