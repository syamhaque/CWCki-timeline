================================================================================

This article is still yet to be completed due to stress. We get a lot of stressful torture in our lives that makes us crash into slumber. Given that inspiration is a big variable, and we may have been lacking of it, this article will be completed as soon as possible, at our own pace... HONEST!
It is no secret that Chris spends a healthy portion of his day watching television shows. His preferences become apparent not only because he will constantly force you to listen to him talk about them, but also because Chris, in his infinite originality, likes to take phrases and sentences from shows and use them verbatim in his everyday speech. As a sequel to the CWC-isms page, this article attempts to list all of these occurrences, especially those he has used repeatedly.
