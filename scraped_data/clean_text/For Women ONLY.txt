Chris's newest attraction photo
Now in color!
For Women ONLY is Chris's tenth addition to the Flipnote Hatena, posted on 30 June 2010.
When his three attempts to post his infamous water maze dream failed, Chris went for a more subtle approach, calling out every female member of the site that has ever put a message in his works. Once again, he attempts to get others to tag in — i.e., edit the note to add their own thoughts — but Chris, paragon of intelligence that he his, locked his creation to edits.
In typical Chris fashion, not only is he completely unable to keep his love quest offline like he promised, he falls into the "honesty" trap and announces there are "online derogatories" about him, thereby ensuring that any passing boyfriend-free girls are going to look them up.
Also, if you look at the responses from the female users of Flipnote Hatena, you'll notice that many of them say "What's going on?" or "You look old!" or "Flipnote is NOT a dating service!" Chris is already getting told off by da ladies, most of whom are in their tweens and early teens.
Not surprisingly, the video was taken off of Flipnote Hatena. But not before it got preserved for historical purposes!
