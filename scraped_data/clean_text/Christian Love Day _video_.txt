"Christian Love Day" is a video uploaded on 23 February 2010 to commemorate Christian Love Day, Chris's self-created holiday, which just so happens to fall on his birthday. In the video, he recites a speech copied from the science-fiction movie Independence Day.
When this video was first uploaded to YouTube, many people noticed that someone else is is holding the camera. This would become more clear when Chris revealed the personal change he alludes to here, in which we meet the visitor who apparently brought his own camera with him to Chris's house.
The quality of the footage in this video is decidedly clear, perhaps the clearest we've ever seen Chris at this point in time, as his mysterious guest owned a better camera.

Transcript
[pause] Good morning. In less than an hour, Sonichu fans from here will join others from around the world as you will be witnessing the largest personal change in the history of mankind. Mankind... That word should have new meaning for us all today. We cannot be consumed by our petty differences anymore. We will be united in our common interests. Perhaps it is fate that today is Metsico's flllag day. And we will once again be saluting an image of our freedom. Not just from trolling, loneliness, or persecution, but also from heartbreak. We are fighting for our right to love, to be honest, and when the sun sets today, the twenty-fourth of February will no longer be known as only a Metsican holiday, but as today Sonichu fans declared in one vwoice, "We will not go quietly into the night! We will not vanish without a fight! We are going to live on! We are going to survive, to celebr--today we celebrate our CHRISTIAN LOVE DAY!"
