================================================================================

Delusion disclosure: This article or section takes place during Chris's phase of role-playing as Sonichu. He may refer to his Christine Chandler personality and physical body in the third person by using terms such as "mama".
On 2 February 2021, Chris discussed in the Watchmen Discord server The Place about piezoelectric crystals and whether they could help him open an interdimensional portal. He posted a clickbait article
on the matter as reference. Chris also uploaded messages between himself and an unknown person in which Chris concluded that a taser to the Gate Crystal and Celestial Key quartz crystals would unlock the portal and result in the Dimensional Merge.
The Watchmen expressed skepticism at this, to which Chris made flippant responses.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Hey, @Nova and @everyone, what do you all know about piezoelectric stones and crystals and how to make tangible interdimensional portals with them?

Kyle
I know about piezoelectrics
Chris (as Sonichu)
Do tell, please.
I’m racking your brain with a good purpose today.
😊⚡️
Kyle
The idea that mechanical deformation releases an electric charge, tangentially relevant to some advanced but rare branches of materials science.
Deformation allowing a charge to essentially be stored in a mechanical means, but naturally that poses problems for almost any application.
Mostly because the medium also degrades rapidly in use.

as far as i know they are used to create a spark

Simple and good initial answer.
Kyle
They're used for simple electric starters because they're cheaper than batteries.
But very much scale limited because of that.
Maybe there's some possible capacitor design, but the grade of the material would have to be flawless, the scale needed would be impractical and the service life would still be horrible, and unreliable given how point defects work.
Chris (as Sonichu)
I will also share this article I found online today: https://www.gaia.com/article/did-our-ancestors-know-how-to-open-a-portal-to-another-dimension
Kyle
Some transducer designs have tried to use them, but are either only suitable for microelectronics or vastly outclassed by better conventional designs.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Hence my use of the word of the day: piezoelectric.
Kyle
There's that rainbow thing in China, but everyone tries to tie that to earthquakes when it isn't.
Chris (as Sonichu)
[quote's Kyle's "There's that rainbow thing in China, but everyone tries to tie that to earthquakes when it isn't." line]
Curious.
Kyle
Just specific meteorology.
Low lying cloud formations with significant volumes of ice.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Rainbow mountains; awesome.
Kyle
Just clouds, there's no statistical correlation with earthquakes.
As for this article, it doesn't have any definite terms, doesn't explain the significance of the events they were attributing these too (I assume maybe CBR)
So, positrons or some other transient antiparticle.
Val
[quotes Chris's "Rainbow mountains; awesome." line]
is it a double rainbow though?
KND
if climatologists can attribute earthquakes to global warming i'm open to possibilities.
Kyle
Idiots blame fracking, because its not like the earth is big or anything.
Ya, they just added some dude's name to it to make this sound scientific, shameful.
Scudder never even called them portals because they're just natural deformations of a magnetic field.
Its just some fluff about someone who doesn't actually have an article to write, connecting something that nobody in the audience is likely to understand to appear valid.
Might as well just say: Bigfoot is real and also here's an article about supercritical fluids.
Oh and of course they bring string theory into it. 🙄
Which they even preface at the end by basically saying they have no clue what they're doing.
Val
its bullshit but an interesting read
Kyle
You can chain anything together in an attempt to sound smart, but that isn't even a clever deception.
Val
hey guys ive found a link between
x
and x
Kyle
They don't even have the constructive skill to misinterpret statistics.
Val
maybe they genuinely belive in this shit lol
[quotes Chris's "I will also share this article I found online today:

im talking about this btw lol
Kyle
Clickbait makes money for someone at least.
The fact they only bring up piezoelectrics once, out of nowhere...
Chris (as Sonichu)
Where would you rather I learn the term and figure out that this is linkable to the portal I would need and could potentially use to get this body from here to C-197, safely, healthy and alive?
Istanbul?
Kyle
Well, what are the odds of any arbitrary article being valid like? Just so we can establish a level of QA.
Chris (as Sonichu)
The article is pretty much a starting point toward the further thought process and meditation is leading me to find and learn what is needed at the upcoming fated moment and time in the near future to finally get this body to Cwcville safely. (edited)
Now I am seeing the larger picture and how-to.
Kyle
And the dead ends?
Chris (as Sonichu)
[posts screenshots of his conversation with an unknown person]
Unknown
Haha you have got to be the only one I know who uses light mode on discord
Ok I see, I can do what I can to help since I Literaly have a piezoelectric machine running and the ability to manipulate it with programs
Chris (as Sonichu)
This brain and body has also dabbled in the dark as well, so no stranger.
[Chris posts a lightbulb emote]
So THAT's why!
The body has imported well over 567 million souls and entities recently into its infinite storage capacity.
Chris is mainly light, and so are about half or so of the imported souls.
Take the dark half, purified and tamed demons included, and Merlin, himself in here: this body Does have the capability of recombining the two universes.
That's also counting Chris, herself, whose soul is still in my body in C-197.
Goddess soul on one side; body, powers, and crystals to guide on the other; Kra-Kow! [lightning bolt emotes]
This REALLY Good!
The Celestial Key and the Gate Crystal are what we need to make this portal happen after all. And a taser to the GC is a perfect test to field it out.
Especially considering this body, and Chris before the body-swap, personally have overcharged it with all of those different types of energy and power.
Kyle
This is kind of endemic to new agism and conspiracy content.
Chris (as Sonichu)
It’s better than nothing.
Kyle
Eh, not if you account for the level of quality.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Remember that equation the Cosmos streamed through me to challenge you with, Kyle?
“1Xz4”
Fated moments override numbers.
Kyle
We don't try to reinterpret critically flawed sources of data, because we have enough mistrust in the data to know the conclusions would be wrong or unrelated, we find better sources.
Chris (as Sonichu)
So, find your better sources to make this make sense in your logic, Dude.
