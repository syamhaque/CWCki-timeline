================================================================================

We're Being Watched (officially Chris Chan Aeon Flux 100408) reveals that - by 4 October 2008 - Chris is thoroughly convinced that all information about him being leaked to the Internet is being obtained by trolls who have literally hacked into the computer and webcam of both himself and his gal-pals. To let his enemies know he is on to them, Chris produces this avant-garde production.
The clip references a popular line from an episode of MTV's Æon Flux, in which the title character mockingly states her intentions directly into a security camera, knowing that no one will take her seriously enough to intervene:
“My name is Æon Flux. I'm here on a mission to assassinate Trevor Goodchild.Is everybody listening? Do you believe me? Everybody happy now?”
Description
*To my Loyal Fans, I am safe and well, and I am working on finishing the 18th Episode; I am still having to cope with some of the stress.
*To those who are Watching me, I know I am being watched, and in this Aeon Flux parodic manner, I humbly ask you to Leave My Friends Alone; if you want to torture someone with e-mail barrages and abuse, you can very well direct them to me. I'm still standing, but I promise to leave your page alone, as long as you leave my Gal-Pals, Sweetheart and Friends alone.
Peace,
Christian Weston Chandler.
