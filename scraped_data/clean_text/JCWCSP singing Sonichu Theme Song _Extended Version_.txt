Description
I am singing the (updated) Sonichu Theme Song, personally.
Lyrics:
S, O, N, I, C H U. S, O, N, I, C, H U. S, O, N, I, C, H U. GO! GO! GO! Let's Zip!
Born from energies of extreme power, runs wild and free, faster than the speed of sound. Love to zip, loves to zap, this Pokemon. Fighting alongside Rosey Rosechu. Infinite electrical power in his body shocks all villains in a word with humans and many Pokemon and Heroes. Sonic the Hedgehog is a friend, too.
In the year 2003, Station Square was under attack, by the Perfect Chaos moster and his evil wrath. Sonic leapt to destroy him, colliding with a Pikachu, turning him into a new hero.
Sonichu! Electric-Hedgehog Pokemon. Sonichu! Defending Cwcville til the day is done. Sonichu! Electric-Hedgehog Pokemon. Sonichu! Need a Prime hero to come along in time to save you. Sonichu!
Fighting alongside Rosey Rosechu, standing right by his side. Jerkops and Team Rocket can never win, though they always try. Chris Chan, the leader, upholds the law, and when they're in trouble, they can always call Sonichu!
Inside, Outside, let's zap them together. Inside, Outside, let's zip. No matter how you try, Sonichu Prime is uncatchable.
Inside, Outside, Go Sonichu! Zipping along, yes, Sonichu! When trouble comes along, you arrive fast and save the day.
Sonichu! Electric-Hedgehog Pokemon. Sonichu! Defending Cwcville til the day is done. Sonichu! Electric-Hedgehog Pokemon. Sonichu! Need a Prime hero to come along in time to save you. Sonichu! Stop...the...trouble,...rescue all and zip away!
After arriving in Cwcville, Sonichu and Rosey made more friends. Wild, Bubbles, Angelica, Punchy, Blake, and the psychic guardian, Magi-Chan. Guided by intuition and learning, they fight with love and honesty against the ones who want to destroy the love and peace. The fight is tough, but they are tough, too.
They have traveled the states, as well as the world, learning of the ancient prophecies that showed the paths. And they live, train and fight to see the future as it shall be.
Inside, Outside, let's zap them together. Inside, Outside, let's zip. No matter how you try, Sonichu Prime is uncatchable.
Inside, Outside, Go Sonichu! Zipping along, yes, Sonichu! When trouble comes along, you arrive fast and save the day.
Sonichu! Electric-Hedgehog Pokemon. Sonichu! Defending Cwcville til the day is done. Sonichu! Electric-Hedgehog Pokemon. Sonichu! Need a Prime hero to come along in time to save you. Sonichu!
Stop...the...trouble,...rescue all and zip away!
S, O, N, I, C H U. S, O, N, I, C, H U. S, O, N, I, C, H U. GO! GO! GO! Let's Zip!
*Guitar Solo*
S, O, N, I, C H U. S, O, N, I, C, H U. S, O, N, I, C, H U. GO! GO! GO! Let's Zip!
Lyrics written by Jesus Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu Prime, also inspired by orcoe30.

Thank you for singing it this time. The backing AI music is still kinda lame though. I think if you tried you could easily pick up a music program. I look forward to more songs!
Chris
I appreciate the feedback! I'm glad you liked the singing.
