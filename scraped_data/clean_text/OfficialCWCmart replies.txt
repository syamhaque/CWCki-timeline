I'm sorry that you got shot
5/5 stars, Chris Chan Jail Art: Neo Spiritual Mantra (LIMITED STOCK)

This item literally saved my life. The tokens were already framed in a cute 4x4 black frame. The soda label I purchased was not. However, when putting the items for safe keeping, as I intend to frame the label, I bent over and injured my back so badly I had to call in to work. The evening, the building next to my work was held at gun point. Thanks Chris! My back may be on fie but atleast I didn't get shot.
Christine 14 November 2023
I am very glad you were saved from the fire, but I am sorry to hear that you got shot. The blessing is that you survived, and you get to continue on doing what the Light Power and Divine Guidance informs you to do.
Blessed rocks
5/5 stars, Temple of Sonichu Sacred Rocks
Sara Simmons 13 November 2023
Words alone cannot begin to describe how elated I am to receive these blessed rocks! I can't wait to use them for the merge! Arrived quickly and without any issues.
Christine 14 November 2023
I am very glad you have received them and are enjoying the energies from the old Sonichu Temple. Consider them well in grounding techniques and meditations. Thank you for your kindness and patronage.

She did not draw me the doodle I requested 😔
Christine 21 November 2023
Unpaid requests or notes left for the seller are not received on the store. However, Commissions are available as Christine has time to perform them. New openings have been posted, but there are limited slots.
Different sealant
1/5 stars, Handmade Sonichu Medallion, WITH MEGASTONE
Kagamine 13 March 2024
Photo is not accurate to the product that arrived. Seller will not let you know this until the item arrives.
Christine 13 March 2024
Your issue you described was that the item wasn't "shiny enough." Christine is using a different sealant on her medallions as some customers have made a note of medallions becoming sticky. If you'd like us to sticky yours up, please return it to the postal address!
This figure does not function as a Skylander

I tried switching this to Skylander mode, but, in the process, I twisted the base off. Please specify that this figure does not function as a Skylander.
Christine 19 April 2024
Did you think you could plug this in and get Sonichu in your video game?
Phony medallions
3/5 stars, Official Chris Chan Sonichu Medallion (READ DESCRIPTION)
Dennis 30 August 2024
So honestly I was pretty excited for this item. I was under the impression Christine made these herself because that is what is said on the item description. Upon going online, there are many people who speculate that these are not in fact made by Christine, but by someone under the name of "Praetor". Do your research about it and determine it for yourself. More importantly, I had messaged the seller, and they never responded back, which is extremely disappointing because all of the reviews say Christine is very responsive. I was completely ignored, so do not have faith if you have any issues with your order. It most likely wouldn't even be the real Christine messaging back anyways. Shipping was slow, the seller did not ship it out until the last day they had to be able to ship. The quality of the item is great however.

Christine 30 August 2024
Hello! Please note that each medallion type has a description which lists whether it was made in a mass production line or whether Christine herself made it. The higher price ones are made by Christine, this listing pictured is a cheaper alternative for those who want a medallion but cannot afford the handmade ones.

Bought for my brother for a VERY late birthday and Christmas gift. In his words he couldn't be more honored than to own his very own medallion! Shipped VERY quickly, too. Couldn't be happier!
