“
Wrist…….watches. Thorn wanted them.
”
Chris remembering the video, October 2023.
Wristwatch-SwissWatch for Jeremy "Thorg" is a video released by Chris on 20 August 2011. It is a bizarre rap ballad to wristwatches dedicated to Thorg. Chris shows off various wristwatches in his collection and flashes his PSP, TV, and 3DS with images of wristwatches on them. Despite the video being barely over a minute in length, Chris quickly gets out of breath while singing. The Sailor Moon poster is briefly focused on. Oddly, though his previous video blackmailing Thorg was removed, he felt the need to tag the video with "blackmail". 11 wristwatches are featured in this video.
This video marks the debut of his "custom" 3DS, which has been fitted onto some sort of band on his wrist, acting like the PIP-Boy from the Fallout franchise. As with any other device that Chris owns, the 3DS is covered in stickers, the only recognizable ones being Bumblebee from Transformers and the My Little Pony logo.
The troll behind Thorg revealed in a Q&A that he got Chris to make this video because other trolls wanted to see how he would pronounce 'wristwatch'.
