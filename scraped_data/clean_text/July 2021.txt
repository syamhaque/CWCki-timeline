Chris in July 2021
July was the seventh month of 2021. At first, it seemed like a promising month for Chris, apparently having found a new love interest, and being financially aided by a fundraiser in order to attend the Everfree Northwest My Little Pony convention, on the caveat that he does commissions and drawings to the backers, something which manager Null noted he was actually doing well with in terms of productivity.
It was sadly not to last.
Midway through, the month saw a sad turn in Christory, as one of the Chandler's dogs, Snoopy passed away. However, this situation utterly paled in comparison to what happened later in the month.
Late on the 29th of July, audio leaked of Chris confessing to having sexual intercourse with his own mother, Barbara Chandler. Incest in Virginia is a Class 5 Felony as it stands, but questions quickly arose as to Barbara's ability to even consent to the sexual intercourse in the first place. This prompted many horrified onlookers to immediately call local law enforcement, who conducted a welfare check on 14 Branchland Court and took Barbara to a hospital. An Emergency Protective Order would be served against Chris, barring him Chris from entering the premises of the house and contacting his mother until 5 August of the next month. To add salt to the wound, the aforementioned Everfree Northwest convention promptly banned Chris from attendance due to the heavy media attention that the situation garnered.
Things only got far worse on the 31st of July, when Null, after looking at Chris's email, had discovered that Chris had stolen $750 from Barbara's bank account, prompting him to immediately cut contact with Chris, cancel the GoFundMe campaign, and to refund all of the backers of the fundraiser.
The full consequences of this infamous weekend would spill over into August 2021, where Chris would find himself tracked down by weens and being arrested in a motel parking lot while Ethan Ralph, a podcaster based in Virginia, live-streamed the entire arrest to thousands of people on Youtube.

Chris records Direct Message to Hasbro: MLPG5 Is Cancelled., a rage-filled video demanding Hasbro cancel its fifth generation of My Little Pony. In the background of the video, multiple punched-in holes in his bathroom wall can be seen. When asked later the same day about the damage dealt to the wall, Chris replies that it was apparently from past attempts from which he was trying to quite literally break into another dimension.[22] During the Jail Saga, Christorians presumed this to be his last video to be uploaded to YouTube, but he would return 2 years later with Jesus Christ Chan Sonichu Prime Resurrected and Returned.
Chris says to Bella that he wants to tell her who his sexual partner is, but is concerned that the government may hack into the conversation. He recommends she download Signal, an encrypted call and chat app.[23]
At 9:30 PM EST, the Incest Call takes place between Chris and Bella in which Chris describes incestuous acts with his mother.[24] Partway through the conversation, Bella covertly begins recording using her iPad.

The Incest Texts occur, which take place on the Signal app.

An Emergency Protective Order is issued forbidding Chris from contacting his mother and from being at the Chandler house until 5 August. Barbara is taken to the hospital for a senior care inspection.[30] In the wake of the scandal, Chris trends on Twitter.

In the fallout from the incest leaks, Don Lashomb pulls Warhol / Chris Chan from sale on Amazon, and Null announces a refund to the donors of the GoFundMe intended to fund Chris's trip to Everfree Northwest.[33]
Null asks Chris about the $750 money transfer. Chris admits he had taken the money and that he had control over Barbara's bank account, potentially constituting a violation of his protective order.[32] As a result, Null entirely cuts ties with Chris, notifies jerkops of the theft, and releases the chatlog from earlier in the month in which Chris had vaguely and misleadingly described sex with his mother as if he was simply in a relationship with an older, disabled woman.[6]
Chris tells The WCT that Aunt Harriet and Uncle Tom have forbidden him from staying at their house, and that he has found a room at Regency Inn Richmond for $56 a night. Chris also complains about Barbara still being kept at the hospital.[34]
