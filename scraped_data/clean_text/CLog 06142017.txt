One such comment.
Someone alerted Chris that exclusive Sonichu sneak peeks were being leaked by his patrons. A few weens mentioned in YouTube comments that they were the ones responsible. Whether this is true or not, and despite the fact that the pages were already paid for by DStecks, Chris was upset.
Some thought this may have led to a new saga.

-ristine Chandler! Uhh, another... Captain's Log. Stardate, 06-14-017?
[nods head]
And I'm jus- this is a brief one! This is gonna be a brief one. Because, I have.. it has been brought to my attention... that apparently, those who have made the contribution to Patreon, are... abusing their privilege, and leaking the pages... amongst, the Internet... that I put up there. So, let's not do that, okay? That's not cool. It's like, movie pirating. You don't steal a women's purse. You don't steal anybody's cell phone. So... don't steal the pages. Alright? Be legit, be honest, be loyal. I believe... in the kindness, of people.
[raises hand for a good 4 seconds]
Anyways, so.. with that. I'll pp- put a link in the... description down below! Once again, don't make - make pledges to my Patreon! Get.. the official, sneak previews of page - of the pages, before the fina - before the final full book... is published. Still working on book 11, we're on - we're up to page 70 right now. We'll be having - hopefully I'll get finished as soon as possible? We'll be coming up to the clip-show after... ten or less pages? That's my - is, that's my - that's my plan anyway.
[looks into the distance]
[whispers] Hmm, anything else, anything else? [mumbles incoherently]
Hmmm... [proceeds to make fart noises for five seconds]
Anyway, also, just a reminder, um, yes, also, when the book does get published, uh, directly to my publisher. I will personally, uh, send out the new book. Copy of it, t-uh... each person that, is still... on the Patreon. Uh, either the first pledge or has been consistently pledging throughout the months. Which that, is much better, especially for the Book of The Month offer... okay? Yeah... so... as soon as book 11 is ready, I send copies out to every Patreon.. that has payed - that has been paying. And uh, so along with, uh, book 12, and 13, 14, so on, so forth.
And uh, also, at one point in the future, um, try... since we have this silent agreement and everything, hopefully get these books in uh, in a.. local comic book store or something. To be determined, along... some time, in the future. Don't know when. There will be no sabotage.
And, I think that will about cover it for now, so... until next video, be a Captain's Log or... random stream. Everybody. Have a good, safe day.
