================================================================================

Bunny Hop is a video shot and uploaded to YouTube in Easter 2009. It shows Chris pretending to be a bunny and doing a silly dance, as a means of entertaining two pet crabs whose names he gets wrong. Yes, this is as ridiculous as it sounds.
At the beginning, Chris is heard (in voiceover) saying "PYONG PYONG PYOOOONG!!!", which is a Japanese onomatopoeia for a rabbit hopping.
Chris tries to mimic a 1952 song by Ray Anthony, presumably something Bob liked.

The video in a nutshell.
A formative experience.
[voice over] PYONG PYONG PYOOONNG, for Crass and Chimp. PYONG PYONG PYOOOOOOONNG!
[Chris is seen holding a pair of pipe cleaners behind his head to represent rabbit ears. He squats down to place his PS3 controller on the ground and gets back up.]
[attempting a kind of English accent] Hoppy Easter! Ivy-ee! Crass and... Chat?! Mmmm, Hoppy Easter!
[begins hopping around, doing a godawful rendition of "Bunny Hop1", a 1950s song, flailing his arms and wiggling around as the whole front of his torso jiggles up and down in disgusting unison. Around 0:44 Chris attempts to continue the song using kissing noises]
Hhhooooooooooo-ppy Easter! Hoppy Easter! Mmm...we'regonnahavefun! [One of his "ears" falls off, and Chris reaches down to pick it up]
Bye now.
