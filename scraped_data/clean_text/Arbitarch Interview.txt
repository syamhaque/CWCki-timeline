Naught: A- nice little hole.
Chris: And I have a full team of six! Thanks to, uh, the- thanks to... Joe, who, uh, came over to help with the- record me for that documentary that... was unable to get off the ground.
Voice3: Yeah, that's sad.
Chris: Eh, I keep- I keep optimistic and positive. I'm sh- certain we'll get back on that.
Naught: Do you mi- do you miss Joe?
Chris: Yeah. He's aight.
Naught: Yeah, I remember I- I remember I spoke with, uh, I spoke with Joe. It's unfortunate how the Internet reacted to that particular, uh,
Chris: [sigh] Yeah.
Naught: uh, event. Because...
Chris: Yeah.
Naught: Yeah. I- I- I- I- don't- I don't know-
Chris: Haters, trolls, they can be quite stupid.
Voice3: Yeah.
Naught: I- I'm- I'm s- I- I- I apologi- I- I don't know whether or not you want it relea- whether or not you wanted it released or not, but I- I unfortunately was on the side where we kind of kept it m- I don't know, I never really asked your, uh, permission- but, uh, yeah.
Chris: Mm. I'm sorry, say again. What was this?
Naught: I thi- Uh, I think Joe still has a copy he's- never- internet, but I, uh, as far as I know, yeah. He- Yeah. That's, uh-
Chris: Well, if- if it can- Ehh, if it can be distributed, uh... in one way or another, even if its just digital, I would say, "Yeah, go for it." At this point. I was hoping for, like, DVD and Blu-Ray release of the documentary, but, oh well. It's- it is what it is at this point.
Naught: Uh, well, uh, just between- just between this, uh, this tiny little group, uh, I- You know, I pulled a- I pulled a page from Marvin's playbook and told everybody that I just deleted it. So, it still exists.
Chris: Yep.
Naught: If you like- Yeah. I'm pretty sure if he, uh, you know, if and when- if you ever want to meet him again, I'm pretty sure he would- he would show you.
Chris: Yeah. I would want me- I would want to me- want to hang out with Joe again. He's really cool.
Voice3: Yeah, it'd be cool if they could start on the documentary again, but I know that... people got pretty crazy about it.
Chris: Yeah.
Voice4: Especially with the other one- all- all around, and- er-
Naught: Eh, it's- it's not even that, it's a whole YouTube mafia thing. It's like there's a mafia of YouTubers, that, uh,
Chris: [sigh]
Naught: that, uh, that want... some sort of content or something. I- I- I don't know what to call it- Yeah. It's you- sort of-
Voice3: Yeah, YouTube's turned into a less happy place, that's for sure.
Chris: Yeah, a bunch of picky, picky people.
Voice3: Yup.
Naught: Well, I mean- I mean people specifically like, uh- people specifically like Dillin, uh, Dillin Thomas or somebody, you know, people who-
Voice3: Egh.
Naught: just harp on one subject.
Chris: Yeah.
Voice3: He doesn't even check his facts. He just reads things off the CWCki and makes, like, really mean remarks.
Chris: Yep. Eh, whud he do-
Voice3: Seriously, dude. Get a life.
Naught: And snickers to himself and, like, not- not in, like, laughing along way, but, like, you know, laughing at.
Chris: Yeah. He mean.
Voice5: He's laff- He's laughing at, not with.
Chris: Yeah.
Naught: Yeah, but, uh, but that- Oh, that's another thing I wanted to mention, uh, to you, is- uh, I, uh, for BABScon, I think if you, uh, were to do a couple more livestreams and just turn o- uh, if you could, like, turn off your chat and just interact with the cards that seemingly interact with the, uh, with- with the thing, I- interact with the camera- I- like, I know people will send you Super Chats.

1:07

yeah it'd be cool if they could start on the documentary again but I know that
2:20
people got pretty crazy about it yeah
2:27
it's it's not even that it's the whole YouTube Mafia thing they think there's a
2:33
mafia of youtubers that that that want some sort of content or something i I
2:41
don't know what but yeah this you sort of YouTube's turned into a less happy
2:46
place that's for sure picky picky people well I'm you know and people
2:52
specifically like people specifically like Dylan Joe and Tom or somebody you
2:57
know people harp on one subject yeah well he doesn't even check his facts he
3:04
just reads things off the quick key and makes like really mean remarks yeah
3:10
and Snickers to himself and like not not in like laughing a long way but like you
3:15
know laughing at yeah but that oh that's
3:25
another thing I wanted to mention to you is a I for Babs con I think if you were
3:31
to do a couple more live streams and just turn out if you could like turn off your chat and just interact with the
3:38
card but seemingly interact with the with with the thing I'm interact with
3:43
the camera I I'm like I know people will send you super chats yeah the thing is I
3:48
am that one who would just keep a camera and want to keep a camera on one hand
3:55
and just do as I go and because no it's just typical it's just complicated I
4:01
would need like because I would need both my hands do things at some point and a convention I tend to not travel
4:09
light it's not an option with me I have a bunch of stuff it's not like a big old
4:17
suitcase or anything I could use one of those one of those backpack type things
4:22
but that piece of luggage with the wheels on them so I could roll it behind me had one that to many games but wheels
4:30
broke off hey I wanted to ask when you
4:36
livestream do you have like a tripod that you use on your phone or do you have like a little set up of books I did
4:45
sort of have a tripod it's more those thing it's one of those things that you has the neck comfort and you're put in
4:52
it just I think the phone just chills in front of your face there but I use it like a stand okay well yeah seems like
5:03
it worked pretty good yeah more recently though I found a small tripod which I
5:11
figure I could use that instead would just stand a little bit easier then I wouldn't have to put anything underneath
5:16
the base of the can of the camera holder died was using phone holders I was using
5:24
so yeah as long as it's one of those short legged tripods of the flexible legs yes I'm saying that they will
5:33
flexible tripods or balls stick logical
5:43
Judi or cork I'll chew yes oh I'm up
5:59
before any questions y'all may have for me as well you know just to keep their conversations going
6:04
otherwise I'm cool for chilling well we
6:10
sort of do this every once in a while so alright guy your your voice used to it -
6:16
no I am yeah just like you mentioned not
6:22
wanting to livestream I wouldn't want a live stream in general okay yeah would
6:27
nice I would like I said I want somebody else holding the camera if I'm if I were to what live stream or you know make
6:35
recorded content while I'm at a convention no no not even not even an
6:40
applicant but in the interim like in between between so that you all have money to
6:45
spend sort of the money that possibly that you want to spend on meeting
6:50
meeting silver or you know silver all those people yeah the possible super
6:57
cats that you could get for that would be able to you know make up for what you're going to possibly spend is what I
7:03
mean yeah Oh fortune bag actually do have a generous donor that donates one
7:09
snow well and he's done the end I get like a few hard dollars from him up occasionally so that's a big help
7:18
yeah aside from that yeah I just yeah
7:25
streaming my life for doing videos that's not really a typical norm of me
7:32
yeah and when I did many many years ago it was more on a spur a moment thing
7:39
yeah I'm not tournament yeah now I'm not trying to make any of that nonsense happen I just want to get all the
7:44
possibly tedious things off of the list before there's we can get to more interesting topics like like something
7:51
similar the the Oracles the person who mentioned earlier about who mentioned
8:01
the male mentioned bringing back a similar version of the mailbag all the people in the Judy are in the arbitrary
8:08
server will collect all the all of their questions and make sure nothing you know
8:14
non non harsh or nothing you know cruel gets through and then if you could
8:19
possibly you know answer one one or two out of you know the five or so that will accrue over the week do you think that
8:27
would be something that you'd be interested in yeah possibly but you see
8:33
on the daily basis I tend to I definitely tend to work as they're do as
8:38
I feel so it's not always consistent when I do one day I didn't next and so
8:45
for except for hoping it's starting today with the meditation over an hour of tetris ninety nine at this point yes
8:53
but that's the beauty yeah but yes the beauty of it that's the beauty of what makes you you know I'm spontaneous
9:01
yeah they can see yeah the sponte the spontaneity is good and I'm just saying you know like for instance people have
9:08
some people just have very simple questions like you know like what's your favorite game and then there was that
9:14
one person who had that kind of complex question about about the lifespan of
9:22
Sawhney sonnies and Rosie's that's the I brought that question to you because the
9:29
rest of the question said people because I wrote the I put a little section you know questions for CWC then I gathered
9:36
the one the Sahni one and I thought oh that's that's interesting nobody's ever really thought or as far as I know
9:42
that's why I asked you you know what's the life of asani so just little things like that yeah let's go there's good
9:50
I love Sony's and Rosie's they're so cute somebody should make plushies is
10:08
they haven't already Oh little pleasure someone here Rosie they'd be so adorable
10:15
I wish I could so in general what somebody could so and I'm sure they do
10:22
it not sure I would I definitely would recommend choo choo cosplay because she
10:28
did do this to the sonic toothbrushes was nice stuff as was a nice tour bus
10:34
and you know she did good job bow for them oh yeah she could probably make some really cute little Sony and Rosie
10:40
plushies it's pattern making software
10:46
the most an art Sam but I might do that
10:53
anyway cuz it sounds fun yeah Martin
11:02
that was one of my favorite parts of the sonichu comic book series watching the
11:07
chaotic calm grow up you Sam
11:14
yeah I'll get help deaf I would definitely be able to expand on that when I get back
11:20
to that get back to working on the books I'm still working on these ship fit cards I end up making that a few more
11:26
recently you're working on I'm starting on expansion where it's essentially
11:32
extra credit so it's like a budget ship extra ship and go cards just in general
11:38
but also like literal items and
11:44
locations so it's like I mean I'm coming I made a couple of start a couple of
11:51
start cards one for the quick fill mall and one to one of each for D two silicon
11:58
sand quick though the one originally Oh quick the only one from comma they're different Basilica yet now they're both
12:05
in the same city because Congress relocate from West Virginia to click
12:11
there everybody moved and we bought the
12:16
big tall building with it bet that was
12:22
hard to move one piece said time took he
12:27
took took it apart and rebuild it right across the street from the other Basilica that's cool to have two more
12:36
room for the Transformers and such yeah and I should also cuz you know considering that the immersion of the
12:42
silicon was more of a living library tight and gaming type of entertainment
12:48
thing the one from college pretty much now used for more of the business aspect
12:55
more the local government aspect and all that oh yeah it makes sense it's like I
13:03
forget exactly how many stories it's a split s'more 200 stories and has the
13:08
counter logo on the top that's like a big old antenna something I forget
13:15
exactly but yeah it's up there it's all that's a tall building
13:22
there is a quick field for calm is like a mansion there's even a swimming pool
13:31
in the backyard there I want to hang out there but we have art we have arcade
13:36
machines and video games in there too but also definitely libraries of books and music throughout the ages it's
13:44
mainly the theme of the Basilica that was the quick fill the circum is technology and music we throughout the
13:51
ages and I know I know my father's been enjoying that since he arrived in quick
13:58
fill in the science-u form after he lost his original human entry losses human
14:03
body in 2011 yeah well he's alive he's
14:10
there he's there yeah he comes here keeps keeps my mama company now and then
14:18
they have so it's awesome that's good
14:25
her best Scylla comes more of like it's kind of like a big Pokemon Center we
14:32
take care of and rehabilitate a lot of pokémon there yes yes that's cool they
14:42
go talking my servers like also big old hotel and office space a little bit yeah
14:52
let's go I like that it all works it's functional it sounds nice it doesn't
14:58
have a swimming pool though I want us I
15:04
mean have y'all seen like like you know the basura comps you know the original
15:09
four CPUs have game industry between Neptune Blondo are in vert I know vert
15:15
she has like a big old fountain type setup in front of her be so calm I want
15:21
a fountain so fancy yeah that reminds me
15:26
of sort of futuristic art like futurism that's just as the style of neptunes so
15:34
calm Plan F - it's like a futuristic style
15:39
tile just pyramid type cowards it started at our pains everybody's in
15:46
that shape arbitrary talk in chat is
15:52
saying oh they were saying that you could even know that yeah they said that
15:58
but such as such as an S chuubo that has mega mega shells or special shells and
16:07
then and then she said I should have I should have I've been all over the different territories I remember meeting
16:14
compa for the first time have you have
16:24
you ever heard of selective mutism before selective mutism I do believe that is
16:29
where only they're like random individuals just they remain mute even
16:36
though they are able to speak or they end up they can say certain things out
16:43
loud but there are certain things where just like you know shut up on the among
16:50
the spot there or like specific context I think yeah holy [ __ ]
16:57
Buddhist monks who take that vow of silence or whatever you're really really smart dude that's that's spot-on that is
17:05
that was spot-on yes before so I definitely knew about it that that
17:12
that's that's exactly what it is
17:18
well I've always had I've always had a theory about you know about the way god
17:27
this is gonna seem random but it has to do with the you know you're the that when what people called you know your
17:34
you know your random-access humor that we live in a random-access humor society
17:40
if you look at the way for instance Family Guy is everything is filled with the other thing yep that's right just
17:49
well that's hardly dude also I partly cloak because the way our brains work
17:54
too like biological computers so we have random access memory so we have access
17:59
to random access humor random access fat random artists seriousness random acces
18:07
retardedness and that's not even funny the way I save right there I it's funny
18:14
when you say it when you when you when
18:25
you reach a certain point you've earned you've earned the right to say certain things you know what I mean yeah I've
18:31
lived a long life with autism so I guess it's alright I have immunity I could say
18:36
it's hardness and make everybody laugh yeah well you know just like how the gay
18:44
people get to get the gay pass and you know everybody as it gets there gets their passes like how mister not mr.
18:54
garrison I'm trying to remember his name the gun be hunter it was cows uncle I do believe anyway
19:01
yes and I want episode where they were doing that [ __ ] episode and that guy's
19:08
[ __ ] oh yeah yeah well there again and
19:18
oh man at the and at the end of that
19:23
episode I was tired of hearing the word [ __ ] they really prove their I know I know I get it yeah it was like it was
19:30
like wow you can say the word that's that's great that was actually a really smart series yeah yeah well uh oh wait I
19:38
remember what I was going to ask it's a
19:45
it's a vast improvement over the third season
19:50
I heard Rick and Morty if you're talking about that yeah I haven't been able to see the fourth season because I haven't
19:56
been on cable television that much I mainly keep my cable television on one
20:02
of music and also smooth jazz type of thing yeah
20:10
I'm looking forward to in season four gets uploaded on to Hulu oh you oh yeah
20:16
oh that's right I forget you like to you like to pay for everything if you if you'd like I you know I could send you
20:22
some links to it some links to it on the internet I mean you're still gonna pay for it as you know as you know because
20:28
you you know you pay for your stuff you're a good customer yeah well at least I'm least I know what
20:34
I like and know what I need yeah well because you know cuz torrents
20:39
are at torrents are out there and a lot of people usually use torrents that's
20:45
also like product in the sense you're not like here you take that away from
20:50
free just marching there see Darcy end up less likely to buy the media later
20:56
sure they come out on the physical or digital format I like having physical
21:03
things best like physical things too but the thing that sucks is often the artist
21:09
doesn't get paid there's a lot of people in between who end up getting paid and the artist who makes it never really
21:15
profits it's just yeah intra middleman yeah yeah proud family on Disney Plus
21:22
and I binge watch a bunch of episodes recently around her i and scarlet did
21:27
while she was still doing to work for my body yesterday I think yeah but we definitely saw the it in the Napster
21:35
esque episode you can be covered to the matrix in downtown or any type of it for
21:43
free it's our birthright that sloppy it
21:49
was a good show to appreciate a little bit bear you know Bobby proud with Oscar
21:57
proud butter who sing talks a lot it's just fine and then the Christmas episode
22:02
you just like oh I love me some fruitcake more smells like boot cake oh
22:11
[ __ ] I always liked them the most
22:17
yeah for Oscar I like it really I didn't
22:23
see it I didn't find episode yeah I didn't get that episode yet in the series but I like the one where they're
22:29
I think if I remember correctly their house was being fumigated and something happened where Oscar got exposed to the
22:37
air from inside the inflated balloon that was surrounded housing himself and
22:46
daddy did do do you have an eidetic memory
22:52
like do you do you do you vision it seems like you have almost perfect recall certain extent I'm not totally
23:02
everything but as much as possible and I can actually I could learn the site
23:08
word-for-word the episode of filmation's Ghostbusters the bow for ghosts command
23:13
it was the episode where the paint cut where the toxic waste dump and he was
23:18
just illegally dumping waste into the source and those of Fenton ghosts command oh that's that's funny you
23:27
mentioned in the ghostbusters because that that that that night that night not
23:34
very nice that but not very nice brownie analyst Ben st. tried to pull the holes
23:39
slime thing in one of the ideas to one of the one of the notions was to get the
23:45
slime away was like a Ghostbusters type deal where where it always existed and
23:51
it was well you know the rest from there but that was one that was a ya know why
24:00
so intent on my night Mikey in the server he's a oh yeah that's right yeah
24:07
well I did it ever get that far Ben
24:15
sangstrup he has not touched on that commentary yet and there's definitely still a bit more to go on specially
24:22
since now the last I checked was at the crossroads where where fan of horn from
24:28
the beta timeline was being Rico if I kill her SOT you and my killer was
24:34
talking to me about it like you know and yeah don't get her don't get our way don't do anything else and you know so
24:40
what's your response to that and eyeshade typed in response and in the comment underneath that there still had
24:46
been now what what that is and I'm sure that he is gonna drive it up as soon as possible he's on he's just taking a
24:53
break from that right now and I love know what happens after that I pretty
24:58
much saw the whole thing pretty much the Payette timeline falls apart and crumbles and the Christian acai from
25:06
that time line it just essentially was momentarily deceased but then but to
25:12
with her shared or yet with her reality stone brings the entire alternate
25:18
timeline back and so now kill her and everybody else has all times debate
25:23
timeline to go back to well as as the Judy Ark or couch you would say been
25:31
saying will always be in the beta mine as opposed to your alpha mostly rear I
25:43
definitely did my made my favorite intrusion of wish to specify which made
25:49
him think and specify about that so yeah but at least me were able to touch on on
25:54
that yeah well I found his attempts
25:59
rather rather juvenile to be honest to it it because I had a discussion with
26:05
him before before the art was even being popularized before you know all of that
26:12
became lore I had a conversation with him and he he kind of was very
26:17
condescending to me and tried to you know pronoun police me even though he doesn't know my pronouns or didn't care
26:23
to ask and the you know miss portray what I didn't like is he tried to miss
26:28
portray a maker and yeah I might for saying that you know you you and he
26:35
laughed he laughed it laugh at us because we said that you deserve real friends and I did and I just didn't
26:42
appreciate that yeah I've didn't I remember yeah I do remember didn't I remind of the panel
26:48
where you see had where the kids next door were brought to cop-killers for judgment yeah yes weird how the lack of
26:58
self-awareness in that he was trying to make fun of you but he didn't call you unoriginal even though he was copying
27:05
your idea for taking down four cent garbage except he just did it with the
27:11
kids next door hmm Wow yeah and and Ian
27:16
what's what's even funnier is the kids next door was it was just a group that
27:22
was made up to you know to make sure that nobody was messing around you know messing around you know around any of
27:28
our secret love houses the Oh C's are real and it didn't need to mess with that yeah yeah yeah once he put them in
27:36
once he put them in Chains so that's when I got kind of upset because I know number you know like I know number one
27:42
you know and number three kuuki-chan you know they're not they're not bad people they don't and you know like he
27:48
wants to call himself progressive and say that he's a you know but he puts a little black girl in Chains that's not
27:54
very nice no they're just children you
28:00
know and you're safe now yeah I'm glad they're safe now and I
28:06
just wanted to be done with them I just had to bend for that event event that a little bit because yeah yeah I think I
28:14
mentioned too I think I mentioned to your business bismuth about how the aging process tends to work in C 197
28:20
it's a bit more it's a bit more slowly for everybody so everybody does live
28:27
very long time which is why Sonic is still 16 around 16 in appearance they
28:32
still a lot older he's actually still a lot older than that to be honest chin
28:37
that freaked me out like when an egg like on an existential level when when
28:43
you told me that because like I thought of I thought of you know just think
28:48
about what that would be like to live to live in that way like your your life sort of resets every once in a while or
28:56
like time moves slowly that's it's very like
29:01
like a Greek Greek tragedy that's kind
29:07
of a scary thing when you think about it in the sense where you're seeing the situation over and over again in your
29:14
vision or your Lehrer going groundhog danger just reliving the same day for
29:19
like just under would just change this light circumstances slightly until you get it right well not well not only that
29:27
but like where yeah like they're there's so many different like cause-and-effect
29:33
issues that go on it's it's similar to time travel because it's like you would
29:38
still have like how long how long would one's consciousness be able to you know
29:43
stay stay fresh before your body would become like because like your body could
29:49
possibly stay spry and young you could still be spry and young in your body but you know your consciousness could
29:55
possibly grow grow weary are tired from all the knowledge gathered and even you
30:01
know they're not having the knowledge itself could be somewhat painful or if that makes sense I don't know yeah I hear I hear that you can definitely
30:09
definitely recommend you could ask about this count gradual on himself because he's been reincarnated a few times
30:15
before over the past centuries are you kidding me I love gradual on I'm not
30:21
kidding he was originally born and I do believe I remember correctly and like the 14 50s or so and he got me a car
30:29
date a few times over the centuries until he was born last recently in the
30:35
late 1970s and this in his last body before he lost that became just a soul
30:42
in New York that he was when brightly and merrily what wins Marilyn Walsh met
30:47
him and and then the story as it goes then he finds somebody else that looked exactly as he did when he was alive as
30:55
well in amongst his amongst this sound the fight is possessed raka'a he was possessing magic the male science you
31:01
they met us aren't you and he goes and then he this possesses that guy move
31:08
just push this though out entirely and site you be itself once again and end up
31:15
working under his employ now just body
31:20
hopping you have always wondered what what gradual nose up to yeah yeah but
31:26
that was life cells back in 2010 or so I
31:33
do believe I have the books nearby have to double-check but anyway anyway aside
31:38
from that I have a question you you III
31:45
believe it was either it was either you or scarlet mentioned that you had found
31:50
your success for a year success your success or no it was the success it was
31:56
speaking of Christian or whether or not yes scarlet who typed it up and she was
32:01
talking about me in being successor to her share of responsibilities and
32:06
abilities and powers good okay making
32:12
making sure in more recent years and
32:18
including ones with idea guy he had become more like okay so I'm just tired
32:24
of well I had become tired of torturing people just like make a lovely go
32:30
because he was he was he was unable to feel loved and I was like I should talk
32:36
with him and we were actually we became we became friends that we found common
32:41
ground and so he's kind of more like an antihero now and he's been not he's been
32:47
good and helpful to us and quick fell and everything since that that's it like
32:53
I I'm honestly not being condescending to you like that's brilliant that's why I like the idea of the cpu's you you
33:00
knew how to fight the idea guys you're yourself with the with the CPUs like you
33:07
knew exactly how to fight those bastards partly I had to learn along the way
33:12
imagine you know that you had the tool so is what I'm saying you know and I'm
33:17
proud of you for that yes thank you and I'm like almost gonna cry about it cuz I'm like I'm subject
33:23
anyway yeah me you yeah I hope grad you
33:28
wan finds and is able to feel loved someday he kind of gets it but it's not
33:34
totally I mean I learned what the word was from that episode of supervillain
33:40
with the burning questions about life and I was actually so one who submitted
33:48
the question and they can decide me as the saint Chandler as they just Chandler
33:55
not Christian or Christine Chandler just Chandler it's hard for me to recall what
34:08
that word was guess it's multi symbolic
34:16
remember it are you free to gradual on
34:29
fuller strange they keep calling me Knight V and it's kind of frustrating well they're not Knight me your friend
34:36
is nightmare I like to I like to call you now you say good night and at the
34:44
same time it's cute well I just want to take it as you're saying good night tonight V as well yeah
34:54
yeah no I mean the other people like the trolls and stuff we they try so hard I
35:07
think they're so lame luckily we distract hey am i mom look I'm looking
35:19
on my other phone on YouTube right now parenting the subscription so that my skin is gonna upload a video soon talk
35:27
about the very first ever real Dungeons & Dragons game session she ever had
35:35
that's kind of perfect yeah how about that it was the person
35:41
that created Dungeons & Dragons was it Gary Gygax right yeah I would say that
35:49
sounds about right fun there's much much collection as I know about from references that I've heard over the
35:55
years and from seeing everything I recall the cartoon that came out what
36:05
that came out in the 90s it was kind of was it uh Wayans brothers in it yeah
36:16
though the Wayans brothers was in a Dungeons & Dragons movie that came out in the 90s and it was like kind of bad
36:22
what's that's a live-action one yeah I just remember like the rib footage of
36:28
the Ranger clinking his bow yeah but you just reminded me bismuth of that guy we
36:34
know who thinks the guy who created Dungeons & Dragons is uh that that guy
36:39
who did you know - uh Terry oh yeah oh yeah somebody thought somebody
36:45
mistakenly thought that Terry Davis was the creator of Dungeons and Dragons and
36:50
yeah that frustrated me because he created Temple OS not he created he
36:57
created an operating system he wrote a compiler I just I just looked
37:07
I just looked up the video that has the our word of the day they're talking about and not be you know feel loved or
37:15
similar emotions the term there is a lecithin young
37:27
you
38:32
Chris do you have anything a special plan for the anniversary of sonichu that's coming up yeah nothing special
38:40
right off the top of my head cuz I'm more focused on the dimension merge and the present process set of events on
38:49
that well what about your birthday I mean your birthday's coming up soon yeah
38:56
that yeah that too um I just I take it as it goes what what happens happens and
39:02
if something really positive happens I don't know maybe someday comes over and
39:08
actually it binds to take me out to wood grill or something we celebrate there or
39:14
I get like a whole massive amount of presents just simply delivered to my front door on that day it's or just or
39:21
nothing happens or or the merge happens and I'm or imagined finally gets full
39:28
gets finally is able to come back into 12 18 Foley and he and I are st.
39:33
dimension woe or whatever and so forth so I mean it's just like it's it's so a
39:41

39:49
if you want Chris and you're not doing anything that day we can watch movies
39:55
like over the Internet yeah I got tried
40:02
that why it seems like it was okay but it was like hmm it's like it's like
40:10
personally with me if I find more enjoyment and in when I'm doing things with others in person face-to-face yeah
40:18
actually lived closer I see well it I mean if you're not doing anything that
40:24
day just let us know and you have nothing to do and we'll figure something out that we can do on just just for an
40:33
idea but you can bring some for yourselves okay all right go it'd be cool [Music]
40:39
watch the Transformers movie was a good movie yes oh yeah that's right yeah
40:46
ten about the original right yeah I mean it's sad I don't like an optimist eyes
40:51
but I can't tuck got totally upset over
40:57
it just I think locked himself in the room for a while after that but yeah but
41:05
yeah I could say I still identify with that with the way what happened when I saw my women I saw my father as he left
41:13
and then suddenly I succeeded him and his life in this became I felt like I
41:19
could relate to hot rod Rama's Prime there yeah that's right I was Orson
41:29
Welles who did the voice a Unicron yeah
41:35
he is creepy giant war Beast I've never seen the animated
41:42
Transformers movie you need to see it the way a delay scenes together is great it's a it's done in an anime style
41:50
I mean it's based it's based on Japanese toys anyway but then the way that
41:55
animation is done it's very ugly yeah it's very like it's very pretty okay I'll have to check it out does
42:10
anyone in here are you guys a Ralph baski fans yes yes yes yeah I love Ralph
42:17
ashbey yes he made some good animation films I really liked his Lord of the
42:26
Rings that's probably one of my favorite movies oh yeah The Hobbit was good to bless universe my
42:32
favorite though is yes absolute favorite I didn't know he did that yeah I
42:42
remember Ralph back spassky's more risky and trees though oh oh look what's that one
42:51
wizard Fritz the Cat yeah that's it Fritz the Cat yeah he also did the movie
42:57
heavy traffic oh yeah I remember that one Mary Ann Marie's huh
43:12
Fritz the Cat I think was one of the furries yeah you know yeah in a way
43:20
well one of the first not-safe-for-work furries oh yeah Ralph esky back she did
43:26
the Mighty Mouse animated series not the original 1970s few cartoons like Fritz
43:34
the Cat yeah at least the first one yeah
43:44
under involved in Fritz the Cat to the
43:49
artist right the guy used to draw it says yeah yeah yeah yeah the guy Henry
43:58
Clay Henry Crum something crumb our crumb from a crawl
44:04
yeah something crying something crumb was a guy who catches for Fred's oh did
44:18
y'all see discord in The Princess Bride that I love kids possible a lot uploaded
44:24
recently oh yeah yeah yeah that was it that was a wholesome that was a
44:29
wholesome meme yeah that was really cool and just you know when tempest tells
44:34
Pinkie Pie rotate the lever course then
44:42
there's my two pieces of art that got featured in there just the cave of this
44:47
bear with the chute no cage of despair
44:53
Jack cage Nic Cage Nic Cage there it is Nicolas Cage there drawing Nic Cage and
44:58
then of course blood of Cora that lovely piece flourish shines the Cora embracing
45:06
and laughs oh that's a cute pairing
45:13
Sakura do you remember when we used to have that I know other people in the
45:23
color are gonna gonna get mad if I ask this but what do you think of it and what do you think of the new Star Wars Episode six oh you're like fortunately I
45:37
have Disney Plus yeah does he pull help
45:52
how big of a Star Wars fan are you my my hardly Oh
45:59
are you more like me are you more of a trek fan I've watched I touched on Star Trek
46:09
I've watched I've mostly watched Star Wars I liked Voyager I like the old Star Trek
46:19
because it's more like The Twilight Zone where it's it's just like one science
46:24
fiction story per episode that kind of has a twist at the end it's all classic
46:31
yeah well there's also yeah there's a
46:37
lot more a lovely tale wrapped up in there well III like I said a few before
46:43
but I don't think that chin has had it I've heard it CME's heard it but I think
46:50
Star Trek is like the ideal idealized way like how society should be but Star
46:55
Wars at a society is gonna be so utopian
47:00
Jane was kind of weird yeah you want to talk about utopia you should mention I
47:07
feel like I could just mentioned the movie version of The Giver I love that
47:14
movie yeah and I read the book when I was in high school it was really different in the lead role I put
47:20
Knuckles the Echidna there well that's actually really interesting and in the
47:25
younger and the in his younger brother who said I want my smack instead of I want my
47:32
snack I put a tails in that role oh I
47:38
will never look at that movie the same way ever again but I was back in my high school days I
47:45
still for my I found site you personally you know yeah between between prominence
47:55
middle and high school I put but just nearly every side character in the various roles just that's the way I was
48:03
so I was definitely in tuned to you know to I was definitely more to would see
48:10
what nice and way back then and I thought about this thing about sign for a jog every day
48:15
and that's a sign for me being a die-hard fan and watching Saturday morning and adventures of and all that
48:21
and I only seen a few episodes a few episodes of underground in high school
48:29
did they ever um when you read The Giver did they ever give you like a report or
48:34
like a project that's what you had to make up your own ending um I'm not sure
48:41
I do believe that question was asked I don't remember exactly why I said so I'm
48:47
gonna say yeah we had to do that because the book lift up on such a cliffhanger
48:53
they're like no you have to create your own ending and thanks to the movie now
49:01
we do have an ending yeah and the same thing and the same can be said for the
49:07
mist stephen congress the mist oh yeah i heard in the comments here i did read
49:14
the book but I heard the commentary day there was no ending in the book but then
49:19
on the movie but got oh shoot his family's dead he's still alive if you if
49:29
you really like the mist at all the MS Stephen King essentially ripping off HP
49:36
Lovecraft HP Lovecraft wrote a lot of short stories that are quite creepy but
49:43
they're they're very good and I think I think you would like them but uh anyway
49:50
you you you remind me I think I said but you're like cereal you might move Lane
49:56
like you're like the god of the wired oh yeah lean so kawaii I smell like the
50:03
first three episodes so far I need to watch I need to watch the rest of it though kind of true that's so everything
50:12
is services yeah if Lane was on
50:23
crunchyroll for example I'd be definitely a client so just finish the series there I'm just saying I I think
50:32
they have the sub and up on YouTube but yeah if you don't have advocate gets tiresome I'm sure they saw the DVD
50:38
online maybe buy the DVD set oh yeah buy a DVD DVD sesh look at that
50:43
you look that up I think the Funimation the Funimation channel gets the revenue anyway because they're partnered with
50:50
YouTube but it's it's difficult to get physical copies of home you have to get
50:57
in order to get digital copies you have to go to Japan or at least order yeah
51:04
they do a blu-rays oh yeah I have they blu ray/dvd combo of the complete series
51:13
of the original of the original animation the Hyperdimension Neptunia so
51:19
there is a 13-episode so yeah someone
51:31
mention the Lovecraft Bible is that the one written by a Robert Robert M price
51:40
I think are you talking about the Book
51:45
of the Dead no someone mentioned they mentioned the ad Lovecraft Bible and I think oh it's
51:53
just it's little it's just the Lovecraft collection I guess he's collection
51:58
because I love crap Lovecraft was very ahead of his time like he created as an
52:03
own entire world of God did everything yeah and there are people to this day
52:09
who follow him yeah that's right the
52:22
Necronomicon has fo glisten and nothing like that will yeah of course they're nothing like the real demonic runes HP
52:29
Lovecraft made it up just like what's his name Abdul el doesn't look rapture like
52:37
tentacle creatures well he's I don't think he liked him hey I'm not easy if
52:47
you this way he describes him he doesn't sound fond I'm not a big fan of Stephen
52:53
King but I do really like the Darabont films who knows how to you know that I
53:00
adapt him yes
53:07
Shawshank Redemption and and the mist that he did yeah as a matter of fact
53:12
well Chris brought up the mist I was like that's the one movie I actually like I wonder if you saw the black and
53:21
white version or the color version though whether in black and white
53:27
yeah cuz Frank dare about he wanted to release it in black and white but the
53:34
studio made him shoot it in color so there's a director's cut that all the
53:40
only differences it's in black and white that's really cool that's what they
53:46
should have done with Jun Jie Ito's anime well they didn't
53:52
get it they didn't get the proportions or the a lot of things right no they didn't try it was kind of half-assed
53:58
they didn't understand what made it so good in the first place I wonder if the
54:03
who's a mom I like I saw clips from and it just a little better in black and white I'll bet you it would probably I
54:14
mean it's part of his style that's part of his aesthetic at this point I mean
54:19
yeah just the black and white and there's there some of the some junior
54:26
you know stories where you know right at the last couple page turns it gets you
54:32
hey next time we do this and Chris is
54:38
coming on just let me know beforehand and all bringing the other guy okay Kiki
54:44
Sonny still hasn't come on even though I think she's here lurkin my brother came
54:58
down and chance was going off oh my tummy's been hurting but I'm bearing
55:04
with it I don't think going to the bathroom would really help me at this point I'm sorry it's okay it just hurts
55:22
what localized or general or what
55:30
localized or general um sure I know it feels like it hurts in my intestines and
55:36
it's got like a sharp pain mm-hmm and I'm afraid to go to the bathroom again
55:42
cuz I don't want to release any more bloody chunks cuz that doesn't seem like something that should be coming out of
55:48
my body hey I need to uh get ready I'll I'm
55:54
gonna stay on I'm gonna keep my mic muted I'll be back on okay all right later guys later yeah if it's anywhere
56:02
specifically near the surgical site that would be not good yeah it's around that area but it's been
56:10
a while since the surgery so I'm not sure I don't know [ __ ] about medicine
56:27
that's why it's good I'm seeing the doctor tomorrow I guess she actually
56:36
came don't be afraid of Christian she's
56:45
nice I'm not afraid of Chris it's not it's not Chris I promise it really isn't in fact I'm
56:52
really excited to talk to Chris um but I did want to say um the is it possible
56:58
that it could be an infection because I had an infection in my intestine once and that's exactly what it was like
57:04
except all the bloody stuff it was like a stabbing pain and I'm good really bad
57:09
did you poop out gelatinous bloody chunks no I didn't run into that pit but
57:15
I didn't throw up and I did I did get like yeah I was soon it was enlarged to
57:22
something they had like a cat scan was it kept that John the name Kyle medical
57:28
man helped it was a big tunnel and they
57:34
put me in and yeah I mean you know the
57:39
best thing was as well they gave me medication and the medication like holy [ __ ] was like someone pouring whiskey
57:46
directly on my brain like and I was just not there and they have the IV in my arm and they're like
57:52
okay you're gonna feel a little funny in a moment I'm like sure okay and then as I was sat there at this feeling just
57:58
like rushed on my body and I was like holy [ __ ] so high he was great he went
58:05
into the un's of the sinking place yeah I was high as a kite it was great but
58:12
the problem was that like my super conservative Christians mother-in-law
58:18
was there at the time so I couldn't swear by nearly did and she gave me this look like I just barely stopped myself from
58:24
saying holy [ __ ] she just gave me this look like I know what you was this
58:34
person and why are they messaging man things are slowly wean it's that bun bum
58:43

1:00:40
intussusception which is the intestine
1:00:46
kind of telescoping into itself that
1:00:55
sounds like a bad thing it's it's not great pain if the pain
1:01:07

1:01:15

and makes the noises yeah yes those ones have you guys seen the UM
1:05:06
the duck tales episode where his voice like in the new series where his voice changes and it's super manly yes to
1:05:21
normal he's like for testing oh yeah hi
1:05:36
I'm Christine hi by the way I'm sunny sunny hi nice to finally talk to you oh
1:05:44
yeah well the thing is Muriel obviously like when I'm channeling Ariel she's
1:05:50
young like a younger mindset than I am so this is me an Ariel I don't think
1:05:56
she's going to come out after all cuz no
1:06:03
very shy very small way shy she might come out if we encourage I should I say
1:06:17
rather it's that I'm not lying her I guess that's the way best way you put it cuz I'm shy so you're being protective
1:06:24
parent yeah another time another time
1:06:29
she's don't cry tell me or sweater down
1:06:42
where it's wetter take it from me we're
1:06:49
all mermaids ask you Christine what do you think of the the live-action My
1:06:54
Little Mermaid what are your thoughts on it I have not seen it I have not seen any of the live-action Disney movies it's
1:07:02
not out yeah um well into how in the yes yeah they just made a bunch of changes
1:07:11
that are kind of baffling yeah I don't know about any of the changes I only know that all the mermaids and now I have
1:07:19
dark skin that's the only thing I know that with like a man I I heard they did
1:07:31
wait really really was based on the drag
1:07:36
queen so really no yeah he really wants was this really famous drag queen hold
1:07:43
on let me look it up there's this really famous track clean and at some point and um they based our Sheila off of this
1:07:49
truck she's really famous hold on I mean now let now makes more sense why at
1:07:56
random times when a drag shows or whatever they tend to quote it's in the
1:08:01
play Ursula song from The Little Mermaid yeah they're doing all march to the
1:08:14
Disney villain and now I see this merciless person a drag queen mission
1:08:26
excuse me I've always liked Ursula is an
1:08:35
Ursula supposed to be like a like a black character that's it divine divine
1:08:40
yeah yes Oh way made the Ursula was based on
1:08:47
divine yeah yeah she's a jack performer from the eighties I don't actually know
1:08:52
anything about it but I read that online and I was like that's really interesting I've seen a movie playing pink flamingos
1:08:59
yeah yeah that's linked in the am Wikipedia article I think I've seen that
1:09:04
one it's pretty good do you like it is it good baby it's it's
1:09:10
right but it's quite quite dirty
1:09:24
or yes have you ever seen crybaby with a Johnny Depp no I think that was his
1:09:33
first big movie like his first studio movie and it's really it's a musical
1:09:39
it's really strange what was that what was that side again cry-baby
1:09:46
Oh cry-baby I know why it's just it's just I think in the contest the
1:09:51
conversation may be slipping that's right now go hide it's uh it's about a
1:10:03
greaser like in the fifties it's kind of but but it's not Greece okay it's a
1:10:08
musical about a Greece in the fifties but oh yeah okay anyway yeah dog yeah
1:10:20
dog pants he's very very vocal there you
1:10:27
go cookie chance even little Pomeranian know how adorable he is kind of like my
1:10:36
cat she's like she's got this really weird habit of if she gets let in the house by someone other than me she runs
1:10:42
up to my room and screams at me I don't know why I don't know what she's doing
1:10:49
maybe I don't know why I'm just like what do you want and then she goes again so it's like okay how did I just imagine
1:10:57
a cat screaming at the top of its lungs well I mean she there's a good description that's really what she does
1:11:03
she just comes in and what do you wanna I mean she goes away again to lick her
1:11:10
bone or something I think she misses you
1:11:18
when she's outside maybe could be right I thought maybe it was like she check to
1:11:25
see if I'm here because then sometimes she goes straight back outside again so it's like you just come in to scream at
1:11:30
me a little yes just gotta scream at her mommy and then go in the back
1:11:37
she was doing yeah that's cute
1:11:42
you like pop-tarts a lot reasons I still can't fathom she freaked out and like
1:11:49
try to bite the pop-tart away from me and like your cat you're not supposed to like these things it was strawberry she
1:12:01
likes the best she had a preference she did she'd go after any of them but if I had a
1:12:07
strawberry one oh boy it was on sure was
1:12:14
I left in my own art you know there's something funny about the us actually you guys have a lot of pop tart flavors
1:12:21
like we don't yeah my favorite are the s'mores do you guys have cherry cut yeah
1:12:36
we have cherry coke it's really nice
1:12:45
okay I feel like we're switching topics from pop-tarts to soda well technically
1:12:54
it here it here we have a soda flavored pop-tarts oh yes I think lemonade flavor
1:13:04
pop-tarts those are really nice yeah we
1:13:10
have this thing over here that you guys don't have it's called freedom medical
1:13:19
bills enjoy it yes that's why they give
1:13:32
you options with anything the toys you buy em girl just loves going and options
1:13:41
are what are good sure to have the
1:13:47
options yeah just like good you can make punch counter punch now but or Decepticon
1:13:53
roars do as I did I found it in between I love them all yeah I wish I could
1:14:07
afford them all but I cannot Transformers are expensive oh they are they've got more expensive these days
1:14:14
yes I mean I definitely want to get the new Transformers siege Omega Supreme
1:14:21
because I'm a collector of the micro masters and debt nap and countdown is
1:14:27
comes with Omega Supreme as the original countdown came with the transforming
1:14:33
lounge launchpad place it with the white and grey rocket I have one of those I
1:14:43
got me a jet fire boy got her a big jet
1:14:51
fire yeah so what I gave you my copy of jetfire and
1:14:58
jetstorm you did I love my boys they're
1:15:04
adorable I wish that series could have got another season so we could see more of them Indian a season four apparently I
1:15:13
heard that they've done reflect with Lecter in that series oh that's Mirchi to become a tank
1:15:20
instead of a camera still feel we got robbed
1:15:25
yeah oh well well this season these seas came out with the refractor and
1:15:31
reflector between both and cartoon colors and the toy colors in the in the
1:15:39
gift pack which I end up getting both because I got the camera parts with the
1:15:46
toy color and I also got the upgrade kit for the cartoon color oh cool so I got
1:15:55
so they both have their flashes and upper pieces up for centerpieces
1:16:02
and yeah I mean it's questionable decisions but we still love them magic
1:16:09
chant actually Gabe told me the reason why I was allowed to have both sets of camera box to remind me to keep my focus
1:16:16
oh and there's also sitting there's also
1:16:23
a literal symbolic reference in hwhiteland in the cameras and the way I have right
1:16:30
and the way I have both of them in my room right now sort of like a way of
1:16:36
like you know just watching me from where I am on the bed and watching me
1:16:42
portal that opens at the bedroom door
1:16:49
it's romantic yeah my hubby's got my back oh yes we
1:17:02
maker is a SAP for romantic things yes so a Steven universe yeah ah now
1:17:09
something I can actually talk about I don't know anything about transformers but Steven universe mmm by the way I had
1:17:17
my away the events of Steven universe happens everything else in the universe happens in an alternate timeline where
1:17:25
World War 2 never happened really yeah so let's just let you know
1:17:31
how the crystal gems fare to world war ii because it didn't happen that makes a
1:17:37
lot of sense actually hmm I would imagine that if they were around then
1:17:42
they wouldn't have gone it wouldn't have been drawn out so long because they're so powerful doesn't make any sense there
1:17:49
would be peace and harmony like if there was that and there would be no internal strife or struggle I don't know of the
1:17:56
yeah of this of the series I've seen up to the end of season 4 I'm surprised they don't go beyond that on Hulu cuz
1:18:04
otherwise I'd be fully caught up yeah they don't enough lakes either I'm the
1:18:10
same I actually skipped like half of the office areas in the middle and went straight to the one
1:18:16
they just released like Neyman days they're really good Christine you should watch them lame it's so Steven universe
1:18:23
is on Netflix it is yeah but they've only got I think the first two series are then again
1:18:29
though this is the this is in the u.s. Netflix I have a different one because I'm obviously so but yeah they only have
1:18:36
two series it's really annoying yeah Hulu pairs up to the end of season four in the u.s. that's a little better not
1:18:44
perfect though ideally have them all yeah I have seen the movie oh you have I
1:18:52
haven't seen it is it good yes it's really good he says you see essentially the crystal
1:18:58
gems are referred back to where they were when they first started losing all memories and steven has to remind them
1:19:06
and spinel is just all sorts of fun it's
1:19:12
just quite good yeah pink diamond was
1:19:17
was part of it too I won't spoil it oh really yeah no don't spoil it I'm I'm
1:19:23
pretty hype for it it's you know it wasn't shown over here that's why I haven't seen it how stupid is that they
1:19:29
didn't actually show it over here use the Internet I I should but you know
1:19:36
what I'm like I'm so behind and watching everything like you told me to watch bumblebee right it was on TV
1:19:42
around Christmas over and over again on the movie tunnels and I didn't watch that was your anything about wait what'd
1:19:48
I tell you about the bumblebee movie yeah there's a transformers one yeah I
1:19:54
like I like the bumblebee movie yeah my um maker told me to watch it and I
1:20:01
haven't I didn't I didn't do it no it was so cute I know I will and actually
1:20:10
it works better to me to make Michael Bay movie so much yeah that's what she
1:20:15
said yeah yeah I'm saying now I'm saying it okay so I've got two words of
1:20:24
affirmation here yeah okay tube you watching that I have to watch full movie no Doritos Starscream's
1:20:31
except the one I got for Christmas cuz I love my mom and she didn't know any better Dorito Starscream yeah the triangular
1:20:39
one in the Michael Bay movies oh okay yeah you say trying your start you say
1:20:47
triangle and Starscream and that makes me think Starscream when he was on
1:20:52
Cybertron in the generation 1 cartoon before we came to earth as well as the
1:20:58
other seekers and that he was in the corner he was me released as in the siege line yeah them ghosts like you
1:21:08
know before Starscream into his jet mode he's like in beg Charlie ah you caught
1:21:15
up so easily just like a paper airplane
1:21:22
they are entertaining yeah but yeah yes
1:21:28
I put on my Christmas list my mom wanted me to do a Christmas list and I put Starscream on it not thinking about how
1:21:34
many iterations there are so she got me the Michael Bay one and he's still
1:21:39
pretty cool I like him is I like the
1:21:53
Transformers Prime stars Green a lot I think that's one of my favorite iterations yep and yes you look like you
1:22:00
wore high heels yeah it was just so devious and it was
1:22:09
fun to watch him fail episode and that
1:22:16
late season episode leave this season 3 where essentially to make it the
1:22:21
Decepticon base became up Resident Evil haunted house with the effect we get
1:22:27
down knockout and Starscream messed up
1:22:32
real big and then guess who saves today
1:22:38
Soundwave here's to baby said all these Decepticons yeah he couldn't speak in
1:22:48
the city this iteration yeah I think he did say one line but it was really short
1:22:55
I wish they would have done more with him yeah yeah it was a song it was
1:23:02
Autobots inferior Soundwave superior yeah yeah he did say that and then he
1:23:09
gave the little smiley face mmm it scared Optimus Prime I think that wasn't
1:23:14
the series finale he said that for season four yeah it was near oh yeah
1:23:20
he's the series yeah the Beast hunter serious the season yeah yeah yeah that's
1:23:27
season four these hunters season four either way today up tomato Optimus Prime
1:23:36
keeps breaking my heart why does he have to die and everything why did you have to die the pilot of Transformers
1:23:42
animated but yes sorry miss Ives him I guess he gets to live in the end of
1:23:47
that one but then again they never got season four so we'll never know you know
1:23:53
I looked on the internet I saw on YouTube apparently there's a fan-made version somebody actually baked season
1:24:01
four of transformers and made but it's fan made so there's that has a bit of
1:24:07
bad quality in it I saw the first episode yeah still pretty fun to think
1:24:15
of what could have been though yep well there's one iteration that man did they make the fans made season four
1:24:23
so there you go it's like once it's like a so once the season three site the
1:24:30
Hedgehog Saturday morning oh I know that would have been so cool yeah we were up
1:24:37
to that one two also robbed original Teen Titans season six I believe oh yeah
1:24:45
then we got Teen Titans go which is just like a major slap in the face well at least we got Teen Titans go vs Teen
1:24:51
Titans so Chancellor she could that's--it's season they actually have talked about that would be cool yeah finally what
1:24:59
happened to Beast Boy and was an overpowered guy overpowered monster the
1:25:05
times were fighting and la terra or not oh yeah she was never revived or better
1:25:13
she was but her memories aren't there yeah they weren't there she wasn't fully oh okay again first
1:25:30
screen found the piss drawer posted it
1:25:35
in the general that meme of that little like toddler that possessed a cybernetic
1:25:50
robot schoolgirl the concepts for Denis
1:25:56
this thing you know the girl body would
1:26:05
start he never gets the respect props to
1:26:14
you Japan I didn't see that one coming no I didn't become aware that until the death ballot but so between stars
1:26:20
premiering will - I haven't seen that one yet it's right good
1:26:25
it was generation 1 Starscream vs. friendship is magic rainbow - oh man who
1:26:32
won well then again I guess that would spoil the ending it's obvious I'll give
1:26:38
you a hint it was not the cunning one rainbow - that's true Starscream is
1:26:51
pretty easy to beat you should watch
1:27:07
that's really good it's right I will look up on YouTube it sends you a
1:27:13
link right down Megan let's see and I
1:27:59
sent you a text message there we go yeah Pizza just came so I'm
1:28:07
gonna mute myself a little bit and watch it Willie I'll be around though enjoy the pizza yeah okay I'm gonna have to
1:28:20
restart my phone then I'm gonna rejoin the call then I'm gonna mute myself
1:28:26
we'll be here all right yeah real real pizza not that fake
1:28:33
British pizza how do I'm so confused what do you mean fake
1:28:39
British pizza yeah me too it's not real Peter it's not real what is it made of
1:28:45
then you just imagine you're having
1:28:55
pizza do you guys don't have the freedom for real pizza no keep it's over there
1:29:07
man they'll be mean you guys I don't think
1:29:18
I've met an Italian ever exactly you have a point there it's all fun and
1:29:27
everything I like the art of fun - really [Music]
1:29:32
yeah oh we do have Scottish people people are
1:29:40
really good to it I just like all kinds of culture yeah me too when I talk to
1:29:46
somebody on the individual front I tend to copy their voice - don't you know a
1:29:52
that was a leprechaun interpretation I
1:29:58
hope I don't sound like a leprechaun I
1:30:06
just said at least you don't sound like any like South Park well imitating Kenny well that was a very
1:30:12
good imitation because I could not tell what you said Kristine they used to
1:30:22
watch some Park I have a watch in a long time I could still I could still use the ketchup - I think a cop's like just
1:30:30
beyond season said Wow so you haven't seen that there's a lot more now I actually really like South
1:30:36
Park yeah I know do I just one of the newer seasons I've seen was the one where carbon was doing
1:30:45
like oh I need to go up so he was so he just sets one set like a murder thing
1:30:50
with all this dogs oh yeah yeah that was a few uh yeah there's a few there's been
1:30:56
a few series since then but that one was a good episode actually and he's like yeah he stinks someone's out to destroy
1:31:03
all of his dolls and then it turns out to be him oh it's probably pretty cool once he says they're prissypants that's
1:31:09
a mop yeah yeah and then I saw them so
1:31:14
that one episode where we got the I'm going to say I'm going to say it we got
1:31:20
the Yahweh and tweek and Craig yeah in
1:31:31
the middle of that episode there's like a Japanese guy that yells out like yeah yeah I make sense
1:31:42
did you guys I love the fact that they actually included fun art from from
1:31:47
people like on the Internet yeah that was fun I do remember that people yeah
1:31:54
people doing animation and separate getting more involved with the people who watched up it's like the guy who
1:32:01
made Rick and Morty he said that anything that's wrong in that style is
1:32:06
cabinet is canon or whatever really
1:32:18
about transformers it's just automatically that case where you got em
1:32:28
goes interpretation don't they you got let me try and enjoy burritos
1:32:34
versus up to this prime loving eats of a homes my impersonation no Rick yeah
1:32:41
those are you I might I say Wi-Fi over
1:32:58
one who likes one or the other oh speaking of Rica morning I'm really
1:33:05
looking forward to the rest of season for actually did you get to watch it like all yet near the recent one yeah I
1:33:14
was talking I met you about it I was like I watched the one with with the snakes yeah I did yeah yeah yeah they
1:33:24
said they would never do it the way they said they would never do time travel but they did it yeah they did but to be fair
1:33:29
it was like I it was like sending up time travel I don't know it was really
1:33:37
good I just think this whole series so far has been really good time travel
1:33:43
didn't make sense going forward there's possibly
1:33:50
that's they pull this season to Timecop
1:33:56
you know like the interdimensional multi-dimensional like a weird-looking
1:34:01
creature three premiere where that where
1:34:06
they were in Rick's mind the guy from airpo and they were ordering Szechuan
1:34:11
sauce oh yeah when he gives his fake back Lori I'd go back in time for this
1:34:20
for the Szechuan starts to take as many as I can yeah it was just a fabrication the
1:34:26
entire backstory was just a yeah just so he could bring back the Szechuan sauce
1:34:41
and it happened watch watching make it burn and McDonald's a this way you say
1:34:48
that that's my one hour man Morty that's that's what I care about nothing else
1:34:55
when they released essentially McDonald's they had this post for it
1:35:00
like advertising hey we've got Szechuan sauce again and they didn't stay it was supposed to be like we could they didn't
1:35:07
say anything about recovery but the art style was like obviously almost exactly
1:35:12
like Rick amore it was like an alien or something and it was like set your own sauce it's like yes I really trying to
1:35:18
rip off a brick morning I thought that they did it together
1:35:23
well they said now you know they really weren't involved at least I got to try
1:35:31
the Szechuan sauce when it was to release me at least I liked it and I say
1:35:37
Ryu at least not there is no current like during the Mulan movie yeah I missed out on that didn't think I was
1:35:45
what do you want they're gonna be what do you think of the new moolah movie I
1:35:50
would say that but I have seen the original I like it me actress who plays
1:35:59
Moo plays Milan or the actress Liu no no
1:36:05
no remind you of the episode of tf2 analyst anarchy at the yang where was essentially an April Fool's episode with
1:36:11
a ship silver quill and Mary Sue and at the end is what you should link what you
1:37:09
should um link post a link to what you're quoting I haven't seen it right

1:46:58
justice Cyrus I'm so alone I can't deal with
1:47:07
that right now oh I just oh um Christine yes did you
1:47:16
want to talk about the D&D stuff yeah when I was clicking on taps right now
1:47:22
and I know I was looking on YouTube I just noticed I had words still open with the document in it so yeah here you go
1:47:28
we can read that top to bottom and I can fill in the blanks like first up I did take a peek at it glanced at the test I
1:47:35
downloaded the file hey Sonic you and Rose choose hide from top ahead 2/10 to foot
1:47:42
not counting the ears it's three foot five not three foot zero okay three four
1:47:47
five well what would be the minimum size minimum mm-hmm because that's like a um
1:47:54
so the base height and the base wait those are the smallest I think they're not averages they're just the smallest
1:47:59
they can be what I'm showing it is the
1:48:07
average okay well I'll put it in I'll put in four brackets underneath of average as
1:48:14
average high well what was that you said three foot five three five okay yes I'm
1:48:27
in Sonic you and Rosie are definitely three foot five apiece so most everybody
1:48:32
else but there are shorter and taller scientists most using as well okay you know site you know I even
1:48:38
learned Ivan deaf I definitely know that Sonic is shorter than any side she arose
1:48:44
true just by two inches because he's like no rocket three foot three yeah I thought to be honest I've always thought
1:48:51
that just cuz of the way he looks like he looks like he's a little bit shorter yeah by about two inches but they still
1:48:58
like to race together did you I remember you said something about the ears as
1:49:03
well oh yeah Sasha's ears are on average seven inches
1:49:10
long so it goes from three foot five to an even four feet okay and a roast shoes
1:49:18
ears at least a female variety are and are an inch long email yeah and then of
1:49:27
course we do have there are female side shoes and Melrose choose which I did I
1:49:33
did release images of recently so the male roast used to have the right shoe style ears okay so I mean so the average
1:49:41
height would be without not count in the ears right just the top of their heads yeah okay I've wrote that down yeah and
1:49:48
like you know just well whatever's have rich lanes for right for the typicals
1:49:54
ride choose ears you can put that down for the mail rows choose ears okay a
1:50:01
crutch and Mahajan I got a I got a hold the Jo would you
1:50:07
like to speak to him sure okay um let me send I sent him the
1:50:14
link he said he could be here within you should be here in a little bit you ever
1:50:29
heard that one mm-hmm it's just a fun you know song or what no I really
1:50:38
haven't well no wait there is that um I really like the movie artificial intelligence and like there's a bit
1:50:45
where they say hey Joe what do you know but I've never heard a song that's not my words so I guess I get
1:50:53
that reference now there's actually a song yeah there's also there's also a
1:51:01
song of Joe DiMaggio Joe Joe DiMaggio we
1:51:09
want you on our side that's it's a classic man she played that song I'm
1:51:16
during the ending credits of the episode of Seinfeld where'd a reference Joe
1:51:21
DiMaggio eating at dinky doughnuts but he's not seen on screen interesting yeah
1:51:31
DiMaggio here think he doughnuts on me yo yo yo yeah we don't there's
1:51:42
there's a lot of stuff that goes translate over a lunar that's the easy a
1:51:52
interdimensional mage it's very timely
1:52:02
just coming in at the same time Hey Joe eNOS
1:52:10
[Music] okay so um so we've got the height and
1:52:16
we've got the weight down I'll probably talk with Kyle to to try and cuz I'm not
1:52:24
good with numbers um what didn't so the first thing you need is like a physical description but
1:52:31
it needs to be like a general description of the right and the like a specific sonichu eros you're just
1:52:37
generally what they look like general description okay on physical appearance
1:52:44
I would say yellow fur with brown
1:52:49
stripes and black ear tips and red cheek pouches
1:52:55
that's mate that's but that's the basic load down and typically wear blue shoes
1:53:04
with brown stripes on them okay and socks white socks and should I say that
1:53:12
okay so they're in terms of the whole race their humanoid and the Kotov like
1:53:21
there were covered in four parts of the body like everywhere except them around the muzzle in the stomach
1:53:29
I guess humanoid is an optional term to
1:53:34
describe them if you think of a ballon I can put it down extra point yeah but they're really more
1:53:41
like you know Hedgehog mouse combinations so we're talking about genetics between electric mouse and
1:53:48
humanoid Hedgehog okay that's definitely very accurate right there I just now
1:53:54
realize it okay I'll put it down um code and fire everywhere except stomach and
1:54:03
muscle but it's right right it's the stomach in the muzzle or is no wait sometimes they smoke the summer cause
1:54:08
it's just a mother yeah sometimes they I think they always sometimes they don't
1:54:14
yeah okay I'll put that down sometimes they have the tan area it's not just a
1:54:19
belly that goes up from somewhere just around the belt and they have whole hair
1:54:25
he had to to chest area if you were to compare site you to hume it to a human
1:54:32
that sense mm-hmm it's just tanker but they don't all have that like you know
1:54:39
just obvious reference of blake magic chant punchy wild but what about the
1:54:46
average typical science you okay yeah one second okay um and let me think
1:54:56
Oh what about gloves do they usually wear clothes I was only just a few oh yeah they do typically get pair gloves
1:55:04
okay but also I should note that between sign shoes and rose shoes clothing
1:55:09
attire is optional so they can be dressed however they they individually
1:55:16
choose to be or remain as our just being naked instead we say
1:55:21
wouldn't I wear the socks and shoes at all hey there we have a Darwin complex if y'all watch Adventures of gumball
1:55:28
mm-hmm you don't watch gumball with the amazing world of gumball no I really
1:55:33
don't it's on Cartoon Network it's really good it's a really good show it seems really weird it took like I've
1:55:39
seen clips and it's like really wacky it Darwin Darwin is the Darwin is the orange fish and he only wears socks and
1:55:46
shoes and he doesn't really have a genital area the speak of that typically
1:55:52
gets censored they joked about that in the show so sometimes so sometimes they
1:55:58
would just put like a censor blur over his bare feet mm-hmm yeah but anyway
1:56:10
yeah closing sorry I got distracted for a moment I got distracted too I wasn't
1:56:15
off talking about gumball versus a naked sonichu without the shoes socks and
1:56:24
gloves mm-hmm it's very true yeah okay I've got okay so let me think
1:56:30
Oh tails shall I put o in I should put um they're very in a color right they
1:56:36
have lots of different colors fur yeah I can't yeah fur color can vary especially especially if they don't have
1:56:44
they didn't have a matching side shoe or roast you're a parasite she ordered pair roast you well a pair of sonic you first
1:56:52
making a size your pair roast you to make us to make a rose shoe parents all
1:56:58
right but I do believe it is possible for a pair of either to make the opposite like a pair of science use
1:57:05
could make a rosy or a pair of Rose choose could make a Sahni it's just it's a it's a very genetics okay let me put
1:57:13
that on that's kind of important it's
1:57:23
it's Jo [Music] what's up Chris how you doing good how
1:57:29
are you good have you been I've been doing alright are you and how you doing with your late
1:57:36

1:58:38
on my backup - might i stern a hard drive I could send you a flash drive but
1:58:45

1:59:57
fun weekend it was a fun weekend you and I shared together I just I really do remember that have you gone back to that
2:00:06
burger place yeah yes I have
2:00:11
yeah they liked you their burger the day
2:00:18
before I think we went out to eat and I
2:00:24
highly recommend that one I'm just now
2:00:34
realizing what remember this here no time is that it's almost 9:30 that's my
2:00:42
thing it's after 2:00 in the morning here so oh well yeah then again I
2:00:52
usually say it later [Laughter]
2:01:03
yeah I can stay up late sometimes but most of the time I end up making myself
2:01:10
braid to hit the shower around 9:00 or 10:00 that's good it's nice to have a
2:01:16
routine cuz yeah I don't have any routine it's really bad yeah my routines
2:01:23
are rather not a rudder lacking except
2:01:30
for the fact that nowadays I may I'd say for about an hour what point Tetris 99
2:01:35
this really good my meditations really good for just actually it promotes
2:01:41
healing like physically buddy I went to the seminar where they talked about it and they talked about how I like helps
2:01:48
with pathways in the brain and all that kind of stuff so that's really good are you big on healing healing and magic
2:01:54
stones mm-hmm I really like moon stones
2:01:59
whereas quartz I mean I don't have a big collection to be honest like I have
2:02:05
money I have like more than six pouches worth of healing stones and magic stones
2:02:13
Wow I have four chunks of amethyst in my bedroom and arrangement along with a few
2:02:18
other stones and and a friend of mine you know her as the artist for Liliana
2:02:26
Rose - I don't think I never know well she's on Twitter anyway she said she
2:02:33
sent me what she sent me why those glass water glass water bottles it's a that's
2:02:39
what's now sighs but more is that her Twitter handle or is she another Jew
2:02:46
because I've looked into many Rosa chews and it seems that there's a lot of people named Rosa - yeah oh I'll send
2:02:53
you a link to a profile all right thank you anyway so anyway so she sent me a glass
2:03:01
bottle and that's Bell with GL ACCE because it comes with
2:03:07
a healing a big old a moderate-sized tower healing stone within it so it's
2:03:14
like you're literally getting your water on the rocks and you're drinking the
2:03:20
benefits of the stone including they have choices like amethyst quartz rose
2:03:26
croats rose quartz - and to others as well on the main website and then they
2:03:33
also have a lower less expensive version of it on Amazon it's about that's I do
2:03:41
believe it's the same bottle but they have like three additional stone interations one of which I'm sure I
2:03:48
would not sure I would recommend cuz I looked on the internet on stones that
2:03:54
are not safe to drink while they are I mean stones they're not safe to have in with
2:04:01
water with the water that you're drinking and they include all stones that end with ite
2:04:08
so with eight at the end really I want yeah and why doesn't use a lot yeah
2:04:16
they're very various different minerals that would be hat would be harmful so I believe one of the eight stones and that
2:04:22
Amazon this thing is fluorite so I would
2:04:27
exercise caution or just avoid that one yeah well to be honest I wouldn't be
2:04:33
able to get anyway like I'm really poor but the most of the ones I got like inherited for my mum because she used to
2:04:40
collect them so oh that's lovely oh thanks and I've deaf I'm definitely
2:04:47
never heard of lightning strike quartz I haven't no that sounds really nice it's
2:04:53
a it's it's basically quartz stone but constantly struck by lightning it's
2:04:59
mainly found in the high in the highest mountains of Brazil apparently they also have them over and over and we're met
2:05:07
over we're maker is in her home state in the desert because I believe it was her
2:05:13
grandmother who found who got lightning quartz lightning strike quartz in the
2:05:19
desert that's really interesting there's actually like there's a gem that's just
2:05:24
like that so I walk out what's he called why it's really rare and you can only
2:05:30
get it from one meteor that was made like a meteor came down to earth and it made a crater and you can only get the
2:05:38
crystals from that career so it's like they're really rare and really pretty I just kind of the name let me have a look
2:05:44
there's rare rare examples of shock metamorphosis anyway anyway essentially
2:05:55
also just a note like these straight quartz is like an ultimate healing stone and also I found this out from personal
2:06:03
experiences between regular quartz and lightning strike orbs at least or you know between two regular court systems
2:06:09
lsq is in general you can strike two of them together and make make light like a
2:06:16
spa okay well yeah because well Bob I'll
2:06:36
actually feel better if you send it back to me I would love to have you with being my true pump if abs on okay if I
2:06:44
might I might be there I want announce
2:06:50
it and if you do come along I recommend you know if you want to do something better than the adult ticket get the
2:06:56
high society badge cuz that's the one I got it's yeah I end up splurging I got
2:07:03
the three hard dollar badge
2:07:09
I'll meet up with you and maybe we can get might meet or something is that cool yeah I'm going with some of my peeps
2:07:16
we're two of them here and this chat right now but yeah good works that will
2:07:21
work something else you know I was just saying oh sorry gone
2:07:26
okay have you heard of this rock called shunga
2:07:32
it's this sort of dark black rock that can purify water
2:07:37
alright I think it was from Russia I believe I know wanted to take one the Russian kings used it to purify one of
2:07:45
his water this critical stuff they have little cool sculptures made in jean-guy stuff that's very interesting I found it
2:07:54
when I was talking about Hannam I'll link it in the discord server it's called moldavite is only yeah you
2:08:02
can only find it from this one meteorite that impacted the earth about 15 million years ago it's bright green yes yeah
2:08:09
it's right it's very pretty it is it's really expensive though because it's so rare and it only comes
2:08:16
is literally from space so yeah I think
2:08:21
so either that or it was formed when the meet the wind the meteor struck one of the two I don't remember but I think
2:08:27
it's called space class this movement um oxide it could be shocked metamorphosis
2:08:35
you just have to have surface level aluminum deposits for that to happen hmm
2:08:42
could occur in Australia to maybe I just
2:08:50
know the chemistry and you say Australia that's I'm just putting it out there
2:08:56
yeah I feel sorry for the fires that they've been having lately oh yeah no it's awful
2:09:02
yeah it's really really awful I don't like thinking about it maybe I'm sad I
2:09:09
don't like think about either but I just feel like get out of the way it came up in my mind just okay now we can go back
2:09:15
to talking about we were talking about moldavite okay there's a table yeah that
2:09:23
yeah tektite what would be a shock many more consistent mostly sad okay I have
2:09:28
no idea without you but okay sure I mean when it was formed when the meteor hit as opposed to coming from like from the
2:09:34
meteorite yeah there's not much actually unique about meteorites they love that in fiction but
2:09:41
no I know that I love that it only comes from this one specific meteorite like that you can't
2:09:47
find it in any of the craters anywhere around the world I just I don't know I think that's fascinating there's
2:09:54
about they see it scattered around the world they say there's about 275 tons so
2:10:01
it is still quite rare tektite mm-hmm
2:10:06
I'm looking up demotivate on the air now on its healing benefits and apparently
2:10:13
it's also known as the Holy Grail stone interesting yeah and definitely notes
2:10:20
I'll quote I quote it all the genuine pieces so the crystal come from only one
2:10:26
area of the world and they Schick Republic the meaning of the name Olduvai
2:10:32
relates to the Modell River in Czechoslovakia yep timeout I'm gonna
2:10:42
link a video of this other it's not to like I hope I'm not overwhelming you there's this other stone that I really
2:10:49
love called great agate and it's so pretty I've just posted it well when it uploads
2:10:55
it was a little short clip of it of someone like showing off it's already
2:11:00
great yeah I just posted it in the discard
2:11:05
oh boy you know what that makes me think of hanna-barbera at one moment Scooby
2:11:14
Doo check him out what's the password the great eight is first-rate
2:11:24
thank you mostly from Indonesia say
2:11:32
again mostly from Indonesia the ones I'm saying are you talking about them at the
2:11:40
mall tonight the golden night was a great game yeah and then the great gate
2:11:48
now you heyget okay it might be a regional thing
2:11:53
we say okay over here but it might be agate and America which is probably right to be honest yeah yeah I see I'm
2:12:03
actually just googled great the gate and yeah isn't it amazing you're all the
2:12:08
little clusters I just think it's so pretty yeah they look like bunches of grapes they do but they they're glarry grapes
2:12:17
that you can't eat but they're still very ready probably still similar to
2:12:23
those maybe I think that's just iron a long time I'll be right back guys okay
2:12:35
all right actually me too I got a question break
2:12:51
