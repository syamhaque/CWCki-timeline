This article is still yet to be completed due to stress. We get a lot of stressful torture in our lives that makes us crash into slumber. Given that inspiration is a big variable, and we may have been lacking of it, this article will be completed as soon as possible, at our own pace... HONEST!

Chris
Fidget Cubes are good.
Emotional and sensitive
1 June, 12:50 am
DoopieDoOver
I can't be mad when people ask "Can you draw me?" because when I was younger I did the same thing to another artist. Some people just don't know better. Not everyone understands what it's like to draw for a living. Be patient with others.
Chris
I know, especially when something Downs you emotionally so much about the subject matter. Especially with us, the artists, we get very emotional and sensitive. But we own our craft, because they have full heart and soul from us.
Dream analysis
1 June, 10:48 pm
Tabitha St Germain
A few weeks ago when Stelli died I dreamed there was toon villain in the garden pulling up flowers putting them into $ bags and driving off. Got in truck with military guys and said 'follow her!' They said good luck, her dad is that priest. We don't believe in him but we have jobs And she carried away all the flowers and left it barren and everyone knew.
Chris
Huh. That sounds interesting.
I'm curious, to better visualize it, the "toon villain" was that priest's daughter, and you were in pursuit for the floral recovery. Did she get all of the flora in one go? It may sound silly asking about a dream, but this sounds like a fun mystery drama. Was he pretending to be a priest to make money selling the stolen flora to lovers, funerals and other events, as a "legitimate" florist? Ooh! What if the "Priest" performed the same funeral ceremonies the flora was sold to? And he might be a past murderer who killed the innocent(?) people he and his daughter sold the flora to that he performed the funeral for.

You were really cute in that video. BTW, Pinkie Pie always has a Party Cannon. :)
Trolls ruin Chris' nomination
Chris' entry to the Best of C-VILLE 2017 nominations was hijacked by trolls, forcing Chris out the contest. Chris was not happy:
3 June, 2:11 pm

I did not make the finals.
Thanks a lump for over-voting me out, you Trolling Stupids.[Link to Best of C-VILLE 2017 contest]

Chris
@Merryweatherey Christine
@Merryweatherey
But you're a man.
Chris
NO, I am a woman. Get used to it.
@Merryweatherey
You were born Ian Brandon Anderson. So why did you change it to Christine?
Chris
There was Never Ever anyone of that name. Wipe it away from your memory.
@Merryweatherey
You said yourself in a video "I am Ian Brandon Anderson!!!" Didn't you?

No.
Merryweather would later interview Chris as part of his Internet Dream Lounge series.

I would have called her Ladybotty
Hair dyeing
6 June, 11:13 pm
Doopie
I attempted to dye my hair extensions to match my hair color and it dyed my hands better than the hair
Chris
That's why we wear plastic or rubber gloves when colouring our hair.
With your foot?

By the way, Hellbent says, "I've heard y'all"; I just fixed that detail on the .jpg yesterday.
Sonichu fan art
Planet Dolan artist Salty Squid shared his fan art of Sonichu. Chris retweeted shortly after:

Chris
Awesome.  :)

@WitchnessArt
[Artist shares work. Tagging Doopie, the artist calls her a "dingus"]
Chris
Yes she is.  :)
Chris reveals a health concern
Twitter user @KisakaToriama held a game in which for every like she received, she would tweet a fact about herself. Little did she expect, Chris would participate with his own shocking facts:
9 June, 5:05 pm
@KisakaToriama
16. My nails are really brittle, so I don't paint them that often. With my job, it only takes a few days before the paint starts to crack :(
Chris
Me too.
Less lately, because I had a misformed fingernail for a while; it is growing back to normal, good shape.
Fast food delivery
9 June, 5:20 pm
Doopie
What a world we live in, where fast food can just be delivered to your house.
Chris
Blue Apron is good.
Chris shares his MLP crossover art
9 June, 7:57 pm
@AndreaLibman
Hope your #FluttershyFriday is going great!

Yes. Pinkie and I fourth-wall break to say hi; accidentally intrudes on Fluttershy's tea party.
[Chris attaches his MLP crossover art]
Chris' beauty is affirmed
9 June, 10:11 pm
@VimHomeless
Trans women are some of the most gorgeous women ever!
Chris
Am I one of them?
😜
@VimHomeless
Absolutely!
Chris
Thank you.
💖🌸
Sentimental music
A Canadian radio station tweeted of an interview with MLP VA, Ashleigh Ball. Chris found an excuse to reply:
10 June, 12:39 pm
Chris
I loved the shoo-wop music style too. My father raised me on a lot of music growing up, including this genre among which. 💖🌸
Pride art
Chris replied to a tweet featuring anthropomorphic art for Pride Month:
10 June, 5:13 pm
Chris
Ah, yes: straight, cisgender and Bisexual; cool.

Adam West tributes
Chris replied to a tweet which concerned the death of Batman's Adam West. Chris also contributed his own tribute. Note his affinity for the iconic theme song:
10 June, 5:23 pm
Chris
@realhartman @tarastrong Oh, No! My mom enjoyed the Adam West Batman series while my brother, @colesmithey, was growing up under her watchful eye. "Na, Na, Na, Na, Na", Forever, original caped crusader.
Chris
Thank you, Adam West. Na, Na, Na, Na, Na Forever. 🌸🌸🌸😭
Chris
@colesmithey Yay our childhood Batman, Adam West, just died. I'd say honor him this week or so.
On trolling
10 June, 7:09 pm
@VimHomeless
Trolling is when stuff is done purposely. I see folks disregard political zealots as trolls, they aren't trolling, that's actually them.
Chris
What a valid viewpoint.
👍
On flowers
An MLP VA shared a photograph of a flower.
10 June, 11:09 pm
Chris
That is really pretty. 💖🌸
Chris talks business

Equality March
Tara Strong posted a tweet supporting the National Equality March. Chris contributed:
11 June, 9:11 am
Chris
Me too, and I pray that everyone in the marches all remain safe and unharmed; no unrequited riots need be, aside from the original intent.
Jumping to Doopie's aid
A user ranted about Doopie and Planet Dolan. They gave up when Chris joined in:
11 June, 8:29 pm
@Jaltoid
I can't believe it @DoopieDoOver killed Shima to steal her job. Thats fucking cold.
Chris
How dare you?! That is just mean of you to blame someone like that.
The user went on to protest. Chris continued to defend Doopie:
@Jaltoid
she also ruined planet doltan. fuck her
Chris
And, frankly, I like Doopie and her work and jokes on PD.
@Jaltoid
you're
right. I was very foolish. I'm sorry for my mean words twords her.
"For me. Not for anyone else!"
11 June, 10:10 pm
Doopie
I'm going to work on becoming a better artist, for me. Not for anyone else!
Chris
Yes!
😊💖🌸🏳️‍🌈
Cleansing the soul
12 June, 12:47 pm
Doopie
I've been hella toxic lately. What are some tips for cleansing the soul and being more positive?
Chris
I'd suggest counting your blessings, counting things that make you feel happy, stepping back and taking deep breaths, listen to good music. And as for myself when I felt toxic that ended up cleansing my soul and keeping me feeling like smiling I looked deep into myself, taking my time, self-reflecting, and forgiving, supporting and loving myself.
Autistic perks
12 June, 3:50 pm
Chris
A Perk to having autism: you can easily overhear a distant conversation in a small building over music. — feeling positive
