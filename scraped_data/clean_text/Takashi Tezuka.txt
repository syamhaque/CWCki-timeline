Message from Chris on Takashi's e-mail
My only current thought is about my recent learning of Sonichu and Rosechu in Animal Crossing City Folk. It Is Legit, and I have officially approved it. I will copy and paste the e-mail I have received, confirming this.

Hello, I am Takashi Tezuka, the general producer of Animal Crossing: City Folk. While working at Nintendo, I have heard about your original character, Sonichu, from many of my co-workers who read emails sent from your fans who were asking for a Sonichu game. I eventually received a message from Shigeru Miyamoto that we at Nintendo should take the first step into creating a Sonichu game. That is why I am programming in two new characters into Animal Crossing: City Folk: Sonichu and Rosechu. Once they are released, we will find out how popular Sonichu and Rosechu are with the Nintendo community. If a large number of players enjoy Sonichu and Rosechu, we will create a Sonichu game with the help of Sega. We have already contacted them about our plan, and are anxious to see the results of our little test. We are almost finished with the Sonichu villager, and are almost ready to start on Rosechu. I have attached a few photos of our prototype Sonichu neighbor, and we would like your feeback on it. Currently it is only in its beta phase, and we should be able to release it on February twenty-fourth.
We did run into a slight problem due to a little b it of error, though. In our testing town, WiiConnect24 was left on, and our latest Sonichu beta villager moved out of our town. Luckily, we were able to create a backup of the electric hedgehog villager, so nothing was lost! The only problem is that a handful of players may have recieved a Sonichu villager early.
I hope to get your input from our current project, so please email me back with your feelings on our Sonichu/Rosechu project at this address: animalcrossingnintendo@usa.com
Kindest regards,
Takashi Tezuka,
General producer of Animal Crossing and leader of the Sonichu-Alpha project.
I gave Takashi my approval and tips for the design of the final version of the characters. The images I have received in the e-mail can be seen below. The first one is from a Fan who accidently received through the WiiConnect24.
And with this, I declare another step forward in the Sonichu Game project, and the downfall of that Impostor, Jimmy Hill. I have also informed them of Sarah Mitchel's message of Sega of Japan leaning to pay the impostor, but Takashi will most certainly step in and avert the mistake from being made. Then hopefully, with their help, I'll be able to claim the copyrights in the UK that should have been mine in the first place. I already had them from the Virginia Library of Congress.
Anyway, when I have new thoughts, I will be sure to add them to this topic.
Love and Peace to y'all. <3<3<3<3<3<3<3
