Who's excited to watch the original story, in a movie, and have (or will) earn the Platinum Trophy on the Game, of the movie of the original 2002 story... ‪#‎RatchetAndClankTheMovie‬ In Theaters tomorrow! I have been looking forward to watching it for over a year or two. Totes Swag! And the duo survived to see the Theater Release Date!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKoeSRhF1nc

I have just enjoyed the Ratchet and Clank movie; it was Well Worth the Wait, and Very Satisfying (especially if you're a PlayStation Fan, and regardless of me getting on that as late as when Guitar Hero came out on PS2). The movie makes use of Most of the clips from the new PS4 game, and all of the in-between scenes were well done. There are only two or three differences in a few portions that differ from the movie and the game (or Copernicus Quark's telling). I liked all of the characters getting their character-building times in the movie, aside from Ratchet, Clank and Quark. And quite a few PS Easter Eggs throughout.
‪#‎RatchetandClanktheMovie‬. See the Movie; Play the Games; Earn the Trophies on PS3, Vita and PS4; Do It ALL. It is Very Satisfying. (Groovitron not in movie; may have ended up in a Deleted Scene; will wait for video to confirm).
