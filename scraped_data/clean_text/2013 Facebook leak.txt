Chris's reaction upon learning of the leak.
The 2013 Facebook leak is a collection leaked by Marvin of Chris's private Facebook posts from 2012-2013 which had only been viewable to those on his friends list. The leak was notable, as it revealed what had occurred during months of public silence from him. On 24 May 2013, Marvin created a CWCki Forums thread in which he claimed that a "secret agent" had infiltrated Chris's friends list about a week prior and screencapped the friends-only posts. The screencaps were uploaded to the image-sharing website Imgur.[1]
The following day, Chris learned of the leak after Null emailed him about it.[2] Chris angrily acknowledged it in a private Facebook post, designed to see if it would be leaked as well.[3] Two hours later, Marvin leaked a screenshot of it.[4] On 26 May, Chris added a comment to the private post, directly linking to the Imgur and posting an angry emote.[3]
The agent was later unfriended by Chris, but by June, Chris readded the agent, who leaked a few more images before again going dormant by September.[5] Whether this was due to the agent being caught by Chris and de-friended, or simply abandoning the screencapping, is unknown. At any rate, all the leaked posts have been incorporated into the monthly Facebook pages on this very wiki.

The posts were primarily composed of mundane updates from services such as Twitter and Facebook applications. What stood out were the posts detailing his continued frustration with not finding a girlfriend, including a number of posts detailing a hypothesized Attraction Sign; and his lack of freedom without the presence of his father.

“
I, Christian Weston Chandler, fully no longer want to ever, forever, approach the Game and Hobby PLace.
It Truly Is the Breeding and Meeting PLace for Trolls and Cyber-Bullies. Long before October 2007, there were very few people who would have anything on me, personally worldwide, because those people only existed Locally to me and with Constant in person communication with me. Those people only existed at the PLace. And the very first person who turned Troll against me, is none other than Megan Schroeder. She conscripted Snyder, Mimms and everyone else against me.
And when my family and I started getting close with identifying them as our perpetrators and The Prime Trolls, Snyder was looking for a reason to ban me, and so he did.
Megan Schroeder is the Prime Queen of the Trolls; the PLace IS truly a Troll/Cyber-Bully Breeding and Meeting Place, and I never, forever, want anything to do with it. The PLace should definately be destroyed and shut down for good.
And I want to exact my fullest revenge and divine retribution with Megan Schroeder. SHE should be the jailed and beaten up, that vile, wicked, traitorous bitch
”
-Chris, nearly 5 years since the ban, and the end of all contact with Megan

I know this may sound like a stupid idea, but I am thinking about getting one of those things to put in the ground to put real estate ads in, and putting advertisements about myself you know for a girlfriend. Obviously I am not going to do what. But that shows you how lonely and desperate I am. This thing would be placed literally in front of my house.
”
Chris, musing about the Attraction Sign's revival
