================================================================================

Delusion disclosure: This article or section takes place during Chris's phase of role-playing as Sonichu. He may refer to his Christine Chandler personality and physical body in the third person by using terms such as "mama".
On 24 December 2020, Chris, Naught, and Kyle chatted in the Watchmen Discord server The Place.
Chris brings up The WCT's recent ban from the group, alleging it was due to his political jokes, and requests for him to be unbanned. Chris also discusses lore relating to the Dimensional Merge and Santa Claus.
Naught recommends Chris watch the anime series Higurashi since its time-travel plot might be of interest to him. Chris says he will check out the series.
Kyle says he is unsure about unbanning The WCT over the disagreements, to which Chris points out the pettiness of it. Kyle shifts to stating that he doesn't like the idea of leaking. Chris responds by claiming that The WCT hasn't leaked. Naught and Kyle reply that The WCT doesn't leak on purpose and claim he is a bit loose with information; Naught claims WCT has hinted about The Place. Chris responds that he is also at fault for the hinting issue and points out that he was not banned for it. Kyle responds that sometimes there is leeway and sometimes not. Chris responds that he has talked to The WCT and is certain he won't hint about the group again, and again requests The WCT be unbanned. Kyle relents and unbans him.

Chris (as Sonichu)
Hey, @everyone.
Naught
Sup
Chris (as Sonichu)
A few things of importance to mention for everyone’s knowledge here.
Side-note and firstly, Neko, I understand, was kicked out of the group due to some political jokes that didn’t go over well with everyone.
It should go without saying that such type of comedy, if it goes over one’s head or is offensive, you can simply not read it, listen to it, or just tolerate it for the support of our friend.
Neko is still a very vital and importan component and individual in our group.
Such differences are petty in comparison to the greater good and ultimate outcomes to come.
With that said, I would appreciate having Neko readmitted into the server, and not to be banned from it again, please.
Second, and of higher importance, (edited)
We presently have the convergence of most to all of the Chris Chan Sonichus from the other dimensions, timelines and universes, to help us in completing the dimension merge in this timeline.
Last night gave us a real further start, as having our Chris here (she’s still in my body, by the way), along with me and this body; we both let out a simultaneous Silent Scream with as much of the deep emotions from within both of us to further break the Iron Curtain frequency on the 1218 side.
Apparently, that number I mentioned earlier, 54643821, is definitely the frequency that breaks that really tough divider.
And the Silent Scream from this body and Chris’ soul self are able to attain that frequency which does put a break in it.
But obviously with the restrictions of 1218 that this body has become accustomed to over the years, despite the further development in its psychic, magic and other deity-level abilities and powers within the past few years or so, it’s not enough to totally shatter the Iron Curtain.
Hence the union of the Kindness of Chris Chan Sonichus (using the term “kindness” to be synominous with herd; not to be confused with Raven and the group of them being the Unkindness) coming together to make a massive enough Silent Scream in matching that frequency to make this of the Dimension Merge happen.
And Third,
A new development has happened last night: from the alignment of the Sacral Chakra/Core areas of both Chris’ and my body, the two Heart Crystals manifested and combined with each other temporarily to manifest yet another vital and powerful object that will help us out.
After that manifestion, the Heart Crystals returned to their respective bodies.
In our Dimensions, here, we had the power of the Seven S-Chu Crystal Balls, manifested from the Chaotic Rainbow of 2003.
Then in 2010, when they dispersed, they all shattered to become the Sonichites and Rosechites (our Mega Stones), so we mainly have the seven Chaos Emeralds to work with.
But with last night’s Heart Crystal Union, we manifested the mythical Eighth S-Chu Crystal Ball; orange in colour.
We’ve stored it, with our Sunstone to maintain it on the 1218 side, while it still is more tangible on the C-197 side at this time, in our closeable S-Chu Ball, here.
At least for the time being until when it is time to use it, but we are keeping it close and safe for the time being.
Naught
Interesting,
Chris (as Sonichu)
With that said, we do have Chris here, still in my body, present on the C-197 side.
She’ll be hanging out with me and Rosey and the others here, because at this juncture, in regard to what was foreseen amongst the infinite number of possiblities, her and I being together will be vital and beneficial in this instance.
Meanwhile, our Magi-Chan is working with the Kindness of Chris Chans and the other deities, including Santa Clause, to make this Merge happen.
Because at this point, it is less likely that this body will be simply teleported into C-197 as it was amongst the most likely to happen.
So, we need to make the Merge happen in order for me to get this body to Cwcville.
Naught
Episode 13 of higurashi dropped today
Chris (as Sonichu)
Is that relevant to what we are talking about?
If so, please tell me how.
Something in its episode content being similar, perhaps?
Naught
Cause time travel
Chris (as Sonichu)
Huh.
Okay, that is relevant.
We might watch that; is it on Crunchyroll?
Naught
Does The krampus exist?
Yes
Chris (as Sonichu)
Unfortunately, yes, but he’s not as malevonent as a lot of people have portrayed him to be, but he still is a tough customer.
Fortunately, with what has happened the past year in 1218, there have been a lot less naughty type of people in comparison to last year, so Krampus won’t be an issue.
I’m going to Crunchyroll now.
Thank you, Bis.
And, again, please unban Neko from the server.
Thank you. (edited)
Naught
Ok, good to know. Ok

Chris (as Sonichu)
Just looked on Crunchyroll; the anime was not on there.
I’ve recently had learned of Higurashi through a WatchMojo list,
[Chris linked to a YouTube video titled "Top 10 Anime Moments That Left Us Shook"]
Suffice to say seeing that one shocking moment was not easy; it made number two on the list.
Found the anime on Funimation app, though.
Naught
Ah, it just came out so it might be a day or two until they get it
Oh nice
Chris (as Sonichu)
Has 13 episodes; is that right?
Naught
Correct
Oh parasyte is good
Chris (as Sonichu)
[posts a screenshot of Funimation's Higurashi page]
Naught
Solid animation
Chris (as Sonichu)
Okay, I guess I know what we’ll be attempting to binge today.
At least Rosey and I have Mama Chris here to share the load.
Kyle
Saw that and didn't know the context, carry on.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Hey, Kyle.
Did you read the bunch of updates I posted on here a short while ago?
Naught
links to a Reddit thread titled "Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Gou [Rewatcher thread]"
Kyle
Ya, I'm a bit unsure of somethings, and maybe some truisms that might be better in practice.
Chris (as Sonichu)
I’ll listen; what are you feeling unsure of?
Kyle
As to why he had so many disagreements, it might be beneficial to keep at a greater distance.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Neko?
Naught
Dillendo?
Kyle
Yes.
Dillho, can go fuck himself for all I care about his 4th grade literacy level.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Neko is still one of our really good friends, and a most valuable asset in our group.
Naught
Dillin is using this for content, and too boost his profile. (edited)
Chris (as Sonichu)
Disagreements are still a petty issue.
Kyle
Agreeable maybe, but if he's doing that, I'll vote no.
There's never any shortage of sycophancy, petty disagreements doesn't exactly override that, just a new angle to work from.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Kyle, please, Neko is still with greater purpose in our group.
You know better than to let petty disagreements take precidence over friendship.
Kyle
I'm analytical, I see what's there and I don't like the idea of leaking.
Chris (as Sonichu)
You know Neko would never leak anything of ours anywhere.
He has never ever done so.
Naught
Not on purpose, he tends to be a bit loose with info
I'm sick of pussyfooting
People on kiwi farm's know this place exists cause he hinted at it
Kyle
True, true.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Chris was in just as much fault of that as well, as you all may be aware.
She’s done accidental doxxing before as well.
But, you all don’t ban her from the group.
Kyle
Sometimes there is leeway, other times...
Chris (as Sonichu)
If you want to ban others based on such mistakes, then we should be not allowed here as well.
Naught
Better than Helena and righteous4cwc and Carrie Krueger that much is certain
Kyle
Helena, Christ, don't even get me started.
Naught
[posts a comic]
Kyle
@MKR No, don't.

Kyle
There's some level of executive privilege, although in my world philosophy I really only give myself no excuse,
Chris (as Sonichu)
Point is, I am positive that Neko will never again hint at our group on us talking with him about that.
I’ve shared this concern with him in a DM.
Cut him some slack, please.
Kyle
I ain't exactly going hard.
Naught
I do
Kyle
No idea how good I am, but I'm good at that kind of thing. I like having skills made extraneous by my commitments.
Naught

The WCT
hi everybody.

The WCT
It's great to be back, but I promise to never take anything for granted again.
And it's clear to me that there's almost to no room for error in here.
