February 7
[18:43:45] Christopher C.W.C.:
Hey, Julie. :)
[18:43:58] BlueSpike:
Hi, Chris. :)
[18:44:04] Christopher C.W.C.:
how are you?
[18:44:07] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'm safe and well.
[18:44:25] BlueSpike:
Kind of bad, my family has run into moreso money problems than before. :(
[18:44:40] BlueSpike:
By Family, I guess I mean just me and my brother.
[18:44:43] Christopher C.W.C.:
oh. I'm sorry.
[18:44:54] BlueSpike:
It's okay, it's not your fault. :D
[18:45:06] Christopher C.W.C.:
okay. do you wish to talk about it?
[18:45:13] BlueSpike:
Nah, it's alright.
[18:45:17] Christopher C.W.C.:
cool.
[18:45:25] BlueSpike:
So, how are you?
[18:45:40] Christopher C.W.C.:
okay. I was just AIMing with Vivian Gee.
[18:46:13] BlueSpike:
Cool.
[18:46:21] BlueSpike:
What did she say?
[18:46:50] Christopher C.W.C.:
She has informed me that she has honestly discouraged Clyde's violent rage moments.
[18:47:02] Christopher C.W.C.:
so, no worries, Julie, you are safe.
[18:47:09] BlueSpike:
That's a relief. :)
[18:47:13] Christopher C.W.C.:
I've expressed mine and your gratitude for her help.
[18:47:31] BlueSpike: :)
[18:47:43] Christopher C.W.C.:
She told me that he is likely to go overboard in his efforts.
[18:47:57] BlueSpike:
Uh-oh.
[18:48:13] Christopher C.W.C.:
But she has sorted it all out. :)
[18:48:21] BlueSpike:
Cool. :)
[18:48:27] BlueSpike:
I'm happy to hear.
[18:49:22] Christopher C.W.C.:
She has told him to make me clean up my room, whereas he said, and you have heard it too, sell or burn my toys; an obvious overboard moment.
[18:49:59] BlueSpike:
Yes.
[18:50:12] Christopher C.W.C.:
the videos, BTW, was his idea alone, but again, I'm certain that was another overboard moment.
[18:50:22] Christopher C.W.C.:
and some good came out of that.
[18:50:22] BlueSpike:
Yeah.
[18:50:45] Christopher C.W.C.:
it made it Perfectly Clear that I was straight, even though I had to lie out of my ass.
[18:51:08] Christopher C.W.C.:
yet come push-to-shove, I would do it all over again to help you.
[18:51:13] Christopher C.W.C.: :)
[18:51:30] BlueSpike: :)
[18:51:32] BlueSpike:
Thank you, Chris.
[18:51:42] BlueSpike:
But, can I share some feelings of the past, with you?
[18:51:47] Christopher C.W.C.:
you may.
[18:51:56] BlueSpike:
When you made that video and said you were a 'gaybian' was it?
[18:52:39] BlueSpike:
I saw through it, and I thought at the time so did Clyde. That you were saying you were straight, I was scared that you were trying to trick him and I was going to lose my life. :(
[18:53:21] Christopher C.W.C.:
yeah, it was a weak effort to keep me from saying "gay". I meant that as in I would be a "Lesbian" and more into women in that sense.
[18:53:32] Christopher C.W.C.:
but again, it was just a weak attempt.
[18:53:49] BlueSpike:
Well, at least it's all alright now.
[18:53:52] Christopher C.W.C.:
yes.
[18:53:56] BlueSpike: :)
[18:55:31] Christopher C.W.C.:
BTW, I wanted to inform you that I feel it would be better if when we talked, we would do that on the PSN, insead of on Mumble.Christopher C.W.C.It is more private; just the two of us, and we would not have to put up with anyone else aiside intruding on our intimate thoughts and moments.
[18:55:43] Christopher C.W.C.:
and as recently tested, it worked just as good.
[18:55:49] Christopher C.W.C.: :)
[18:56:06] BlueSpike:
I understand completely.
[18:56:51] BlueSpike:
But in my own opinion that maybe we could try and make sure that nobody gets in our room during Mumble anymore. I bought this mic on the computer for you, and I wouldn't want it to be ill-used, if that's the term.
[18:57:02] Christopher C.W.C.:
also, Saturday Nights are my Nights to watch British Comedies on PBS; a night I feel best to free up from the internet.
[18:57:30] Christopher C.W.C.:
I can still come onto Mumble to talk and answer my fans.
[18:57:41] BlueSpike:
Alright. :)
[18:58:06] Christopher C.W.C.:
but for only when it's just the two of us, let's leave that on the PSN.
[18:58:16] Christopher C.W.C.:
I Love You, Julie.
[18:58:22] Christopher C.W.C.: :-*
[18:58:24] BlueSpike:
I love you too, Chris.
[18:58:44] BlueSpike: :*
[18:59:16] Christopher C.W.C.:
oh, BTW, can you type your last name on here, so I can better understand it?Christopher C.W.C.it sounded to me like, "Milvana" before.
[18:59:44] BlueSpike:
Milvana is indeed it.
[19:00:02] BlueSpike:
Or at least that's the best it can be put into english typing.
[19:00:24] Christopher C.W.C.:
ah, cool. :) But when you arrive, I will still ask to check your ID, just to let you know.
[19:00:32] BlueSpike:
Of course. :)
[19:00:35] Christopher C.W.C.:
cool.
[19:00:44] BlueSpike:
I have nothing to hide from you, Chris. :)
[19:00:49] Christopher C.W.C.:
I gtg for now, but I'll TTYL.
[19:00:50] Christopher C.W.C.: :)
[19:00:56] Christopher C.W.C.:
me neither. ;)
[19:00:56] BlueSpike:
Okay.
[19:01:00] BlueSpike:
Love you. :*
[19:01:12] Christopher C.W.C.:
I Love You, Julie Milvana. :-*
[19:01:22] Christopher C.W.C.:
Peace.
[19:01:27] BlueSpike:
I love you too, Christan Weston Chandler. :*
[19:01:36] BlueSpike:
Goodbye for now.
[20:10:03] BlueSpike:
Oh, BTW Chris. We can ban Clyde now, so if something happens and we need to use Mumble, he won't bother us.
[20:10:12] BlueSpike:
Also, are we gonna play Burnout tonight?
February 8
[00:26:26] BlueSpike:
Chris?
[00:42:22] BlueSpike:
Maybe you can come to Mumble for the fans? :)
[02:00:03] BlueSpike:
Chris, we really want you to come in to talk to us. :(
[14:15:14] Christopher C.W.C.:
Hey, Julie.
[14:15:26] BlueSpike:
Hi. :)
[14:15:38] Christopher C.W.C.:
how are you?
[14:15:48] BlueSpike:
Good, yourself?
[14:15:55] Christopher C.W.C.:
I've been better.
[14:16:08] BlueSpike:
What happened? :(
[14:16:15] Christopher C.W.C.:
I've just typed it out in a message on the PSN for you.
[14:16:19] BlueSpike:
Oh, okay.
[14:16:28] Christopher C.W.C.: *three messages.
[14:16:30] BlueSpike:
I'll read it now.
[14:16:33] Christopher C.W.C.:
ok
[14:16:45] BlueSpike:
So, how are things at home? I might as well ask before I read the message.
[14:17:49] Christopher C.W.C.:
okay. I do intend to clean up my room later, but I need a nap beforehand.
[14:17:56] BlueSpike:
Okay. :)
[14:18:43] Christopher C.W.C.:
between you and me, if Clyde thought my room is a mess, he should see the rest of my house; my family has a LOT of clutter from small things in boxes to furniture.
[14:18:58] BlueSpike: :o
[14:18:59] BlueSpike:
I see.
[14:19:58] Christopher C.W.C.:
You don't need to feel surprised from the mess of my family, my mother got her things one at a time while "it was a bargain".
[14:20:14] BlueSpike:
Heh. :)
[14:20:32] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'll let you read what I typed up for you on the PSN.
[14:20:35] BlueSpike:
I did.
[14:20:44] BlueSpike:
I hope that Sarah's okay. :(
[14:21:01] Christopher C.W.C.:
I pray for her safety as well. and the video is uploading right now.
[14:21:15] BlueSpike:
Okay. :)
[14:21:22] BlueSpike:
So, anything you wanna talk about that may raise your spirts?
[14:22:20] Christopher C.W.C.:
I need to think about what I should do if she is still planning to come to me.Christopher C.W.C.Other than that, I feel that what is best for me right now is some rest from the stress.
[14:22:32] BlueSpike:
Okay. :)
[14:22:44] BlueSpike:
Sweet dreams. :*
[14:23:01] Christopher C.W.C.:
thank you. I Love You. :-*
[14:23:11] BlueSpike:
I love you too. :*
[17:11:28] BlueSpike:
Chris? :(
[17:12:54] BlueSpike:
Chris, I just realized you should maybe be cleaning your room..That's what I heard, at least..
[17:13:08] BlueSpike:
It would be nice to see a man who can clean.
[17:13:19] BlueSpike:
You are the house husband after all. :)
February 9
[15:27:59] BlueSpike:
Hi, Chris. :)
[18:19:03] BlueSpike:
Hello? :(
[22:50:20] BlueSpike:
I hope you're cleaning your room, I bet you'll do a great job. :)
[22:59:20] BlueSpike:
Chris, come on. :( We want to do an actual Q&A with us fans. :) We'll keep Clyde out, we swear.
[23:39:54] Christopher C.W.C.:
Hey, Julie. Yes, I was cleaning up my room. I still have a bunch more to go through, but at least there is more walking room.
[23:40:10] BlueSpike:
Okay. :)
[23:40:22] BlueSpike:
Maybe you can get in Mumble later?
[23:40:31] Christopher C.W.C.:
Maybe tomorrow.
[23:40:43] BlueSpike:
Okay. :(
[23:41:24] BlueSpike:
You can clean later, can't you?
[23:41:36] BlueSpike:
We all can't be in Mumble tomorrow. :(
[23:42:15] Christopher C.W.C.:
I would feel better in finishing the cleaning I started in the same timeframe.
[23:42:25] BlueSpike:
Oh, okay. :(
[23:42:53] Christopher C.W.C.:
Buck up, Julie. Did you read the message I left you on the PSN?
[23:43:05] BlueSpike:
Yes. : )
[23:43:14] Christopher C.W.C.:
was that the right word for the greeting?
[23:43:21] BlueSpike:
Yes. : )
[23:43:26] Christopher C.W.C.: :)
[23:44:13] Christopher C.W.C.:
cool. that can be our own personal greeting. I will make it a priority to memorize the word; I have it on paper, you know.
[23:44:46] Christopher C.W.C.: *personal greeting between you and me.
[23:44:47] BlueSpike:
I think I need to work late tommrow, are you sure you can't come here? It's been a while and we miss you here.
[23:44:51] BlueSpike:
And cool. :)
[23:45:52] Christopher C.W.C.:
I hear you, sweetie, but I have the promise to keep to Clyde, Vivian and you to make my room more hospitable for the two of us; you and me. :)
[23:46:35] Christopher C.W.C.: *I'm including Viv in that factor, since you know I've talked to her recently, and she's in on my making that promise as Clyde.
[23:46:49] Christopher C.W.C.:
I promised Clyde, and in turn I have promised Vivian.
[23:46:53] BlueSpike:
True, thank you. :)
[23:47:04] BlueSpike:
Tomorrow it is, it's a date?
[23:47:06] Christopher C.W.C.:
and most importantly, I've promised you that too. :-*
[23:47:13] BlueSpike: :*
[23:47:38] BlueSpike:
Well, date as in you're sure you'll be there. The REAL dates will be once I get there. ;)
[23:47:43] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'll come to the Mumble tomorrow, but I wouldn't call it a date, since it's mostly for my fanbase.
[23:47:51] Christopher C.W.C.:
yeah.
[23:48:30] Christopher C.W.C.:
You know, I have NEVER in my lifetime been on a Date, so you'll be the first, and I'm looking forward to it.
[23:49:10] Christopher C.W.C.:
BTW, forgive me for asking, but can you describe your body measurements for me?
[23:49:59] BlueSpike:
Let's see..
[23:50:09] BlueSpike:
I'm a B cup, for one thing. :)
[23:50:16] BlueSpike:
5'5
[23:50:35] BlueSpike:
Fairly skinny. :)
[23:50:59] Christopher C.W.C.:
Sounds good. ;)
[23:51:14] BlueSpike: ;)
[23:51:32] Christopher C.W.C.:
also, I hope I'm not overstepping it, but how are your teeth?
[23:51:58] BlueSpike:
I know that tour guide said awful things about that.
[23:52:07] BlueSpike:
But mine are all white, I have them all. ;)
[23:52:10] BlueSpike:
I even have fangs.
[23:52:21] BlueSpike:
They're all straight, too.
[23:52:30] Christopher C.W.C.:
cool.Christopher C.W.C.any particular reason you bring up your fangs?
[23:52:30] BlueSpike:
And they at least seem like fangs.
[23:52:39] BlueSpike:
Well, you asked.
[23:52:43] Christopher C.W.C.: :)
[23:52:50] BlueSpike:
I thought I'd mention that I have two that are like fangs. :)
[23:53:01] Christopher C.W.C.:
I have fangs too, and FYI, they're considered to be Eye Teeth.
[23:53:07] BlueSpike:
Ah, thank you.
[23:53:10] BlueSpike:
I didn't know the term. :)
[23:53:18] Christopher C.W.C.:
you've learned something new then.
[23:53:24] BlueSpike:
Thank you. :D
[23:53:43] Christopher C.W.C.:
I guess we both can play vampires together. :P
[23:54:06] BlueSpike: :)
[23:54:10] BlueSpike:
I look forward to it.
[23:54:18] Christopher C.W.C.:
cool.
[23:56:12] Christopher C.W.C.:
I gtg back to cleaning, and I also checked my e-mail for anything from Panda; nothing yet. I've also read in a search on my PS3, and confirmed her city's location in comparison to where the fires were happening (it is close), about the fire claiming over 180. I pray she is still alive and well.
[23:56:30] Christopher C.W.C.:
At least I have you, Julie.
[23:56:31] Christopher C.W.C.: :)
[23:56:32] BlueSpike:
As do I. :(
[23:56:35] BlueSpike:
And thank you. :)
[23:57:04] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'll TTYL. I Love You, Julie. :-*Christopher C.W.C.Do you have a nickname you would like me to call you by?
[23:57:57] Christopher C.W.C.:
I haven't been able to think of one for you yet.
[23:58:20] BlueSpike:
Hmm..
[23:58:39] Christopher C.W.C.:
no rush, though. we can think and share our ideas next time.
[23:58:46] Christopher C.W.C.:
XOXOXOXO :-*
[23:58:49] BlueSpike:
I have one, though. I think.
[23:58:56] Christopher C.W.C.:
okay.
[23:59:04] BlueSpike:
Kitty. :)
[23:59:14] Christopher C.W.C.:
do you like cats?
[23:59:24] BlueSpike:
Yes. :)
[23:59:39] Christopher C.W.C.:
alright, I'll call you Kitty. :)
[23:59:47] BlueSpike: :)
[23:59:48] Christopher C.W.C.:
TTYL, Kitty.
[23:59:55] BlueSpike:
Next time I wanna talk to you about something. :)
February 10
[00:00:00] Christopher C.W.C.:
cool.
[00:00:01] BlueSpike:
And okay, I'll TTYL. :*
[00:00:29] Christopher C.W.C.:
or, if you want to get it off your mind, you may still message me on the PSN about it.
[00:00:36] BlueSpike:
Okay. :)
[00:00:39] Christopher C.W.C.:
bye for now.
[00:00:44] BlueSpike:
Okay./
[00:15:01] BlueSpike:
Chris, Canine, one of the big fans, won't be here tomorrow, he says he wish you would come here tonight. :(

[15:49:07] Christopher C.W.C.:
Well, that's a lot of good fun for me to remember about you, Kitty. :)
[15:50:56] Christopher C.W.C.:
Are you there?
[15:51:01] BlueSpike:
Yeah.
[15:51:02] BlueSpike: : )
[15:51:07] Christopher C.W.C.:
Zlkavszka
[15:51:16] BlueSpike: : )
[15:51:26] BlueSpike:
Zlkavszka to you too. ;)
[15:51:38] Christopher C.W.C.:
I trust that you are safe and healthy today.
[15:51:46] BlueSpike:
Uh-huh. :)
[15:51:47] Christopher C.W.C.:
I am too.
[15:52:16] Christopher C.W.C.:
I have some news, I have just received a snail-mail letter from N.O.A.
[15:52:26] BlueSpike:
Really? Awesome! What's it say?
[15:52:30] BlueSpike:
Good news, I hope!
[15:52:37] Christopher C.W.C.:
It's from Mike Chandler, and it says, and I quote,
[15:54:13] Christopher C.W.C.:
"Mr. Shigeru Miyamoto did not have a meeting scheduled with you, nor has he been corresponding with you. Mr. Miyamoto speaks and writes only very limited English and our game development teams do not accept unsolicited games suggestions or ideas. Although Mr. Miyamoto make occasional business trips to the U.S., he spends the majority of his time in Japan at Nintendo's headquarters."
[15:54:16] BlueSpike:
You could just read it if you wan-Oh. :)
[15:54:32] BlueSpike:
That's no good. :(
[15:54:36] BlueSpike:
What do you make of it?
[15:55:28] Christopher C.W.C.:
Mine and my family and congregation's theory was correct; I HAVE been in contact with an impostor, and I'm certain the "Reggie" was an impostor as well.
[15:55:38] BlueSpike: :o !
[15:55:50] Christopher C.W.C.:
and probably the "James Conrad" I've recently received a phone call from as well.
[15:56:08] BlueSpike:
I wouldn't know about that, but possibly!
[15:56:24] Christopher C.W.C.:
I've suspected as much from him, since he did not leave a number in which to call him back, and he called my cell and it came up, "Unavailable."
[15:56:39] BlueSpike:
Huh.
[15:57:54] Christopher C.W.C.:
In light of this, I will make an announcement in the video which I will create for the showing off of the floor space I've cleared in my room, where I will have the letter and its envelope in hand and read it outloud.
[15:58:18] BlueSpike:
Do you think you could say 'I love you' in Molvanian for me?
[15:58:29] BlueSpike:
I can teach you it real quick over the mics, if you want. : )
[15:58:37] BlueSpike:
I'm not able to type it, I think. :(
[15:58:59] Christopher C.W.C.:
I have not learned that expression yet.
[15:58:59] BlueSpike:
Oh, by the way, what languages do you know, anyway?
[15:59:25] Christopher C.W.C.:
let me put on my earphones, and you can teach me right now. :)
[15:59:31] BlueSpike:
Okay.
[15:59:43] BlueSpike:
But what languages do you know?
[15:59:48] BlueSpike:
I never asked, I'd love to know. :)
[15:59:58] Christopher C.W.C.:
English and Spanish
[16:00:12] BlueSpike:
Ah, I know Molvanian and English. :)
[16:00:20] Christopher C.W.C.: :)
[16:01:03] Christopher C.W.C.:
ickvenschwel
[16:09:10] Christopher C.W.C.: :)
[18:28:06] BlueSpike:
Chris? :)
[19:41:31] Christopher C.W.C.:
Zlkavszka
[19:41:32] BlueSpike:
is away. This is an auto-reply message.
[19:41:56] BlueSpike:
Zlkavszka. :)
[19:42:24] Christopher C.W.C.:
I have just uploaded the video with the state of my room and the update from N.O.A.
[19:42:43] BlueSpike:
Cool. :)
[19:43:14] Christopher C.W.C.:
I was just chatting with Sarah May, giving her the news as well.
[19:43:20] BlueSpike:
Cool.
[19:43:35] BlueSpike:
Hey, once it's up. Link me to it, okay?
[19:43:46] Christopher C.W.C.:
