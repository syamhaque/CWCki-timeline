================================================================================

Boys Boys Boys v2 is the 12th track from SPARKLE like you mean it: ROBEE'S BALLAD by Robee Sonee and the Tomgirls. The song is a cover of "Girls, Girls, Girls" by Mötley Crüe.
It should not be confused with the 11th track from the same album, also titled "Boys Boys Boys". However, unlike that song, this is a straight cover of the original with all instances of "girls" intact.

Lyrics
Boys it- Bonus Track from Mötley Crüe!
Friday night, and I need a fight!
My motorcycle and a switchblade knife!
Hand full of grease and my hair feels right!
All I need to make me feel tight, are those
Girls, Girls, Girls!
… Legs and Burgundy lips!
Girls, Girls, Girls!
Da … cin’ down on the sunset strip!
Girls, Girls Girls!
Red lips, finger tips.
Trick or treat, sweet to eat.
On Halloween and New years Eve!
Yankee Girls, you just can’t be beat.
But they are best when they’re off their feet!
Girls, Girls, Girls!
At da doll house in Fort Lauderdale,
Girls, Girls, Girls!
Rockin in-in Atlanta at the tell-tales,
Girls, Girls, Girls!
Raisin’ hell at the seventh veil,
Girls! – You heard the news? There's
In the Soho Tribune
You know she did me!
Th-that she broke my heart!
I’m such a goo- good boy,
I just need a new toy!
I tell you what, Jackie,
Dance for me, I’ll keep you overemployed for a lifetime,
Just send me a story, you know-you know the one I mean.
Crazy Horse, Pa-ar-ris France,
Forget the names, remember romance!
I got the photos, of ménage à trois
Must of broke those Frenchies hoes, of those
Girls, Girls, Girls!
B-b-b-body shop! And a marble arch!
Girls, Girls, Girls!
Tropicana where I lost my heart.
Girls, Girls, Girls!
Stress sigh, followed by instrumental.
Girls...
Girls, Girls, Girls!
Jackie, Jackie Jackie Pie!
You’re the girl I need! Da only one I want!
Only one for my heart!
You know it Jackie pie!
Cause when I say “multiple girls,”
I mean, with you. Multiple times!
Girls, Girls, Girls!
...Girls, Girlsssss!
