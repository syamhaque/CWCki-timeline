God Hand Focus
Ship
Heart

Rather they be individual as Spectro, Viewfinder and Spyglass, or cloned and copied as Reflector, these camera bots always enjoying the view as they spy and gather intel. They even like to combine and take alternate shapes, including a set of them becoming a large hand and holding another set as a camera for a behind-the-corner perception of someone else around the corner.

Goal
Checkmark
Win this Goal when: A Pony card without any Keywords (other than its name) is shipped in a chain between an Autobot and a Decepticon.
Punch is one to remain on the side of good and justice, but his acting in his alt-mode as Counterpunch does get confusing. Fortunately, he has found an in-between form when he can be neither one or the other for a while and be just himself.

Is This My Body or Yours?
Ship
Heart
Swap the positions of the two Pony cards attached to this ship. At the end of your turn, if neither of the affected Pony cards have been remobed from the shipping grid, swap the two affected Pony cards in their present positions.

Pony
Gender-neutral

This little-energy-crafted imp is one that should not be tampered with easily, as he can suck the electricity from mechanical beings for sustenance and power. The only way to quell these beasts down is to totally drain it.

Pizza Bagels!!!
Ship
Heart
When you attach this card to the grid, you may choose one Pony card attached to this Ship. Until the end of your turn, that Pony card gains one food-based keyword of your choice, except for Pony names.
Appparently, a small part of the dispute between Optimus Prime and Megatron is Prime's love of Pizza Bagels, and Megatrons love of Burritos. So, when Son-Chu and his team were being dispatched into Cwcville, Excelina returned with a big box of pizza bagels for Prime. He enjoy gobbling each and every one of them. (Shoutout to Emgo316 on YouTube)

To conceal themselves during times of peace, some Cybertronians would take a visual alt-form of a human or creature and co-mingle with the local individuals until when they are needed again for battle.

Son-Chu is the head of the Cwcville division of Autobots, known as the Samurai Pizza Bots (they did pick up a a bunch of samurai training from Autobot Drift, and Magi-Chan helped them find their center, balance and better skills). Son0Chu has triumphed over many a Decepticlone sent in from PVCCitizens, and even a number of Decepticons. He managed to stand up to Megatron and surpassed him on his own skills and merit in two battles.

Where's My Trailer
Ship
Heart
Whenever a Pony card attached with this Ship card would be moved on the shipping grid, the other Pony card connected to this Ship card moves as well. This does not apply to discard rules.
Optimus Prime's Trailer usually gets teleported into his subspace, or if needed locally, it will teleport to a nearby location. There is the odd occasion where the trailer does not appear when Optimus transforms into his vehicle mode. It can get pretty awkward for him when it happens.
