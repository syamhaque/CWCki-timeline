Note on Credibility:
Geno Samuel has been deemed to be an unreliable narrator for the following reason:• Has a habit of making dishonest and disingenuous statements[note 1]
Bear this in mind, and use healthy skepticism when taking statements from the subject being discussed.
“
Simply making the doc has already gotten attention from Chris which prompted her to retcon her past. Christory has already been interfered with.

Edwin Grigonis, also known by the pseudonym Geno Samuel, (born circa 1990s)[6] is a Lithuanian-born YouTuber and musician. He is a Christuber and carpetbagger known for creating the series Chris Chan: A Comprehensive History and Sonichu: The Animated Series (2025), as well as exploiting Chris's imagery by selling items themed after him without his permission.
Chris has generally expressed a positive opinion towards Geno and has occasionally chatted with him. At one point Chris asked Geno for input on creating a custom TSSSF card referencing him, and when Geno asked that the card not be made, Chris obliged.[7] Geno, on the other hand, neglected to ask Chris for permission when selling items based on him (including appropriating his artwork for Sonichu: The Animated Series), causing some pushback by Chris.
On 13 July 2025, Geno renamed his Chris-oriented YouTube channel from "GenoSamuel2.1" to "Chris Chan: A Comprehensive History", and announced the "transition" the following day.[8]

History
On 26 May 2018, Copitz mentioned Geno to Chris during conversation, and asked if he liked people making neutral documentaries about him.[9] Chris replied that he wishes he was considered more famous than infamous.
On 16 June 2018, Chris expressed his hope that Geno and his fanbase will "recover swiftly" from Geno's termination on YouTube.[10]
On 28 August 2019, Chris (as Magi-Chan) DM'd Geno, thanking him for giving him and Magi-Chan a better recollection of past events.[11] He also told Geno to keep up the good work, and told him to feel free to ask Magi-Chan for any feedback or input for Geno's "Chronological History series".
On 14 September 2019, Chris discussed Geno after he was brought up by someone in a livestream hosted by people associated with Sonichu Mania.[12] Chris says that he likes Geno's series, adding that he didn't offend him too much.
On 20 September 2019, Chris DM'd Geno and asked his input on creating a "Genochu" TSSSF custom card featuring him. Geno politely declined the request, and Chris in turn thanked him for responding and said the offer would remain open if he changed his mind.[7]
On 21 October 2019, Chris DM'd Geno, telling him that he should read what happened to Simonchu, since Geno apparently liked one of Chris's "comments".[13]
On 11 May 2020, Chris (as Sonichu) replied to Geno defending himself and his documentary series from wrongful criticism on Twitter.[14]
On 22 May 2020, Chris (as Sonichu) wrote a letter addressed to Kai, and mentioned that in order for Kai to become "a literal God," he would have to humble himself. He explained that Kai can learn to do so from Chris via "those videos on GenoSamuel's YouTube channel."[15]
On 10 October 2020, Chris (as Sonichu) wrote a comment on YouTube thanking Geno for finally using his preferred pronouns.[16]
On 15 November 2020, Chris (as Sonichu) wrote a comment on YouTube to Geno for his Q&A video to celebrate 100,000 subscribers.[17] On 13 December, the Q&A video would be published, and Geno answers Chris's question at the end.[18]
KwaiiSandbag mentioned and discussed Geno a few times to Chris over their calls, due to being a big fan of his documentary series.
On 11 March 2021, Chris replied to Geno after he left a joke reply to a meme of Chris.[19]
On 31 March 2021, Chris DM'd Geno, upset over Geno's April Fools joke which entailed altering the title and thumbnails of Chris Chan: A Comprehensive History to replace Chris with Donald Trump.[20]
In a 4 July 2022 letter, Chris mentioned a desire to collaborate with Geno, writing that he would contact Geno as soon as he was able;[21] the latter reacted with "Fuck." in a Kiwi Farms post on learning of Chris's comment.[22]
On 21 October 2023, Chris viewed and commented during a livestream on Geno's channel in which Geno played back old video of Chris.[23]
In 2023, Geno began offering knockoff Sonichu medallions for sale. His medallions also included a Certificate of Authenticity, in an imitation of Chris commonly including a Certificate in his own for-sale medallions. Chris criticized Geno's medallion product in a 14 December 2023 post, writing, "Geno. Don’t even with the “Certificate”. 3D Printed never surpasses the full soul effort in hand-crafting. It’s not funny."[24]
On 10 January 2024, Chris congratulated Geno on his wife's pregnancy.[25]
On 3 February 2024, Geno began advertising more Chris-themed items for sale, including a shirt with a "WANT WOMAN!" slogan on it. Chris objected to it, asking, "Can you please stop the “Want Woman” shirt?"[26] Geno appears unlikely to accede to Chris's request - in a r/ChrisChanSonichu thread about Chris's comment, Geno replied to another Reddit user that he was "watching the sales roll in" and defended offering the item for sale.[27]
On a livestream on 29 March 2025, Chris got asked about Geno, prompting him to reply with "I have only talked a little bit—a little bit—with Geno Samuel. And just, um, the way he conduct- the way he conducts his videos, there's like a few things that can be criticized. Like, he could not be so focused on, uh, the times where I were- where I was taken advantage of. Especially with those theoretical relationships, or anything—and I mean anything—NSFW..."[28]
In April 2025, Geno began releasing Sonichu: The Animated Series, which took Chris's artwork for the Sonichu comics - notably Sonichu 0 - and applied limited animation to the pages, but without Chris's permission. The trailer and two episodes had been uploaded when Chris filed a copyright complaint, and YouTube terminated the series and placed a copyright strike on Geno's channel. Chris later lifted the strike after discussion with Geno, who chose not to continue the series on YouTube (instead posting the remainder onto Twitter).
Carpetbagging
Patreon
Geno has a Patreon which is used for multiple projects, including both Chris and non-Chris related. Despite that, the subscriber count closely aligns with the Chris projects. As of August 2025, the peak occurred with Episode 85 of Chris Chan: A Comprehensive History during March 2024 (845 subscribers) and then steadily decreased as the series went on hiatus afterwards. A slight uptick in subscribers was seen when Geno attempted to make a Sonichu: The Animated Series in April 2025 (going from 298 to 327), and upon its cancellation, the decline resumed (260 in August).[29]
When Chris had a Patreon account (since terminated after the incest scandal), he was a follower on Geno's Patreon, though is not known to have subscribed.[30]
Atlas VPN
On 18 March 2023, Geno premiered Episode 73 of Chris Chan: A Comprehensive History, which contained a sponsor plug for Atlas VPN. After recapping one of the MagiChan111448 tweets, the episode began an advertisement for Atlas VPN which lasted for over a minute. In response to criticism over the timing of the ad placement, Geno answered, "You usually don’t have that choice. You’re asked to place it “in the first part” of the video to ensure the highest number of people watching, and to integrate it into your normal video flow."[31]
GenoineProductions
In late 2023, Geno opened an Etsy store called GenoineProductions, where he made 42 sales before the shop was closed. On 13 March 2025, Geno replied to a Twitter user who had experienced major problems using Etsy, specifically not receiving money after orders were fulfilled (still being expected to pay taxes), cases being opened and appealed without the owner's notice, and no response from Etsy themselves via email regarding the issues.[32] Geno said that the same thing happened to him, jokingly saying that Etsy "banned" him for "being too popular."
genosamuel.com
Since at least 24 April 2022, Geno has owned a website under the domain genosamuel.com, using it as a hub for his Chris content and other personal projects. In late 2023, presumably after his Etsy failed, he began to sell bootleg Chris merchandise using the site. He started with his own 3D printed miniature Sonic Totems and Sonichu and Rosechu medallions, and orders contained a knockoff "Certificate of Authenticity" and signature from Geno. On 14 December 2023, Chris criticized the certificate and the fact that Geno used a 3D printer for his medallions, saying it's "not funny."[24] This did not discourage Geno, as he still sells them—as well as medallions of Chris's other characters, Blake, Bubbles, Angelica, and Sylvana—as of May 2025.
By 3 February 2024, preorders were available for several Chris-themed hats and shirts. On that day, Chris commented on Geno's YouTube community post promoting the merch, particularly disapproving of the "WANT WOMAN!" shirt, requesting that he "stops" it.[26] This did not discourage Geno, as he still sells the shirt as of May 2025.
Sonichu: The Animated Series
Main article: Sonichu: The Animated Series (Geno Samuel)
In April 2025, Geno began releasing Sonichu: The Animated Series. The series was funded by patrons on Patreon, and patrons that pledged at least $5 per month would have their name added in the credits of the episodes. In the early morning hours of 5 May 2025, Geno made an announcement on Patreon regarding Chris's takedown:[33]
“
Hey Y'all! So I got a copyright strike from Christine Chandler on YouTube which caused Sonichu: The Animated Series Episodes 1 and 2 to be taken down. Totally understandable since it is her artwork that I'm using (though those are not her characters, but that's besides the point...).
Anyway, So this project is dead. Anyone who joined my Patreon to support the series is free to leave or ask for a refund if you'd like. If you're willing to stick around, you're in luck cuz this means I can work faster on my other projects like documentaries and music.
Thank you for your understanding.
All the best,
G.G.
”
Initially, Geno heavily promoted his Patreon alongside the series, and updated his Patreon's description to mention the series.[34] Geno also animated at least two of Chris's Sonichu Classic Strips, both of which are locked behind a paywall on Patreon.[35][36] Despite the copyright strike, the public statement of disapproval from Chris, and Geno's statements of agreement to cease continuing the project, he premiered Episode 3 of the series on Twitter later the same day.[37] Notably, Geno makes money from post engagement on Twitter, due to paying for a blue checkmark.

Notes
↑ Geno has made posts falsely claiming: that he is not gaming a system for selfish gain regarding his sales, when he has ripped off Chris's design of Sonichu medallions; that, about his Sonichu: The Animated Series, that those are not Chris's characters he used, when he has used Chris's characters such as the fictionalized Chris Chan and Reldnahc Notsew Naitsirhc; that he does not read the CWCki, which he has used material from in his series Chris Chan: A Comprehensive History; that his series is unbiased, when there is bias within it.
