9 February 2021
ok bout to start driving talk soon
Hey. Feeling fatigued and not sure I'll be up for the call tonight; can we reschedule for tomorrow, please?
I would much rather prefer tonight if you are able, I have another meeting tomorrow night and I have class in the morning and afternoon
Hello?
Look if your not serious about this please do not waist my time
Ok fine, We can meet tomorrow, but I have other appointments so it will have to be at sharp. Unless you can meet tonight. Also, I looked over your internet presence and meditated and I have some news that may be quite shocking
8pm est please consider
10 February 2021
Are we still meeting tonight?
Yes, I will be of better energy tonight; I will make positive of it.
great
Feeling better tonight.
Talk with you about 8:00.

11 February 2021
I really enjoyed our chat last night and I will be doing some more research to further help our psychic connection
12 February 2021
Awesome. Thanks a bunch.😊⚡
of course
14 February 2021
Hey Sonichu, So my house is being renovated this week and the week after, and I am worried it may interfere. Is there any way we could meet tonight before the construction begins?
hey, I will be ready at like 8:05
19 February 2021
Hi Sonichu, This is lily, she is a good friend of mine who will be joining us in our next session, I am available this weekend if you would like to meet tonight or tomorrow night
Hi sonichu! It's great to finally meet you :)
just let us know a time that works for you. Like i said we are available tonight at about 9pm or tomorrow at 8pm or so
Hey, @everyone. I am humbled by this moment. Tonight's not good; getting over things from today, and what this body recalled about itself that was its one failure in life up to this point.
To be blunt, but sparing the TMI: Chris has talked with bunches of other people, developed her self-esteem and self-confidence, had a number of relationships, dated, and two times ever, in the same month of April, 2012, had sex with a woman. But, Chris has never, with this body in this universe, properly with mutual respect, compassion and consent, ever cuddled, laid, or made out/kissed with anyone. The body and the soul star have been feeling bugged and bummed over this failure the last few days, and I've been working on healing and re-energizing this body during that time as well. And working hard in consoling this thing.
I will make the effort to be on with you all tomorrow night at 8:00 pm, eastern. Also, I am not going public with this situation, and keeping it strictly confidential. I am also not online dating due to not only the obvious pandemic, but also the haters and bad trolls who are always lurking those social and dating websites. Thank you for listening.
of course even if you just want to vent we would be happy to give council in a time when real help is hard to come by please do not hesitate to share your feelings
20 February 2021
Hi sonichu, will we be meeting tonight?
@CWCSonichu1982
hey @CWCSonichu1982, we may need to push off the meeting untill 9 because lily is running an errand right now would this be ok?
My apologies Sonichu, I know you have a lot going on right now and am sorry for any inconvenience I may be causing with the delay
No prob.
Nine is cool.
Feeling better
today, actually.
great talk at 9
Had a few dreams, with some sleep. During the 2:00 meditate, Rosey and I traversed the Earth, battled a few demons with Doctor Steven Strange, absorbed the souls after defeating the lot of them that were attracted to his home in New York, absorbed and purified a few million other recently deceased souls into the conduit of this body, and literally absorbed half the energy of all unmined crystals and magic stones around the world. Also, Mina (from Mewni, the avid soldier of Solara); she died, and she attacked Danny Phantom with that sword of hers. I had to calm her down, and I rallied her and got her into the conduit as well. Bonus points for her, since Solara, herself, is in here as well. Also, Tokyo Treat box arrived, warmed a pot of Sakura, Pineapple and Chamomile tea (combining flavors is very cool); other than the chamomile, the other two came from two past Tokyo Treat boxes.
Very eventful, and pleasant later on, the afternoon has been.
23 February 2021
Hi Sonich, as I understand, tomorrow is christines birthday. Would you like to have a session tomorrow night?

@CWCSonichu1982
24 February 2021
Happy Birthday Christine
Yes happy birthday! 🙂 I know Christine is not in this world right now but if you could let her know we say happy birthday that would be great
Thanks.😊⚡
25 February 2021
Hi Christine, I saw your twitter post announcing your return to our dimension. I just want to say it is such a pleasure to meet you and I hope we can talk soon as we have been speaking with sonichu. Im sure sonichu told you that Lily and I are here to help with any psychic issues you may have and we would be thrilled to continue working with you
@CWCSonichu1982
Yes, this ol' noggin does remember y'all. I am presently feeling some psychic headaches over the status of this universe. It is still long premature for My Little Pony G5 to happen; G4 needs its five more seasons. I feel triggered after reading about the recent leak and content.
26 February 2021
When do you want to meet next?
@CWCSonichu1982
27 February 2021
?
Are you available tomorrow night?
@CWCSonichu1982
Christine? We would very much like to continue our psychic work with you as we feel we have made great progress, however, if you feel you would prefer to discontinue our sessions that would be fine as well. We just need to know what will be happening as we have a relatively busy schedule and need to know what to expect. Thanks
^
I will have a session with you both. Sorry for not responding sooner; having to resync myself with my own body is an arduous process after ten months and 24 days.
Monday, perhaps.
I can do monday at like 8pm est probably
Okay. I'll talk with y'all then.
Great
1 March 2021
@CWCSonichu1982 Just confirming that we
are still meeting tonight at 8pm est?
Yes, tonight at 8:00; I will be cool enough. Still working and sorting out the problems with my body. It's still really bumming out on lack of mutual compassionate and respecting cuddles.
Great Cant wait to finally talk to the real you
@CWCSonichu1982 we are waiting for you in the call
Are you ready?
Look, I am taking time out of my schedule to meet with you, and I want to meet with you, I really do, but If you are going to waste our time maybe it is best if I start charging you for our time
Please respond
I will wait until 8:30 and If you are not here, I cannot meet tonight and we will have to reschedule for tomorrow or Wednesday night @CWCSonichu1982
You still there?
I'm sorry.
I got sidetracked.
Let me restart my computer and I would be happy to call now
Thank you
Ofc give me 5-10 to set up my space
