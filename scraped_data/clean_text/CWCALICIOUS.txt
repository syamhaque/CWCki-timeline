Lyrics
Listen up y'all cause this is it
The beat that I'm bangin' is delicious
Fergalicious, definition:
Make them girls go loco
'Ey want my treasure
So they get their pleasures from my photo
You can see me, you can't squeeze me
I ain't easy, I ain't sleazy
I got reasons why I tease 'em
Girls just come and go like seasons
...Fergalicious, so del...[loses track]
But I ain't promiscuous
And if you was suspicious
All that BEEP is fictitious
I blow kisses
That puts them girls on rock, rock
And they be linin' down the block
Just to watch what I got
So delicious
It's...hot, hot, hot
So delicious
I put them girls on rock, rock
So delicious
They want a taste of what I got
I'm Fergalicious
T-t-t-t-t-tasty, tasty

[The following verses are comprised of mumbles and word mash, which is saying a lot]
All the time I turn around brothas gather round
Always lookin' at me up and down, lookin' at my
I just wanna say it now I ain't tryin? to round up drama
Little mama I don't wanna take your girl
And I know I'm comin' off just a little bit conceited
And I keep on repeatin' how the girl wanna eat it
But I'm tryin' to tell, that I can't be treated like clientele
Cause they say she delicious
But I ain't promiscuous
And if you was suspicious
All that BEEP is fictitious
I blow kisses
That puts them girls on rock
And they be linin' down the block
Just to watch what I got
My body stay vicious
I be up in the gym
Just workin' on my fitness
She's my witness
I put yo' girl on rock
And he be linin' down the block
Just to watch what I got
So delicious
