Just like someone we know.

Aqua Teen Hunger Force is an animated series on Adult Swim that later gained a cult following. It features low-budget bad animation, so it comes as no surprise to see that Chris likes it, even if he probably doesn't get many of the jokes.
Chris wasn't always a fan of the series. In a 2005 post on the Cartoon Network forums, he said that he enjoyed all of Adult Swim's shows "except ATHF," although he didn't explain why. He later started to like it, including the bizarre Old Time Rock and Roll on Shredwud music video. However, he seems to have gone off it around 2010 according to Vivian Gee E-Mails, comparing its decline to Alec's "Blood and Gore."
