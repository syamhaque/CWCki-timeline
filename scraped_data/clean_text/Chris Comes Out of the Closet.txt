Manipulation Disclosure: The views Chris
expresses may or may not be his own. Many of Chris's videos were orchestrated behind the scenes by trolls putting ideas in his head or goading him to act out; the majority of these interactions was never released to the public.
“
But when it comes down to it, I would Honestly rather smear my image with crap than have someone I care deeply for get hurt. I prayed to God and Jesus for forgiveness and strength beforehand.
”
Chris to Julie[1]
Threatening Julie with harm, a vengeful Clyde Cash demanded in Mumble 3 that Chris come out of the closet on YouTube in exchange for her safety. Ambivalent about how to handle the situation, Chris posts a video in which he filibusters for nearly three minutes and finally declares himself to be a "gaybian". This didn't satisfy Cash, who pointed out in Mumble 3.5 that gaybian isn't a word, and so Chris went back and made another video shortly afterward, this time saying the all-important words "I'm gay".
While the Gaybian Ruse failed, Chris was still able to slip in "subtle" hints that he was less than sincere about his confession. Viewers familiar with Chris's YouTube videos will notice that he is not wearing his Medallion, and he is holding his Optimus Prime toy throughout both recordings. Conspicuously, a Sailor Moon Poster is also present in the background. Also, Chris outright states that he's being forced to come out the closet, which is a surreptitious way of communicating that he is being forced to come out of the closet. Chris would later disavow these videos on the following day, confirming that the absence of the medallion, the present Optimus Prime, and Sailor Moon posters were indeed clues that he was, in fact, being forced to come out of the closet. This would seem to put his agreement with Clyde in abeyance, but Julie has apparently been unharmed ever since.
Notable in both of these videos is how averse Chris is to even saying the word "gay", even when he isn't using the word to describe himself. Chris told Julie that this was actually the first time in his entire life that he said "the "G" word."[2]

Description
"Fine, I'm Gay."
No, I am NOT; I was Forced to make this video by Clyde, or he would have hurt or killed a close, trusted Girl-Friend of mine.
At least one person in an e-mail he sent to me noticed my non-verbal clues, and I copy/paste,
"In your "coming out" video today, you didn't wear your Sonichu medaillon. Also, you had Optimus Prime on your lap.
Could it be -- have the Troll2 forced you to make a YouTube video in which you claim to be gay?
We all know it isn't the TRUE ORIGINAL Chris-chan if he doesn't wear his medaillon or High-School Ring.
Also, Transformers are toys for boys, so I guess that's a subtle way of telling us you haven't forgotten your gender.
Am I reading the signs right?
You aren't gay, you were forced to make this video?"
Correct to a Capital "T", but I am the TRUE Christian Weston Chandler. I took off my medal in the video, because forcibly smearing MY name was bad enough.

’Ello.
Y’know, the word… "gaaay"… tends to be thrown around a lot. Especially when, uh, one's words… is, uh, heavily… understood one way… or understood another way. It can mean so much. But when it comes to—uh, in the end… it can make a lot of difference.
I, uh, personally… respect… the, uh… gay population. And, uh… I applaurd them because… they come out the closets with their own emotions and feelings and whatnot. And sometimes, even us… brave heroes… need to come out the closet, as well. I have come out of my… emotional… prohibited shell… that has prohib—has prohibited me from, uh… expressing my emotions… in an understood, wise choice of words. But… I have learned… to come out… [inhales sharply] and express them in a good term, as well.
But—and especially when… it can come from the h—especially when the emotions come from the heart, and the body language, it just depends on, uh, how it is understood from that point or another.
But, uh, I'll cut to a chase. I respect my fellow man… and, uh… I w—and I… have some feelings for the man, as well. But, uh… yeah, in a nutshell… I have to come out of the closet. And so, one closet…
(God, please help me.)
… that I fe—that I am forced—forced to come out of…
Uh… simply put—and I am willing to say this… in sound mind and body: I… am a gaybian.
Yep. You heard me. I am… a gaaaaaaaaay… bian.
A male lesbian.
Thank you.

Transcript
Good evening.
You know, the, uh… word… "gay" and terms like… "coming out of the closet"… [inhales sharply] ughh… get th-thrown around a lot.
[pauses for several seconds, groans quietly, and shakes his head in disgust]
Anyway—uh… and als—and also, uh… some of us have to be—feel like we're being forced… to supposedly come out of the closet. And also, uh, some of—some of—so, sometimes, the, uh… actual words… like, uh, I myself—actual words that I have… used… become misinterpreted.
And, uh, it can be… very infuriating… when, uh… people misinterpret, uh… th-things into slanderous, uh, misunderstandings.
[inhales sharply] Mmm…
But yeah, I’ll, uh, get to a point here. I’ll get to the point.
[inhales sharply and groans] I have—so, like, I'm being forced to, uh… come out of… a closet, even though I already came out of one closet… emotionally, where I have learned… to, uh, put my emotions into a good… sound assortment of words… and, uh, ho—and honest input. And it—s—and s—and even though it really… pains me a lot… to… [long pause]
To say th—such th—to say some things…
Anyway, the—uh… anyway, so… to get to the point…
Fine. I'm guhhh—I'm gaaay. I'm gay.
Pfff. I said it.
I said it. So, there.
I said it.
Yep. I'm gaaay-
[sigh] Okay. Yep. So… did I really come out of the closet there?
That just depends on y'all—how y'all understand it!
Peace.
