Chris's self-portrait, 2015.
2015 was the 7th year since Chris's discovery. Coming full circle with the unfortunate incident of his house burning down last year, Chris announced that the renovations on it were finished, and that he would be moving back in. As the year progressed, Chris would further start producing content for YouTube again at a much more frequent basis.
Most of the year was spent in the aftermath of 26 December 2014, the events of which caused Chris to return to the Internet's attention. Chris served five court dates until finally, on 15 October, he was given a $541 fine for court fees and a 180-day probation. While Chris did fulfill his probation without any other crimes occurring, this incident ultimately did not teach him a lesson (and indeed, it wouldn't be the last time Chris would end up in the pokey). Chris continued to spend the year complaining about Sonic's blue arms, and being bitter over his local GameStop banning him for the aforementioned incident; however, he did finally end his protests in October, after seeing that Sonic's arms would return to being tan in the following year's Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games title.
It was also the year where Chris' fashion sense plummeted to depths unseen by the trolls, making him more akin to a crazy old hag than the woman he wants to be. In particular (and rather ironically), Chris dyed his hair blue in July.
The Lady Managers group of trolls began influencing Chris during this year.

Events of 2015
Chris narrowly avoided serving time in jail due to his recent incarceration. Most of this year is based on whether Chris would be jailed or not.
In Sonichu #10, Chris had predicted that by 2015, he would have finally found his sweetheart, Lovely Weather, whom he would be happily married to. This didn't actually happen.
This is also the year that Chris claimed his father would die, having heard it from the Grim Reaper in a prophetic dream.
This was also supposed to be the year of the Manchester High School 15th annual reunion which he had worked so hard on in 2013 until he found out his gal-pals had been hired help. It did not happen, and Chris has apparently stopped caring about it.
On 20 October 2015, Activision relaunched the Guitar Hero series with Guitar Hero Live.
