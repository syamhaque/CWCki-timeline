Because Discord has become the main platform for online dicussion, the CWCki has a Discord server.
If you're an editor here, send a message to a CWCki Jerkop when you join so you can get a cool role and access to some sooper sekrit channels.

Does Chris ever come here?
NO.
Chris was banned from this server on 14 August 2020, after joining on 10 August. This server's purpose is to observe and discuss Chris, not to provide a platform for him to promote his fantasies regarding the Dimensional Merge. His joining resulted in a substantial influx of weens and trolls to the server who were attempting to interact with him. This server is not a method to contact Chris. We do not have any contact with Chris or anyone associated with him. For these reasons, Chris is banned from the Official CWCki Server, and this is a position we have no intention of reversing.
Joining on Apple devices
If you are on Mac or iOS, you will not be able to opt in to viewing age-restricted content on the Discord mobile app. In order to do so, you will need to follow these instructions.
If you do not have access to a desktop PC to make this change to your account you can login to Discord in your web browser to do so.
Rules
You can read more on the server but in short:
Don't be a ween. Use common sense and don't use the server as a platform for weening. You will be banned. Also, follow Discord Terms of Service and Community Guidelines
No Minors. No exceptions.
Don't spam links to other Discord servers.
NSFW content an imagery must be blurred with spoilers. No porn, no gore, no illegal content, no viruses, no hate content.
Do not thirstpost about Chris. This has led to bad things in the past. Don't be weirdly sexual to other members of the server. No Roleplay.
Don't be a jerk. No drama. Don't be a pedofork.
Don't dox yourself or others. Keep your personal information to yourself. Do not turn on your webcam.

Contact Staff
ModMail
You can submit a request to the CWCki server staff by sending a DM to the ModMail bot. It will have you select which server you are sending the mod mail to, and then the staff will receive your message.
CWCki Jerkops
Direct message a CWCki Jerkop when they are online: @Hurtful Truth Level, @Larry the Larryhog. Please provide a username and an alt email for account creation.
The username and alt email are recommended to be ones that are not shared with any other online identity you may possess, in order to minimize the risk of being doxed. Once your account is created, you will receive the @Editor role. There is also a need for Scribes, Grammarians, and Archivists.
