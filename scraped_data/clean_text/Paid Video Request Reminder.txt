================================================================================

This is a video Chris uploaded on 26 July 2016. Notably, it is from an alternate account he revived for evading his two-week ban from uploading videos to his CwcvilleGuardian account.
On 6 August, he reuploaded it to the CwcvilleGuardian account, signifying that the ban was lifted.
In the video, he gives his prices for requests and the guidelines, saying that Barb will not appear. He also has no idea how much people should pay for a one minute video of him doing nothing special on camera.
Chris's angry tone when mentioning that he will not record his mother is likely due to a troll requesting a video of him making out with her.
