“
There's an old saying in Tennessee — I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee — that says, fool me once, shame on — shame on you. Fool me — You can't get fooled again.
”
George W. Bush
“
HE UPLOADED the pics I SENT to him onto the ED page. It was NOT MY FAULT, because he FOOLED ME ONCE, Shame on HIM.

George W. Bush (born 6 July 1946) served as the 43rd President of the United States from 2001 to 2009. He also appears to be one of the few men on Earth Chris respects. Though Bush was President at the time Chris wrote that list, it is unclear if Chris means that he likes Bush personally, or just whoever happens to hold of the office at any given time. Bush's likeness was invoked multiple times by Chris during his Presidency.
In 2009, he was succeeded by Barack Obama.

Role in the PVCC Crisis of 2004
“
I got SUSPENDED FROM PVCC by the Board, and I have that Meddling XXXXX to thank for this as well. I am SUPER ANGRY! >8( My Dad is blood-thirsty for revenge as well. He’s going to write to US PRESIDENT, George W. Bush Jr., and Laura Bush, to help me get allowed back to PVCC. WE ALL CURSE DEATH upon that XXXXX, Mary Lee Walsh!
”
Christian's blog, September 16, 2004
Surprisingly, President Bush did not intervene on behalf of the Chandlers.
The ramifications of this inaction are sure to be debated by Presidential historians for centuries to come.
Superfluous use of "Jr."
Like many other English mistakes he has made, Chris consistently calls him George W. Bush Jr. The Jr. is not needed, because the lone middle initial distinguishes him from his father George H. W. Bush. This may just be a cultural thing, however, as Chris's half-brother Cole Smithey also calls him George Bush Jr.[2]
ED edit
In an ED edit, Chris invoked President Bush in order to fight the slanderous trolls at ED.
Dahlings, by order of of President George Bush Junior, there shall be no naughty, grotesque posts of this dahling US citizen.
Any new posts, or deletion of this official message shall be found punishable to the fullest extent of American Law.
From the Secreterial Desk of the White House,
The President, George Bush
Obviously, this had the complete opposite effect of what he had intended.

Appearance in Sonichu #8
Despite Bush's refusal to help the Chandlers in 2004, Chris would honor him in 2008 by featuring him in the final issue of Sonichu produced before he left office. In it, Bush is seen tipping over a ladder being used by his eventual successor Barack Obama as he attempts to paint the White House black.
Life and Times of Jesus Christ
Bush in the play.
During the Jail Saga, Chris wrote a play while behind bars. Scenes from the play were sold by OfficialCWCmart under the title The Life and Times of Jesus Christ.
George Bush makes a cameo in the play, appearing watching a DVD of it during his second presidential term from 2005, with Bush laughing at a line of dialog.
