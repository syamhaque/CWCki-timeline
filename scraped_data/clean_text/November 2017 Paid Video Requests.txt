Singing The Dream I Dreamed
Chris sings "I Dreamed a Dream", performed by Ruthie Henshall in Les Misérables, as requested by a fan. Notable is the claw of fail and Chris sounding like a dying cat while trying to sound like a woman. He also changes the line, "There was a time when men were kind" to, "There was a time when women were kind," but kept in the lines about being in love with a man.
Note that Chris leaves in the background synth music he normally plays during his vlogs, even when playing another song.
The video he sings to can be found here (NOTE: this may not be the actual version he sings to, but its quite close)

Hello everybody, this here is a song for a
Sonichu fan- one of two. First one, 'I Dreamed a Dream" from Les Miserahb.
[Music Starts - note: He still has not learned to do karaoke versions and uses Ruthie Henshall's version, and the Playstation streaming music is present throughout]
There was a time when women were kind
When their voices were soft
And their words inviting
There was a time when love was blind
And the world was a song
And the song was exciting
There was a time
Then it all went wrong
I dreamed a dream in time gone by
When hope was high and life worth living
I dreamed, that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving
Then I was young and unafraid
When dreams were made and used and wasted
There was no ransom to be paid
No song unsung, no wine untasted
But tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hope apart
As they turn your dream to shame
He slept a summer by my side
He filled my days with endless wonder
He took my childhood in his stride
But he was gone when autumn came
And still I dream he'll come to me
That we will live the years together
But there are dreams that cannot be
And there are storms we cannot weather
I had a dream my life would be
So different from this hell I'm living
So different now from what it seemed
Now life has killed the dream
I dreamed
Singing Sorry (Not Sorry)
Singing Sorry (Not Sorry) is the second of two new music videos by Chris for two Sonichu fans. Once again, Chris's wailing sounds like a dying cat rather than an amazing female singer. He also puts very little effort into singing the song, changing the lyrics and mumbling a lot of the verses, and again leaves in his background synth music while singing and playing another song.

[Playstation streaming music is present throughout]
Hello everybody! This here is the second song for the second Sonichu fan. From Demi Lovato, "Sorry! Not Sorry". [singing like an old lady]
Now I'm out here looking like revenge
Feelin' like a ten, the best I ever been
And yeah, I know how bad it must hurt
To see me like this, but it gets worse
Now you're out here looking like regret
Ain't too proud to beg, second chance you'll never get
And yeah, I know how bad it must hurt to see me like this
But it gets worse
Now payback is a bad bitch
And baby, I'm the baddest
[unintelligible] a savage
Can't have this, can't have this
And it'd be nice of me to take it easy on ya, but nah
Baby, I'm sorry
I'm not sorry
I'm not

Baby, I'm not sorry
Baby, I'm sorry
I'm not sorry
Feeling [unintelligible] 'cause the tables have turned
Yeah, I'm on fire and I know that it burns
Baby, fineness is the way to kill
Tell me how it feel, bet it's such a bitter pill
And I know you thought you had bigger, better things
Bet right now this stings
'Cause the grass is greener under me
Bright as technicolor, I can tell that you can see
And yeah, I know how bad it must hurt to see me like this
But it gets much worse
Payback is a bad bitch
And baby, I'm the baddest
You fuckin' with a savage
Can't have this, can't have this
And it'd be nice of me to take it easy on you, but nah
Baby, I'm sorry

Feeling inspired 'cause the tables have turned
Baby, I'm on fire and I know that it burns

Better walk, better walk that walk, baby
