================================================================================

"I Gotta Make My Move" is the fourth song from Christian and the Hedgehog Boys COMEBACK!. It is Chris's version of the Rod Stewart song "Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?".
Chris's cover is about taking a boyfriend-free girl to his "apartment" for hanky-panky. He also encourages sexual harassment of women in the chorus by saying if you "need" a woman, feel free to touch her without her permission.

Lyrics
[sung over Rod Stewart's "Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?"]
Shoulda...shoulda...ooooh-oh... [This part is not sung by Chris.]
She sits alone
Waiting for suggestions
I'm so nervous
Not knowing what the hay to say there
My mind is blank
Hers filling with good ideas
Don't you just know exactly what we're thinking
If you want her body
And you think she's sexy
Come on, dumb boy, let her know
If you really need her
Just reach out and touch her
Come on, dumb boy, tell her so
Tell her so, man!
I'm acting shy
Looking for an answer
Come on dumb boy go spend your night together
Now hold on a minute
Before we go much further
I beg for a dime so I can phone my mother
We catch a cab to my high-rise apartment
At least I can tell her exactly what apartment
If you want her body
and you think she's sexy
Come on, dumb boy, let her know
If you really need her
Just reach out and touch her
Come on, dumb boy, tell her so
My heart's beating like a drum
'Cause at last I got my girl home!
At last you made it and y'all are alone
Alone!
We wake at dawn
'Cause all the birds are singing
Two true lovers forgetting what we're thinking
Outside it's cold, misty and it's raining
We have each other
We are not complaining
I said "I'm sorry but I'm out of milk and coffee."
"Never mind sugar, we can watch an early movie."
If you want her body
And you think she's sexy
Come on, dumb boy, let her know
If you really need her
Just reach out and touch her
Come on, dumb boy, tell her so!
Hey, man!
If you need her
Just reach out and touch her
Come on, dumb boy, let her know
If you really, really, really, really, really need her
Let her know
Just let her know
Just reach out and touch her
Come on, dumb boy, let her know
If you really need her
Just reach out and touch her
Come on, dumb boy, let her know
If you really - If you really need her
Just come on and tell her so
Just reach out and touch her
