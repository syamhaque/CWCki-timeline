Nintendo employee reveals details of Chris's Nintendo transactions is a CWCki Forums thread created by Null on 12 January 2015.[1] In it, he posted a message allegedly from a
Nintendo employee leaking the status of Chris's game account. As the post shows, Chris's irresponsible spending habits from the PlayStation Network quickly carried over to the Wii, Wii U and 3DS; among the titles Chris purchased for the platforms, the post states he purchased nearly all of the Virtual Console titles for 3DS, a whole bunch of shovelware, numerous redundant titles (including two sets of the same three Pikmin videos, one 3D and one 2D), and - most interestingly - both Sonic Boom titles for the 3DS and Wii U, despite his intense hatred of the franchise.
The following day, Chris made a Facebook response to the post, claiming that the Sonic Boom games were a gift from Catherine and that he only registered the 3DS game for Club Nintendo points.
Posting
The below comes from a Nintendo of America employee.
Consoles registered:
Nintendo 3DS x2
Nintendo DS
Nintendo DSi
Nintendo DSi XL x2
Wii
Wii U
Currently has 585 interactions in his account, this could be many things, but each one is a purchase in some way. Full game, virtual console title, DLC, in-game purchase, etc. This has occurred over a span of 4.5 years. So roughly 150 payments a year. This is by far the most I've ever seen, and was a big flag determining that this was actually Chris.
I'm fairly certain this can only be downloaded at the stadium, but he downloaded a 3DS app in 2013 that is exclusive for use in Safeco Field in Seattle. This occurred on 12/11/2013 at 7pm. It is likely that he took a trip? The app is "Nintendo Fan Network at Safeco Field"
His 3DS is eligible for the Ambassador Program, meaning he bought it at or close to launch in 2011.
Notible recent purchases:
Pokemon Omega Ruby
Pokemon Alpha Sapphire
Sonic Boom (Wii U, Physical)
Sonic Boom (3DS, digital)
Hyrule Warriors
Smash Bros (Wii U)
Smash Bros (3DS)
Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker
Skylanders Trap Team
Almost every recent high profile VC release (Bionic Commando: Elite Forces, Duck Hunt, Super Mario Bros. Deluxe, Pokemon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire, Harvest Moon 3, many, many more)
Pikmin Short Movies (3D)
Pikmin Short Movies (HD) (This means he bought the same 3 movies on both systems for convenience sake, huge waste of money)
Ultimate NES Remix (He also owns NES Remix 1 and 2 for the Wii U, I thought it was weird that he'd buy this one too)
Multiple Nintendo 3DS themes
SOME Notable strange/shovelware games for Chris to buy:
Tekken 3D
Wii Fit U
Family Tennis 3D
3D Solitaire
Every single Anonymous Notes game
Faceez! Monsters
Every single "Learning with the PooYoos"
Many Airport Mania titles
Outdoor's Unleashed: Africa 3D
Tokyo Crash Mobs
Sweet Memories: Blackjack
Pong Toss Pro - Frat Party Games
Rock Zombie
Arrow Time U
Xtreme Sports
The Letter (EXTREME SHOVELWARE)
Plain video Poker
Poker Dice Solitaire Future
Crazy construction
Vegas Stakes
BearShark
Naruto: Powerful Shippuden
Air Battle Hockey 3D
Gardenscapes
Family Party: 30 Great Games Obstacle
3D MahJong
Little Inferno
3D Game collection
Every single Wii U Panorama View video. That's $2 each for cheap camera videos you watch on your Wii U
If I wrote all of these out I would literally be here for hours. Most of his non-virtual console purchases are just complete shovelware garbage that he paid for.
He honestly owns almost every single Virtual Console release for the Nintendo 3DS, as well as most of them for the Wii U. I have yet to find a single 3DS one that he does not own, from the ones at launch to every single one that comes out recently. This includes the 3D classics. That's an ABSURD amount of money.
He bought every single mini game in Rusty's Real Deal Baseball.
He purchases many virtual Console games many times over, including Wario's Woods, Soloman's Key, and Dr. Mario.
He plays almost every single game demo available on the eShop. This includes games that Chris clearly has no interest in, such as FIFA 13 and Jay Z's NBA 13.
Not unexpected, he owns every Sonic the Hedgehog game available on the 3DS and Wii U. As well as the DLC for Lost Worlds.
There was a series of House M.D. games he purchased. I think they're point and click? But I find it strange that he purchased House games. They're called "Episode 1: Globetrotting" and "Episode 2: The Blue Meanie". I thought that was weird.
That's pretty much all there is to report though. He owns almost every first party game on the 3DS and Wii U, including stuff like Style Savvy. Overall it's easy to tell that he's spent thousands and thousands of dollars on this over the last 4.5 years. He's the biggest account I've seen in the course of the months that I've been here.
Chris's response
The following day, Chris discovered the post and made a response to it on Facebook.
This is in response to the post below this one about the so-called list of my purchased Nintendo software. Direct to the point: I have sincerely NEVER purchased either Sonic Boom game. The 3DS game, however, was actually Hand Given to me as a Gift from my ex-girlfriend, Catherine's Cousin, Al, after out bowling outing in Early December, 2014; Last Month.
I have registered the 3DS card through my Club Nintendo account, and explicitly told them in the survey that game Was Gifted to me; I Had Not Purchased it, period.
And I Had shortly after received a copy of the Wii U Game In the Mail. I had disposed of the envelope, because there was no return address. I Would have registered that as well, but there as NO Club Nintendo code enclosed. I have Never booted or played either game, and I certainly never have inserted either card or disc into any of my handhelds or consoles at all ever. And to spare having it quoted in the comments below this point, or in any future comments and posts in this group or on my page: Being Gifted the thing you are protesting against against your initial will, regardless of acceptance out of being polite or whatever, it does NOT Change my position or aynthing integral of the Protest that I Have personally started and still am working towards the cause, period.
SEGA!!! CHANGE SONIC'S ARM COLOUR BACK IMMEDIATELY!!! YOUR BLUE ARMS HAVE HURT NOT ONLY ME IN A NUMBER OF GREAT WAYS, BUT COUNTLESS OTHER PEOPLE (GREATER THAN A THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS) AS WELL!!! YOU WILL PAY FOR YOUR LACK OF RECALL AND CORRECTIONS!!!
Chris ignores the fact that the post lists the Wii U Sonic Boom game as being a physical item, and that the 3DS game was apparently a digital download and not a physical copy like he claimed.
