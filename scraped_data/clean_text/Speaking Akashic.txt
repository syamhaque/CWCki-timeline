“
Everything is up for interpretation, and only those who are authentically psychic, spiritual vastly connected and metaphysical can translate it so. And once it is spoken, it is erased from the speaker's conscious memory, like an obscure dream's details.
Not many neurotypical individuals can get it.

Chris, shortly after posting the video.
Speaking Akashic is a video uploaded to Chris's YouTube channel on 24 September 2025. It consists entirely of Chris babbling in incomprehensible spiritual nonsense (for a change). According to Chris, this gibberish is actually the "Akashic" language, a supposed lost language that he started to believe he could speak when he went to jail. The speech could be described as a form of glossolalia.

Description
This was me feeling fatigued, but I was really connected and spoke verbally in the moment. Any authentic, vastly connected and powerful psychic, spiritual, metaphysical individual can translate or understand it.
Transcript
[Chris is sitting in his room. His green screen is enabled and is set to an image of the Royal Albert Hall. Chris stares into the camera and begins to talk, slurring his words in an exaggerated manner.]
Okay, to anybody that gets this... At this moment, I have been without caffeine the entire day and my brain is very... very much connected with the cosmos and everything. You look into my eye, into my pupil. As you can see, they're small. And essentially, [Chris speaks in gibberish for about 108 seconds before briefly making a loud humming noise, then uttering one last gibberish remark before ending the video.]
Analysis
In this video, Chris believes he is speaking an otherwordly language, which he calls "Akashic". Chris has earlier claimed to have access to the Akashic records, a compendium of all past and future events believed to exist by theosophists. "Akashic" (the Sanskrit word for "aether", "sky", or "atmosphere") does not denote a language within Theosophy, but Chris seems to believe some sort of otherworldly Akashic language exists regardless.
In reality, Chris is speaking a form of glossolalia. In scientific terms, this is really just activating the region of your brain used for speaking, pacing and organizing speech without activating the ones relating to language, and essentially letting your speech rhythms operate by themselves. When glossolalia speakers discover their ability to do this, they may think that it's an alien or otherwordly language because it feels like language when you're speaking it. However, it does not actually contain meaningful information.
