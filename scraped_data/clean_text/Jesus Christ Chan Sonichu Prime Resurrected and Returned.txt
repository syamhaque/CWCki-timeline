================================================================================

Jesus Christ Chan Sonichu Prime Resurrected and Returned is a video uploaded to Chris's YouTube channel on 16 October 2023. It is notable for being Chris's first upload for more than two years, and the first of the Second Coming. In the video's description, Chris links to Praetor's online shop OfficialCWCmart, indicating he is still in business with the group. It is likely that Praetor influenced this video, seen in the green screen and editing seen in previous Praetor projects.
The video is about 9 minutes long and consists of Chris singing two parodies of songs from the Pokémon 2.B.A. Master album in front of a green screen; the first is a spoof of "Double Trouble" loaded with slurred, almost nonsensical lyrics, while the second is a parody of "Viridian City" that's now centered around going to CWCville. Interspersed are brief messages to his viewers in what seems to be an incredibly loose talk show/podcast format. Clips of Chris dancing are overlaid on top of the video throughout. Overall, unlike his previous attempts at making music videos, the production quality is a lot higher, which suggests that other people could have been involved in the video's creation (though in the description, Chris insists that he edited the video himself.)
At the end of the video, Chris presents his hands to the audience and states that he has "the etchings of where I have been hung on that cross back in Nazareth many a millennia ago." No such marks of crucifixion are present. However, this shows that he believes the crucifixion of Jesus Christ took place in his birthplace of Nazareth, not Jerusalem as agreed upon by every Christian sect. This puts Chris' laziness on full display. Despite pretending to be Jesus for nearly two years and a Bible likely being one of the few items he was allowed to have in jail, he has still not bothered to read it.
Despite the improved production quality, the video somehow manages to land among the most baffling and incoherent content Chris has ever produced. Notably, comments were disabled when the video was first uploaded, as the video was marked "for kids" by either Youtube or Chris himself. This marking would be removed, and the comment section enabled, around midnight on 17 October, before comments were disabled again a few hours later.
It should be noted that the chorus, where Chris repeats that Team Rocket is stupid, is very similar to a part of the video Victory Rockout, in which Chris jumps up and down whilst singing about Team Rocket being stupid.

Description
Glory be to all who are Light Powered, Good, Righteous and Neutrals with ability to be Good.
There is only good remaining on this Earth in this Universe and Timeline as we survive and continue onward in Light Powered Glory.
The worst of toxic sinners are left behind and gone; now we redeem the remainder of the minority who remain.
All is and shall be good with the Ultimate Miracle and the Dimension Merge's completion.
Let your auras and chakras be aligned and healed.
This pair of reworded songs are appropriate with the fall of the toxic ones and the rise of the Light Powered and Good.
I have been taught to use more advanced programs for video editing and then some.

[poorly imitating Giovanni] This is the boss, and I'm sick of waiting. Get your crap together, and stop following those twerps.
[singing to the tune of "Double Trouble"]
Prepare for stupid, make it lucid

[Chris stops singing as the song ends]
Oh I [cut in the video]
Yea and merrily to everyone. Welcome to this. That song you just heard; that was-a dedicated to all the lingering and blocked toxic haters, s'fakers, and darkest sinners that came from the 1218 half of our Earth that has been bugging us for the longest of time. And why r'they still lingering? You're not supposed to be doin' that. Come on, get outta the picture already. You're long gone! [snaps]
Hm, but anyway yesss. T-the Ultimate Miracle Chaos Control, I ascend and make my return to the internet and all that is good and wellbeing.
I am divined and conneted to everything, and I know, and not know, at the same time. Between the consciousness, the subconsciousness, and the unconsciousness. I know all, I see all, I foreknow all. I've been there, done that, [snaps] everything.
So now, with that, we are still admist our dimension merge completion and a moment of futureassed as you shall learn shortly enough, with the events that happened back in late February 2006.
But for now, we are [clap] on the road on the road. [cut in the video]
[Singing again, now to the tune of "Viridian City"]
On the road, on the road, on the road
On the road, on the road, on the road .. on the road
On the road to the city of Cwcville
on the road, on the road
On the road to the city of Cwcville
then.. the city of Cwc..
We're on the road getting stronger
yah... stronger..
We left our home in Vir-gin-yah
uh huh, getting stronger
Well here's the plan, we're gunna head out around the world
[gasp for air]
Time to collect and save everyone
Gotta save em' all
We keep on tryin', ehh then we try some more
To get to the place that's worth fighting FOOO-OOR
I'm on the road, I'm on the road
To the city of Cwcville
Meet my friends along the way
On the road, to the city of Cwcville
I've got a badge and the power to ZAP IT UP
[edited demonic and slow] To the city of Cwcville
The city of Cwcville
Ya boo a beh, and built a team
And workin' out, fighting all power
That's inside
mm back
In a moment that is yours, and yours and mine
We're gunna run to keep and catch up
And we're the speedy partners, we win the race
We keep on tryin', and then we'll try some more
To get to the place that's worth fighting for!
I'm on the road, to the city of Cwcville
Meet my friends along the way
On the road to the city of Cwcville
I've got a badge and the power
I'm on the road to the city of Cwcville
meet my friends and ehhh...
City of Cwcville
On the road to the city of Cwcville
make friends on the way.. on the way!
[something crashes in the background]
On the road to the city of Cwcville
City of Cwcville
On the road to the city of Cwcville
ohh, City of Cwcville
On the road to the city of Cwcville
hmm-mm, City of Cwcville
On the road to the city of Cwcville
hmm, City of Cwcville
On the road to the city of Cwcville
huhuh City of Cwcville
On the road to the city of Cwcville
suh.. City of Cwcville
[The song finally ends]
Hahah, perfet. Perf- [cut off]
So yeah, I'm back. I'm proud, I'm more motivated, I've got the boundaries set. So, later haters, fakers, y'all gone. We're sticking with good, positivity, light power and [snaps] L-Righteousness. Keep on zappin' it up.
Y'all the good ones, the good light power and righteousness, you all continue to do excellent and very well. I know so, cuz I've got all these crosses on the palms of my hands. And the images- and the etchings of where I have been hung on that cross back in Nazareth many a millennia ago. [claps]
[uncomfortable stare]
See y'all later. [snaps]
