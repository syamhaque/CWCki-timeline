After finding out that Liquid Chris had a girlfriend, Solid Chris called her so he could "ease her into the truth" about her boyfriend's lies. Then he talks about eating cum off her tits.

Later, he tries to convince Kacey that he has multiple personalities, and his former personality was the weak and gullible one, but now he's switched over to the more "dynamic" one. Kacey basically laughs at him and tells him he's stupid, so he gives up on that idea and tries to pretend it never happened.
