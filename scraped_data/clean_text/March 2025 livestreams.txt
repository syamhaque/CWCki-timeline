Jesus Christ Chan - Sonic 2006 Speed Run is a livestream done by Chris on 14 March 2025, in which he plays through the 2006 Sonic the Hedgehog game, widely regarded as one of the worst Sonic games ever made. Chris teased this livestream about a week prior on 6 March,[1] and announced it would happen later the same day on 14 March.[2] Chris also mentioned that he thinks his "speed play" could take more than one stream to complete. About three hours before streaming, Chris published a YouTube video of himself reading Chaos Crystal Control Act 0 as a "precursor to the livestream that will be coming later."[3]
Chris mentions that "perhaps another time [he] could definitely do ... another Q&A session" via livestream, as long as he receives "genuine thoughts and questions" that are not "mean-spirited or MoistCr1TiKaL."
Good old-fashioned PS3 fun!

At some times I feel like I'm better off just doing individual videos, as opposed to livestreams...

I tried bouncing on it, that does not work!

Jesus Christ Chan - Sonic 2006 Speed Playthrough is a livestream done by Chris on 29 March 2025, in which he plays through the 2006 Sonic the Hedgehog game. Chris announced this livestream a day prior, mentioning how he aims to finally do the "second half" of Sonic's Story[4] (later adding that he will "maybe" complete it[5]). He also mentioned how he wants to be "a bit more fair in audience acknowledgment," meaning he has to "give the Superchat supporters more quick responses."
Chris is also using his dental situation from four months ago as an excuse to beg for donations.[6] At the end of the three hour stream, Chris promised to play more in a future stream, and said "a few videos" are "coming in the following weeks."
