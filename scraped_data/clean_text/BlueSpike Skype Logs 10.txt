Chat
[05:31:27] Christopher C.W.C.:
Are you there, Julie?
[05:32:21] Christopher C.W.C.:
I hope you were able to get some sleep.
[05:33:17] Christopher C.W.C.:
I just wanted to inform you that I've just created, and I am uploading a video, addressed to Sarah May. I pray she has not done anything extravagant, and is still alive and well.
[05:33:42] Christopher C.W.C.:
and I hope she sees this video.
[05:34:35] Christopher C.W.C.:
Also, I wanted to ask, were you a member of the Sonichu Girls Forum? If you are, please check on there for any new messages from Sarah May for me.
[05:35:04] Christopher C.W.C.:
I would do it myself, but I had asked her to delete my account after a troll hacked into it and defaced it.
[05:35:42] Christopher C.W.C.:
I had recreated my account on there, and submitted an application that I'm hoping Sarah also gets to read and approve.
[05:36:41] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'd feel just heart-broken if she commited suicide because of my mistake; it would be Ryan all over again. :_(
[05:36:48] Christopher C.W.C.: ;(
[05:37:06] Christopher C.W.C.:
I need to recover. I'll TTYL.
[05:37:16] Christopher C.W.C.:
Ickvenschwell, Julie-Kat.
[11:59:01] BlueSpike:
[11:59:11] BlueSpike:
[12:29:24] BlueSpike:
Hi, Chris.
[12:29:44] BlueSpike:
Let me know when you're at the computer.
[17:36:39] Christopher C.W.C.:
Zlkavszka, Julie.
[17:44:51] BlueSpike:
Hi, Chris.
[17:45:13] Christopher C.W.C.:
Hey, Julie.
[17:46:06] Christopher C.W.C.:
I've just read a reply I got from Cassie, Sarah May's spanish friend, she offered comforting words that made me feel a bit better. I replied with gratitude.
[17:46:19] Christopher C.W.C.:
how are you feeling?
[17:46:48] BlueSpike:
Awful.
[17:46:58] Christopher C.W.C.:
because of Sarah May?
[17:47:03] BlueSpike:
Yes.
[17:47:38] Christopher C.W.C.:
I understand, but you don't have to dwell on about it. have you tried to distract yourself with a movie or something?
[17:47:46] BlueSpike:
....
[17:48:14] BlueSpike:
No matter HOW many movies I see, I WILL NEVER forget my dead friend.
[17:48:15] BlueSpike:
EVER.
[17:49:40] Christopher C.W.C.:
I understand, and I feel the same way. The emotions will linger and come back now and then. But the best thing one can do in the similar situation is to try to not fret over it a lot and move on.
[17:50:02] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'm still feeling the shakes and emotions from her and Aunt Corina.
[17:51:16] Christopher C.W.C.:
but at least I am feeling capable of being able to move on, having known the opening details, and wait to see if it's gotten worse.
[17:52:43] BlueSpike:
Chris, she commited sucide.
[17:53:43] Christopher C.W.C.:
I understand that possiblity, and it would really hurt me if she did that because of me. It would be Ryan all over again.
[17:53:48] Christopher C.W.C.: :(
[17:54:15] BlueSpike:
Chris..
[17:54:20] BlueSpike:
She did it because of a promise you made..
[17:54:23] BlueSpike:
She was so happy about it.
[17:54:48] Christopher C.W.C.:
I know, and I feel terrible over it.
[17:56:27] Christopher C.W.C.:
But from what I've learned after past deaths I've felt close to, is that I should try to move on. I did care about Sarah May very much, and I will never forget her.
[17:56:36] Christopher C.W.C.:
did you see the video I uploaded?
[17:56:43] BlueSpike:
Yes...
[17:57:29] Christopher C.W.C.:
It pains me deeply to know that I am losing, or have lost, a good friend in that way.
[17:57:50] Christopher C.W.C.:
I've shed tears for her.
[17:58:04] BlueSpike:
I don't think you really did, Chris..
[17:58:09] BlueSpike:
Could we talk on the PSN, about it..?
[17:58:13] Christopher C.W.C.:
okay.
[17:58:26] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'll send you the invite.
[17:59:53] BlueSpike:
Give me few minutes.
[23:51:51] Christopher C.W.C.:
Zlkavszka, Julie.
[23:52:13] BlueSpike:
Hello.
[23:52:40] Christopher C.W.C.:
I have a bit of good news. Sarah May is still alive. she left me a message on Skype a few hours ago.
[23:53:02] BlueSpike:
That's good, what did she say?
[23:53:40] Christopher C.W.C.:
that's the bad part; she started with "..." at 8:27 PM, then two minutes later thought I was ignoring her, when I was not on my PC.
[23:53:57] BlueSpike:
Huh..
[23:54:14] Christopher C.W.C.:
I left her a message with an apology for missing her, and a plea for her to not do anything stupid. And I informed her of the video I uploaded.
[23:54:43] Christopher C.W.C.:
She's not online right now, but at least we can breath a sigh of relief, because she's alive.
[23:55:11] BlueSpike:
Yeah.
[23:55:57] BlueSpike:
So..Chris..
[23:56:02] Christopher C.W.C.:
Did you enjoy listening to my father earlier?
[23:56:07] BlueSpike:
Yeah.
[23:56:08] BlueSpike: :)
[23:56:13] Christopher C.W.C.:
cool. :)
[23:56:18] BlueSpike:
Chris..
[23:56:21] Christopher C.W.C.:
yes?
[23:56:24] BlueSpike:
Did you ever make that video of you..you know?
[23:56:36] Christopher C.W.C.:
not yet, and I am thinking about doing it tonight.
[23:56:59] BlueSpike:
Cool.
[23:57:22] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'll record it in a couple of hours or so, but I promise you I will have it done, just for you.
[23:57:34] BlueSpike: :)
[23:57:36] BlueSpike:
So, what's up?
[23:58:25] Christopher C.W.C.:
not much else. but I did tell you about what I was doing while you were listening to my dad.
[23:58:42] BlueSpike:
No, what were you doing?
[23:59:34] Christopher C.W.C.:
I told you in a message on the PSN.
[23:59:44] BlueSpike:
Oh, yeah.
[23:59:45] BlueSpike:
That.
[23:59:47] BlueSpike:
Neat.
09-02-19
[00:00:12] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'm good in technological things, you know.
[00:00:26] Christopher C.W.C.:
did I mention that I took a computer upgrade course at PVCC?
[00:00:30] BlueSpike:
You never mentioned.
[00:00:31] BlueSpike:
Huh.
[00:00:37] Christopher C.W.C.:
I did, and I passed.
[00:00:54] BlueSpike:
Cool.
[00:01:04] Christopher C.W.C.:
Needless to say I have a good understanding of what is inside my PC's Tower.
[00:01:15] BlueSpike:
Cool.
[00:01:34] Christopher C.W.C.:
and to figure out how to upgrade my PS3's internal HDD to a greater memory capacity was a snap.
[00:01:43] BlueSpike:
Awesome.
[00:02:31] Christopher C.W.C.:
Also, in my lifetime, I have unscrewed and taken apart some of my video game consoles, to see what they looked like on the inside, including my original Game Boy, GBA and my PSP.
[00:02:49] Christopher C.W.C.:
and a NES among the Televised consoles.
[00:02:51] BlueSpike:
Cool.
[00:05:19] Christopher C.W.C.:
Yes, it's fun to take things apart to see the insides. Also, I sucessfully Upgraded my PS2 Guitar with the insides of a newer PS2 guitar. I started with the one that came with GH1, then I learned the RED guitars that later came out were better and upgraded in comparison, so I unscrewed and swapped some of the internal parts, as well as the newer cord, since they were both the Sony Wired Gibson SGs, and I was successful in the upgrade.
[00:05:37] BlueSpike:
Cool.
[00:05:47] Christopher C.W.C.:
I got the newer guitar used, then I returned it after I did the internal swapping.
[00:06:09] Christopher C.W.C.:
it's not easy to repaint a new guitar to make it match the memories that went into the old, you know.
[00:06:22] BlueSpike:
I do.
[00:06:39] Christopher C.W.C.:
so, the Casing has been with me throughout my GH years.
[00:07:16] BlueSpike:
Cool.
[00:07:17] Christopher C.W.C.:
Also, when Gamestop was having a Tournament for GH2, I entered and WON the whole thing. I got a T-Shirt, while everyone else got posters.
[00:07:28] Christopher C.W.C.:
It happened a couple years ago in February.
[00:07:47] Christopher C.W.C.:
NAILED Freebird on Hard better than my opponent in the Final.
[00:08:28] BlueSpike:
Awesome.
[00:08:54] Christopher C.W.C.:
I mean, I did not get a perfect score, but I got an "A" Grade.
[00:09:02] Christopher C.W.C.:
95-100?
[00:09:06] Christopher C.W.C.: *%
[00:09:11] BlueSpike:
Awesome.
[00:09:13] BlueSpike: :)
[00:09:37] Christopher C.W.C.:
and I look forward to playing some GH with you. :)
[00:10:15] Christopher C.W.C.:
You don't have to be the best at it; all I would ask is for you to do your best.
[00:10:23] Christopher C.W.C.: *your personal best.
[00:10:33] BlueSpike:
I am good at it.
[00:10:35] BlueSpike:
I played Expert.
[00:10:38] Christopher C.W.C.:
me2
[00:10:48] BlueSpike:
And I get mostly 90%-100%
[00:10:57] Christopher C.W.C.:
I've also completed the Expert in GHAerosmith
[00:11:08] Christopher C.W.C.:
as well as the rest, with mostly A Grades.
[00:11:14] BlueSpike:
Cool.
[00:11:42] Christopher C.W.C.:
oh, right, they measure in Stars; that's the grade format I was trying to think of.
[00:11:53] Christopher C.W.C.:
but I went with the letter anyway.
[00:12:27] Christopher C.W.C.:
Play any good games lately on your PS3 or Wii?
[00:12:40] Christopher C.W.C.:
oh, yeah, Burnout.
[00:12:42] Christopher C.W.C.: :P
[00:12:45] BlueSpike:
Yeah..
[00:12:50] BlueSpike:
I haven't really played much of Burnout.
[00:12:57] Christopher C.W.C.:
ah.
[00:13:02] Christopher C.W.C.:
I see.
[00:13:08] BlueSpike:
I've been wanting Street Fighter 4 so badly..
[00:13:32] Christopher C.W.C.:
As soon as possible, I plan on buying the Special Edition version for PS3.
[00:13:46] BlueSpike:
Cool..
[00:14:00] Christopher C.W.C.:
as well as MGS4 and the other titles we've agreed on adding to my quarry.
[00:14:10] Christopher C.W.C.:
how many disc games do you own?
[00:14:19] BlueSpike:
In total? Or just PS3?
[00:14:23] Christopher C.W.C.:
PS3
[00:14:27] BlueSpike:
2.
[00:14:36] Christopher C.W.C.:
I have over 25
[00:14:51] BlueSpike:
Cool.
[00:15:08] Christopher C.W.C.:
You'd probably gasp when you see my shelves in my room.
[00:15:26] Christopher C.W.C.:
up close
[00:15:44] BlueSpike:
Heheh.
[00:15:46] BlueSpike:
Yeah.
[00:16:04] Christopher C.W.C.:
my first game system was a Commodore 64 computer.
[00:16:16] BlueSpike:
Hmm.
[00:16:27] Christopher C.W.C.:
I still have the system, complete with Hard Drive Keyboard, cords, and Floppy Disk Drive
[00:16:50] BlueSpike:
Awesome.
[00:17:09] Christopher C.W.C.:
but my Joystick I used on it got messed up sometime ago, as it didn't work for me last time I turned on the sytem a few months ago.
[00:17:18] BlueSpike: :(
[00:17:40] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'm sure I can find a working joystick on eBay, but that's for another day.
[00:17:50] BlueSpike:
Yeah.
[00:18:28] Christopher C.W.C.:
we have to exchange stories of our childhoods after you get here.
[00:18:36] BlueSpike:
Yeah.
[00:18:54] Christopher C.W.C.:
you would get a cornucopia from my slideshow in my DVD.
[00:19:35] Christopher C.W.C.:
and I look forward to hearing your stories very much. :)
[00:19:43] BlueSpike:
Yeah...
[00:19:50] BlueSpike: :(
[00:19:52] Christopher C.W.C.:
?
[00:19:58] BlueSpike:
Nothing, sorry.
[00:20:13] Christopher C.W.C.:
what's the matter? did a bad memory reappear?
[00:20:23] BlueSpike:
No..
[00:20:36] Christopher C.W.C.:
it's okay, you can confide in me.
[00:20:42] BlueSpike:
It's nothing.
[00:21:19] Christopher C.W.C.:
hey, no childhood is perfect. and you know I've had a bunch of bad bumps in my lifetime.
[00:21:32] BlueSpike:
Yeah..
[00:21:33] BlueSpike: :(
[00:21:55] Christopher C.W.C.:
"Don't trust them new n*ggers over there."
[00:22:18] Christopher C.W.C.: :)
[00:22:54] BlueSpike: :)
[00:22:58] Christopher C.W.C.:
I left out the second letter, just like what happened to Stan's Dad in that episode of South Park.
[00:23:08] BlueSpike:
Yeah..
[00:23:09] BlueSpike: :)
[00:23:36] Christopher C.W.C.:
"With Apologies to Jessie Jackson" was that episode's title.
[00:24:09] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'm reminded of another Funny episode of South Park; "Breast Cancer Episode Ever"
[00:24:15] BlueSpike:
Yeah.
[00:24:30] Christopher C.W.C.:
I could not believe what Eric did to himself in front of Wendy.
[00:24:33] Christopher C.W.C.: :D
[00:24:39] BlueSpike:
Yeah. :D
[00:25:16] Christopher C.W.C.:
Still, it was a great episode that showed off Girl Power.
[00:25:31] BlueSpike: :)
[00:25:44] BlueSpike:
Could you sing that Uncle Ruckus song for me, one more time, please?
[00:25:45] BlueSpike: :)
[00:25:51] Christopher C.W.C.:
hang on.
[00:25:51] BlueSpike:
It'll cheer me right up.
[00:26:23] BlueSpike:
Yes.
[00:26:56] BlueSpike: :D
[00:26:58] BlueSpike:
Thank you.
[00:27:21] BlueSpike: :)
[00:27:35] BlueSpike:
So..It's been a few days..
[00:27:38] BlueSpike: :D
[00:27:52] BlueSpike:
A few days since we skype called just you and me.
[00:27:56] BlueSpike:
That's all. :(
[00:28:00] BlueSpike:
Not cybering, silly.
[00:28:04] BlueSpike: :D
[00:28:05] BlueSpike:
It's okay.
[00:28:16] BlueSpike: :)
[00:28:45] BlueSpike:
?
[00:28:50] BlueSpike:
Okay.
[00:28:53] BlueSpike:
We can type, I gues.
[00:29:09] Christopher C.W.C.:
I still keep on Lovin' You.
[00:29:55] BlueSpike: :)
[00:29:59] Christopher C.W.C.:
They're playing Barry White "I Can't Get Enough of Your Lovin' Baby."
[00:30:03] Christopher C.W.C.:
on the radio
[00:30:15] BlueSpike: :D
[00:30:42] Christopher C.W.C.:
have you heard that one?
[00:31:17] BlueSpike:
No. :(
[00:31:32] Christopher C.W.C.:
Hang on for a bit.
[00:38:12] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'm gonna hook you up with the track, after I spend 43 Coke points to get it for you. :)
[00:41:17] Christopher C.W.C.:

[00:42:33] Christopher C.W.C.:
You enjoy that; it can be our song. :)

[00:46:10] Christopher C.W.C.:
Here's another choice track for you.
[00:46:28] Christopher C.W.C.:
I had this one on my PC.
[00:46:38] BlueSpike: :)
[00:47:58] Christopher C.W.C.:
You can copy these tracks to your PS3 and enjoy them on there as well.
[00:48:42] Christopher C.W.C.:
are you enjoying Barry's song?
[00:48:49] BlueSpike:
Yes.:)
[00:49:26] Christopher C.W.C.:
another topic of the Nick and Nora movie was Mix CDs and good music tracks.
[00:50:23] BlueSpike:
Cool.
[00:51:23] Christopher C.W.C.:
and the iPod was featured there. BTW, did you see the joke in the new Family Guy; Carter asks Bill Gates to help him with his (Microsoft) Zune, but he actually has the MORE POPULAR iPod.
[00:51:40] Christopher C.W.C.: *(Apple) iPod
[00:51:50] Christopher C.W.C.:
I use my PSP for music on the go.
[00:52:00] Christopher C.W.C.: *(Sony) PSP
[00:52:04] Christopher C.W.C.: :)
[00:53:32] Christopher C.W.C.:
before my PSP, I used a Game Boy Advance Jukebox.
[00:53:56] Christopher C.W.C.:
and I got that accessory for only 10 dollars while it was on clearance back then.
[00:55:02] Christopher C.W.C.:
but I digress on the techo savvey.
[00:55:32] BlueSpike:
Yeah..
[00:55:59] Christopher C.W.C.:
did my going-on bother you?
[00:56:17] BlueSpike:
No. :)
[00:56:20] Christopher C.W.C.:
okay.
[00:56:21] Christopher C.W.C.: :)
[00:57:04] Christopher C.W.C.:
we can share music everyday together, and even create our own.
[00:57:11] BlueSpike: :)
[00:58:34] Christopher C.W.C.:
sent file "Christian & the Hedgehog Boys.zip" to members of this chat<files alt=""><file size="26569539" index="0">Christian & the Hedgehog Boys.zip</file></files>
[00:58:41] Christopher C.W.C.:
these are my tracks.
[00:58:59] Christopher C.W.C.:
all 8 of them.
[00:59:27] BlueSpike:
Cool.
[01:01:18] Christopher C.W.C.:
Did you get your Wii Number for me yet, so I can add you onto my WiiNetwork?
[01:01:26] BlueSpike:
No, not yet.
[01:01:33] BlueSpike:
I'm feeling kind of tired, I'll get it tomorrow.
[01:03:22] Christopher C.W.C.:
okay. Here's mine, 8626-5211-8387-4771. You can go ahead and add me onto your Wii.
[01:03:29] BlueSpike:
Okay.
[01:03:33] BlueSpike:
I will soon.
[01:04:10] Christopher C.W.C.:
because apparently we both have to have registered our opposite numbers onto our Wiis in order to exchange messages and gift from the Shopping Channel.
[01:04:24] Christopher C.W.C.:
and, be sure your country setting is set to USA
[01:04:27] BlueSpike:
Yeah.
[01:04:51] Christopher C.W.C.:
and you've been on the Shopping Channel yourself, yes?
[01:05:26] Christopher C.W.C.:
oh, and you have to set up in the Shopping Channel options to Receive Gifts.
[01:05:35] BlueSpike:
Okay.
[01:06:00] Christopher C.W.C.:
I had to go through these details when I gifted Tetris Party to Sarah May.
[01:06:12] BlueSpike:
Ah.
[01:06:23] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'll gift it to you as well after I get your number.
[01:06:29] BlueSpike:
Okay.
[01:06:42] Christopher C.W.C.:
I enjoy Puzzle Games, and Tetris is a favorite classic.
[01:07:17] Christopher C.W.C.:
logging in a lot of Tetris Time pays off for when arranging things on-the-spot.
[01:07:32] BlueSpike:
Yeah.
[01:07:56] Christopher C.W.C.:
there was an episode of the Simpsons where Homer had that practice and arranged the Garage Sale stuff he and his family bought in the car. but he left himself out. :D
[01:08:12] BlueSpike:
Heh.
[01:08:24] Christopher C.W.C.:
D'oh!
[01:08:34] Christopher C.W.C.:
:)
[01:09:39] Christopher C.W.C.:
I should let you go, so you can get some rest for your work tomorrow.
A piece of advice I offer to most everyone I talk to, "Keep a Happy Thought".
[01:09:54] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'll talk to you again later.
[01:10:04] BlueSpike:
Okay. :)
[01:10:11] Christopher C.W.C.:
Ickvenschwel, Julie-Kat. :-*
[01:11:06] Christopher C.W.C.:
oh, and a piece of advice, write your Wii Number on the back of your Operations Manual; makes it easier to find in the future.
[01:11:27] Christopher C.W.C.:
(L)(L)(L)
[01:11:37] BlueSpike: :)
[18:57:22] Christopher C.W.C.:
Zlkavszka, Julie.
[18:57:40] BlueSpike:
Hi.
[18:58:35] BlueSpike:
Did you finish that video for me? :)
[18:58:40] Christopher C.W.C.:
I've had a bit of a day; I went out with my family earlier this afternoon on their errands, and I went with my mother before then to escort her to our local doctor to give some blood for blood work.
[18:58:47] Christopher C.W.C.:
yes I did.
[18:59:01] Christopher C.W.C.:
I've just reformatted it for you, and it's ready to be sent.
[18:59:40] Christopher C.W.C.:
it is explicit, so keep it ONLY for your Eyes; don't let your bro see it.
[18:59:47] Christopher C.W.C.:
or anyone else for that matter.
[18:59:47] BlueSpike:
You got it.
[18:59:50] Christopher C.W.C.:
cool.
[19:00:13] Christopher C.W.C.:
sent file "For Julies Eyes Only.MP4" to members of this chat<files alt=""><file size="90400128" index="0">For Julies Eyes Only.MP4</file></files>
[19:00:42] Christopher C.W.C.:
FYI, I wore a condom during the time; I ended breaking one and replacing it.
[19:00:49] BlueSpike:
An MP4..?
[19:00:54] BlueSpike:
Would that play on my computer?
[19:01:13] Christopher C.W.C.:
yes. it works on any iTunes Player, Windows Media Player, PS3 and PSP
[19:01:17] BlueSpike:
Oh, alrighty.
[19:02:10] Christopher C.W.C.:
anyway, the doll I was using was not a doll I'd choose right away, because the V-Hole and the A-Hole are linked together, so it's like my duck can go all the way through and stick out its A-Hole.
[19:02:37] Christopher C.W.C.:
I just thought I'd let you know about that.
[19:03:31] Christopher C.W.C.:
how was your day?
[19:03:39] BlueSpike:
It was good.
[19:04:07] Christopher C.W.C.:
anything different or exciting?
[19:04:54] BlueSpike:
Nope.
[19:05:07] BlueSpike:
How long is the video, anyway?
[19:05:20] Christopher C.W.C.:
it's about 7 to 8 minutes long.
[19:06:27] Christopher C.W.C.:
and I was feeling a bit nervous, because of the condom breaking and having to pause the recording now and then. but I perservered anyway. :)
[19:07:25] Christopher C.W.C.:
I just did basically my routine for doing it with a doll; when I do it with you for my very first time, I can promise you that it will be more varitiable thatn what is shown.
[19:07:30] Christopher C.W.C.:
*than
[19:08:46] Christopher C.W.C.:
Julie?
[19:09:21] Christopher C.W.C.:
what happened there?
[19:09:22] BlueSpike:
Hi.
[19:09:27] BlueSpike:
My router's power supply got DC'd.
[19:09:33] Christopher C.W.C.:
oh, okay.
[19:09:48] Christopher C.W.C.:
I've had that happen to me before too.
[19:10:16] Christopher C.W.C.:
BTW, did you look up your Wii Number yet?
[19:10:30] BlueSpike:
Ah, I forgot. :(
[19:10:44] Christopher C.W.C.:
you can do it now, while it's on your mind. :)
[19:10:57] BlueSpike:
I'll do it soon, don't worry.
[19:11:16] Christopher C.W.C.:
okay. I trust you know how to look it up?
[19:11:20] BlueSpike:
Yeah.
[19:11:23] Christopher C.W.C.:
cool.
[19:12:30] Christopher C.W.C.:
let me check my memory about you a bit; you're 5'5", B-Cup, slim body-type, brown eyes and hair.
[19:12:50] Christopher C.W.C.:
and your voice is locked into my Audio Memory very well. :)
[19:12:54] BlueSpike: :)
[19:13:15] Christopher C.W.C.:
how am I on remembering your physical features?
[19:13:20] BlueSpike:
Very good.
[19:13:49] Christopher C.W.C.:
cool. I've had a small bit of a problem remembering your favorite color; was it blue?
[19:13:56] BlueSpike:
Yes.
[19:14:07] Christopher C.W.C.:
cool. :)
[19:14:50] Christopher C.W.C.:
you know something, from what you've told me, you would look very sexy, IMHO. ;)
[19:15:22] BlueSpike: :)
[19:15:25] Christopher C.W.C.:
but I still have not got the pictures yet, and I am looking forward to seeing the sexy woman I'll be seeing.
[19:15:46] BlueSpike: :)
[19:15:56] Christopher C.W.C.:
oh, and your teeth are in very good shape; I remember that.
[19:17:08] Christopher C.W.C.:
I brush my teeth every day, so I'm cool too. FYI, I've had two Wisdom Teeth, and I had them removed. I still have them preserved in a jar with a dash of alcohol.
[19:17:39] Christopher C.W.C.:
You know why they call them Wisdom Teeth?
[19:17:47] BlueSpike:
No, why?
[19:18:18] Christopher C.W.C.:
Because they've been tucked away soo long back there under flesh, they've had a Longer time to think compared to the rest of the teeth. :D
[19:18:53] Christopher C.W.C.:
that's my little joke.
[19:19:01] BlueSpike: :D
[19:20:13] Christopher C.W.C.:
stop me if I'm corssing any lines, but how well or often were you able to brush your teeth in Molvania?
[19:20:27] BlueSpike:
You're crossing some lines, there. :(
[19:20:34] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'm sorry.
[19:20:46] Christopher C.W.C.:
I will not go further in that.
[19:21:16] Christopher C.W.C.:
Uncle Ruckus says, "Don't trust them new n*ggers over there!"
[19:21:18] Christopher C.W.C.: :D
[19:21:29] BlueSpike:
Heh.
[19:22:28] Christopher C.W.C.:
another fun thing I can do after I receive your Wii Number, I can send you 10-second audio messages from my WiiSpeak Channel, so you'll be able to dig my voice whenever you want.
[19:22:42] Christopher C.W.C.:
brb
[19:22:42] BlueSpike:
Cool.
[19:28:52] Christopher C.W.C.:
back
[19:31:52] Christopher C.W.C.:
Also, I've gave it some thought, after taking off my medal and please hear me out, I wear it, because I consider it my personal Lucky Charm, and it reminds me of my previous emotional traumas and good memories from my past since I created the original one.Christopher C.W.C.Also, suppose, god forbid, I get hit, and I've fallen into a case of amnesia. The medal would be on me, and it can start me on recovering my memory much faster. Ridiculous, yes, but it's better safe than sorry.
[19:32:17] BlueSpike:
Okay.
[19:33:11] Christopher C.W.C.:
For you, though, I can take it off me while we're together, or when we have sex; you only have to say the word, and I'll have it off of myself around you.
[19:33:25] BlueSpike:
Okay.
[19:33:43] Christopher C.W.C.:
I still care about you and respect your feelings. :)
[19:34:28] BlueSpike: :)
[19:35:26] Christopher C.W.C.:
did you watch the video yet, or are you going to watch it later?
[19:36:10] BlueSpike:
I'm watching it now.
[19:36:28] Christopher C.W.C.:
okay. turns you on?
[19:36:32] BlueSpike: :)
[19:36:35] Christopher C.W.C.:
cool.
[19:36:40] BlueSpike:
I could dye my hair pink if you wanted.
[19:37:07] Christopher C.W.C.:
give me a moment to imagine that.
[19:38:16] Christopher C.W.C.:
pink would look good, but do you personally want to dye your hair that color?
[19:38:23] BlueSpike:
Sure.
[19:38:25] BlueSpike: :)
[19:38:36] Christopher C.W.C.:
how about blue?
[19:39:21] BlueSpike:
Maybe..
[19:39:25] BlueSpike:
Do you like girls with Blue hair?
[19:40:19] Christopher C.W.C.:
yes I do; like Ami/Sailor Mercury.
[19:40:43] Christopher C.W.C.:
yes, blue would be better.
[19:40:57] BlueSpike: :)
[19:41:10] Christopher C.W.C.:
are you sure you're cool doing that to yourself?
[19:41:45] BlueSpike:
Yes. :)
[19:41:49] Christopher C.W.C.:
alright.
[19:42:04] Christopher C.W.C.:
BTW, what's your hairstyle; long, short, pigtails or what?
[19:42:12] BlueSpike:
You'll see. :)
[19:42:58] Christopher C.W.C.:
in your pics. :) I feel that long hair, about to the shoulders, looks good to me.
[19:43:13] Christopher C.W.C.:
but I'll wait and see your pics.
[19:43:19] BlueSpike: :)
[19:43:28] Christopher C.W.C.:
and I'll take you as you are anyway.
[19:43:44] Christopher C.W.C.: :)
[19:43:48] BlueSpike:
Maybe if you ever do this again, you could make put in a little bit more passion. ;)
[19:43:56] Christopher C.W.C.:
the video?
[19:44:02] BlueSpike:
Yeah.
[19:44:16] Christopher C.W.C.:
if I was doing it with you for real, like our first time. ;)
[19:44:23] Christopher C.W.C.:
yes
[19:44:24] BlueSpike: :)
[19:44:53] Christopher C.W.C.:
like I said, I felt nervous from the mishaps then.
[19:45:03] Christopher C.W.C.: *a bit nervous
[19:45:38] Christopher C.W.C.:
do you have the video tucked away in a folder on your PC?
[19:46:05] BlueSpike:
Yes, why?
[19:46:49] Christopher C.W.C.:
If your brother finds it and says anything about it to you, I can still send a vocal message on the WiiNetwork, telling him a few words in our romantic defense. ;)
[19:46:56] BlueSpike:
Okay. :)
[19:47:36] Christopher C.W.C.:
do you have more than WiiSports among your Wii Disc games?
[19:47:49] BlueSpike:
I have No More Heroes..and Brawl.
[19:47:59] Christopher C.W.C.:
Mario Kart?
[19:48:04] BlueSpike:
Yeah, Mario Kart.
[19:48:08] BlueSpike:
Slipped my mind, sorry.
[19:48:15] Christopher C.W.C.:
how about Animal Crossing?
[19:48:19] BlueSpike:
No. :(
[19:48:30] BlueSpike:
I'm not that much into Animal Crossing, I don't think.
[19:49:10] Christopher C.W.C.:
I see, well you can at least get a WiiSpeak, so you and I can talk on there as well, and you can send me 10-second audio messages too. :)
[19:50:08] Christopher C.W.C.:
With a WiiSpeak, you get a download ticket to download the WiiSpeak Channel, which is not among the immediate downloads on the Shopping Channel.
[19:50:39] Christopher C.W.C.:
it's currently available for 29.99 USD in most stores.
[19:50:51] Christopher C.W.C.:
if you can find one new for less, then cool.
[19:51:42] BlueSpike:
Yeah...
[19:51:55] Christopher C.W.C.:
but our talks on the PSN and Skype are cool; I'm just thinking of an alternative. You don't have to do it if you don't want to.
[19:52:27] BlueSpike:
Yeah..
[19:53:02] Christopher C.W.C.:
I once knew a man from Nantucket; he had on his head a darn bucket. :D
[19:54:02] Christopher C.W.C.:
I knew a nose from the Pocanose, but then he ran away to Snotsville. :D
[19:54:51] Christopher C.W.C.:
I will fufill all your wishes with my taco flavored kisses. Taco, Taco. :_
[19:54:54] Christopher C.W.C.: :)
[19:56:25] Christopher C.W.C.:
"Don't trust them new n*ggers over there. No, No don't dah, dah, dah-dah. No, don't trust them new n*ggers over there."
[19:56:36] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'll have to learn the lyrics from that episode of the Boondocks.
[19:56:53] Christopher C.W.C.:
so I can learn that part I don't know.
[19:57:03] BlueSpike: :)
[19:57:14] Christopher C.W.C.:
there's that smile.
[19:57:33] Christopher C.W.C.:
"Julie's Smile. Oh, won't you smile a while for me...Julie?"
[19:58:42] BlueSpike: :)
[19:59:57] Christopher C.W.C.:
"Oh, it's a wonderful day with Julie. Julie makes your heart so light. When the skies are grey and ordinary, Julie makes the sun shine bright. Oh, happiness is blooming around her. The daffodills are smiling at the dove. When Julie holds your hand, you feel so grand, your heart starts beating like a big brass band. BAM, BAM, BAM, BAM. It's a jolly holiday with Julie. No wonder that it's Julie that we love."
[20:00:58] Christopher C.W.C.:
I can go on with two-sylible name songs and put your name in them all to make you smile more. :)
[20:01:52] Christopher C.W.C.:
and I'll still mean them all from my heart. (L)
[20:02:10] BlueSpike: :)
[20:02:51] Christopher C.W.C.:
FYI, that last one was from "Mary Poppins"
[20:03:19] BlueSpike:
Cool.
[20:03:54] Christopher C.W.C.:
I should go and get something to eat, then draw some more for my comic book. I'll talk to you again later. :-*
[20:04:04] Christopher C.W.C.:
Ickvenschwel, Julie.
[20:04:24] BlueSpike:
Okay.
[20:05:00] Christopher C.W.C.:
can I get some love back before I leave?
[20:05:42] Christopher C.W.C.:
a kiss and an "I Love You too?"
[20:05:52] Christopher C.W.C.:
it's nice to be reminded now and again.
[20:06:01] BlueSpike:
:*
[20:06:03] BlueSpike:
I love you too.
[20:06:10] Christopher C.W.C.:
thank you. :-*
[20:06:18] BlueSpike:
I'm sorry, I keep forgetting to tell you..I always thought you already knew. :(
[20:06:21] BlueSpike:
:)
[20:06:21] BlueSpike:
But I love you.
[21:22:13] Christopher C.W.C.:
I always know that you do and will love me, it's just nice to hear it now and again to refresh the memory. :)
[21:22:50] Christopher C.W.C.:
Also, I've just purchased the new LBP Costume Pack and the Burnout Paradise Legend Car Pack (includes the Back to the Future Car and the Ecto-1).
[21:22:59] Christopher C.W.C.:
so, you may log in and download them for yourself.
[21:23:33] BlueSpike:
Oh, okay.
[21:23:36] BlueSpike:
I'll do that now. :)
[21:23:42] BlueSpike:
What was the password again?
[21:23:56] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'll send you the password in a PSN Message shortly.
[21:24:05] BlueSpike:
Gotcha. :)
[21:35:25] BlueSpike:
Thanks, Chris.
[21:35:43] BlueSpike:
Maybe later, possibly tonight, we can play around with the new cars.
[21:49:24] BlueSpike:
Maybe you could get that time saver pack so I could have all the cars you do.
[21:49:27] BlueSpike:
:)
