What's the Name, Christian Chandler, C H R I S C H A N was uploaded by Chris on 14 January 2010. He sings once again, performing his own variation of a "Mr. Plow Remix" that featured in a recent The Simpsons 20th anniversary special, about how he is Christian Chandler. He proves that he cannot play the Harmonica at all, making his statement in the mailbag yet another lie.
Similar to his Holding out for a Hero video, where he "plays" his gitar despite the fact that the original song features no guitar track, the original song he screeches over here features no harmonica. As a matter of fact, the parts he plays over is actually a guitar track this time.
Chris's obligation to produce daily comic updates on CWCipedia and his feud with Alec Benson Leary creep into the lyrics, as he vows to deliver a new page and boasts of its "hand drawn art" in a typical dig at Asperchu.

Transcript
Well, with indebted gratitude to Mr. Matt Groening and Mr. Moby, here's my version of that song with my name on it.
[Chris raps along with Moby's music video, changing the lyrics to make the song entirely about himself.]
Say, what's the name?
Christian Chandler
What's that name?

C-H-I-S-C-H-A-N!

You don't need to worry,
I'm drawing here
Drawing in color,
My pen and marker!
My papa was chicken,
And he named me Christian Chandler
Afternoon before the sunrise,
I have a new page before you,
Open your eyes
New plots are a big surprise
The hand drawn art is quality,
And that's no lie
What's the name?
It's Christian Chandler
[Chris briefly plays what he thinks is the melody on his harmonica, failing hard.]
One, two, three!
Say, what's the name?
Christian Chandler
What's that name?

[Chris resumes playing the harmonica.]
[Chris stops playing and is silent while Lisa Simpson, in Moby's video, appropriately says, "Promise to never do that again."]
Aw'right.
