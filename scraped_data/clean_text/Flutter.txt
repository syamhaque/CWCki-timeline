Note on Misinformation:
This article previously included information that was primarily speculative or incorrect. This has been fixed. For more information see here.
It has been found that the subject of this article has been a frequent subject of impersonation from trolls/weens. Bear this in mind, and be cautious of any accounts claiming to be them.
Ongoing
The things described in this article are still happening, or are still being looked into. As a result, it may be subject to frequent change, and the information provided may not be entirely reliable.
PROTIP:
Should you encounter Flutter in public (with or without Chris) do NOT harass her. Getting a discreet picture is fine if you're able to, but don't directly interact with her or Chris. Once you make yourself a part of Christory, there is no escaping from it.
NOTE:
It has not been confirmed that Flutter is dating Chris, or if she has a romantic relationship with him.

“
She's a friend of mine, and I refer to her only as Flutter, because she likes Fluttershy, okay? I met her in Lynchburg, she got in touch with me while I was in jail, and we managed to meet, we managed to bond and connect with each other as friends. And she is literally thirty years old, despite the way - despite her physicality.

Saga
Jail, Third Exile, Revelations
Flutter (born 1992 or 1993) is the nickname Chris gave to a female friend of his. Flutter reached out to Chris at some point during his time in Central Virginia Regional Jail. Sometime after Chris was released in March 2023, he met up with her in the city of Lynchburg, Virginia, and they began hanging out together.[1] Chris has referred to her simply as a friend, suggesting that their relationship is not romantic, although he does not explicitly deny having romantic feelings for her either. Chris also claims that she is thirty years old (as of 17 October 2023), despite her childlike appearance. The nickname "Flutter" comes from her fondness for the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic character Fluttershy.
After Chris's release from jail, he was frequently photographed by people who managed to spot him in public. In September 2023, he was spotted with Flutter for the first time. On the 17th, she was spotted allegedly making out with Chris at a CVS, causing many people to believe she was his girlfriend. Otaku King also claimed that the two of them were a couple. In Setting the Record straight - there never was any sex involving me in 2021, however, Chris simply refers to her as a friend. Some observers have speculated that Flutter may be Finnish or of Finnish descent, noting that Chris began studying Finnish intensively on Duolingo since October 2023 for no apparent reason.[2] This theory was bolstered by sightings of Chris and Flutter in Finland. A Reddit user who saw Flutter claims that she did not have an accent.[3] Another Redditor claims that she spoke in a fake anime girl voice.[4]
Flutter's identity and motives remain one of the more mysterious aspects of modern Christory. With both Chris and Flutter herself seemingly unwilling to divulge any information about her, as well as a lack of any known social media presence, most discussion regarding her has been purely speculative. This has allowed for the proliferation of numerous theories and rumors. Theories ranged from things such as Flutter being underage due to her youthful and diminutive appearance, being a recruit from Praetor meant to keep Chris in check, being an obscure Finnish lolcow mostly unknown to Chris's primarily North American follower base, to even the possibility of being impregnated by Chris. Time will tell as to whether or not any of these questions end up being answered, but for now, Chris seems content maintaining his silence on the matter.

Sightings
Main articles: Sightings (2023), Sightings (2024), and Sightings (2025)
Flutter is best known for having been spotted together with Chris in public many times following his release from jail, first in the United States and then (beginning in April 2024) in Finland as well. This is particularly notable given Chris's substantially decreased online prescence.
2023
On 4 September 2023, Chris was spotted talking with Flutter at a Coinstar machine at a Food Lion supermarket. This was the first time she was sighted, and earned her the nickname "Food Lion Lady."[5]
On 9 September 2023, a ween stalked Chris in his car. Reportedly, Flutter was in the car with Chris, and the ween remarked that she looked like a child.[6]
On 16 September 2023, she was spotted with Chris at Walmart. This was the first clear view of her face.[7]
On 17 September 2023, Chris was allegedly sighted hugging, touching, and kissing Flutter at a CVS.[8]
On the 20th, the sighter posted two incredibly blurry pictures of Chris hugging and kissing her. While Chris is easy to see, Flutter is incredibly hard to see. The sighter also made multiple comments about her.
[Chris] was all over that woman. Just kept touching her and had her hand on the back almost the whole time. She doesn’t look young.
She 100 percent looked uncomfortable.
She seemed uncomfortable and kept her head down mostly. I can’t say whether she was just uncomfortable or if she was low functioning.
Seemed like he was kind of leading the shopping trip. He also was very close to her at all times. Co-Worker asked if they needed help Chris made sure to step so that he was :between my Co-Worker and the girl.
She paid.
These comments have yet to be confirmed as fact.
On 19 September 2023, Chris supposedly walked into a game store with her.[9]
On 1 October 2023, Chris was spotted showing something on his device to her at River Ridge Mall. This was the clearest view of her face yet until another photoshoot on Valentine's Day of 2025.[10]
On 3 October 2023, Flutter was seen waiting in a car while Chris was shopping at Game Junkies.[11]
On 20 December 2023, around 7:30 PM, a video of her was taken at the Richmond International Airport. Her origin flight was from the Charlotte Douglas International Airport, but the starting destination is unknown.[12] Later that day, she was also spotted at a Sheetz in Henrico, VA, and afterwards driven away by Chris.[13]
On 21 December 2023, Flutter and Chris were spotted at Isabella's Italian Trattoria Restaurant in Lynchburg. Reddit user JacksonStarship speculated that Flutter paid for the meal, also noting that Chris "ate spaghetti like a toddler."
The user also reported that Chris hand-fed dessert to Flutter.
JacksonStarship stated that Flutter did not appear mentally handicapped, nor did she appear an exceptionally young age.
On several occasions she would keep Chris in check, stopping him from escalating situations.
They were last seen walking away together in the parking lot.[3]
2024
On 4 January 2024, Chris and Flutter were photographed at Ultimate Comics in Cary, North Carolina while picking up tickets for the Animate! Raleigh convention.[14]
They were seen in attendance together on 5 January 2024, with Flutter wearing a face mask. On 6 January 2024, Chris and Flutter were seen outside of the Animate! convention, reportedly having been kicked out.[15]
On 23 March 2024, Chris was spotted with Flutter at TJ Maxx in Lynchburg, VA, disproving rumors about her staying away from him due to the aftermath of Animate! Raleigh.[16]
Chris also had plans to go to BABSCon 2024 with her, but his two tickets were refunded due to the event staff being aware of his status on the internet. This is hinted at in his reply to BABSCon's email:[17]
I was looking for an enjoyable, peaceful weekend with my friend that would have been more than very good and beneficial. But no, you dare deny us this simple pleasure as Pegasisters of the Brony Community.
On 4 April 2024, Chris and Flutter were both spotted at the Arabia Shopping Centre in Helsinki, Finland.[18]
On 30 April 2024, Chris and Flutter were unwittingly recorded in the background of a YouTube video, holding hands while walking together at Linnanmäki in Helsinki, Finland.[19]
On 29 June 2024, Chris and Flutter were spotted at River Ridge Mall, where they ate at Chick-fil-A and went to see a movie.[20]
A few days later, on 5 July, they were seen together at a Walmart in Lynchburg.[21] A week later, they were again seen shopping in Walmart, and the Reddit user watching them claimed that Flutter was speaking in a fake anime girl voice and that Chris was telling her how to bag food properly.[4] A few days later on July 16, they were spotted on the road driving towards Charlottesville, with Flutter sitting in the backseat.[22]
On 13 August 2024, Chris and Flutter were spotted at River Ridge Mall and about a week later, they were spotted again, this time in Roanoke at Valley View Mall. The observers photographed them several times and even secretly recorded a video of them approaching and talking to Chris, with Flutter being behind Chris being silent and leaves without her face being shown on the video. However, two days later, one of the observers posted another photo of them from the same sighting, which marked the first time Flutter's face had been photographed since October 2023.
On 22 August 2024, Chris and Flutter were spotted and photographed at a Goodwill in Lynchburg.[23]
On 28 September 2024, Chris and Flutter were spotted walking in the in Helsinki, Finland.[24] The observer recorded a brief clip of them walking together.
On 17 December 2024, Chris and Flutter were seen at Redi in Kalasatama, Helsinki, Finland.[25]
2025
On 14 February 2025, Chris and Flutter were spotted browsing in a pet store.[26]
On 17 April 2025, Chris and Flutter were spotted eating at Arnold's in Helsinki, Finland.[27]
On 23 July 2025, Chris and Flutter were seen shopping at Rauma International Market in Rauma, Finland.[28] This is their first sighting in Finland outside of Helsinki—more than 250 km (155 mi.) away, in fact, leading some to hypothesize that Flutter lives in the area or has family there.
On 13 August 2025, Chris and Flutter were spotted shopping at a Walmart in Lynchburg. This sighting provided the highest-quality image of Flutter's face thus far.[29]
On 31 August 2025, Chris and presumably Flutter are spotted eating at the Red Lobster in Lynchburg.[30]
On 7 September 2025, Chris and Flutter are spotted at a Barnes and Noble in Roanoke, VA.[31]
Wariness
Since late December 2023, when Flutter returned to the spotlight, many people have joked about the inability of weens to take a good photo of her. This has also led to speculation that she was trying to stay out of the spotlight of said weens to avoid harassment, especially when observers noted her self-awareness at some events that she went to with Chris.
The first strong signals of this came to light on December 20, where she was noted by an observer to wear a face mask in public:
yes I was on her flight, I noticed her almost immediately but she wore a mask the whole time, It was subconscious so I didn't think much of it other than "huh she looks familiar," but while she was leaving the airport chris was waiting for her he embraced her and said her name out loud, I was on the phone and couldn't make out what he said.
When the said person approached them later, Chris was against him taking pictures of themselves. The same behavior repeated a day later:
As they walked out Chris commented to a passing family “a family night, that’s nice” or something like that, and Egg had to pull him through the door. I asked Chris for a photo as he was walking out and he got PISSED. But I still shook Chris’ hand. Wish I could’ve gotten better photos but it was kind of a formal dinner.
He has also stated Flutter didn't seem to be mentally handicapped and took on a near motherly role during the visit.
Egg didn’t say a word to me, I passed their table at 2 points. She wasn’t noticeably mentally handicapped and seemed to be keeping Chris in check to some degree
During Animate! Raleigh, Flutter was seen with all of her face covered up by a face mask, sunglasses and her hair. Observers also noted her obsessive self-awareness at the event.
I am legit annoyed that you people cannot be bothered to get one clear photo or video. How hard can it be?
Genuinely this has been more difficult than you’d imagine. Flutter appears to be quite vigilant and unwilling (obviously) to appear in anything, especially candids. With her proximity to Chris it is not surprising there is a lack of high def photos
i was legitimately right beside them on an escalator yesterday without realizing and genuinely she is so hard to see. she has such self awareness compared to chris it is insane
Chris's Silence
“
That remains absolutely with no comment!
”
Chris, after being asked about Flutter and his Finland visits[32]
When he first spoke about her shortly after returning to the Internet, Chris only shared her nickname and the fact that she had reached out to him while he was incarcerated, and that they had met up in Lynchburg following his release.
In a May 2025 call with a ween, Chris was asked directly about Flutter and proceeded to lie about everything possibly related to her, including denying that he ever went to Finland with her or was learning Finnish on Duolingo.
Instead he claimed Flutter lives in Philadelphia and is going to college there, but was both unwilling and unable to provide any details when pressed further.
He refused to give up her real name or even the first letter, even after being offered bribes of $50, $150 and purchases from his Etsy store, stating simply, "Her name shall not be revealed."[33]
