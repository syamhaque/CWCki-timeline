Idea Guy Manipulation Disclosure:
The views Chris expresses are extremely unlikely to be his own. This video was orchestrated behind the scenes by the Idea Guys putting ideas in his head or goading him to act out; not all of these interactions were released to the public.

Idea Guy Wise on this video.[1]
Freestyle Dance With Me, For Our World! is a video uploaded by Chris on 14 November 2017 at the behest of original Idea Guy Wise as part of his brainwashing of Chris. In it, Chris dances to the 1993 Serbian war propaganda song "God is a Serb and He Will Protect Us" or alternatively known as "Karadzic, Lead your Serbs"[note 1] also known in Internet circles as "REMOVE KEBAB" or "SERBIA STRONG."[2] Throughout, he wears a tinfoil hat and shouts phrases related to the Hyperdimension Neptunia video game franchise with religious fervor, under the impression he would gain a magical power boost from doing so. After making the video, he posted on Twitter, saying:
Haters are going to hate. What I did in the dance video, I Did for Our Home World and for You All! You will thank me later when I am able to take out Bullies with my powerful friends. As well as my family and my Sonichus and Rosechus! Make up! ❤️⚡️
Chris appears to be unaware of the song's origins as a nationalist propaganda song, as he describes it only as a "polka."

“
THE MAN will not take over your MIIINNNDDDSSS!
”
Ironically, the person who got Chris to make this video did exactly this.
Uh!
People of the world! Christine Chandler coming to you from live from home! And the world is in great need of your services as... well as my own. Most direly. So dance with me if you will, to this lovely little polka. And put on a tinfoil hat to show that... THE MAN will not take over your MIIINNNDDDSSS! A beret will also suffice-s well.[note 2]
[plays "God is a Serb" and dances awkwardly]
DANCE FREELY! IN YOUR OWN WAY!
[Clover and Snoopy start baying in the background as the final line before the first chorus begins]
Even the dogs are singing!
[dogs are heard trying to get into the room]
Moon walk! Do a twirl! Have fun!
[dogs bay again]
For the world! For Gamindustri! For all the other worlds and dimensions!
[dogs bay again after a bit]
[song ends]
Go with it. FOR OUR WORLD!

Notes
↑ Serbian: Bog je Srbin i on će nas čuvati or alternatively Karadžić, vodi svoje Srbe a Reference to Radovan Karadzic, a Serbian war criminal mentioned in the song's lyrics
↑ Probably a reference to the original music video, in which accordion player Novislav Đajić (known online as "Dat Face Soldier") prominently wears a beret.[2]
