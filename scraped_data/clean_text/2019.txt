================================================================================

2019 was the eleventh year since Chris's discovery, and the final year of the 2010s. The Financhu Crisis continued, with Chris's unpaid debts cases involving Second Round Sub and Midland Funding having wrapped up, owing $2,463.63 and $2,777.90 respectively. Renewed interest in Chris brought an intense year with thousands of new weens. One particular orbiter, an enabler named Jacob Sockness, would stand out from among the crowd as particularly noteworthy when he began manipulating Chris with his own delusions. Throughout the second half of the year, tensions would flare up as Sockness tried to pursue a romantic and sexual relationship with Chris before the latter, in a surprising display of awareness, shot him down. Nonetheless, thanks to Sockness and many others feeding into his fantasies, Chris's tenuous grip on reality further loosened.

Chris in January 2019
Chris started out the new year by pushing back the Dimensional Merge, after its estimated date of December 31st came to pass and showed no results. Eventually, members of TF2 Analysis started blocking Chris on Twitter after either being harassed by weens or finding out about Chris's reputation. Chris did not take this very well, and spent a week making various rants on Twitter and YouTube, as well as a four-page comic, before ending January by making his Twitter account private, starting the Soft Exile.

Chris in February 2019
After making another video begging the brony analysts to unblock him on Twitter, Chris made a new Twitter account at @CPU_CWCSonichu in an attempt to bypass the blocks. Then, after uploading a video where he plays with Legos while having a mental breakdown, he eventually moved all his Twitter activities to the new account. After that, nothing really happened for a week, until Chris turned 37 and did a Twitter Q&A.

Chris in March 2019
March got off to an amazing start when leaks of Sonic's design for the upcoming movie revealed several drastic changes from the original, one of them being the inclusion of blue arms. That very same day, Chris tweeted his displeasure, showing that his 2014 viewpoint was anything but changed. Chris received a Nintendo Switch from Sarah and Steve, and made a 7-minute unboxing video, where at one point he picks up an attached letter and holds it up to the camera before setting it aside – the letter explicitly saying not to discuss the matter online, raising the suspicion of observers that this may be a sign of a trolling scheme. A GameStop employee then uploaded an eyewitness video of Chris shopping for a Poké Ball Plus peripheral for his Switch. Copitz went ghost hunting with Chris in the now-abandoned DeJarnette Center for Human Development in Staunton, Virginia. Chris then uploaded Goodwill Offering and Kindest Wishes, where he paid respect to those abused at the DeJarnette Sanitarium by leaving a Sonichu drawing.
April

Chris in April 2019
Chris defied everyone's expectations when he uploaded Future message from Crystal W Chandler, where a mysterious masked man recites a poem about Reginald Chandler relaying a message from his sister on the state of the Dimensional Merge. Chris tweeted a link to a Kickstarter for a documentary made about him called Chris Chan VS. The Internet, which would allegedly feature appearances from individuals like Megan. It was met with very hostile reception on Kiwi Farms, and two days later, the documentary's Kickstarter was abruptly cancelled; the project, however, is not. A member of the subreddit r/ChrisChanSonichu posted a photo of seeing Chris at a Target, and said he was "muttering really loudly" to himself. Later, Chris tweeted how the Notre-Dame fire was caused by a Pokémon. Google approved Chris listing his house as Sonichu Headquarters. The reviews quickly started pouring in, with at least 130 in the first 24 hours. Chris then made a tweet begging for Sonichu Headquarters to be nominated "as a Poké Stop, maybe even a Gym". Chris finished the Therapeutic Docket program for his 2018 mall trespass case. April ended spectacularly when the first trailer for the Sonic the Hedgehog movie debuted on YouTube, setting the Internet on fire. On the day before that, however, an image of the movie's Dr. Eggman, played by Jim Carrey, was leaked. Chris responded to this in a very negative manner.

After the release of the Sonic movie trailer, Chris tweeted his discontent with it. Two days later, Jeff Fowler, the movie's director, tweeted that Sonic's design will be fixed before the final release. Chris then responded with a simple "Thank You for listening. 😊⚡️💙⚡️".
