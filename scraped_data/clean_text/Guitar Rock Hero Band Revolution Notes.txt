Captain's Log, Stardate: August 16th, 2009.
I don't wanna go on a rant here, but I feel like some truce needs to be made between Guitar Hero and Rock Band. Mmm... firstly, auburn nobel [?] yeah. Rock Band, one and two, so... Yeah, the track packs. You know, the d—d you know, y'all release, y'all at Harmonix [he pronounces this "Harmonis"] release now and then, you know, it's fine to some, as discs, in the game stores and toy stores and whatever, but yeah, you know what, you're losing money by packaging—by printing the codes on the back of the manuals as you do, anyway if you're gonna do that, then-if you're gonna do that then make sure that the store owners take out all the manuals in those things, otherwise, someone could just walk right on in to the game—to the Gamestop, pull out the manual, and just handwrite the—handwrite the code on the back and download the tracks for free. You'll be losing—you lose—you—uh, that's a, basic fail right there, to borrow a term from the trolls, you know? You—that's just a basic fail, you mean, walk right into it, I mean, especially, and that's another thing, you know, people could just walk—not only that, but people could just walk right in, buy the track pack, and then, uh, redeem the code, and then go return the game and get their money back. That's...—that's just a bad deal, right there.
So, what I'd suggest, is, in addition to releasing the new track packs on discs, DO NOT ADD A CODE TO REDEEM FOR DOWNLOADING THEM. Let them be for sale, for a smaller am—smaller fee, like, say half price, on the PlayStation Network, Xbox Live, or Wii Stores. Let the downloadable tracks be available for half price, versus the original MSRP value. And then, if the MSRP goes down, then decrease them in some stories, as well.
Yeah. Another thing, Guitar Hero: it originated on the PS2. I don't know WHY people are playing it on the Hex Box, especially since I hate the Hex Box, and the—it's like... Anyway, I... I mean, Wii's okay, but, I mean, you know... Anyway, if you really want to branch out, like you've been doing, amongst the other system—amongst the other consoles, you—you redig Guitar Hero 2 for Xbox, redo that, and other original Guitar Hero 1, and Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the Eighties, for Xbox and Wii. And, also, why not—and also, redo buh—all three, Guitar Heroes 1, 2, and 3, in a special edition version for PlayStation 3, since all the Guitar Hero history originated on PlayStation 2.
And—and, also, you know what I was thinking? Yeah... Rock Revolution. I mean, I know, it went downhill pretty quickly... Yeah, Konami, did okay, but, you know, just a drum kit? You should have made your own guitar to go with it, or, like, you know, said, "Hey, you know, go ahead and use Rock Band or Guitar Hero d—drums, but still we—our own drum kit." It's like, you know, yeah. It's like the review on the, the G4 channel, "Yeah, yeah, hey, look, Konami's finally trying to make a break out of the Dance Dance Revolution with music instruments, and the only instrument they could bring was a drum kit." Buuuuurip-tish! Like, heh? Songs already included in Rock Band and Guitar Hero. Try making a better drum that does not have six, it has five. One, two, three or four drum pads, and one—two cymbals, so that it could be compatible with both Rock Band, more—or—or, easily compatible and more capable of understanding for playing ther [sic] ability between Guitar Hero and Rock Band. You should do that if you're make a sequel for Rock Revolution, like, you know, Rock Revolution 2. Remake the drum kit, do guitars, make a microphone—if you want to add a Dance Dance touch to it, go ahead! Some people like to actually play—I don't know how they do it at the same time, but like, play guitar and... dance on the dance pad! Like those—in that episode of The Simpsons! That was a fun bit, heh. What's that comic book guy have business about?
Anyway... so anyway, uh, the music business... Yeah, just a re—recap. Yeah, go ahead and give the—uh, promotional codes should be included in all of your, uh, Rock Band track packs with an expiry date of December 31st, 2009, and then start offering all the track packs for half price on the PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Market and Wii Store... and uh, yeah, redo Guitar Heroes 1, 2, and 3 for PlayStation 3 and Wii, and redo Guitar Hero—...I'm sorry, Guitar Heroes 1, 2, and Encore for Playstation 3 and Wii, and redo Guitar Heroes 1 and Encore Xbox 360. If you really want to branch out, you gotta go put all the history between this—multiple consoles. I mean, originated for the PlayStation. Everybody knows that. So there.
And, uh, yeah, Konami? Give it another go, we—yeah, learn from your mistakes. Take advice from G4 review. No wonder you got a low grade, especially since I've played myself, you know, yeah... The horizant [sic] thing, mmm... Yeah, kind of sucky, compared to what we have in Rock Band, where it's like, everything's coming at you! Think about it, Konami, you could do it better on Rock Revolution 2, or outgrade [sic] Rock Revolution 1. Anytime.
Okay, that's my shpiel [sic] on the music business. I'm thinking about maybe doing a downloadable track review on Guitar Hero, but that's...—as may be, as a possibility, only for the YouTube. But I'm still drawing the Sonichu comics. As I am the original creator, I've given life to Sonichu, Rosechu and everybody, I'm keeping the responsibility. They will be on paper, officially, from my own...—from my own hands, and from my own authority, and my own si—signature, soon, I am working on it. [mumbles] ...Works. So there. I appreciate the continue support from all the good fans—and trolls, I know you haze me just to try and encourage me (?!?!?). Believe me, you don't need to be hazing me to encourage me; we can just be friends. I mean, stop mocking! I get it! I'M WORKING ON IT. So anyway, with that, stay safe, peace... Autobots, transform, and roll out.
Oh, and one more thing. The, uh, Harmonis people behind Rock Band... you really want people to keep those games discs? Then, yeah, take my advice: don't put the codes in there with the manuals, or encourage the store owners to take out the manuals all through the—all through the store shelf... displays, and, uh, give those codes an expirie [sic] date of, like, uh, December 31st, 2009, and start offering all the track packs as downloadable content, in addition to the game discs. I mean, no wonder you've got an economic downcline, [sic] especially since everybody's like, you know, "Just get the code, all for free, then I'm returning it! Or, playing it again." Bye.

And also, y'know, just one more thing, in observation....
Yeah, the multiple track pack diss, yeah, I'd say mainly do 'em just for... DLC (knocks on the gitar) for Rock Band and Rock Band 2. Because, like me, nobody wants to have to re-create their individual characters from scratch. And you know what? Yeah, take this tip: both Guitar Hero and Rock Band, ca—people: make an update between Rock Band, and all ge—all Rock Band and all Guitar Hero titles. It's like, where there is a previously saved data from any one of the games between Rock Band titles or Guitar Hero titles, all the... [makes a weird "fsh" sound] ...custom characters, the custom gitars, the custom tattoos, the custom band logos—everything—make 'em all usable in every other Rock Band/Guitar Hero title! [pause] Yeah, I would appreciate it. I mean, I wanna just have to try an' copy my... Chris-chan character, from scratch, between Guitar Hero 3 to [waves hand] no, I'm sorry... from Guitar Hero World Tour to Metallica, to Smash Hits, to even the ness one, 5, or Van Halen. I don't wanna have to do all that from scratch. Let's save the trouble, please! Make 'em a—make 'em all playable; make 'em exportable from old data to nay—de—noo data. Copyable.
...'kay, g'bye.
