Memes
With this video, Chris likely intended to vocalize his frustration and intimidate his trolls, but he accidentally started a new Twitter meme. Not long after the video was published, people began editing the video to change Chris's scream into something else. Among the edits that have been made include ones where he screams the PlayStation 2 startup theme, the Loud Nigra sound clip, and Luigi's cry for "YHEEEEEELP!" from the Super Mario World cartoon. The following is a fan compilation:
