PROTIP:
We once again advise you to never directly engage with Chris nor attempt to get him banned from the places he's been to, as doing so won't work well in your favor. On the off-chance that you cross paths with Chris, the most that you should do is get some kind of documentation of Chris, but never to directly engage with him.
Ongoing
The things described in this article are still happening, or are still being looked into. As a result, it may be subject to frequent change, and the information provided may not be entirely reliable.
Since his release from jail in 2023, sightings of Chris have occurred in 2025. The sightings are particularly notable, given Chris's decline in terms of having an active online presence.

February
Pet & Aquatic Warehouse
On 14 February 2025, Chris and Flutter were spotted browsing at Pet & Aquatic Warehouse in Lynchburg.[1][2][3][4]
Observers have also noted that Chris doesn't stick out as much in these photos, as his fashion sense has become more conventional and less feminine than it was before his trips to Finland. He is wearing a nondescript black hoodie and baggy jeans, and his blue hair seems to be fading to a natural grayish color. He is still wearing his custom-painted shoes, however.
March
Food Lion
On 17 March 2025, Chris was allegedly spotted and photographed at a Food Lion. The photo wasn't shared publicly until 29 March 2025, when someone sent it to Reddit user lolcow-docs.[5] However, due to the blurriness of the photo, it is unclear whether the person photographed is Chris.
Sent to me just today. 3/17/2025 ruckersville food lion.
April
Pasila, Helsinki, Finland
On 4 April 2025, Kiwi Farms user kotijopi made a post about allegedly seeing Chris in Finland a few days prior. He wrote:
Thought you spergs might want to know that I spotted Chris this wednesday in Helsinki, Pasila, in a small convience store, near the places where he has been spotted previously. He bought a bag of chips and a energy drink, nothing else special to mention. Wore thick black glasses but was definitely recognizable. To me it seems likely that he lives nearby.[6]
Arnold's, Helsinki, Finland
On 17 April 2025, a user on the Finnish imageboard Ylilauta posted a photo of Chris and Flutter.[7] The photo is of them eating at Arnold's, a coffee shop chain, which seems to be at Redi in Helsinki.
May
Walmart (May)
On 18 May 2025, Reddit user Ready_Supermarket_41 posted a picture of Chris at Walmart that was taken earlier in the day to r/ChrisChanSightings:
Got this from my friends coworker in old forest, said they had the medallion and all...[8]
July
Rauma International Market, Rauma, Finland
On 23 July 2025, Chris and Flutter were spotted at Rauma International Market in Rauma, Finland by Reddit user Villi_Vuohi:[9]
me and a group of friends saw chris-chan and "flutter" today in Rauma international market. Heard them speak and everything. Sorry i couldnt get the face in..
The next day, Villi_Vuohi gave additional details about the sighting in a conversation with an anonymous CWCki user:[10]
Hey, I was wondering if you heard what Chris and Flutter said when you saw them.
Hello! They were talking to a cashier at the booth, clumsily trying to speak finnish but then asked for english. I dont remember the exact words but the voice was distinctly familiar. I dont think flutter said a word. I can ask my friends i was with, if they heard.
Thanks for answering! I have a few more questions
1. Did you hear Flutter's name?
2. Have you or your friends spotted Chris before? Do you know if Chris or Flutter is a resident of the town?
3. Can I post your responses to these questions on the CWCki?
1. No, none of us heard her speak, or chris speak to her.
2. Nope this was totally out of the blue for all of us, we had heard they were in finland but in assumed Helsinki. They were here probably for the international market.
3. Sure :3
Assumed in helsinki*
August
Walmart (August)
A cropped still from the recording.
On 13 August 2025, Chris and Flutter were spotted and briefly recorded shopping at the Old Forest Walmart in Lynchburg, VA by Kiwi Farms user BlockedByDaylight.[11] The video that the user provided also results in the clearest image of Flutter's face to date.
I didn't know Chris Chan lived in my city until I saw him (her?) at my local Walmart today. Shocked the hell out of me. He had a lady with him but they were both very quiet.
Later that day, BlockedByDaylight commented:[12][13]
I live in Virginia, maybe 30 minutes from Roanoke. I asked my buddies about him, and apparently people see him around town all the time, so I know he's lived in my city for quite a while. I didn't hear them say anything interesting, they were just grocery shopping. Nothing out of the ordinary. I didn't want to bother them so I recorded quickly then went on with my day. But if I see him again I'll keep you all updated if things change!
I will say the only thing that really struck me as odd about them was that they kept looking around nervously, as if they were scared someone would recognize them or try to interact with them. You can even see in the video the lady kept glaring at me even though I had only been in their aisle for less than a minute.

Red Lobster
On 31 August 2025, Chris and a woman, presumably Flutter, were spotted eating out at the Red Lobster in Lynchburg by the mother of Twitter user lunarpatriot. The mother snapped a picture of Chris, and the photo was shared online by her son the following day:
not fucking around i got a photo of chris-chan at red lobster yesterday LOL[14]
The Twitter user also answered a few questions:
you took that?
it was my mom that actually took it but yes LOL[15]
Who was he with? 😮
my mom got a look of them but how she described them it didnt seem like flutter[16]
can you tell us exactly where the location was so we can add this to the wiki?
The one red lobster in Lynchburg, VA[17]
who was he eating with
someone who is suspiciously flutter-like but when i showed my mom a photo of flutter she said she didnt match up[18]
YouTuber and animator HotDiggedyDemon then asked a question on the post:
What did he order?[19]
holy shit hotdiggitydemon omg haii i loved pony.mov
also i will get back to you on that
Kiwi Farms user Zeus Blue Thunder messaged lunarpatriot asking him to elaborate on what he meant by "didn't seem like
Flutter"[20]:
i showed her a pic of flutter and she said that while the girl was short, her hair was a lighter blonde and it was cut in a short bob
The following day, lunarpatriot shared more alleged details of the sighting, claiming he had spoken to a friend who works at the restaurant:[21][22]
Peeping the threads and after talking to a friend who happened to be working that night there, I have some info for you that might interest you. The waiter serving them described Chris and Unknown Female #1 as very weird, and they didn't spend too much time socializing. The girl didn't speak much so he couldn't pick up on an accent. Notably Chris paid the entire bill, which from what i'm reading has never happened with him and Flutter before.
Chris did all of the ordering for her
No names?
I tried to see if she signed her name on the check, that's why I know Chris paid entirely
September
Valley View Mall
On 7 September 2025, Chris was spotted at Barnes and Noble at Valley View Mall in Roanoke, VA.[23] According to the eyewitness, "he was with flutter they were just separated at the time of the photo"[24]
DMV
On 8 September 2025, Chris was allegedly spotted by Reddit user u/Taxistheft98 at the DMV in Lynchburg, VA.[25]
Saw him at the Lynchburg DMV yesterday. Couldn’t grab a photo because of how busy it was.
Sheetz
On 25 September 2025, Chris was spotted at a Sheetz in Lynchburg[26] by Reddit user Striking-Ebb-8484:[27]
Ran into Chris today at sheetz
I asked for a picture, but was respectfully declined and given a fist bump instead
According to the user, Chris "still had the amulet and everything". This possibly marks the first time Chris has been seen wearing his new medallion in public.
November
Target
On 22 November 2025, Chris was spotted at the Target on Wards Road in Lynchburg, VA by Reddit user oosolto:[28]
