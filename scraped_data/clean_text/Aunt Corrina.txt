“
I'm also shedding a tear again for my Aunt Corina. I'm hoping her funeral is not on my birthday, because I'm planning on going to this Pancake Dinner that my church is holding on that day. a week ago, my pastor said I can come and they would celebrate my birthday as well. but if the funeral is on my birthday, then I hope I can return in time to make the Pancake Dinner.

Aunt Corrina (full name Corrina Weston Carey Inge;[1] 26 January 1934 – 21 February 2009[2]) was Barbara's older sister and one of Chris's favorite aunts. She was also the person from whom the Chandlers bought their dog Patti Chandler.
Corrina lived in Red Oak, Virginia, her and Barbara's hometown, and the Chandlers occasionally drove down to Red Oak to visit her and other Weston family members while she was alive.[3] Corrina was married twice, first to Edward Carey and later to Raymond Inge. She was the grandmother of Jonathan Carey by way of her first husband.

Death and legacy
Corrina died on 21 February 2009 and was buried on 24 February, thus ruining Chris's twenty-seventh birthday as a posthumous troll. The day she was buried was also the Christian holiday of Shrove Tuesday (a.k.a. "Fat Tuesday" or Mardi Gras), when some Christian churches including Chris's traditionally give pancake dinners. Unsurprisingly, Chris cared more about the fact that he missed out on stuffing his autistic face with pancakes than he did the funeral of his "beloved" aunt.
In the days leading up to Corrina's death Julie insisted that Chris visit her in the hospital, but Barb dissuaded him. He did get the chance to tell Corrina he loved her over the phone before she died.[4]
In the Father Call, Chris tries to convince Mr. Devoria that he has gone through some hardships in his life, bringing up his aunt's passing as an example.
In his phone call to Lars, Chris swore on her grave he would not spend any more money on the PlayStation 3. He predictably failed to keep his word.
According to Chris, after Corrina's death he and his mother became hated by the entire Weston family.[5]
Spelling of name
Further suggesting a lack of familial closeness, Chris consistently spells her name "Corina", but the spelling "Corrina" appears on her obituary,[1] her gravestone and a PeopleFinders notice.[6]
