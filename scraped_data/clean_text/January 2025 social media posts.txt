Thoughts on Artificial Intelligence
17 January
1:55 PM
Power to you, #saberspark.
I 101% agree that AI generated media is beyond subpart.
I feel and agree that human created art and content is far superior as they contain the love and soul as well as care and compassion into the media.

Not to mention how bad AI would take jobs from people.
AI is not to be constantly relied upon, because of likelihood of failure in programming.
And in media companies mistakenly firing artists and creative people for AI, you'd essentially get MLPG5 all over again and worse.
Not to mention recklessly encouraging next gen children and individuals to be really uncultured and brain-numbed; we need mentally and emotionally strong individuals inspired by authentic, high-quality, soul-filled stories and content with thought-provoking ideas and thought sets with light-powered
...encouragement and guidance.
Don't just be greedy and churning out low-quality crap; kids, teens and babies are meant to think and understand as much as possible; they are smarter than one may think.
As are we who are experienced and understanding of better quality in media and arts.
So, in a sense, "Make them better quality like they used to before 2019 as the humans do.
Not the new-fangled AI video generating garbage."

The same message was posted to Chris's Twitter account on the same minute.
Cherry-picking a Stoic philosopher
Chris posted the Marcus Aurelius quote due to him also drawing himself saying the quote to KingCobraJFS (a lolcow that has criticized Chris) in a commissioned drawing on the same day.
In this post, Chris cherry-picks a quote from Marcus Aurelius' Meditations, which advocates stoicism, being in control of your emotions, accepting one's limits and reality, honesty, coming to terms with death, clear-mindedness, and being a productive member of society. It's safe to say Chris has not read the book.

"Whenever you are about to find fault with someone, ask yourself the following question: What fault of mine most nearly resembles the one I am about to criticize?"
-Marcus Aurelius
Similarly, "Do not hate on others with things that you are, yourself."
-JCWCSP ⚡️💙⚡️

A bit of wisdom
25 January
12:25 PM
Here's a bit of wisdom for you all: Sometimes, even as teens and adults, we need to be reminded of how to do good for and with ourselves and others.
So, yes, it is good to have a favourite or new good quality affirming show playing in the background.
[Posts GIF of Vinyl Scratch and Derpy Hooves from My Little Pony.]
Also, in that, everyone is going to have at least one traumatic event in their childhood or past, which is best to give yourself and your inner child security and assurance.
Caring for yourself allows you to better care for others as well.
That's a reason behind "Me Time": to heal and process.

I'm watching this for the first time; it resonates with me.
I don't want to say more, because I'm keeping personal details offline nowadays.
But, thank you, #DrWolf and #LightningBliss for your continued good works and family/friend values in them.
Happy 2025. ⚡️💙⚡️

I express my gratitude for one person who sent me a kind letter and this card over the holiday.
I did not get many letters over the holiday in the mail.
But still, I am thankful for this one kind individual. ⚡️💙⚡️
