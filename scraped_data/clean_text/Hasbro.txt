NOBODY Cares for MLP G5; Resume Friendship is Magic Already, @Hasbro, Please! I Literally Foreknew and Foretold how Premature and Awful G5 was to be. #PsychicPowers #Avatar #JesusChristIsRightHere

Ranting at Hasbro's executives, in the form of a custom TSSSF card.
Hasbro is an American-based multinational toy and entertainment company. Its assets are valued in the billions and includes brands Dungeons and Dragons, My Little Pony, Power Rangers, and Transformers.
Chris has repeatedly attempted to influence Hasbro's leadership over the direction of the My Little Pony franchise, to the extent of warning them the world could be conquered by Akan[2] or be destroyed if his favorite animated series My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic is not extended another five seasons.[3] On a less dramatic front, Chris has also expressed a desire to work with Hasbro to sell his custom Transformers toys.
To date, Hasbro's decision-makers have yet to respond to Chris.

On Transformers
Chris in December 2024 pretending his Transformers knock-off characters are being sold alongside official Transformers.
Much like how Chris's character of Sonichu is a mash of two copyrighted characters, his Samurai Pizza Bots characters are explicitly a group of Transformers whose name is taken from the unrelated Samurai Pizza Cats series. Chris has customized some of his Transformers toys to resemble his Samurai Pizza Bots and suggested Hasbro could work with him in sales. As Chris's customization involves painting over official Transformers models, ripping off the box art design, and copying phrases from the franchise such as "Autobots", it is unlikely Hasbro would attempt to work with him.
In the April 2017 video Son-Chu Review, Chris advertised his custom Son-chu toy and said that it would be under the Sonichu brand until Hasbro is able to make a distribution agreement with him.
In 2024, Chris began pretending to have a set of licensed Transformers figures for sale at retail stores - the figures actually being his knock-off Samurai Pizza Bots and Decepti-Clones characters, customized from official Transformers sets. Chris dubbed those the Transformers Legacy United Merged toyline. In the 2024-2025 video series Light Powered Cwclight Reviews, Chris showed off the figures at his home. In December 2024, he pretended that the figures were being sold at retail stores such as Walmart and Target, by placing his custom toys on the shelf in place of actual products and taking photos to post on social media.[4] This was followed by a video published in June 2025 showing Chris walking up to a shelf at Target filled with his custom figures.[5]
On My Little Pony
My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic is a long-running animated series in the My Little Pony franchise, as its Generation 4. It ran from 2010-2019 and spawned a film and spin-off series, as well as the brony subculture of adult male fans. In mid-2018, Chris was distraught to find that the series would be ending amid rumors of how the My Little Pony franchise would be rebooted for Generation 5.
Over the next several years, Chris took to social media and YouTube in protest, often tagging Hasbro's Twitter accounts with increasingly frantic rants on why he felt the My Little Pony reboot should not happen.[6][7] After the reboot proceeded, Chris's rants morphed into claiming that G5 should not yet exist in his timeline and that G4 should be revived.[8][9]
YES to MLPFiMSeasons10to14 is a set of custom TSSSF cards Chris made to represent his protest of Hasbro, and he often posted images from the set in his social media rants at Hasbro.
Video messages
Chris has produced multiple unhinged videos directed at Hasbro.
On 13 August 2018, Chris published Hasbro! MLP G4 Must Continue; NO MLP G5!. In it, he commanded Hasbro to continue producing My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic and to cancel its plans to reboot the My Little Pony franchise into G5. Chris claimed to have consulted with characters from Friendship is Magic. However, Hasbro ignored Chris's demands.
On 27 July 2021, Chris published Direct Message to Hasbro: MLPG5 Is Cancelled. In it, he again issued the same demands, but in a much more aggressive manner, as the G5 reboot was impending. Chris claimed that if Hasbro did not obey, then the timeline would be put into chaos. Three days later, he was arrested for incest with his mother, putting a years-long hiatus to his video output.
On 18 March 2024, Chris published Telling It To All of You, and the Hasbro Executives and Staff. In it, he concocted conspiracy theories to try to link My Little Pony G5 to Russian propaganda. Notably, he suggested that the late Brian Goldner had been assassinated by Russians. Goldner was Hasbro's CEO and was therefore credited as executive producer for the MLP G5 movie A New Generation. Goldner died of cancer a month after the movie's premiere. Chris claimed he had communicated with Goldner's soul and that Goldner regretted green-lighting MLP G5.
