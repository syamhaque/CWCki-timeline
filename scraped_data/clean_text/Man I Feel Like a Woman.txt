Lyrics
[sung over Shania Twain's "Man! I Feel Like a Woman!"]
Let's go girls!
Come on.
I'm going out tonight
I'm feelin' alright
Gonna let it all hang out
Wanna make some noise
Really raise my voice
Yeah, I wanna scream and shout
No inhibitions
Make no conditions
Gah a little outta line
I ain't gonna act policically correct,
I only wanna have a good time!
The best thing about bein' a woman,
Is the prerogative to have a little fun!
Oh, oh, oh, go totally crazy!
Forget I'm a lady!
[leaves out "Man's] ... shirt, short skirts,
Oh, oh, oh, really go wild, yeah, doin' it in-in style
Oh, oh, oh, get in the action!
Feel the attraction!
Color my hair, do what I dare,
Oh, oh, oh, I wanna be as free, yeah, yeah yeah I feel,
Man! I feel like a woman!
The girls need a break
Tonight we're gonna take
The chance to get out on the town
We don't need romance
We only wanna dance
We're gonna let our hair hang down
The best thing about being a woman
Is the prerogative to have a little fun and,
Oh, oh, oh, go totally crazy!
Forget I'm a lady!
Tank shirts, short skirts
Oh, oh, oh, really go wild, yeah, doin' it sty-in style
Oh, oh, oh, get in the action, feel the attraction
Color my hair, do what I dare
Oh, oh, oh, I wanna be free, yeah, feel the way-ay I feel
Man! I feel like a woman!
Oh yeah, the best thing about being a woman
Is the prerogative to have a little fun! Fun!
Oh, oh, oh, go totally crazy!
Forget I'm a lady!
Tank shirts, short skirts
Oh, oh, oh, really go wild, yeah, doin' it in style
Oh, oh, oh, get in the action!
Feel the attraction!
Color my hair, do what I dare
Oh, oh, oh, I wanna be free, yeah, feel the way I feel
Man! I feel like a woman!
OH! Oh Oh! OH! Uh huh yeah!
I get totally crazy
Can you feel it?
Come, come, come on Jackie!
Oh! Oh!! OH!!
I feel like a woman!
