Chris at BronyCon 2017.
Chris has attended many conventions over the years. Prior to the 2010s, he had only ever been to two specific conventions; since then, he has regularly attended various conventions.
Chris generally has a blast attending conventions, as it lets him get out of his house and surround himself with people with similar interests, therefore making it easier for him to socialize with them. Chris has noted that he feels more accepted at conventions, although whether this was truly the case or simply an incorrect interpretation of what really went on can be debated (and in terms of conventions he's attended after the incest scandal, safely assumed to be the latter).

Conventions Chris has successfully attended
Chris at BrickFest 2001.
BrickFest
9-11 June 2000, 13-15 July 2001, 19-21 July 2002; Arlington, Virginia
An adult LEGO convention and the first convention that Chris ever attended. Not much is known about his exploits here, but we can assume he probably showed off his Lego creations. Chris attended the very first BrickFest as well as the next two. In October 2025, r/ChrisChanSonichu user studiopalas uploaded photos of Brickfest 2001, noting Chris to be among the people pictured.[1][2]

Anime Mid-Atlantic
Main article: Anime Mid-Atlantic
29 May 2004, 17-19 June 2005; Richmond, Virginia
The last convention Chris would attend for a decade. Here, he met voice actors and actresses such as Monica Rial, tried out Japanese foods, and hocked copies of Sonichu #0 while cosplaying as himself.
Madicon
9 March 2013; Harrisonburg, Virginia
A two-day "Science Fiction, Fantasy, Anime, and Gaming convention" held at James Madison University. Chris was invited to the convention by a gal-pal but expressed concern that Barb would not allow him to be away from the house for an entire day, let alone a weekend. Barb eventually relented and allowed Chris to go for just the first day of the convention. He came dressed as Tom Cruise's masked, hooded character from Eyes Wide Shut in order to keep a low profile and not be recognized for himself.[3] He described the experience in a few Facebook posts as "The best day I have had in a very long time".
OmegaCon
Main article: OmegaCon
29 August 2015, 28 August 2016; Charlottesville, Virginia
Chris went alone dressed up as the MLP character Vinyl Scratch and attended a cosplaying contest that he lost. He went back the next year and attended all three days from winning a free ticket from the last year. Chris also apparently tried marijuana here.
BronyCon
Main article: BronyCon
11 August 2017-4 August 2019; Baltimore, Maryland
Chris attended this My Little Pony-themed convention for its final three years.
MAGfest
Main article: MAGfest
6-7 January 2018; National Harbor, Maryland
Chris wanted to attend this convention in 2011, but budgeting issues led to failing to book a room. He came up with an ill-conceived backup plan to either sleep in the lobby or his car, which was vetoed by his parents out of safety concerns, and his mother threatened suicide over his stubbornness, pressuring him into cancelling.[4]
He later attended the 2018 convention after hearing that there would be a panel themed after him that year.
Gem, Mineral & Jewelry Show
22 September 2018; Fishersville, Virginia
In September 2018, Chris attended an annual show on gems, minerals and jewelry.[5] He can be seen in crowd shots on the event's website.
Unnamed stamp conventions
(Dates unknown)
In June 2021, Chris claimed on Twitter to have attended "a couple of stamp conventions and rock conventions", stating that "vibes were neutral, in general, between them."[6] These conventions probably took place in or around the Charlottesville area.
Festival of Light

10 May 2025; Lynchburg, Virginia
On 7 June 2025, Chris posted four pictures of his toys, the backgrounds of which revealed a booklet with a picture of Chris on the front.[7] Upon research, it was discovered that it was an "Aura Care Booklet", obtained from an "aura imaging photography" service provided by Avillion of Universal Insight.[8][9] The written date on the booklet, 10 May, matched up with timing of the Festival of Light, an event held at 1499 Coffee Road, Lynchburg, VA 24503 over 10-11 May 2025 during 10 AM through 5 PM, which provided the service. The booklet cost Chris $45, and provided him with "One full-color Aura Photograph of your Heart Chakra," a "Personal Chakra Report with 2 printed Full Body Pictures," and "An Aura Care Booklet with additional information on maintaining a strong and healthy Aura". There is seemingly an option to get a private "Angel-Guided Golden Light Ascension" reading session with the aura photograph for $90, but it is completely unknown whether or not Chris purchased it alongside his booklet. The admission fee for the event is unclear, with the prices for same event but held in November 2025 set to cost $8 per day or just $10 for a weekend pass, while a random Facebook user claimed the entry price for the May 2025 festival was $5 per day. It is unknown whether or not Chris attended the second day of the festival, which landed on Mother's Day.
Conventions Chris was kicked out of
TooManyGames
Main article: TooManyGames
22-23 June 2018, Oaks, Pennsylvania
The first convention Chris was booted from during attendance. Chris got too touchy-feely with guests and kissed many of them without their consent; because of this,
he was kicked out on the second day of the three-day convention. Chris reacted by melting down, curling in the fetal position, and crying on the floor for an extended period of time. It is not known if Chris was explicitly banned from coming back in later years, but he never made another effort to attend.
Animate! Raleigh
Main article: Animate! Raleigh
5-7 January 2024, Raleigh, North Carolina
A comic/cartoon convention Chris went to with Flutter. Likely in order to avoid a pre-emptive ban, he did not announce his intention of attending the convention on social media, and he bought his ticket in person the day before it began. On day 2 of the convention, a friend of a Redditor claimed to have witnessed Chris and Flutter being escorted out by staff after having been previously denied entry earlier that day.[10][11] The exact reasons for Chris being booted are currently unknown, but what is known is that he was ratted out by the staff and they took the snitch's word over his.[12]
Conventions that have pre-emptively banned Chris

Seaquestria Fest
13-15 May 2022, Ocean City, Maryland
Chris was included on a preemptive blacklist made before this MLP convention's slated 2020 launch, and he will probably remain permanently banned from any subsequent events. Chris mentioned wanting to go once in 2019. Due to COVID-19, it was not held in 2020 or 2021. Chris was nevertheless in jail when the 2022 launch took place.
Everfree Northwest
Main article: Everfree Northwest
13-15 August 2021, Bellevue, Washington
In June 2021, Null announced that Chris would attend Everfree Northwest, a Seattle-area My Little Pony convention held in August 2021. Originally, Chris had planned to take the over 40-hour drive to the convention, however, he was convinced by Null to simply take a flight to Washington instead, who would help with Chris's financial arrangements for the trip.[13] Later in July 2021, Null started a GoFundMe campaign in order to help raise the money for the trip, and Chris uploaded Help send Chris-Chan to Everfree NW to promote it, stating that donators to the campaign would receive shout out videos and artwork from Chris. Throughout July Chris would draw commissioned artwork and record videos for the donators.[14] However, following the Incest Call being leaked later that month, and Chris being arrested in a motel parking lot on 1 August 2021, Chris was silently banned from attending Everfree Northwest by having his ticket revoked by the convention.[15] Null later refunded all donors.[16]
BABSCon
Main article: BABSCon
29-31 March 2024, Burlingame, California
Chris first expressed interest in attending this San Francisco Bay Area My Little Pony convention in 2017 upon learning that volunteers were given free admission, but he lost interest after he realized that travel expenses would not be covered. He made a more serious attempt to raise money to attend the 2020 convention, but it was canceled that year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, he coped by playing make-believe that he had gone to the BABScon in dimension C-197. Chris's intention to attend the 2021 convention was frustrated when it too was canceled due to the ongoing pandemic. Chris's plan was to drive all the way from Virginia to California and back. BABScon eventually took place on April 2022, but Chris was incarcerated while the con took place. Before the 2024 convention took place, Chris was informed by the convention organizers that he had been blacklisted permanently,[17] obviously due to the societal stigma against literal motherfuckers like Chris.
Conventions Chris failed to attend for other reasons
Otakon
Baltimore, Maryland
In 2010, Chris planned for a time to visit the Otakon convention in Baltimore (in large part so he could meet Jackie there), but he managed to thwart himself by spending the money he'd set aside for the expedition. In an e-mail to Jackie, he claims that he overdrew his bank account shortly beforehand.[18] Chris's parents had initially been fine with him going on the trip, since Chris had a plan laid out. However, his failure to control his spending, along with Chris having been tricked by trolls into going on the Ohio trip the year before (leading his parents to
- correctly - assume he was being set up again), led them to reconsider, and they forbade Chris from the trip.[18]
Looking ahead
Even though Chris was granted deferred disposition for his incest charges, it is safe to assume that if convention organizers ever neglect to pre-emptively ban Chris from attending a convention, and he shows up unannounced like he did at Animate! Raleigh, he will be promptly booted as soon as his presence becomes known. This is provided, of course, that convention organizers view Chris as too much of a liability. Otherwise, Chris might luck out like he did with the Festival of Light.
