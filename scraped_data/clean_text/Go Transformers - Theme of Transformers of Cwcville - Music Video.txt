================================================================================

Go Transformers - Theme of Transformers of Cwcville - Music Video is a video uploaded to Chris's YouTube channel on 12 September 2025. It is a self-made music video set to a custom theme song Chris wrote for the CWCville version of the Transformers, which was then converted to a full-on song with the AI site Suno. The video heavily utilizes very rudimentary stop-motion, and is frequently broken up by brief, random skits.
This marks the very first time Chris made a comment in the comment section on his own video.[1]

Music by Suno
Transformers! Go Transformers!
More than meets the eye.
GO Transformers!
Robots in disguise.
Autobots and Guardians defending the Earth and everyone, amidst the Chaos and evil's wrath.
Fighting the evil forces of the Decepticons and Renegades, keeping them off their path.
The city of Cwcville is defended by the forces of good with the help of Chris Chan and the Sonichus and Rosechus.
Infinite electrical power tempts the evil, so they call on the power of Psychic and Magic with their might.
And when the evil is tall like a con, the Bots stand to defend and fight.
Go, Transformers! Go Transformers!
More than meets the eye.
Go, Transformers! Go, Transformers!
Mighty Robots, Mighty Vehicles and Beasts; they know how to fight from millennia in the least.
Brotherly Rivalries... Lost Loves... Survival on Energy... Cybertron and Primus... Strong with Aura!
Go, Transformers! Go, Transformers!

Good Transformers theme song
On 13 September, Chris replied to a commenter on the video:

Finally a good Transformers theme song, it's been ages!
Chris 12:27:41 AM
Well, Thank you very much. As a long time fan of the Cybertronians and even Gobotronians, I felt it was high time everyone was included. I did write the lyrics. I would have personally liked personal musicians to give the jams, but work with what we can afford and have within reach these days. ⚡️💙⚡
Jcc2224 10:36:42 AM
@CwcvilleGuardian
It sure was zappin' to the extreme! Figured you'd like to know that your Beast Wars Transmetals Tarantulas has been in my collection for some time now, and I hang the certificate of authenticity with pride! Thank you!
Chris 10:40:23 AM
Wait, really? I forgot I sold that when I sold some things off on eBay years ago. DM me on Twitter, please.
On 18 September, Chris replied to several more commenters on the video:
Transformers NOT manly
yeethaw5816 13 September 5:43:04 AM
That's a very male toy to be playing with as a woman 🤔 Tho I really appreciate the effort in this vid! Wish we got something like this with the sonichus The Wilhelm scream will haunt me
Chris 18 September 11:47:34 AM
Archer, Elita-1, Windblade, Solus Prime; not as manly as you think.
yeethaw5816 18 September 12:12:26 PM
@CwcvilleGuardian sorry but I dont know what you're referring to? are those the characters that do the wilhelm scream?
Figure stands
johnnybeatles9923 14 September 5:41:24 PM
My buddy, Yonnit, needs some of those stands, can you hit me up?
Chris 18 September 11:43:15 AM
Look on Amazon for figure stands.

KingOfTheMentallyIll 14 September 8:47:08 PM
What’s your favorite Transformer Christine ?
Chris 18 September 11:46:17 AM
Out of this set, Son-Chu. Out of the whole: Bumblebee, Optimus Prime, Soundwave, Starscream, Sparky, Stallion and Scooter.
KingOfTheMentallyIll 19 September 10:43:23 AM
@CwcvilleGuardian
Ahah! I didn't comment on all your amazing Transformers review but Son-Chu is also definitely my favorite :D !! Please keep up your good work Christine and have a great day.
G.I. Joe
unknownname1631 15 September 1:03:50 AM
CwcvilleGuardian are you G.I. Joe fan?
Chris 18 September 11:44:34 AM
I watched a few episodes and the movie, but didn't really get into it, but support the soldiers.
Emgo's large collection
dinna7680 15 September 11:51:18 AM
Chris has more toys than people whose job it is to buy and review toys.
Chris 18 September 11:43:58 AM
You should see Emgo's room; my entire toy collection is not as large as that.
Thanks friend
mosvexur1391 15 September 11:05:07 PM
Sending love and positive energy your way! 🎉 💙
Chris 18 September 11:42:58 AM
Thanks, friend! I am feeling the positive energy! ⚡️

How is this 8 minutes long?!?!

The additional verse; the original track had the same verse repeated twice, and I've wanted to update it after figuring out the new verse, myself.

Thanks for showing us a quick glimpse of what the merge will be like! Quick question though... Will it all be singing like this or only sometimes? Will there be singing at all? forgive me, I'm not very educated on the topic.
Chris
Not all the videos will feature AI singing.

Remember when Chris was able to write iconic lyrics like So Need a Cute Girl and (Clyde's) Trollsta's Paradise?
I guess now that he’s WAY PAST middle age he’s all washed up and has lost his SPARK. 😢
Chris
I wrote the lyrics to the song.
Dubbed Version With Subtitles
On 21 November 2025 Chris uploaded JCWCSP Go Transformers - Theme of Transformers of Cwcville - Music Video Plus Subtitles. In it, Chris dubs over Go Transformers - Theme of Transformers of Cwcville - Music Video Fully Updated Plus Subtitles replacing the AI singing with his own singing.

The original with the error will remain unlisted, but still accessable through the links posted on BlueSky and Twitter. Also, bit of a price between working on both PC and laptop.*
