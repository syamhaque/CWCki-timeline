================================================================================

June was the sixth month of 2012. It started off with Chris's return to Facebook, although it was far from triumphant, as Chris confirmed that, once again, he was duped by the trolls, deflating his (borderline insane) ego trip that had started in April. In stark contrast to the months before, Chris spent this month ranting and raving about various things, most of all, blaming the trolls (again) for his misery.
Amazingly, Chris actually upheld his promise to collect donations for cancer via Alex's Lemonade Stand, though it's unknown if he actually sent the money or kept it.
