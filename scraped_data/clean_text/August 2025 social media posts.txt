Gwenmi Mikoto TLUM Review
1 August
Gwen, Gwenmi; whichever, because she was one of the evil one that helped divert the Timelines alongside the very late IdeaGuy.

King of the Hill Season 14
7 August
9:10 PM
I've just finished watching #KingoftheHill Season 14, and I've already watched the entire first 13 seasons beforehand over the years.
Personally, I feel it is great quality. They kept it in line with the older seasons, so lots of continuity. And the jokes were spot on.

Although, I was thrown for a loop with Hank and Peggy being in Saudi Arabia for a few years. Still wrapping my head around that. But, I am glad to see most everyone in a later year. Even Bobby ended up a successful chef and restaurant owner. German and Japanese; the combination was quite unique.
I liked the renewed vibe between Bobby and Connie.
Another great part was when they spliced in scenes from the older episodes in flashbacks. Although, I wish they had used the original footage from when Good Hank was born for that flashback.
If I have any complaints about it, it would be the minor detail in some scenes where Peggy's forehead looked big due to the misplacement of her hair in the front. I look forward to Season 15.
Also, where are Luanne and Lucky?
Just my ⚡️💙⚡️ for now.

Jerk Retirement
9 August
9:34 PM
Everyone, I realize and understand that over the years, I have been a real jerk. I've said and done insensitive things to others over the years. What did it get me? A lot of being trolled, and lots of regrets.
I solemnly swear: from now on, I will never ever again be a jerk.

Crackder the First video
15 August
12:22 PM
Even the surviving First Crackder is not as cracked up as he is meant to be, especilly with sometimes being dizzy while standing at his height, as well as the BIG and TALL jokes. ⚡️💙⚡️

Bad cops. Bad cops. Makoto's cops are on the take, but what do you expect from the Energon they make. Rather as a bot or as a car, they can go excessively far. Bad cops. Bad cops.

Chris isn't hip

Hey. I wish to state that I was never as into internet lingo, memes and trends as you may think or project onto me. I hardly know that many YouTube personalities, either. I can mainly name #Pewdiepie and #MoistCritical, any of the Brony analysts, or even #DangerDolan and...
...friends or anyone more recently introduced to me. And the memes that come to mind: #TwoNumber9s or #Yee. Name any popular or "popular" YouTube, and I very like have never ever heard of them. I hardly ever look for the new, fresh or attention-wanting or heavy video on any...
...streaming service, including YouTube. I don't even keep up with those trends. Call me 80s old-fashioned like that. I didn't go on YouTube everyday in 2006 or before when I got more involved years later.

Excelina video

Do you like your Bots singular or in a combo? Excelina excels either way.

Sonic Racing: Crossworlds beta demo bug
30 August
9:39 AM
Posted to Chris's Twitter account.
How did I get stuck in here for so long a time, @SEGA #SonicRacingCrossWorlds.
⚡️💙⚡️
ALSO, at one point while waiting for an online race to begin, on the Loading screen, Sonic slowly collects one of the three rings then stops. My Switch blacked out;...
...I thought it might have become bricked. BUT, I held the Power button for about ten or so seconds; heard a click sound; the console rebooted. I recovered, but be aware: if that loading is stuck on One Ring waiting to race online, exit the app.
