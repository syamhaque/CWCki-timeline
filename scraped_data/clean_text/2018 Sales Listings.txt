“
[The Idea Guys] were telling him what to sell/urging him to dig through more boxes, etc. in an effort to find things to hawk on eBay to make money for them.
”
Guard Dog The Captain.[1]
This page lists the stuff Chris offered for sale in 2018. In addition, he also sold Sonichu comics printed through Lulu via Patreon.
Chris hit his highest amount of sales revenue during this year, exceeding over $10,000 in sales. The sales were heavily influenced by the Idea Guys saga, as they were alleged to have extorted Chris out of $6,000 by threatening to destroy his imaginary city CWCville. To help raise money to pay them off, Chris sold many items, including several of his Transformers toys, his Amnyfest Ring and ShecameforCWC.JPG, as well as random objects from the Chandler home including Cole Smithey's old homework assignments.
Sales continued after April, when the Idea Guys were removed from power, as the Chandlers were still having financial issues. Chris sold more items during the summer such as Sonichu- and Chris Chan-themed autographed photos, cards, and Fanta cans.
Sales from this year would also start the Guard Dogs and Teen Troon Squad sagas, as Guard Dog The Captain began contact with Chris via purchasing his Amnyfest Ring, and Teen Troon Squad members began contact by purchasing shecameforCWC.JPG.

Selling a few copies of Pokémon LeafGreen that I was gifted some time ago. They all have been checked and passed for full functionalities, and any past save data was erased from each of them. To help my mother and I some more, please. Thank you. :)
Note: Chris acquired the games from a ween who was gullible enough to believe that Chris needed money for grocery bills during the Financhu Crisis and thus sent him a set of 25 Pokemon games to resell. Chris found the package in the hoard two years later.
it should also be noted that Chris claimed each game was "checked and passed", and save data had been erased. He may be fully aware that some (or all) of the games are bootlegs
March
Sailor Moon ticket
Listed 6 March, as Buy It Now
Price: $15, free shipping
Chris cancelled the auction on 20 March, three days after the show.
Ticket For Sailor Moon The Musical At Alamo Drafthouse Theater
Winchester, VA, USA
I was going to see this movie with my friends, but we found a theater closer to our location that will also be showing it. And I can’t get a refund for this ticket; purchased it online. It is for Row 4, Seat 1; this is an awesome show. Please help me out. Full ticket will be sent via private message after sale. Thank you.
Note: The show is for 17 March, yet Chris set the eBay listing to end on 5 April. Chris had purchased an aisle seat and the seat next to it was still available, putting into question Chris's claim about wanting to see the show with friends. It's very possible he met someone who was also going to the show but had a closer seat, even though some places, if the seating is open, may allow goers to take a closer seat. He also says he will be going to a showing closer to Ruckersville, even though all current locations for the musical are only slightly closer/way farther than Winchester, meaning Chris will drive 1.5-2 hours just to see a screening (not live) of a Sailor Moon show
It should also be noted that only two seats at this time (3-10, 6:52 PM CST) are taken that are "closer" to the stage- Row 2 seats 8 and 9- even though all the seats are the exact same price of 15 dollars. It should also be noted its far away from other people- the front row and the handicap row behind are clear

Gloves are not required for applying the conditioner in the shower; be sure you apply it after your regular shampoo and conditioner, and make caring for your hair come First before washing the rest of your body. I enjoy a daily shower with Irish Spring Soap, Garnier Fructise Paraban-Free Shampoos and Conditiners, and water. Rinse off your Colour conditioner Only after finishing washing your body and face, or five minutes after applying it into your hair. And try to keep your Colour-conditioned hair from getting hit by the water before the time is proper to rinse it out, for Best colourful results.

Lot of 32 porn drawings
Listed: 23 April[11]
Price: $1,000
Sold: 24 April[12]
The original listing had been pulled within a few hours, apparently due to reports as eBay does not allow people to sell pornography drawings (unless put in the correct categories, which Chris did not do).
However, on 24 April, Lukas Simpkins, aka Twitter user FFEMemberLukas, expressed interest in buying the art:
@CWCSonichu im willing to pay the 1,000$ for the drawings, please repost them on ebay or esty so i can
Chris replied:
I can’t relist them; eBay is against that. I sent you a direct message, Lukas.
Lukas insisted on a working link, so Chris then quietly relisted the drawings as "Artsfor lukas," and it quickly sold. Lukas gave credit to Twitter user @wxlfdxg for giving him ideas on buying the set.
The listing included Sonichu 8's infamous sex scene, at least one page from the Giant Penis Comic, and the cut-up remains of ShecameforCWC.JPG. Note how most of the art is censored as well (including Chris's man-nips)
I am selling off, as a lot, all 32 of my past and recently-drawn porn drawings I drew personally over the years, including all of the pieces of the torn up “She Came For CWC” drawing in an envelope. Go ahead, you Pervs! You know you Want to pay Large for this lot directly from me. No Certificate of Authenticity will be included, because All of these drawings only bring me feeling ashamed of myself from my past. No Negotiations and No Returns.
This event would later set up the beginning of the Teen Troon Squad saga.
