Fixed with Crayola Fucking Model Magic.

Chris added:
And besides which, this Blue Arm Travesty is as Gosh Awful as #MichaelJackson's whiteface thing!
Nothing personal against the Pop Star Singer.
And nothing personal against anyone of any Race or Color either.
A fan had some questions:
What do you think of Knuckles design? Personally, that bothers me more than the blue arms. I mean, Knuckles was never a bruiser. He was more like a shaman/ninja, not Hulk Hogan.
Also, although I dislike the blue arms (It makes him look like he's in spandex), Sonic Boom is set in an alternate universe, so he's actually a totally different Sonic from Classic or even Modern Sonic. Nice work on the arms though, I actually thought they'd changed the design for a second, before I noticed the slight colour difference. Crayola Model Magic?
Anyway, Knuckles. Your thoughts?
Chris just said:
Yeah, Model Magic.
The same fan asked:
Also, if you are boycotting Sonic Boom and want us to aswell, why did you buy at least two Sonic Boom toys? I don't plan to support them, but by buying their merch, it kind of sends the message that you LIKE the changes, yaknow?
Chris answered:
To recollect the current arms on a couple of items is a small Ironic price to pay towards the cause.

The Shovel Mech Horror
6 November 2014
This idiot in the shovel mech started a fire, near a forest and Houses, including mine! Does not this Male Idiot have a lick of Common Sense to put out the fire when the winds are as heavy as they are Right Now?!!!
Like the video, these first images are taken from inside the house.
But here we see that Chris also went outside.
It's very possible that he screamed at the JERK.
The terrifying inferno.
Chris simultaneously uploaded a video about this incident to his YouTube account.
He posted a follow-up the next day:
7 November 2014
Status update: back to normal, alive for another day or so. Who else gets frightened by fire? Yep.
Caught Up on the Commissions
9 November 2014
I am caught up on the Drawing Commissions. The already drawn pieces are Still Available, and would make great holiday gifts. As would also the Rosechu or Sonichu Medallions (or custom requests for a medallion). To guarantee your Medallions to be delivered before mid-December or Christmas, be sure to make your order(s) before December 10.
And should my moving back into my house come into effect, I will note that on the timeline here, and make an estimate of when I would be back in the swift production to get them out before Christmas.
I am molding more medals right now, including and especially those promised to my most valued customer. All of the recent medal orders herein will be shipped out later this week.
Thank you all for your patience and patronage. Have a good and safe day.
More Foreshadowing
The "Sonic the Hedgehog" Facebook page asked, "What did you think of the first episode of Sonic Boom?" Chris posted on his own page:
9 November 2014
SONIC'S ARMS ARE NOT BLUE!!! I am Boycotting the Sonic Boom Games and TV Show!!! FIX THE ARM COLOR NOW!!! Everyone, BOYCOTT THE GAMES AND TV SHOW until SEGA FIXES THE MONSTROSITY!!!
>:(
Additionally:
9 November 2014
HEY, SEGA!!! SONIC's ARMS ARE NOT BLUE!!! KEEP EVERYTHING ACCURATE!!! HELL YES, I AM STILL VERY PISSED OFF AT YOU ALL FOR NOT DOING ANYTHING TO FIX THE MONSTROSITY OF A MESS!!!
Chris Calls for Civil Unrest
10 November 2014
Take a Stand With Me!!! Not Only Boycott Sonic Boom, the Games AND the TV Show, but Also, Discourage EVERYONE from Buying the Games and Watching Cartoon Network until SEGA Recalls EVERYTHING Sonic Boom, Including the TV Show, and Changes Sonic's Arm Color BACK to their Original Color!!!
RIOT THE STREETS UNTIL THEY FIX THE MONSTROSITY!!!
#SonicBoom
#SonictheHedgehog
#SEGA
#CartoonNetwork
Chris replied to his own comment:
SEND THE MESSAGE OUT TO SEGA AND THE SONIC THE HEDGEHOG PAGE!!!
And again:
I AM STILL REALLY PISSED OFF AT THEM FOR LEAVING HIS ARMS THE WRONG COLOR!!!
One of Chris's followers called for reason:
Dude, why does it matter to you so much? If the game is fun to play, does it really matter what colour his arms are? Why does this bother you so much? This isn't even the "real" Sonic, it's an alternate universe. I'm pretty annoyed that Knuckles looks like Hulk Hogan, but I'm going to wait until I see gameplay to decide if it's bad or not.
Why not approach it with an open mind? You might like it if you give it a chance.
William Elliott Waterman opined:
I just stopped playing them because Sonic Adventure 2 was so horrible.
Kenneth wrote:
He's better off with a petition among Sonic fans rather than a lone protest.
But Chris would not be moved:
I do not care of your so-called circumstances, or "Alternate Universe" Theory. SONIC'S ARMS ARE NOT FREAKING BLUE!!!
And ALL of the Sonic Games, Before THIS MONSTROSITY, Including Sonic Adventure 2, Are Freaking Awesome, WILLIAM!!!
AND WHY DON'T YOU START THE PETITION?! I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO MAKE AN ONLINE PETITION
Kenneth replied:
Just go to: http://www.ipetitions.com/
Because I honestly don't understand why you are so upset over this?
Chris said:
His Arms Are Not Supposed To Be Blue; How Is That Difficult For You To Understand?!
Kenneth, still trying to be helpful:
Why not write Sega directly and ask them Was it a marketing decision that prompted this? Are there others who are upset over this?
Chris:
I am sure there are, and I Have Messaged SEGA and the Sonic Pages on Facebook about this! The STH page blocked me from Posting Comments and Liking their page's content. >:(
Kenneth:
That may have just been the "official fanpage" or whatever, but I just did a search and it looks like there's a bunch of STH Facebook pages.
There is a Facebook Page about Sonic's arms being blue but it does not look like a protest page.
Chris:
Click the link to its page from the Sonic Boom Link in the Post, three below this one.
And your iPetition thing is Messed Up; it is Not Working Very Well For Me. Not User Friendly!
Good Night!!! |:(
William retorted:
What? All of the Sonic games before Sonic Boom (which isn't released yet) were awesome? Chris, I know you have PSN trophies for Sonic 2006. You really liked that? I mean, setting the story aside, it was full of glitches and obviously wasn't playtested. SEGA didn't care about their fans when they released it. You're saying that's okay?
Chris replied:
Sonic 2006 does not have Trophies. And I can tolerate the minor glitches.
A Free Theme?!?! Horrible!!!
11 November 2014
Ugh!!! They have This Blue Armed Theme on the 3DS shop for Free. I am NOT Downloading it, and Neither Should Any Of You All!
Boycott Sonic Boom Until SEGA RECALLS IT ALL AND CHANGE HIS ARMS BACK!!!

11 November 2014

This is Getting Repetitive
Chris posted a still from the Sonic Boom TV show with:
14 November 2014
GET THIS CARTOON OFF THE AIR AND FIX HIS ARM COLOUR IMMEDIATELY!!!
Kim asked:
Are you going to get the game?
Chris responded:
Hell No!!! NOT UNTIL SEGA RECALLS ALL THE COPIES, EDITS THE INSERTS AS WELL AS THE INITIAL SOFTWARE, PRE-UPDATES, AND PULLS THE TV SHOW OFF THE AIR AND FIXES THAT TOO!!! I AM FUCKING SERIOUS ABOUT IT!!!
Kim:
What if they never change the arms?
Sadly, they might not care about the customers anymore...
Chris:
THEN I WILL STILL NOT BE BUYING THE GAMES AT ALL!!!
Kim:
Well good for you! You believe in the cause.
You should try to rally the troops, so to speak. Do you have any ideas?
Chris:
And NOT WATCHING THE TV SHOW EVER EITHER!!! I MIGHT NOT WATCH CARTOON NETWORK EVER AGAIN!!! |:(
That is why I authorized Kenneth Erwin Engelhardt to creat the group, Keep Sonic Original, and create the online Petition.
SONIC'S ARMS ARE NOT BLUE, AND THEY SERIOUSLY CAUSE SENSORY OVERLOADS IN ME!!! PLEASE REMOVE ALL OF YOUR SONIC BOOM IMAGES, VIDEOS, AND THE TV SHOW ALTOGETHER FROM YOUR FACEBOOK, FROM YOUR CN WEBSITE, AND FROM YOUR CHANNEL IMMEDIATELY!!!
FOLLOW ME IN BOYCOTTING SONIC BOOM, UNTIL SEGA WISES UP, RECALLS EVERYTHING AND CHANGES HIS ARM COLOUR BACK, NOW!!!

At this point Chris's fans helped him set up a separate protest Facebook page, "Keep Sonic Original."
In Case You Didn't Get It the First Time
On 16 November 2014, Chris uploaded screenshots of the above conversation between himself and Kim regarding his holy cause.
I Want You...to Sign This Petition
Chris provided a link to iPetitions with:

RIGHT! Sign this Petition, Please!
The Autism-Discriminating Sperm Bank
Chris complained about being rejected for being a sperm donor because of his autism. Chris posted screencaps of his e-mail about the situation. In typical Chris fashion, the idea that there might be reasons other than autistic discrimination doesn't occur to him.
Chris probably had some help writing this post.
20 November 2014
I have applied on beaspermdonor.com to the Fairfax, VA Cryobank, and in their reply in the images below, I was rejected. Autism WAS asked about in the online donor application.
The simple fact that the sperm bank rejected my application makes it very clear that they are discriminatory against autistic people. They are insinuating that autism is some sort of dreaded disease that needs to be disclosed despite the fact that it is not an illness. The sperm bank is embracing the ideals of the eugenics movement in their attempt too "protect the world" from the big, bad, scary autistic people. The sperm bank is also insinuating that autism is genetic or hereditary when in fact there is no consistent scientific proof to back this up. By denying my application, the sperm bank is thus perpetuating the same old tired assumptions but without providing actual evidence to support their outlandish claims.
There is no such thing as a 100% healthy individual with 100% healthy DNA, so the sperm bank is lying to its recipients when they "guarantee" their sperm. There is no way to reliably figure out which combinations of DNA from sperm and egg will likely give which results. Everybody is carrying something; so why discriminate against me, and by extension, other autistic people?
Their whole "your DNA is no good- begone!" explanation is utter bullshit.
We really need to draw attention to this. The sperm bank shouldn't be allowed to get away with this outrage

Changing Sonic's Arms Back for the Nth Time
Chris continued his complaining over Sonic's blue arms, this time by drawing a picture about himself, dressed in women's clothing, painting Sonic's arms. The illustration itself was actually a request from a CWCki Forums user for a comic,[1] before Chris posted the panel on his "Keep Sonic Original" Facebook group.
The requested full comic including the infamous panel.

Chris is Just a Clown Who's Feeling Down
26 November 2014
I have had a stressful week last week, the most bizarre and mixed up sleep schedule, and I am feeling REALLY SLEEPY after a deep slumber last night, resulting in a Short Five Hour "Power Nap". UGH!!! My mind is wiped right now. All current orders, And one remedy of a commission request, will be fulfilled and completed tomorrow at my better ability and feelings then. Everything will be shipped out Wednesday. I just bought some ZZZQuil; a single dose ought to give me the full eight or so hours I need right now.
