Chris in April 2013.
April was the fourth month of 2013. Chris primarily just updated his Facebook, posting a few new profile pictures of his tomgirl look.
Notable events
4 April - Chris posts public and private Facebook notes saying that he wants nothing more to do with the The GAMe PLACe.
20 April - Chris uploads two new Facebook pictures. One of them depicts him holding a sign that reads "Haters to the Left," and points to the viewer's right in typical Chris fashion. The other one shows him holding a different sign that declares him "[his] own free bitch." Privately, he says that he made the photos for a "new woman in my life."
22 April - Chris posts a photo on Facebook of his cat Lucy sitting on his "shrinking mound."
26 April - Chris shows his Facebook friends that he has recolored his hair to a dirty blonde.
29 April - Chris posts two Facebook notes. In the first one he expresses his outrage at the news of Sega planning to replace Sonic as their mascot, not realizing that the news story he is responding to is parodic. In the second note he bemoans how he has been trolled in the past by men pretending to be women.
