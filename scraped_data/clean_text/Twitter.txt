YOUR TAX DOLLARS AT WORK!The contents of this page have been bought with taxpayer money!
PROTIP:
While it has been renamed to X, CWCki will continue to refer to it by it's TRUE and HONEST original name, Twitter, due to most of Chris's activity stemming from before the rename, and the site still being referred to mostly as Twitter.

Twitter (renamed 𝕏 after Elon Musk's acquisition of the platform, but largely called by its original name by most users) is a popular social networking and microblogging service where people can post messages that are up to 280 (originally 140) characters in length, or more if you pay a monthly subscription for the platform (which Chris began doing in October 2023).[2] While it has its uses and has managed to last despite many criticisms, it is sometimes described as a pointless fad, and if even Chris called it a fad at one point, perhaps there is something to this claim.
However, from 2016 onward, Chris became much more active on Twitter, to the point where it became his primary means of communicating with the public. He shifted his online presence away from his YouTube channel and his Facebook page and began using the blogging platform to communicate ideas through multi-part Twitter threads and image uploads.
Unfortunately, Chris often failed to understand why Twitter was designed the way it is. While Twitter threads are now an official feature of the site, Chris concocted his own version of them for years prior. He acted as if Twitter is just a normal blog that inexplicably splits the messages into 280-character chunks for no reason. Whenever he goes off on a long text wall broken up between dozens of tweets, he ends most of them with a "..." when he has to finish a sentence between tweets, making his tweets difficult to follow. However, after subscribing, he took advantage of his free rein to make longer posts, making his ramblings easier to read and process.
On 20 June 2013 and 21 June 2013, hidden Twitter posts from 16 April 2012 to 21 June 2013, most of them linked to the 2013 Facebook leak, and pictures from 20 June 2013 were leaked on the CWCki Forums.
Chris stopped using Twitter following the revelations and his eventual arrest for incest, with his last tweet being on 30 July 2021. On 16 August 2023, however, he returned to the site, liking a few tweets, then eventually resuming posting in October 2023.

CWCSonichu (26 December 2009 - 14 June 2019)
As it was, in 2010.
Chris was inspired to register his own Twitter account, CWCSonichu,[3] when the CWCipedia administrator insisted on adding a live Sonichu Twitter feed [4] onto the CWCipedia Mailbag page, and later the CWCipedia front page. This feed picked up all mentions of the word "Sonichu" (hence Chris's use of the prefix "C.C. Sonichu says:"), to provide the loyal fanbase real-time coverage of their favorite comic and game hero and reactions to his weird antics from other fans. The CWCipedia sysop, in his infinite wisdom, elected to allow arbitrary, unmoderated comments from all fans to appear on the front page, to fully leverage the power of Web 2.0, user-created content, reader participation and all that modern nonsense.
Careful readers may start to notice that there's a slight conflict in this: Chris had stated many times that he wanted to be in complete control over the CWCipedia. In a development that surprised no one, the live feed was promptly overrun by trolls. Chris was furious, and was compelled to write his own updates to drown out all of the gay allegations and other pickle-related activity that was going on on his web page.
However, as it is with all of the other things in this world, Chris's focus on Twitter waned over time. In May 2010, the live Twitter feed was removed from CWCipedia, because apparently certain trolls failed to notice that Chris quit paying attention to his own web page and the activities of the trolls in the Twitter feed started to make Chris look positive in comparison. Chris stopped using the site in 2013 but picked up again in June 2016 and began tweeting more and more through the rest of 2016 and into 2017, to the point where he is more active on Twitter now than ever before.
Subscriptions
Chris originally followed 29 people and groups, all of them related to gaming. Among these are...
...relevant information on Life Upgrades: PlayStation, ps3fanboy, PS3_Trophies
...accounts related to the sweetest non-Chinese hobby of all: Media_Molecule, LittleBigPlanet [No longer followed as that account was suspended for some reason], LittleBIGFan, SackBoy4Pluto, Mm_Sackgirl
...respectable, reliable and impartial game journalists and media: Veronica [Veronica Belmont], Qore, GamesRadar, GameTrailers, gamespot, IGN, g4tv, GamePro, xplay, gamenewsps3 [G4], gameinformer
...game houses which produce games that Chris may play, if properly baited away from LittleBigPlanet-related activities: Naughty_Dog, insomniacgames, SEGA, EA, Ubisoft, CriterionGames, NISAmerica [Nippon Ichi Software], RockBand, namcogames
...tugboat sailing destinations: amazongames
...events which Chris doesn't attend: Official_PAX
Notably, Veronica Belmont (a video game show host and also, OMG, a woman) is the only real person among these subscriptions. This does wonders to dispel rumors that Chris is a living video game geek stereotype and hence beyond merely undateable.
With Chris's resurgence of activity, he has followed over 600 accounts, many of them belonging to minor celebrities and internet personalities he attempts to interact with. Some accounts he formerly followed have since blocked Chris.
Blocks
See also: List of places that have banned Chris#Social media profiles and TF2 Analysis
Chris has been blocked on Twitter by a number of accounts, including many he used to follow, preventing him from either tweeting at them or seeing their posts. While some of this has come from people he follows discovering his personality flaws and history of poor online behavior, other blocks have been due to weens flocking to any account Chris shares from or responds to, spamming his convos with less than savory things and images of Chris's past.
Though Chris has been periodically blocked by various people for several years, he reached his breaking point in January 2019 when he was blocked by a number of individuals in the My Little Pony fandom in short succession, prompting many days of angry screeching and tard rage against the trolls and the blockers themselves.
This would not be the first notable incident where Chris threw a total fit from being blocked. When Doopie blocked Chris for his creepy behavior, Chris blamed the trolls and weens, not realizing that his own actions was the main catalyst in Doopie cutting any sort of ties with him. From this incident, it is clear that two years later, Chris still cannot comprehend why someone would NOT want to talk to him. Given his historic inability to be told "no", it is likely that Chris will be continuing to receive more twitter blocks in the future.
CPU_CWCSonichu (9 February 2019 - 30 July 2021; 16 August 2023 -)
On 9 February 2019, Chris began his move to a new Twitter account, @CPU_CWCSonichu, in an attempt to yet again bypass his blocks. Predictably, this was blocked within a day or two by all relevant bronies. After a few days of Twitter silence, Chris posted A Moment With Dr Wolf Chris Chan and Greater Struggles on both his old @CWCSonichu account and his new
@CPU_CWCSonichu account, soon followed with an announcement the he was indeed abandoning the old account (with roughly 25,000 followers at this time, down from a peak of 31,000 after manually banning thousands of weens and trolls) and transferring his Twitter fanbase to the new @CPU_CWCSonichu account (just over 2,000 followers as of 17 February, and growing rapidly), noting that he "will be striving to contain Less Drama and any and all Haters and Harassers shall be Blocked Out, Period".
Chris did not realize that protected Twitter accounts cannot be viewed by people who are not following him. He made many tweets directed at people who will never see them, meaning that he is truly talking into the void. On 5 June 2019, however, Chris responded to someone pointing this out to him. Chris said he knows this, but doesn't care, and still tags people. Currently, when Chris tweets something that he wants as many people as possible to see, he will ask readers to screencap his tweets and share them. He opened Direct Messaging on the 24th and removed the protection the next day.
Chris eventually unprotected the account.
During the Jail Saga, Chris's account was dormant, with his last tweet being on 30 July 2021.
Post-jail activity
Helena's liked fanart.
On 16 August 2023, Chris began liking tweets on his CPU_CWCSonichu account. The first was a comic about My Little Pony and the second about the drink GFuel.[5][6]
The first liked tweet.
The second liked tweet.
Hours later, Chris liked several more tweets, including one showing art by the enabler Helena Fiorenza on Chris being back online.[7]
A few more hours later, Chris liked another tweet from more enablers offering fanart and welcoming him back to the internet.[8][9]
On the 17th, Chris likes some more tweets including more "welcome back" fanart and art of someone's bisexual My Little Pony OC, along with a comic about My Little Pony characters looking at each other's asses.[10][11][12]
On the 18th, Chris is still actively liking tweets.
On the 19th, Chris's Twitter activity skyrockets as he likes twelve tweets in one day. The liked tweets range from posts about a romance book series called "The Jane Austen Series", a tweet complaining about the new "X" app icon, a meme about missing out on "teen love", an ad for a new shoe that's "one for the furries", the standard My Little Pony post, and an ad for a collaboration between G-Fuel and Genshin Impact.[13][14][15][16][17][18]
Later in the day, Chris likes five more posts, mainly more My Little Pony fanart, along with a tweet about furries going to furry convention.[19][20]
On the 26th, Chris liked a post of a Snorlax wearing a fedora being called a "wild redditor". He later liked a post commenting on Pmurt's mugshot with the ironic caption "I hope he's tried as an adult."[21][22]
Chris was inactive on Twitter for about a week until the 31st, liking more My Little Pony fanart.[23][24]
On 4 September 2023, Chris makes his first known post-jail block as he blocks "The New Liquid Chris" on Twitter.[25] Chris also likes a retweet of Helena Fiorenza's DM release along with two of Otaku King's tweets, the first being an Attack On Titan meme about Otaku and Chris and the second being Otaku's sighting of Chris.[26][27][28] Chris also followed Otaku King on Twitter.[29]
After another short break, Chris likes a tweet from Geno Samuel on the 10th about Geno appearing on Japanese TV, the caption referencing Chris's Yep, I'm on TV :) DVD.[30]
Ending yet another now routine break, Chris likes a couple tweets throughout the last week of September 2023, including the standard My Little Pony fanart, random AI art, a giveaway for an XBox controller, and a retweet of a trailer for an audio series titled "Gay Old Life".[31][32][33][34]
Through the first weeks of October 2023 from the 3rd to the 14th, Chris liked many posts, notably including two posts from former US president,Barack Obama,[35] one celebrating his annivesary with Michelle, and one condemning the terrorism in Israel.[36] These posts were bookended by multiple tweets relating to the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic TV show.
On the 16 October 2023, Chris makes his first post-jail tweet. [37] Attached to the tweet are 2 out of focus images of Chris's Room and the latest rendition of the Sonichu Medallion, as well as a photo featuring 2 custom Amiibos and one photo of a full color drawing of Chris-chan Sonichu.
Alt accounts
Since the discovery of the @NightStar2891 account, watchers have found a number of other accounts that appear to belong to Chris, such as the now-suspended @EquestriaHeart, characterized by their clearly unrealistic degree of Sonichu fandom, white knighting of Chris, and similar interests and behavior. However, it has become clear that they in fact belong to weens pretending to be Chris's sockpuppets.
A related form of weenery involves impersonating Chris. While a few accounts such as @RealCWCSonichu make some attempt to be convincing imposters, most, such as @liquidchu420 and @cw_true, are clearly (unfunny) jokes and not intended to fool spectators. Chris, however, believes that these imposter accounts are responsible for his bad reputation that led to other users blocking him.
NightStar2891
Main article: Night Star#Twitter sockpuppet
In August 2017, during the Doopie Saga, trolls discovered that Chris was operating an alternate account (or "sockpuppet") on Twitter, with the main purpose of supporting his main account in arguments with weens, posing as a TRUE and HONEST fan of Chris and his work. The account, @NightStar2891, assumed the persona of Chris's My Little Pony fan character, "(Miss) Night Star".
Chris initially denied (on both accounts) any connection to "Night Star". However, as with his JenkinsJinkies account on Trollin Train, even a slow-in-the-mind would be able to recognize Chris from the use of his distinctive writing style, constant praise and defense of himself, location in Virginia, frequent assertions that he is transgender, following and retweeting of people he likes (such as Doopie and Tara Strong), borrowing of his original characters, and password-recovery emails matching Chris's known accounts. Of course, Chris believes he is a master of disguise and believed he had successfully masked his identity under the secondary account.
Later in August, Chris came clean and admitted he was behind NightStar8291, though he continues to use the account occasionally, particularly to try and contact people such as Doopie, Tabitha St. Germain, and LadyOfTheCosmo who have blocked Chris's main account.

MagiChan111448
The recovery email on file matches IAMMRC@aol.com, Bob's old email[38], proving it to be Chris.
On January 2019, another Twitter sock was discovered by observers under the alias of Magi-Chan, @MagiChan111448. The account was created primarily so Chris could white-knight for himself during the Twitter blocks from TF2 Analysis crew saga and to evade their blocks on his main Twitter account.
The account was set to protected mode, so people not following it wouldn't be able to read the tweets and reply, making it a cheap way for Chris to feel validation. Activity on the account resumed in June 2019, promoting Dimensional Merge and Chris's other beliefs. The account was unprotected in late June 2019.
Chris claims it was made for his imaginary friend and spouse:
I personally helped make the account for him, and he stood with me and included his likes and wants for the page. He shall be personally making his tweets and commentary from there.[39]
The number 111448 is a reference to Magi-Chan's retconned birthdate (Nov. 14, 1948, which had been put in Chris's head by the Idea Guys the year before).[40]

Crystalemera28
In July 2023, during the third exile, the Twitter account crystalemera28, aka Christ Chan, was created. The account looks very similar to Chris's YouTube Channel created around the same time. The account has only four tweets and a relatively small number of likes.

Today’s episode of Tell Your Tale was a close call. Let’s hope it was just an outlier, and not a sign that this series will end up acknowledging Season 9 of Friendship is Magic and thus have to be revised with it.

Agreed. #MLPG5 still needs to be shelved and #FriendshipIsMagic and #EquestriaGirls resumed posthaste.

#MLPG5 is more demonic and evil than the worst evils of Hell Realm.

The Teen Troon Squad socially engineered Chris into giving them his Twitter password and used it to sign into his account to post tweets in order to troll him, such as by leaking several videos from the Idea Guys saga and posting an image of a dead animal claiming it to be one of Chris's pets.
The Captain signed into Chris's account, with his permission, during the events of Waiting for the tow truck, in order to inform followers of Chris's situation.
Marvin, who had access to the account, mentioned in February 2019 that he would sometimes use his access to block "speds screeching at Chris";[41] Marvin blocked Jacob Sockness's account in December 2019.[42]
X
Chris's X account as of November 2024, promoting his Bluesky and no longer paying for X Premium.
During the Jail Saga, Twitter was acquired by Elon Musk, who rebranded the website to X and made other broad changes. After Chris returned to using the website, he subscribed to the X Premium feature.[2] In October 2023, after he resumed regularly posting, he complained that "@elonmusk really has fucked Twitter up," writing:[43]
Verification Process improvement aside, but the price is not needed for that, @elonmusk really has fucked Twitter up. Nobody, not even I, will ever refer to it as “X”; that is just as Stupid Y Stupid (tonto y tonto) as Team Rocket and Giovanni, period.
Phew! It feels really good to finally get that off of my mind and back.
In November 2024, after the Musk-backed candidate Pmurt won the United States election, Chris announced that he would be mainly moving to competitor social media site Bluesky, but would still have a presence on Twitter.
Elon Musk
“
I do not like Elon Musk at all.
”
Chris
In 2022, Twitter was acquired by Elon Musk. Before this, Chris has had positive things to say about Elon, agreeing with his theory in the Big Bang Theory in March 2019.[44][45] However, when Chris returned from jail to the Internet in October 2023, he began to mirror the more popular opinion of Elon on Twitter, claiming he had "fucked [it] up."[46]
In December 2023, Chris would write to Elon saying "The only shit you get is from yourself, due to the lack of authentic deep spiritual satisfaction, insights and connections with everything without the need of technology. Meditate on that, Elon."[47]
In November 2024, Chris would call-out Elon for hypocrisy about spreading hate and division.[48]
In the early hours of 6 November 2024, shortly after Donald Trump had won the presidential election with Elon's support, Chris made a post on Bluesky claiming to be moving to the platform.[49] On 9 November 2024, Chris made a post on Twitter talking about the move and claimed he had blocked Elon Musk, adding "Take from that what you may." This happened two days after he had blocked Caitlyn Jenner for supporting Donald Trump.[50]
On 29 March 2025, while Chris was livestreaming, a donor asked Chris for his opinion on Elon. Chris replied with "I do not like Elon Musk at all. I mean, I had the blue checkmark, it was good while it lasted... but it's not worth it with, uh, Musk... he's too musky, and really... bad. He could've just not purch- not bought Twitter. He had the opportunity to back out, but no. He... pressed on. He should've taken it out, we'd be a lot better off."[51]
Despite his disapproval of Elon and his management of Twitter, Chris has paid for a subscription to Twitter for several months from October 2023 until February 2025. Chris acknowledged this in March 2025, saying "it was good while it lasted," and explained his reasoning for unsubscribing was because it was "not worth it" due to Elon.[52]
