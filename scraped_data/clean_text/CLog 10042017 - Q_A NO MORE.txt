================================================================================

CLog 10042017 - Q&A NO MORE!!! is a video Chris streamed live on 5 October 2017 (despite the "04" in the title). It is the second of two videos (after IMG 5424 he uploaded that day in response to the alleged hacking of Jessica Quinn's Facebook account. While the first was addressed to Quinn and expressed concern for what had happened to her, in this video Chris blames the hacking on trolls from Kiwi Farms, where he had solicited questions for a Q&A video the previous day.
It is arguably the most terrifying fit of rage Chris has publicly uploaded in years, as he screams like a banshee while looking like a witch and gesturing at the camera. The calming background synth music only adds to the confusion the video brings out. His left eye is also noticeably drooping, which may either be an early sign of a stroke, or substance abuse.
This marks the first time in many years that Chris curses someone. One of Chris's cats can also be seen near the door to his room throughout the video, obscured by the clutter in his playroom.
This video is the second-most popular upload on Chris's CwcvilleGuardian YouTube channel, sitting at over 321,000 views as of August 2023. It was eventually overtaken in views by a later, similarly over-the-top rant about My Little Pony, which was also the last video that Chris would upload himself before his arrest over an incestuous affair.
