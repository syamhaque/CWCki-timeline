Ultra Sonichu is a blog post published by Chris to Cwclight on 16 November 2024. It is the seventh post to the website, published five days after the previous two.
Ultra Sonichu
This blog is to talk about Sonichu Prime when he powers up with the seven (or all eight) Chaos Emeralds or Chaos Crystal Balls.
But, I feel the details of the Ultimate Emerald needed to be restated at this point for starters.
The Ultimate Emerald is a God Powered Emerald, more powerful than the eight Master Emeralds.
It was the central power gem with each of the eight Master Emeralds surrounding it like points on a compass.
In around 450 B.C., the Ultimate Emerald had shattered, and it left the Eight Chaos Emeralds.
Eight, Not Seven; the Eighth one is Orange, and is more elusive compared to the other seven.
When the Ultimate Emerald shattered and the Chaos Emeralds dispersed, so did the eight Master Emeralds, with the Green one ending up on what would become Angel Island with the Echidna Tribe.
And the Core Energy of the Ultimate Emerald ended up within the Core of the One Avatar of all existence, and the Ultimate Emerald has been restored within the past couple of years from September, 2024 and resonates between both the C-197 and 1218 halves of this very Earth.
The Chaos Emeralds and Chaos Crystal Balls continue to be about and do as they will and need to keep and restore order when chaos and discord is afoot.
Knuckles' Master Emerald, aside, the Master Sunston on Flame the Sunbird's island is one of the other Master Emeralds, albeit reshaped to be like the evolution sun stone.
That Master Emerald promotes growth, prosperity and development.
The Cyan Master Emerald is housed in Cwcville on a dedicated alter and under protection within the expansive Cwcville Park just north-east of the Cwcville Basillicomm.
The remaining five are around the world on their respective alters under guard by a Special Sonichu or Rosechu, as well as the Psychic Squadron division located in those respective countries.
That being said, a Chaos Emerald is equal to 12.5% Power of a Master Emerald, and a Chaos Crystal (S-Chu) Ball is equal to about 15% Power of a Master Emerald.
One difference between the Emeralds and Crystal Balls being intense Electric Power in the Crystal Balls.
Now only Sonichu Prime and Rosey Rosechu Prime, as opposed to the Regular Sonichus and Rosechus, are capable of utilizing the power and energy of the Chaos gem stones and storing the energies in their bodies.
Yet like regular Sonichus and Rosechus, they are capable of Mega Evolving with their Sonichite and Rosechite (Mega Stones).
When Sonichu Prime Mega Evolves, he takes the physical form of Ultra Sonichu, but he is not as powerful as if he had used the Chaos Emeralds or Chaos Crystal Balls, or even the SOL Emeralds.
He does get the stat boots all around, but it's not like he can ram into a foe and insta-kill them.
Mega Evolving results in about 1/3 Power compared to the full power using seven Chaos gem stones.
When Rosey utilizes the Chaos gems, she is not like her Mega Evolved (Lioness) form; she physically stays similar, but her quills are straightened out and turned upright, and she glows in a primrose shade as opposed to her normal fur colour of diva pink.
Anyway, one other good thing about Ultra Sonichu Prime (with Chaos gems) is that he can focus and shine his aura energy with lightning power boost from his hands and core to shine a Light Power that is even brighter than the Sun, which can no doubt dispel and destroy any demon, devil or anything that is weak to Light Power.
