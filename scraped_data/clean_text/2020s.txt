And obviously those out of the eight guys, counting Robertchu, before me were not hitting her G-Spot as much with their cocks. I had attempted the first night to rub her in there; i found her spot, but it hurt her. But, alternatively, I did find that at cunnilingus, I was good at it with my tongue

Chris describing incestuous sex with his mother[1]
The 2020s are the current decade, and the period of time where all hell finally broke loose for Chris.
2020 started things off with a pretty big clusterfuck with the coronavirus pandemic wreaking havoc on the world, justifying Chris's further descent into his fantasies. For almost an entire year, he pretended to be possessed by Sonichu.
Little did observers know, this was only the beginning. In 2021, Chris was arrested for incest with his own mother, shocking followers. Chris spent over a year in jail, along with a short stint in a mental hospital, before being released from jail on court order. After jail, Chris seemed to improve somewhat, moving into a new home (with help from the mysterious Praetor group) and meeting a boyfriend-free girl, "Flutter."
This decade so far has marked a period of accelerated decay – mentally and physically – for Chris, and things have only intensified further as the decade has gone on. Chris will be aged between 37 and 47, presuming that he makes it through the entire decade.

Afterwards, he was spotted frequently around the Chesterfield area. In August 2023, Chris's incest charge was dismissed as a result of David Heilberg having filed for an autism disorder deferred disposition a year prior. Later that year, Chris moved into a house in Big Island, Virginia, which Caden Peck had been involved with financing.
