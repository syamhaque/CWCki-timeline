Troll disclosure: This persona was created, appropriated, or otherwise used by trolls to manipulate Chris. He was played by Clyde CashThough this identity is contrived, the CWCki may treat it as if it were a real identity because it was to Chris. (It's also funnier that way.)

Shawn Corey Carter (born 4 December 1969), known as Jay Z, is an American rapper and businessman. He is one of the world's best-selling music artists.
In 2009, a troll used Carter's pseudonym as a nickname for a lawyer persona named James Zylberstein,[1] which was used to persuade Chris to change the names of the real-life people used in Sonichu, most notably with "Mary Lee Walsh" becoming "Slaweel Ryam". Although the name was a clear nod to the rapper, Chris failed to recognize the reference. Despite this, some future real-life characters, such as Jason Kendrick Howell, still used their real names.
Jay's emails with Chris were posted on PVCC, including one email where Chris 'pretty much explained everything he's ripped off'. Unfortunately, Jay Z did not save these emails, nor did any of the PVCC members, so they are now completely lost to time. Former CWCki admin Champthom described these emails as 'hilarious stuff'[2].

What Chris probably thought his lawyer looked like.
According to Chris in the Gregg Mays E-mails, Zylberstein was his sole legal contact with Nintendo and served as the ultimate authority on all matters related to copyright and troll detection. Chris repeatedly invoked “my lawyer” to validate Gregg Mays’ legitimacy, threaten legal action, and justify his own paranoid ramblings.
At one point, Gregg Mays claiming to be a web designer for Nintendo asked Chris for both his username and password to his Tripod account in order to implement a new “system” for the website. Chris promptly handed over the credentials. Gregg then hijacked the site and falsely claimed that Sega had taken it down. Chris later claimed that Zylberstein confirmed Gregg was a troll and that Sega had no intention of suing him, thereby granting Chris the high ground (in his own mind).
On 8 January 2009, Chris uploaded a video named "CWC Update 010808" where he threatens Gregg Mays, demanding that he "re-upload sonichu.net". He also referred to James Zylberstein as Jay Z, somehow unaware of the joke. In the video, Chris claimed that Jay Z would "come down with his boys from Nintendo and the boys at Sega! They gonna rain d-they gonna track you down. We're gonna punish you for what you did."

Years later, on 12 January 2015, a thread created by Null popped up on the CWCki Forums back when it was still operating under that name before eventually rebranding as Kiwi Farms. It featured a post that was an alleged leak from someone claiming to be a Nintendo employee. The post detailed the status of Chris’s game account, revealing a list of titles he had purchased for the platform. Among the games mentioned was NBA 2K13 a game executive-produced by none other than Jay Z and plastered him all over its marketing.[3]
