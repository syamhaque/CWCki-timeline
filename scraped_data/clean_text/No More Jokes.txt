An artist's interpretation of the epic love that can't be.
No More Jokes is a 5 November 2009 video in which Chris not very dramatically reveals the true face of Clyde Cash, just few days after telling us it will never end. Not surprisingly, this revelation has had absolutely no effect on Clyde, probably due to the fact that he (spoiler alert) uses the same old Gay Spider-Man photo used plenty of times before.
