Design of the coin
The Kiwi Farms silver coin is a custom silver coin featuring Chris's imagery. A batch of coins were sold by Null during 2021 to support the Kiwi Farms forum.
On 1 February 2021, Null announced on Kiwi Farms that he was planning to sell custom silver coins as a merch run, and that his idea was to have imagery of the Kiwi Farms on one side of the coin and Chris on the other.[1]
Chris attempts to photograph a profile shot of himself for Null's coin run.
On 4 February, he posted a photo of Chris posing for the coin, who wore his medallion, Sailor Moon tiara, and Breathe It In shirt.[2] On 12 April, Null posted that Chris was very into the idea of being featured on the coin when Null asked for his permission. Null further claimed that Chris had offered to tweet about it the previous week. On the topic of compensation towards Chris for using his likeness, Null claimed he would send a bunch of coins to 14 Branchland Court, and send some cash over or offer to help pay for Chris's future car repairs.[3] Null mentioned that Chris had a suggestion for the coin's motto, which Null rejected, citing his desire for a motto with broader appeal and the length of Chris's motto being too long to fit on the coin. As Null recalled, the suggested motto was akin to "Zappin' to the Extreme with Sonichu & Rosechu and the Electric Blueheart CPU Goddess".[4]
Sales of the coin hit an unexpected problem in summer 2021 when Chris was found to have committed incest. On 1 August, Null announced that he would not change the coin design, but would provide refunds upon request, and promised the coins would be the last items he would sell with direct reference to Chris.[5]

Following delays and other issues with the coin run, on 17 September 2021, orders began to be received by customers.[6] In February 2022, Null sent out emails to customers stating that all should have received their coins.[7]
On 31 July 2021, Chris had lied to Null, concerning money Chris had taken out of his mother's bank account. This compelled Null to cut ties with Chris.[8] As a result of this, it is unclear whether Null intends to compensate Chris for his imagery on the coins as originally planned.
