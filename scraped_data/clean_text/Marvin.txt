This article is still yet to be completed due to stress. We get a lot of stressful torture in our lives that makes us crash into slumber. Given that inspiration is a big variable, and we may have been lacking of it, this article will be completed as soon as possible, at our own pace... HONEST! This article is missing the following:
• stuff from the Man in the Pickle Suit page

The man in the pickle suit… a- it's apparent this guy's amongst the… trolls.

Emily, Guard Dog
Marvin, also known by the pseudonym Howard Winslow, is a former member of the Miscreants group of trolls, a former member of the Guard Dogs, and the owner of the CWCki. For many years he was an active member of communities such as CWCki Forums and Kiwi Farms, where he often commented on how trolling was arranged behind-the-scenes and leaked content on Chris.
As a troll, Marvin may be best known for portraying the Man in the Pickle Suit during the Date with Emily.
Despite his background as a troll, Marvin has also given help to Chris. He played a role in convincing Chris to seek medical treatment for the self-inflicted taint wound. After Marvin discovered that the Idea Guys had allegedly begun extorting Chris, he helped advise The Captain to distract them while he gathered evidence for the Guard Dogs to attempt to send to law enforcement. For a time afterwards, Marvin helped discourage others from contacting Chris and was trusted by him to screen out weens on Twitter.
Marvin gradually lost interest in Chris and now rarely posts in the Chris subforum of Kiwi Farms, although he still continues to host the CWCki.
History
Main article: Man in the Pickle Suit#Emily Saga
From left: Marvin, in costume as the Man in the Pickle Suit, LoveYouLongTime, in her role as Emily, and Chris.
In March 2009, Marvin and LoveYouLongTime trolled Chris at the Fashion Square Mall. LoveYouLongTime, portraying Emily, led Chris to believe she was on a date with him. Marvin,
wearing a pickle costume, then intercepted them and asked Emily if she wanted to see a movie. The two then left together, leaving Chris outraged.
On 7 August 2017, Marvin, using his "Howard Winslow" Twitter account, DM'd NightStar2891, a Twitter account suspected to be an alt used by Chris. Marvin called out NightStar2891 for writing similarly to Chris. NightStar2891 attempted to dispute by having a supposed DM conversation with Chris's CWCSonichu account, then sharing the screenshots with Howard Winslow and authorizing him to post the screenshots publicly, which he did on Kiwi Farms. Chris's ruse failed - a Kiwi Farms user noticed that NightStar2891 was registered using Chris's email address.
Chris followed the Howard Winslow account on his main CWCSonichu Twitter account a week later.[1] This enabled Marvin to give Chris information that MAGfest was planning to hold a CWC panel.[2] After MAGfest, Chris blocked Marvin's account. His block message included the phrase, "You are too much trollble".[3]
For unknown reasons, Chris re-added Howard Winslow to his Twitter follow list in 2018. On 10 May, in the midst of a temper tantrum, Chris tagged Howard and tweeted:[4]
“
AND YOU - YOU'RE LUCKY I EVEN TOLERATE YOU! I FOLLOWED YOU OUT OF MUTUAL RESPECT!
”
Marvin was a part of the Guard Dogs group, who sought to filter out harmful individuals from contacting Chris in the wake of the Idea Guys. Marvin was given access to Chris's email and social media to block weens.[5] In January 2019, Chris planned a scheme to reduce harassment against him on Twitter, and as part of it he wanted Marvin to "log in and sort out the legit from the Bugbears".[6] The following month, Chris changed his plan to creating a new account, CPU_CWCSonichu, and he again wanted Marvin to screen his followers list, describing him as an "ally" to a fan questioning the new account.[7] In December 2019, Chris commented that Marvin had blocked Jacob Sockness's Twitter account.[8]
