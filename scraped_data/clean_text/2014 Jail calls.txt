================================================================================

On 28 December 2014, an agent called the Albemarle Regional Jail in order to confirm that Chris was an inmate there following an incident at a local GameStop that occurred two days prior. According to Harvey Morris, the officer who answers the phone, they had received two prior calls that day asking about Chris. Harvey confirms that it was indeed pepper spray that Chris had sprayed the employee with, and that said employee was doing fine after the incident. The caller confirmed on CWCki Forums that the god-awful voice masking was added later.
After Chris's hearing on 29 December, another troll called the jail and was informed that Chris had been released on bail. This troll, however, did not use voice-masking.
