================================================================================

PROTIP:
This letter is - part of a series of letters- in response to someone attempting to troll Chris in jail. Don't do this.
On 19 January 2022, Chris sent an eleventh letter from jail to Kenneth Engelhardt.
Some highlights of this letter include:
Chris rants about various misinformation being spread about him online, and attempts to recruit his many followers to avenge him for this.
Throughout the letter, Chris refers to himself as two separate entities: ("Christine Chan" and the the Goddess Blue Heart)
Kenneth had sent a set of drawings that he had made to Chris, all of which can be found in the gallery.
The drawings Kenneth sent him prompts Chris to give further guidelines on what can be considered canon in Sonichu fanworks:
The fanwork cannot contain any mention of the events that happened in Chris's life from August 1st onwards unless otherwise noted.
Chris must be a character in the fanwork to some degree. If he is not the main focus, he must be at least a supporting character.
Neither Chrises can be depicted as being overweight. Even mentioning it is not allowed.
A specific piece of lore must be considered when writing the fanwork, in that both Chrises were spiritually lost in 2010 until discovering themselves in 2014 and 2017/2018.
Chris sets very specific guidelines as to how to represent both Chrises' super powers and their superforms.
The fanwork cannot make Sonichu and Rosechu siblings or related by blood.
There cannot be any "INCEST WINCEST" between characters - "Thou Gutter Brains among my followers."
All drawings/writings for the fanwork must be between TV-Y7 and TV-14 in terms of content.
If a character has no visible genitals or nipples, as they are apparently hidden behind their fur, they can be drawn without clothing, but they must have fur. Clothing is optional for Pokemon species characters.
Chris has also notably rescinded any further invitations to the Sonichu Temple, as he has not received any phone numbers from the people he wanted to regain contact with (Fiona, The WCT, and some Praetors).
Chris also specifies that Barb was actually his EARTH mother, while Emanuelle is his real mother. However, Christine Chan is not the direct daughter of Emanuelle.
Chris for some reason feels he needs to clarify that Sonichu Prime and Rosechu Prime are not Jesus, though a part of himeself has been implanted into the Pikachu and Raichu that created them both respectively. He also claims that they are not siblings.
Chris also gives guidelines on how to donate money to him until he's sent back home, again not elaborating on how he plans on doing this. (All money must been put into a PO box)

Greetings, Kenneth.
I have returned to my Body, once again, and I write personally, today, with a few messages of insights and wisdoms that as many as possible of my followers need to hear now.
Mainly, word has become conscious a heard by my Body of a number of obvious false statements, even with fake, edited, “photographs”, But my Body and I both Know better an positively certain without any doubt the true facts and the outcomes. Awaken, my followers, for these hateful faking individuals mean only to instigate fans drama, and shock, upon you all to make thou prone and easier prey for the Demons, and to be messengers in relaying these to us to instill insecurity and lack of confidence. This is and shall never be the case with I and my Body, for we know better, and we instill this Truth and Light Power unto thee all to clear the Demons away as many as possible and keep the number of Toxic Ones Left Behind Low as so or lower.
I Pray For and Bring Thee Better Lives in Neo Spirituality; Do Not let yourselves become blinded again by Demonics and Sinners.
For if thou all are not able to discern Temptations Lies and Drama from what True and Fact, Ultimately, thou all wouldst be in deep shit and troubles, indeed.
Before closing, a fire more Guidelines for y’all’s written and drawn input for the Sonichu and Rosechu Books, BUT KNOW that nothing Any and All of thee contribute in extensive stories or short stories or tidbit thoughts, to reaffirm for Everyone’s Safety, including yours, ALL not manifested from my experiences and hands as of August 1, 2021, until further personal notice, are Absolutely not Canon with This Timeline and its set of Universes within, or my Book series, until after I personally read/view these over some time after Returning with my living and Safe Immortal Body, to our Home at the Sonichu Temple. On that, in better light of confirmations, I rescend my invitation to the temple for those I have not personally talked with, with their Phone Numbers to in my phone or Address Book. That being stated”
- If I or Christine Chan are Not the central focus of thy stories, you may keep us in as Only Support or Background Characters in Active Duties and Work (She and I mainly Rest within Milliseconds of time with Full Recovery afterwards, and we both Actively meditate innately and consciously; We Are NOT Lazy)
We DO Fight our Battles, Socialize, and Diplomatically Work, Actively and Respectively
- Neither Christine Chan or I are overweight nor fat; There is Absolutely to be No Mention of either word, or Any implications thereof, in regards to us
- Christine Chan and I, respectively were spiritually lost for a time, but She has Found Himself and come around in 2010, And I have starting from 2014, and 2017/2018, and even moreso in the past couples of years, now. Keep those details in mind when writing...
...of either Christine Chan or I.
- I am the Goddess Blue Heart, complete with Goddess Form; Christine Chan is Not with God or Goddess Form, but she is Rank 3 (out of a common maximum of 5) Goddess, in general. Christine Chan has the Female Super Form (shown in “Sonichu” #11) when she Mega Evolves, or goes Super with 7 Chaos Emeralds or 7 Chaotic (S-Chu) Crystal Balls when in either her Human or Sonichu Form. I, hover, have the set typical SOnichu Mega/SUper Form, but my fur color becomes Lavender (and Brown for the back stripes and tail base and my Left Eye Orange and my Right Eye REd. I can also be in Goddess Form and Mega Evolve/Go Super, which that combination would even trump Wally/Flash’s and “Archie” Sonic’s Powers and Abilities, and then some (see the ”Death Battle” simulation of the two for more details.)
- To state Again: while Barbara is my Earth Mom, the GOD Emanuel, is, in fact, my Mother (for your reference). Christine Chan is Not a direct child of Emanuel, however and oviously Not a Jesus Christ direct.
- On that, Sonichu Prime and Rosey Rosechu Prime; Neither of them are Jesus Christ, directly, or whatnot. BUT, Divinely and Spiritually, as opposed to my Body being manifested from one of Emanuel’s Ovum that had been implanted into Barbara’s Ovary; A Piece of Myself had been implanted, respectively, into the Mother Pikachu and the Mother Raichu that gave birth to the pair of male-born Pichus that would become Sonichu and Rosey by the Chaotic Rainbow, and the collision with Super Sonic, in February, 2003 ***I tell you all Direct and True, Now, to clear this Detail up for Good:...
Neither Sonichu Prime or Rosey Rosechu Prime are in Any Form Direct Siblings or Blood-Related, and that is the same in Relations between I or Christine Chan and ANY of the individual Sonichus and Rosechus, including the pair of Primes (Sonichu and Rosey): NO Direct or Blood Relation whatsoever. The Exact Same can be stated between Emanuel and I (in Present or Past Life): Emanuel was/is my Father/Mother, but not in direct blood relations, but in Divine Spirituality. Emanuel Is my Parent as much as I am the Parent of Sonichu Prime and Rosey Rosechu Prime. So, to be blunt: THERE WAS/IS ABSOLUTELY NO “INCEST WINCEST” BETWEEN Sonichu, Rosy, Christine Chan, and I IN ANY OF THIS SEXUAL RELATIONS
Thou Gutter Brains among my followers.
And A Reminder to keep thy writings/drawings under between TV-Y7 and TV-14 Content Guidelines.
- Also, As Long As there is No Portrayl of genitals or nipples, since the species is fur-covered, anyway, ALL Clothing-Attired Sonichus and Rosechus may be drawn without clothing, but Never Without Their Fur. Clothing is optional among the individuals of the Pokemon Species.
IF thy content can’t be shown on Cartoon Network’s or Nickelodeon’s DAY Hours, ir Does Not Fly with me.
- And refer to the previous letter from my Body for additional Guidelines.
And, at present until my Body’s release from Jail safe return to the Sonichu Temple, any donations to the Inmate Account my Only be Made through Post Office Money Orders for Fastest Processing. In Other words, Go to your Local Post Office and address to me a the Jail’s address. Moneygram is Not Accepted, here.
That is All for No. I do not like to see Anyone of Food or Neutral either Fall into Toxic or Get Left Behind, so Moniter thy Choices and Actions and be conscious NOT to be temped or influenced by Demons. Keep That In Mind, Kenneth Engelhardt.
Stay Safe and Well.
Mrs. Jesus Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu, the Goddess Blue Heart, Avatar, Lord, Messiah, Savior and God of all.
