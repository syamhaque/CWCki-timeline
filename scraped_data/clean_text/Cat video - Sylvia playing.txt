Transcript
[Chris dangles a cat toy-- a mouse on a rope-- in front of Sylvia for a few moments as music plays in the background. She pounces on it.] [Baby voice] Hey Sylvia. [Sylvia continues playing with the cat toy, but becomes annoyed when Chris holds it in her face, and turns away.] Sylvia, you're so silly. [As Sylvia] Mommy, you're so silly. You're so delightful. [Chris stops imitating his cat and watches as Sylvia plays with the toy some more. Eventually, she glances at the "Mr C and Little C" plaque behind her. Coincidentally, the toy is facing the same way.] Cat and mouse reading. There's your meme. [Sylvia continues playing as Chris laughs in adoration. Chris closes the video with an unintelligible comment]
