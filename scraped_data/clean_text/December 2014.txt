On 9 December 2014, it's revealed that Chris uses this contraption for a certain purpose.
On 26 December 2014, Chris ends the year in style.
December was the twelfth and final month of 2014. At first it seemed like nothing big was going to happen beyond Chris repiercing and later removing the un-clit, moving back into 14 Branchland Court, and, of course, continuing to hate blue-colored arms. But on the day after Christmas, Chris decided to completely ignore common sense and past experience by visiting a GameStop that he was banned from and macing an employee on his way out. He was arrested and spent a weekend in jail. Sometime during this month, Son-Chu II was sold.
