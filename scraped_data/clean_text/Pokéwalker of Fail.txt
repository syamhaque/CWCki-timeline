One of the Pokéwalkers of Fail, unearthed in 2018.
All the 28-year-olds are doing it!
If it's a Pokéwalker, then why would he wear them if he isn't walking?
A Pokéwalker in real life.
The Pokéwalker of Fail is another one of Chris's relics. Pokéwalkers are best described as a Poké Ball-shaped hybrid of a pedometer and a Tamagotchi. They were originally bundled with the Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver games. Chris is using it not because he's interested in his health and wishes to monitor his exercise, but because you can place a Pokémon in the device and gain experience points for it, find items or catch more Pokémon by walking (basically, a prototype of Pokémon GO). While the item is meant to encourage exercise, Chris sports not one, but three in an attempt to triple his gains with 1/3rd of the effort. In a way, this makes Chris even more lazy.
Chris, being the artistic fellow that he is, repainted his with Sonichu's colors as an imitation of an S-Chu Ball.
It made its debut on 6 June 2010 and later appeared with him in public during the events of the Fridays After Five concert Chris attended on 18 June. Another picture of Chris on July 9th showed he owns (or owned) at least two Pokéwalkers he didn't customize. Normally, one Pokéwalker is included with HeartGold and SoulSilver, so either he bought an extra walker off the website or an extra copy of either one of the games. Most likely the second option, as you can't take more than one Pokémon from the same game out on the Pokéwalker at a time.
Chris listed one for sale in March 2018, asking $100 for the beaten-to-shit toy with crumbling CRAYOLA FUCKIN' MODEL MAGIC paint work held together with tape. A fan quickly bought it.[1]
