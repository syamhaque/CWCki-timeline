This article is still yet to be completed due to stress. We get a lot of stressful torture in our lives that makes us crash into slumber. Given that inspiration is a big variable, and we may have been lacking of it, this article will be completed as soon as possible, at our own pace... HONEST! This article is missing the following:
• Lainchu Manifesto
Their love quests are at an end...
“
At this point, I believed the excitement, the major changes, to be over. The Watchmen group had effectively been smashed, with the Knights rising to take their place. For a time, things had an air of normality again: Chris would continue rambling, and we would continue commenting on it behind the scenes. I kept running the CWCki Server, hosting events and later celebrating the server's one-year anniversary. I thought we'd be waiting a while before the next big shake-up happened.
But if there's anything predictable about Christory, it's how utterly unpredictable it truly is. And so, little did we know that this month would effectively mark the end of Christory as we knew it, and the end of the status quo we had been so used to for about a decade.
We didn't know it, but we were witnessing the Twilight of Christory.

Anaxis in the Lainchu Manifesto.[1]
The Twilight of Christory, sometimes referred to as the Twilight Saga or the Everfree Saga, is the calm before the storm of Christory. Anaxis gave this saga the name "Twilight of Christory" in the Lainchu Manifesto due to the finality of Chris's story as we know it when he got arrested under charges of incest.[1]
During this period, there appeared to be much more stability and normality both within Chris's life and the circles he was in after several hectic events. However, in the background of this seemingly calm period was something insidious. Chris repeatedly made mention of having an older "lady friend" with he had a relationship.

Collapse of the Watchmen
One of the most notable aspects of this period, and arguably the thing that kicked it off, was the decline of the Watchmen, a group that had significant influence on the CWCsphere due to their acts of gatekeeping Chris.
This collapse was a result of several cases of infighting amongst the Watchmen, as well as conflicts they've had with Praetor, things that made Chris begin to distance himself from the group. The last straw would be broken on June 2021, when Naught had doxed The WCT over conflicts surrounding WCT refusing to give Naught access to his Kiwi Farms account.
This led to The WCT confronting Naught during one of the Watchmen's movie nights, as well as The WCT convincing Chris to back away from what he deemed the "Toxic Trio", consisting of Naught, Kyle, and MKRNightVee.[2]

Bella and Fiona
Main articles: Bella and Fiona
Discluding the aformentioned "lady friend", Chris had not one, but two prominent gal-pals during this saga. These two gal-pals, Isabella Loretta Janke and Fiona Cooper were the leading figures of this period, being the two people that Chris ultimately invited to Everfree Northwest, as well as the ones that'd cause the storm to transpire as a result of their respective roles in Chris's dark secret being known to the public - Bella recorded a call with Chris admitting to the crime, and Fiona played a crucial role in it being leaked.
Bella was a fan and notorious A-log of Chris's who created a fan animation as a comission from Praetor. Afterwards, Chris talked to Bella many times, and came to view her as a potential sweetheart. Chris had mistook Bella as being a member of Praetor, and told this to the Watchmen several times. Fiona, who had a genuine crush on Chris, was originally set to meet him there. Chris recorded an audio file for her promising her he would not get angry upon seeing the rebooted My Little Pony: Make Your Mark cartoon at the convention.[3]
In July 2021, while making plans to attend the convention, Chris sought to put together a "posse" for "sharing and protection" during the convention, in response to being informed by Watchman The WCT that Jacob Sockness planned to attend in disguise[4] to meet with him.[5] On 12 July, Chris asked The WCT if he knew of anyone who could help, and WCT indicated that he did not. The following day, Chris texted Bella and assigned her to act as a bodyguard,[6] which she agreed to do.[7][8] At some point, Fiona and Chris made arrangements to met up at Everfree; Chris informed The WCT on 19 July about it (but refers to Fiona as "Fifi Vixenhart"), and asked The WCT to invite Bella and Fiona into The Knights of CWC Discord server.[9]
According to Bella, there was a "love triangle" between the trio - that Bella liked Fiona, Fiona liked Chris, and Chris liked Bella - and that this made hotel arrangements complicated as Chris wanted to room with Bella but not Fiona.[10] Bella, herself sexually attracted to Fiona,[11] had expressed desires to date her during the event. Bella claimed in the Chess club that she planned to "steal" her from Chris to "protect" her,[12] and that Chris invited Bella to be his dance partner and then invited Fiona at Bella's suggestion, though Bella intended to just dance with Fiona.[13]

Post-Incest Investigations
After the leaking of the infamous call between Chris and Bella, many onlookers tried to make sense of the chaos that ensued, and the events that led up to it.
