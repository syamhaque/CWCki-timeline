Categories: Category, Jail Letters
================================================================================

On 30 January 2022, Chris sent his second and last letter to Youtuber Bizarre Bazaar. On 2 March 2022, Bazaar uploaded a video to Youtube in which he reads the letter and comments on it.
Along with Chris's prayer to Spamton, this is the last known letter sent by Chris before he was transferred from CVRJ to Western State Hospital following his hearing on 3 February 2022. The content of the letter is almost identical to the prayer to Spamton. As with Chris's other letters from late January 2022, it is postmarked 22 February.

Hi Mike.
Enclosed is a copy of my Prayer for your reference, enjoyment, and Enlightenments, and you may share it in a video on your Youtube channel. By the time you receive this letter and Prayer, I shall have returned home to the Sonichu Temple, recorded and uploaded my vital message, with the citing of my prayer for all, and now being the safe point of no return,
as we Collectively Shift at better pace. I'll see you still safe, alive, and well on C-197 Earth.
Take Care and Be Safe and Well.
Cheers.
Mrs. Jesus Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu,
the Goddess Blue Heart, Avatar, and Lord.
Commodore me in our Brightest Hour and Moment with my Second Coming and an Epic, Genuine Spiritual Revelation, Enlightenment, and greatest of Faithful Moments for you all.
Also enclosed is a personally blessed talisman for your soul's protection from the darkness and demons.
