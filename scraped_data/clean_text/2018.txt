Chris in 2018.
2018 was the tenth year since Chris's discovery. The year was marred heavily by the influences of the Idea Guys and the Teen Troon Squad; for the former, 2018 revealed the depths of their maliciousness as the Idea Guys began systematically violating Chris's closest-held beliefs and interests, brainwashing him to the point of the three demanding Chris furnish them with money and expensive games and consoles, as well as threatening to defraud him and even report him to the FBI for being a pedophile before being torn down by The Captain and Marvin. For the Teen Troon Squad, they made Chris further detached from reality by insinuating Chris to the Dimensional Merge and taking over his Twitter account. He also attended multiple conventions this year, being kicked out of one of them for being too handsy with other visitors.

Chris in January
Main article: January 2018
After hearing of a panel dedicated to him, Chris decided to travel to Maryland to attend MAGfest. He received a warm welcome. He was still under the influence of the Idea Guys, declaring the marriage of Mewtwo and Magi-Chan and smashing a doll on camera under the belief that it was bugged by Nazis. The Idea Guy was finally doxed on January 22, revealed to be Kiwi Farms user Joshua Wise. More information was leaked about the Idea Guy, including fake news clips, audio recordings, and what appears to be unfinished works for Sonichu #16. There were also apologies to Alec Benson Leary and Michael Snyder. More of Sonichu #12-9 was uploaded. Chris also tried to sell his old Pokémon cards, ostensibly to fix Barb's teeth. After being doxed, Wise quickly fell quiet, but began doubling down on his plans; unbeknown to everyone else at this time, Wise was just one of at least four Idea Guys, who as a group had decided to begin their habitual abuse and alleged extortion of Chris.

This month mostly consisted of Chris selling items on eBay. These include a scalped ticket, bootleg Pokémon cartridges and Cole's old comics.

April

April was a surprisingly turbulent month for several reasons. As a result of brainwashing by the Idea Guys, he claimed to the public that he is now a bisexual. The Idea Guys also continued alleged extortion of him, and his need for money became even more desperate, as he made begging videos and took paid video requests again. His desperation reached its peak when he sold the Amnyfest Ring. The Captain, who bought the ring, was able to then shut down the Idea Guys.

In the aftermath of the Idea Guys saga and realizing he had been conned out of $6,000, Chris reached a breaking point, lashing out at anyone trying to interact with him and posting a video regarding the drama. Chris would then reveal his two sweethearts, Cryzel Rosechu and Magi-Chan. Later on, he would resume his work on Sonichu #12-9 to recoup his losses. Tragedy would strike in the Chandler household as Sorbet and Pollo would go MIA and die of natural causes respectively. At the end of the month, Chris would meet Copitz, where they would make a video together.

The major highlight for this month starts out with Chris displaying his anti-Pmurt sentiment for the first time in a year by uploading Down with tyranny; rally in Hawaii. Chris made a series of cryptic tweets and a video regarding a so-called "Dimensional Merge", where our universe and his imaginary universe will collide into one. At the same time, he tried to reunite with Megan, only to stop when he realized that she is armed. CWCSonichu complained about the Sonichu merch Twitter account claiming to donate its proceeds to Autism Speaks instead of him.[1] In the end, Chris would introduce Patches, a new kitten, along with two others later on.

The month started with major drama as Patches would die early in the month. Chris continued to talk about the Dimensional Merge, while in the real world his car died, he uploaded a video of himself mass debating, and contributed to Shrek Retold.
December
Main article: December 2018
Lukas, Devil and Eva, trolls who were in close contact with Chris earlier in the year, had a falling out with him after Marvin secretly doxed Lukas, and in response Lukas leaked various videos and chats involving Chris. As December drew closer to its end, Chris became more desperate as the Dimensional Merge was yet to happen. This coincided with another debt case from Midland Funding.
