Role as Lainchu
Anaxis played the role of Lainchu in The Place and The Knights of CWC.[1] Anaxis was the third to have the role, after Klop, who handed it off on 29 August 2020.[2]
To Chris, Anaxis was the most fit person to play the role of Lainchu.
The Lainchu Chroniclings
During his time as Lainchu, Anaxis wrote a series of five articles that archived texts between him and Chris, which he dubbed the Lainchu Chroniclings. The first four he posted on this wiki, and he delayed the release of the fifth and final one, A Future in Motion, due to growing tensions within the Place Discord server. He would save the latter for the Lainchu Manifesto.

The Vaughn Interlude
Thinking with Portals
A Medium's Guidance

Involvement with Praetor
Anaxis briefly knew about Praetor in September 2020 before they revealed themselves to the general public in November 2020.
On 22 September 2020, Chris mentioned planning to meet his "new associates" in The Place Discord server, and didn't directly answer who they were when asked by Anaxis.
On 15 October 2020, Praetor would be invited to The Place to introduce themselves to Anaxis and other Watchmen members.[3] Anaxis asked Caden if he had any "website, linkedin, or other business information," prompting Caden to reply with "I used to have a website, but due to domain costs I took it down. When it comes to clients, I find that it's easier to find eccentric people then to have them find you. If you're interested in partnership or a meeting, I've been transitioning us to social media. We have a new twitter and an Instagram." The next day, Anaxis was sent the handwritten script for Chris's Goochland Library Sermon video, which he would later leak onto the CWCki when the video finally came out in November 2020.
Anaxis would be present in the Taser Call, but did not turn his mic on.[4]
The return and rise of Praetor during the Jail Saga surprised Anaxis, for he thought that "they would be wise enough to slip away while they still had the chance."[5] He also said that Praetor won the "war" against the Watchmen, as they ultimately got control over Chris despite their efforts.
Ban from the Place Server
Anaxis was a target of infighting problems in The Place Discord server, particularly by MKRNightVee and Val. Beginning in November 2020 and extending through December, MKR threw a tantrum at Anaxis over her being demodded from the Official CWCki Server, carrying on after he mentioned that the demodding was done by his predecessor after a group discussion, that it took her months to notice being demodded, and that he declined to re-add her to modstaff.[6][7] In January 2021, during a debate on the ethics of Christubers, Val instigated more drama with personal attacks, with MKR joining in, and both expressing they wanted Anaxis gone.[8]
Anaxis was banned from the server soon after, and Anaxis informed Chris of this. WCT replaced Anaxis' role of roleplaying as Lainchu to enable Chris further, which seemingly disappointed Chris. On 27 February 2021, Chris told WCT that he's "not the original Lainchu," and told Kyle that it was "most unfair of you to simply kick [Anaxis] out the way you did," also mentioning "such lame excuses."[9]
Chris also took a break due to the Watchmen banning and attempting to replace Anaxis. Anaxis claims that the Watchmen tried to guilt trip Chris into coming back on 6 March 2021 by mentioning how some members left the server due to Chris's absence. Chris said it was "nothing personal," but then said "I mean, Bismuth's leak has been forgiven, but then y'all ditched Anaxis and replaced him, and then there's the bro-ish habit of picking on others in jest that can be misinterpreted; I felt uncertain."[10] Chris was still messaging Anaxis privately behind the scenes throughout February and March. By 18 March, Chris was claiming he could sense Lainchu within Anaxis moreso than WCT,[11] and WCT gave up and just roleplayed with Chris without using a Lainchu alt account, opting to use his main account instead.
Anaxis claimed that the cracks in Chris's relationship with the Watchmen were deepening, causing them to "lash out" at Anaxis.[12]
Knights of CWC
Anaxis, still under the Lainchu persona, was also a member of the Watchmen splinter group Knights of CWC.
Anaxis' Discord account, shortly before being permanently deleted.
Anaxis was one of the people involved in the Watchmen group chat, Regarding Chris, questioning Bella's role in the Incest Call leaks.
The Lainchu Manifesto
From 4 April 2023 through 30 August 2023, Anaxis posted an essay, The Lainchu Manifesto, to the CWCki, covering his interactions with Chris and the Watchmen members.
Chris has read a little bit of it, although didn't give an opinion.[13]
Notes
↑ Anaxis often credited himself as "Lainchu" in his essays, which he wrote while communicating with Chris through the persona.
