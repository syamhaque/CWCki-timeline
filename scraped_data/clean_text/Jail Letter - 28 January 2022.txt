Robert's account
On 12 April 2022. Robert uploaded to Imgur[1] his account of corresponding with Chris, including a drawing by Chris and a quote from Chris's letter.
Disclaimer: I do not support the alleged crime committed by Christopher but do believe that with positive support that Christopher can get the help that he needs to become a better person and function in society, my heart goes out to the victim of his crime and the whole entire family and Hope that the family learns to overcome this tragedy and that Barbara and her family find peace with the past and move on into the future.

I scanned the photo in at Walmart and printed a copy and also had a photo CD made, so I have a digital copy of this image, if I could find a computer with a CD drive I could upload the original image, maybe someday...
This is a copy of art sent to me by Christopher Weston Chandler aka Chris Chan in a letter from his jail on January 28th 2022, the letter itself was extremely personal in response to the letter that I had sent him and would reveal too much personal information about myself to share it in full..
I had sent him previous letters within days of him being locked up that he never responded to... In fact I actually googled the address of the local jail as I was watching him be arrested live on Ethan Ralphs live stream..
But here's a line by line transcript:
Dear Robert,
Thank you for your letter, I remember your previous letters, your letter was the first letter I received and in fact I used some of the blank pages you sent me as part of my goddess [unintelligible] I also enjoyed the graph paper you sent me,
[10 lines of redacted conversation] thank you for sharing information about your childhood, I am Jesus Christ fully reincarnated and the real ready player One, the dimensional merge will happen soon.
Goodbye,
Jesus Christ Chan Sonichu
Robert made a brief video clip showing off the drawing accompanying the letter. The video is archived below.
