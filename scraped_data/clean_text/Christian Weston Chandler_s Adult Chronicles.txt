“
And I HAVE the idea for the Video Game for myself, if I can swing that with SEGA as well, an epic tale of my tragic Adult Life straight from my tortured heart and soul. I will bring the pain to the Jerkops, I will kick Mary Lee Walsh into her cauldron to burn, as well as the other villians. And I will have support from my Electric-Hedgehogs, my mother and father, my Closest Gal-Pals who I've grown to love; Megan Schroeder and Anna McLerran to name a couple, sparingly in the game. And I will square-off in the TRULY SELF-EPIC Battle between me, and my Dark Half. I plan to have THIS GAME ALONE go Multi-Console between Nintendo Wii, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 (with downloadable content); screw the HEX-Box.
”
From An Important Update.
Probably the most unintentionally accurate depiction of how Chris views real adult life.
To encourage a developer to pick up the game, Chris made his own ad to decrease production costs.
Christian Weston Chandler's Adult Chronicles is Chris's ill-conceived, narcissistic video game idea where one plays as Chris trying to fight Jerkops to find a true sweetheart and kill Mary Lee Walsh, with Sonichu and Rosechu as useless, but determined, sidekicks. There is no available information on the genre or mechanics of the game.
Originally, Chris was determined to see Sonichu made into a game, but based on his interactions during Miyamoto Saga and in The Sonichu Chronicles, Chris seems more determined to make his own game where it's all about him and his failure to adjust to adult life... Which, ironically, would be befitting as an adaptation of his comic, which is about himself more than it is the title character.
The game is (ostensibly) currently awaiting development beyond the front cover and the advertisement, both of which in themselves break innumerable copyrights. Please note that while he wants the game published for PS2, PS3, and Wii, and it should absolutely never be made for the HEXBox. (Fans have waited to find out if the title will be redeveloped for newer generations of consoles.)
On 4 October 2017, Chris mentioned his Adult Chronicles game again in a Q&A he did for Kiwi Farms. He said:
Mm. Oh yeah, um... Adul-- The... heh. There was a video game of my adult life to be made, it would have to be something like a choice-making game like, either Life Is Strange or Gone Home. I like both of those, both of those are really good.
Strangely enough, Gone Home is not a choice-making game or at all similar to Life Is Strange; it is a mod of the survival horror game Amnesia: The Dark Descent.

Cover
In a bold decision in graphic design, the cover depicts Chris having already won his battle, staring determinedly out at an empty back yard littered with the broken iconography of his enemies. While most games presumably end in the hero overcoming his obstacles, only daring experiments in literary form (such as Awesome Possum Kicks Doctor Machino's Butt, which also sucked, but not to this extent) actually establish victory before the start button is pressed.

For a time, the Adult Chronicles illustration graced a console cover attached to Chris's original PS3. Chris preserved that cover as a "memento" after destroying the console, but then transplanted it onto a new (old, big model) PS3 that he got with your money shortly afterwards.
Shigeru Miyamoto's response to the game
(Fanmade) CWC Adult Chronicles
In June 2014, a demo was released of an actual, fan-made Adult Chronicles game; which in December was upgraded to its alpha stage. The game itself is still in the making, but needless to say, is quite high quality for a flash parody; proving, yet again, that even when purposely making something terrible in response to Chris, it can still turn out good, if not better than the original piece. The website, featuring trailers, updates, and of course, the game, can be found here. The game seems to be inspired by retro RPGs. As of now it remains under development and an official release date is still unconfirmed.
In November 2015, Chris discovered the fangame's existence. It goes without saying that he was not pleased.
The game was actively updated until late July 2021, when it was put on hiatus following the allegations that Chris had committed incest with his own mother. Progress on the game has since resumed, and a beta version was released in February 2024.
In August 2024, in a reply to a tweet announcing the release of a new update, Chris reassured everyone that he still does not approve of the game.[1]
On 14 March 2025, when asked about if he's seen the game, Chris said he has seen clips of it and added "I'm not a big fan of that. It's not accurate! It's not accurate... and plus I have no personal approval or overview- supervision of that game. Plus it's a fan-made..."[2]
Later developments
After half a decade of not mentioning the game, in July 2021, Chris claimed that "the actual game, already exists in C-197 in fully programmed media." He also complained that the fangame in this dimension consisted of "mainly interpretations and misinterpretations of my adult years post-High School Graduation from the context and lack of context available online.
