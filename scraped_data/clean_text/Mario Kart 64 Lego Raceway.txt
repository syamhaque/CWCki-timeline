Mario Kart 64 Lego Raceway is a video series featured on Chris's "Yep, I'm on TV" DVD. It was filmed using a Game Boy Camera in 1998, when Chris was still in Manchester High School.
As of February 2024, Chris still owns at least some of the items involved, showing two minifigs and a go-kart during Christ Chan Live Stream: Legos, Games and Media.

Production
The Game Boy Camera is a bulky Game Boy accessory cartridge with a camera built into it, which can be placed into a Game Boy and be used to take grainy black-and-white pictures. Afterward, these pictures can be edited in various ways; they can be drawn on, turned into sprites for a handful of minigames, be printed out with another expensive accessory called the "Game Boy Printer", or strung together to make an animation as Chris did. Using the camera and his Lego collection, Chris made a stop-motion animation of the cars racing around his Lego city and firing shells (or in this case, Star and Circle shapes) at each other, then added some appropriate music.
The Game Boy Camera can only hold thirty pictures at a time; that isn't nearly enough for even half a lap. What Chris did was take the thirty pictures, edit them appropriately, string them together into an animation, record the animation, and then repeat the process over and over. To make the sudden starting and stopping seem more "natural", Chris put a second of static at the end of each set of pictures. This didn't do anything to change how the twenty-second music clip Chris used for his animation gets more grating every time it is used.
It is impressive that Chris expended so much time and effort at such a complex and frustrating task, especially considering that years later, he would draw Sonichu comics without any planning or practice and upload YouTube videos without bothering to check them over first. Despite this, the actual animation is jerky and erratic, presumably due to the extremely low frame-per-second count (the average stop-motion production has 12 frames per second).
In the actual race videos, it's near impossible to tell what's going on, since most of the racers look exactly the same in poor quality black-and-white pictures. It doesn't help that the racing is regularly interrupted by confusing sequences where outsiders attack the racers.
The sequences also appear to have been transferred onto VHS tape at some point, as evidenced by the vertical stabilization problems, the noise at the bottom of the picture at the beginning of the first video, and the general picture quality of the video. Chris got the video on VHS by putting the Game Boy Camera into a Super Game Boy, and hooking up his SNES to a VCR to record it from there.
Although these videos apparently date to 1998, it's possible Chris got the date wrong and they actually date to 1999, as Darth Maul and Lego's accompanying Star Wars sets wouldn't be introduced until that year. A Naboo Fighter is also present in the videos, which also wouldn't be released until 1999.
Plot
Most of the video is taken up with depicting four kart races based on Mario Kart 64​. As with all of Chris's projects, the characters competing are from Chris's family, gal-pals, and characters from his favorite media series - in this case, Lego, Power Rangers, Super Mario, Dexter's Laboratory, Star Wars, a ninja and, bizarrely, "Andy Griffit". Some Pokémon show up too. Oddly enough, there is no sign of Sonic, or even Bionic the Hedgehog (who had been invented two years earlier).
However, what is very easy to tell is that even in his younger days Chris was a God-moder; in all three races in which Chris appears, he wins easily - in his second race, he even has time to fight Darth Maul and get back on his kart in time to win.
Interval sequences
Chris also spends some time in-between races describing his Power Rangers team, made up of him, Cole Smithey, Laura Dorazio, Peach, Mario and Mega Man. Unsurprisingly, Chris makes himself the leader. He also spends almost a minute (and several takes worth of animation) showing several karts combine into the KART MEGAZORD, a powerful weapon never seen since until Sonichu #9, and even then it hasn't really done anything yet.
He also supplies a tour of his Lego town, which he had not yet christened "CWCville", which features an Information Center, the Start/Finish Line, Lego Lake, Mt. Extreme, Band Stand, and Fonz's Kart Shop.
