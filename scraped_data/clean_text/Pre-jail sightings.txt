This article is still yet to be completed due to stress. We get a lot of stressful torture in our lives that makes us crash into slumber. Given that inspiration is a big variable, and we may have been lacking of it, this article will be completed as soon as possible, at our own pace... HONEST!
This article, like Chris's pickle, is a bit small. You can help CWCki by expanding it.
Since his discovery on the Internet, there have been many sightings of Chris over the years. Chris is notably not fond of people taking Bigfoot style pictures of him.[1]
