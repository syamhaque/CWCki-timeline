For Kacey
For his fourth video in the challenge, IBAChandler chose to cover "The Touch" by Stan Bush, from The Transformers: The Movie soundtrack, specifically using the 2007 re-recording of it. Ian makes no comments before or after the song, but occasionally closes his eyes, touches his heart, or raises his hand, for dramatic effect.
With moist cheeks and sniffles, at several points in the video, Ian seems close to tears and being choked up. Reportedly, this was uploaded just after an angry, berating call from Kacey (either 1.5, where she repeatedly insulted Ian's appearance as he posed as Liquid, or 3, where she confronted Ian for impersonating Liquid over the phone).
