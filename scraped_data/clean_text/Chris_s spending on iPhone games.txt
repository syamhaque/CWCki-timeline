Chris's spending on iPhone games is a CWCki Forums thread from 26 September 2013 in which user Uzumaki documented Chris's activity on the game The Simpsons: Tapped Out.[1]
Key posts
Back when the big facebook dump first occurred I added Chris to as a friend on the iPhone game Simpsons Tapped Out since he posted his username for it. I never thought he'd accept my request but he did, and every time I log in to my town Sonichu has visited it.
If you look at Chris's town, he has everything. All the buildings, all the characters, both the stuff that you have to sit there and tap all day for weeks to get during stupid events, and all the stuff you have to pay real money for (I'd have to guess at least a thousand dollars worth, but I haven't done the math). Chris has has spent the maximum amount of money you can on the game.
And that's just the game where I'm on his friends list. There are millions of shitty little money pit games on that platform, and I have no reason to believe that Simpsons Tapped Out is his only iPhone vice. It makes me wonder how much money he's spending on these things. At least when you buy a videogame you're getting the ability to play a game; all you get when you buy Rich Texan is a little drawing of Rich Texan walking around your screen.
If Chris can work into his budget hundreds of dollars to buy imaginary buildings for double imaginary Springfield, then I have to assume he'll be able to scrape together the funds to buy the PS-Q.
P.S.: I always assumed nobody cared, but if there's interest I can post a picture of Chris's Springfield.
Okay Chris's Springfield is big and the stupid game is a crashy piece of shit. Rather than frustrate myself trying to capture the whole thing, here's the nickel tour:
This is a very typical section of CWCfield: semi-organized layout with random insane crap strewn about. You can see 6 things that cost real-world money in this picture alone.
More of the same.
I love that the identical houses all still have their Christmas decorations up (this can be toggled on and off).
With the exception of the silver robot guy, every single one of the buskers on his boardwalk is a premium character that costs real money.
See the melted Simpsons family snowmen? All real-money items. The section towards the Duff stuff at the top is a glut of premium stuff, but every time I try to scroll to that area the game crashes. It's full of real-money holiday decorations and real-money Duff beer stuff.
There, now just imagine another 15 of those and you have CWCfield.
I can only estimate, but if we assume he has 100 premium items (conservative estimate) we're looking at about $1,000, but it could be more. It also depends on how he bought his donuts; I looked it up and if he bought everything at once (which I know he didn't) it would have cost him $300 if he bought the donuts in bulk. But he probably bought them in smaller denominations, meaning he's looking at $720 or $1200. That also makes the pretty big assumption that he only used donuts to buy premium items, and not to speed up construction or buy extra money.
Edit: Oh, also, this assumes that he only bought one of each premium item and, as we can see from my screenshots, he has multiples of some.
