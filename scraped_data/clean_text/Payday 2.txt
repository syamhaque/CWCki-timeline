Cover of the game.
Payday 2 is an FPS video game developed by Overkill Software and published by 505 Games in 2013. The plot and gameplay revolve around the titular Payday Gang, as they plan robberies and heists on banks, jewelry stores, warehouses and various other targets of high value. Payday: The Heist was the first game in the Payday series, and follows a similar plot. The first Idea Guy, Joshua Wise, was a fan of this series, and as a result, many of the game's plot points were brainwashed into Chris.
Chris briefly played the game at the Idea Guy's request, in which they played several matches together in a Private Server.[1] Chris would also play the game alone by his own will sometimes, before eventually abandoning it due to weens constantly joining his server to taunt him.[2][3]
List of plot points brainwashed into Chris
The Cloaker and Medic Dozer enemies from the game were featured heavily in Red Forest.
The Hardcore Henry character Akan was added to the Sonichu comic, due to him being featured in Payday 2.
When asked by Chris on Alec Benson Leary's whereabouts, Idea Guy provided a revised version of the character Bodhi's biography as an answer.[4]
The Idea Guy also convinced Chris that one of the people running for new mayor of CWCville was Bob McKendrick (a supporting character from Payday 2).[5]
