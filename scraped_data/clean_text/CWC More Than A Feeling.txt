KNOW THE DIFFERENCE
CWC More Than A Feeling is a video filmed in 2008 or early 2009 and uploaded on 29 July, depicting Solid Chris playing the Boston song "More Than a Feeling" in Guitar Hero. In short, it's over 5 minutes of him just playing with his guitar and slapping on the whammy bar. Notably, Solid's goatee is not present, suggesting the video was filmed quite some time before being made public. A careful ear might also hear that the TV plays music when Solid himself is not strumming on the guitar, suggesting that he was playing on Hard difficulty instead of Expert; even then, he still misses a fair amount of notes, which begs the question of whether he ever intended this to be impressive to anyone.

Response
The same day this video was reuploaded, Liquid Chris responded to this video by making his own version. Here, he plays with a TRUE and HONEST acoustic guitar, rather than one made of plastic.
