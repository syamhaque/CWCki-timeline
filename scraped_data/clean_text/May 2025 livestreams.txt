Jesus Christ Chan - Sonic 2006 Speed Playthrough Part 3
Jesus Christ Chan - Sonic 2006 Speed Playthrough Part 3 is a livestream done by Chris on 17 May 2025, in which he plays through the 2006 Sonic the Hedgehog game, widely regarded as one of the worst Sonic games ever made. On 12 May, Chris wrote in a Bluesky post thread that he will "host another live stream for finishing Sonic's story soon."[1] On 17 May, he then announced that the stream would be happening later in the day.[2]
Most notably, Chris briefly talked about the Saberspark drama and copyright striking Geno Samuel, and he also gave a donor a phone call during a break period, in which he was allegedly asked questions about the Dimensional Merge. Chris also reveals that he got the implants for his broken teeth done, something he had first mentioned needing back in November 2024,[3] and used to beg for money in a March 2025 livestream.[4]

30:44: A donor asks, "why copyright strike geno's animated series". Chris responds that the series was premature, claiming that "we do have a better animated series in development which will take a few years to do because animation takes time". He mentions the issues of others copying his art style without linking to Etsy or giving credit. Chris adds that he has spoken with Geno, that "we have things in the works", and that he has rescinded the strike.
