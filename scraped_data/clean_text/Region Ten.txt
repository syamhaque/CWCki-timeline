History
In November 2010, a ween created fake details of a high school reunion, listing an address which Chris realized went to a Region Ten building. Chris did not go to it.[1]
In December 2013, LoveYouLongTime suggested Chris talk with Region 10 about job placement, though Chris is not known to have replied.[2]
In September 2017, when asked in an interview about therapy, Chris listed his experiences, including recently getting help from seeing someone at Region Ten.[3]
On 9 May 2018, the Guard Dogs arranged a meeting between Chris and Rocky Shoemaker, hoping she would escort Chris to the local police to report the Idea Guys. Rocky instead wanted to take Chris to Region Ten and thought the mental health staff there would help him file the complaint. However, the lady Chris used to talk to was on maternity leave at the time and Chris didn't want to talk with anyone else.[4]
During July 2018-April 2019, for his March 2018 trespass charge, Chris was placed on the Therapeutic Docket court program and required to go to therapy at a Region Ten location. On 13 August, a fellow patient took a photo of Chris without permission while both were at a waiting room and posted it to Twitter with the caption "Who's girl is this". The next day Chris replied, "Very funny. You caught me yesterday at Region 10. I would have felt better if you said hey to me, instead of just taking a photo of me without my knowledge. But I am still me, Chris Chan."[5] During his therapy, Chris was part of the Boost support group and mentioned going on nature walks with the group.[6]
In February 2019, Chris responded to a social media push to get him on the Dr. Phil talk show. In his refusal, Chris cited that "I have been seeing a psychiatrist at Region 10, if that helps ease everyone’s minds at this time."[7]
During 2022, for his Affair with Mother offense, Chris was jailed awaiting legal proceedings and complained in Jail Letter - 29 July 2022 that the Region 10 staff was doing nothing to help him.
