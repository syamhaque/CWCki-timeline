PSA: Don’t throw your guitar like an axe while still wearing it around your neck.
”
Chris remembering the video, October 2023.
Victory Rockout (originally called Skyrim Victory.mp4) is a video leaked early in the morning of 28 August 2011 by CWCki user Dinglebear, under the YouTube account "CWCvilleProductions". In this video, Chris flails around a Guitar Hero controller while dancing to Sbeast's metal version of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim theme. Chris completely disregards both the rhythm and structure of the original song, and just screams whatever pops in his mind in a not-particularly-musical manner. It appears to be created in response to Thorg's retirement from trolling, referencing Thorg's love for The Elder Scrolls.
Chris once again complains about CWCki. He was likely taking an issue with the PS3 Tracker on the front page, which said at the time "Chris was last spotted playing Fallout: New Vegas. Chris has spent over $3,678.10 of YOUR money!" and is trying to hint that he's not spending that much money on video games. (It is worth noting that CWCki's numbers are on the conservative side.)
The video frequently skips and misses frames, which is most likely due to his PSEye being damaged (again).

Transcript
Chris kneels down and presses buttons on the PS3 controller, and the music begins. He starts furiously slapping his Guitar Hero guitar.
Eah, we got victory! [Dramatic glassess removal] I won with a victory! VICTORY OVER ALL DAMN CYBERBULLIES! Cyberbullies gonna get their kickin', BAM BAM BAM! Bam! I kicked your head in, you damn dirty bullies! [Strikes the air with his guitar controller while it's still attached to his neck] Whee!
You bullies are really, really stupid! Trolls are really, really stupid! Hey you bullies are really, really stupid! Team Rocket's stupid, you're stupid, you're stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, STUPID STUPIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIID!
HELLO, IAN! WHY IS YOUR LAST NAME BRANDON ANDERSON?!
JULAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYY!
[crows loudly like a rooster]
Victory over the trolls! Goes to the creator of the Electric Hedgehog Pokémon! Yeah! [turns around and thrusts his ass towards the camera] So you can kiss it! Kit! Kiss it! Kiss it!
And I paid ten dollars for this guitar and game combo, at a garage sale a couple weeks ago! I only paid $10 FOR Fallout: Vegas when it was on sale a previous time!
So your assumptions of what I paid for everything...
INCOREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEECT!
The CWCki's a damn lie! Ahhh....exaggerations! False implications! Naked truths and a content plague inside contents!
Never trust the CWCki no matter what! If you have questions, ask me d'personally! I will answer with honesty! All they tell you is exaggeration and LIEEESSSSSSS! Damn those internet bullies! DEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAD!
[turns off PSEye]
