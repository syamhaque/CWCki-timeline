Welcome to Cwclight is a blog post published by Chris to Cwclight on 12 September 2024. It is the very first post, published eight days before the website was officially announced and revealed.
Welcome to Cwclight
This will be my True and Honest Official Website, nothing more nothing less.
On here, you can expect details and content direct from me.
Some of which will include corrections to a good number of the pages and details that are on other Chris Chan websites and YouTube videos about me, because they went off of what I had said and written online, and what was recorded of me without my consent; a lot of the time, they did not have every detail direct from me.
And moreover newer content and updates about me, the media featuring the Sonichus and Rosechus and all, and other relating events and topics (even some that may appear to deviate from time to time).
As well as lots of other things that at the moment of writing this is not yet conscious to my Brain.
And I'll offer occasional guidance that will be more towards yours and everyone's self-improvement and well-being as individuals and as groups of good friends and partners.
Keep faith and follow that which is good and Light Powered.
