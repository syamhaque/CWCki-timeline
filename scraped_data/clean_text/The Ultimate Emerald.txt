Chris educating his stream chat about Emerald Lore.
The Ultimate Emerald is a fictional stone that was supposedly split into eight different Master Emeralds. The most notable of these eight was the Legendary Master Sunstone.
According to Chris, the Ultimate Emerald became shattered in "somewhere around 450BC", leading to the dispersal of the Master Emeralds. [1]
