Lyrics written by Christine/Christian Weston Chandler November 29, 2015.
Sonichu and Rosechu (c) 3/2000 C.W.C.
Sing Along!
It's the mighty Zapping Boom
Of the mighty Sonichu!
It's the mighty Zapping Blade
Of the mighty Rosechu!
It's the mighty flaming shoes
Of the mighty Blake Sonichu!
It's the mighty Vine Whip
Of the mighty Wild Sonichu!
It's the mighty Tidal Wave
Of the mighty Bubbles Rosechu!
It's the mighty Prayers and Grace
Of the mighty Angelica Rosechu!
It's the mighty Mach Punch
Of the mighty Punchy Sonichu!
It's the mighty Psychic Waves
Of the mighty Magi-Chan Sonichu!
And with me,
We defend the city,
From the forces of evil,
Who want to make finding True Love,
Companionship,
And sweet emotions,
Illegal!
