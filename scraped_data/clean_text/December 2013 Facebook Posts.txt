Chris's new self-pitying profile picture uploaded in December.
Friends
After uploading his new cover photo, Chris posted another self-pitying lament and tagged Sarah Bevel:

Justine Sacco's sex dream
In an attempt to "win" against his former high school gal-pals and his trolls due to his autism, Chris posted this:
23 December 2013
Hey! Justine Sacco Dreams of having Sex with an Autistic person (drunk or not; child or adult, it is all hidden desires for her conscious). So, EAT THAT, you immature brats and Immature Ex-High-School-Girl-Friends! :(P
NOTE: Justine Sacco was a PR executive for InterActive Corp, who made the news for an infamous tweet which read "Going to Africa. Hope I don't get AIDS. Just kidding. I'm white!". CNN's story on Sacco also highlighted choice Tweets by Sacco before she deleted her account, among which was this Tweet, from February 24, 2012:
"I had a sex dream about an autistic kid last night. #fml."
Chris likely read the story, saw the Tweet, and not knowing that FML is an abbrevation for "fuck my life", proceeded to brag about it on Facebook.
Chris is lost
Chris posted twice while ushering in the New Year. The first post includes a scene from the game Zelda II.
A more detailed version of the scene from Zelda II that Chris referenced.
23 December 2013
I know nothing. I am lost. My mind is a constant, zombie-like, blank. I am depressed. I am in misery. No one outside my house acknowledges me. There is no true care or love on the internet, or from anyone hiding behind their screens and monitors of any kind.
I know nothing. I am lost.
Worst Broken Heart Ever
23 December 2013
Here's to another year in this dead-end life with the worst broken heart ever.

It Gets WORSE!
On 19 December, Kellie Andes, one of Chris's former high school crushes, has seen the infamous For J-R's Eyes Only.MOV video and shares it:
17 December 2013
OMG guys it gets WORSE! I threw up a little in my mouth after watching this. If you have a weak stomach, turn back now.

Mommy's Undies
On 27 December, Sarah Bevel, another of Chris's former gal pals, posts another tidbit about Chris, this time about him wearing his mom's underwear:
27 December 2013
A "friend" sent me this. Not only does Christian like to borrow mommy's undies, but he apparently "spoons" with her as well. Just when you think you've heard it all.
