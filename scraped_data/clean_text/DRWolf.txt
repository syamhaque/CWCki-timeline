DRWolf, or Dr. Wolf, is a YouTuber who reviews and analyzes episodes of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic. He caught the attention of the Brony fandom in 2013 when his analysis videos were met with positive reception. He began creating A Moment With DRWolf, which were videos of his fursona giving therapy sessions to other characters. He has grown in the Brony community and is well known by many fans, including Christian Weston Chandler.

Chris and DRWolf
Chris did not seem to know of DRWolf until mid-2018, when the latter vlogged his experience at BronyCon 2018 (which took place in July) and there was a cameo of CWC in the background. Chris began pledging to DRWolf on Patreon in August 2018.
In October 2018, a UK release of a My Little Pony: Equestria Girls DVD had an image of DRWolf included on the back, as a mistake. EquestriaDaily posted on Twitter about it, prompting Chris to reply: "It’s Official: all MLP OCs are Canon! 😊"
On 16 February 2019, Chris uploaded A Moment With Dr Wolf Chris Chan and Greater Struggles. In a Lego video mimicking Dr. Wolf's Moment With format, Wolf (voiced by Chris) talks to Chris regarding the recent blocks on Twitter. Instead of conveying constructive advice, Chris uses the "therapy session" as a coping strategy to shift any blame away from himself.
In January 2020, Chris considered spending $105 to purchase a Meet & Greet session with DrWolf and SilverQuill at BABScon (the convention would be cancelled due to COVID-19).[1]
In March 2021, Chris tweeted about his plans to make a Workaholics Anonymous comic based on a series of My Little Pony-themed videos that DRWolf made entitled "Workaholics." Ironically enough, Chris would soon seemingly abandon these plans after only drawing a handful of panels for the short-lived comic.
Dr. Wolf in the comic
In January 2019, upset that people on Twitter were blocking him, Chris drew up a comic featuring Dr. Wolf. In the comic, Magi-chan and Dr. Wolf have a long text-wall conversation about how getting blocked on Twitter is hurting Chris, that he is getting harassed by being blocked, that people shouldn't ignore him, and that creators need to reconnect with their OCs. Chris-chan Sonichu mind-links with Magi-chan and he tells her to get tea for him. The third panel implies that the aforementioned Lego video is a follow-up to this comic.
Dr. Wolf and his real-life counterpart would later appear as cameos for Sonichu 14, demonstrating the effect of the Dimensional Merge.
