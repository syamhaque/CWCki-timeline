================================================================================

Vanessa AIM Chat 3 is the third chat between Chris and Joshua Martinez, an old acquaintance pretending to be Vanessa Hudgens. It took place on 16 April 2009.
Summary
This chat opens with Vanessa asking about Chris crashing into slumber over Blanca. Chris at first claims not to remember who she was, but then misremembers her as the now-deceased PandaHalo. He fails to show any qualms about her death. Vanessa asks about Chris's childhood, and he talks about puncturing three incarnations of Officer Nasty with his duck. Chris admits putting things up his ass in the past, but now restricts it to jets of water. He tries to play down their cyber session, saying that while he was typing Vanessa, he was shouting Ivy. He manages to resist her clumsy temptations and she changes the subject to Sarah Hammer and Megan. The chat ends with Chris trying to make a McDonalds date with her.
Transcript
Joshua (11:54:38 PM): so i know you told me alittle abit of Ivy but the video of you on youtube of you laying down crying and some girl broke up with you
Joshua (11:54:44 PM): who was the girl?
ChrisChanSonichu (11:55:33 PM): That was MONTHS Ago. and I do not remember that "girl", but "she" was a troll anyway.
ChrisChanSonichu (11:57:07 PM): I think I remember now, yes. that was Sarah Cassandra McKenzie; not a troll. An australian girl, but she was a victim of the recent bushfires.
Joshua (11:57:13 PM): i need too know little more info about your child hood bc wanny use it for the movie
Joshua (11:57:24 PM): oh
ChrisChanSonichu (11:59:26 PM): If I understood the scenario, I can offer a proper piece of my childhood from memory for the movie. A blow-up female sex doll, which came with a plastic, removable police outfit.
ChrisChanSonichu (12:01:37 AM): In my adult life, I have gone through a number of female sex dolls. After a while of putting my weight carefully on them in the artificial intercourse, they each would have a hole punctured on the inside from my weight, which was irrepairable.
ChrisChanSonichu (12:01:54 AM): I think I've been through 3 of the "Officer Nasty" dolls.
ChrisChanSonichu (12:02:20 AM): you can look up that, and other, sex dolls on http://www.adameve.com
ChrisChanSonichu (12:02:44 AM): and with a minimum 17 dollar purchase, they offer a free gift.
Joshua (12:02:46 AM): do you trust me?
ChrisChanSonichu (12:02:57 AM): yes, Vanessa, I trust you
Joshua (12:03:39 AM): do you put things in ur ass? if you do its kinda turn's me on
ChrisChanSonichu (12:04:06 AM): I did for a short time, but I found it uncomfortable for me, so I don't do that anymore.
Joshua (12:04:23 AM): comeon baby you still do it plzz tell me honey
ChrisChanSonichu (12:05:04 AM): sometimes with a narrow jet of water from my adjustable shower-head on a hose.

ChrisChanSonichu (12:30:41 AM): Joshua told me recently that she was employed, but I forget where.
Joshua (12:30:44 AM): how did you get fired from ur job selling knives?
ChrisChanSonichu (12:31:58 AM): that was when I worked as a Cutco salesman. I did not get fired; my boss got replaced, then I did not know what to do with any future business transactions from that summer job, so I quit.

ChrisChanSonichu (12:35:13 AM): a crush I had my eye on for the two years we were in personal touch. But she felt no lovey emotions for me, and last June, I got kicked out of The Game Place by that bastard, Michael Snyder; he hated my guts.
ChrisChanSonichu (12:35:57 AM): I'll e-mail you the lyrics after I've found my hand-written lyric sheet.
ChrisChanSonichu (12:36:11 AM): because it would take a while to type them up, and I can't remember them all off the top of my head.
