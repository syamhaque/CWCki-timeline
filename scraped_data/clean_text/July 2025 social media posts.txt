I've seen this image before; it's good, but I'm uncertain if the image in the mirror is the same as years ago when I saw this image.

Homunculus
@CPU_CWCSonichu I have a question about Sonees and Rosees: since Rosechu is a Raichu, does that imply that giving Sonichu a thunder stone would make a Rosechu, or is there a male version of their Final Evolution?
Chris
No

In honor of Peter Cullen’s 84th birthday, what’s your favorite character from the voice actor?
How about an obscure one amidst the Renegades? A Stallion of a different colour. #Gobots #Transformers

Although, Jupiter Juggernaut, I do recall from Super George's one adventure. None top Optimus, Eeyore or Ironhide in #PeterCullen's repitoire.⚡️💙⚡️

That colour scheme makes Small Foot look like her Shattered Glass self-counterparts.
