Mary Poppins is a 1964 Disney movie starring Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke that is highly regarded as a classic of children's and musical cinema. It is also the favorite film of Christian Weston Chandler, who has made references to the film several times in his usual context-eschewing style.
His extreme zeal for "women's rights" likely comes from the character Mrs. Banks, the mother of Jane & Michael. As the story is set in England in the "spring of 1910" (although Emmeline Pankhurst's second arrest of 1909 was mentioned in an earlier song), women do not yet have the right to vote. She sang the second song of the film, "Sister Suffragette", and she made numerous references to the movement after that.
Mrs. Banks and her friends were depicted as struggling for the greater cause of being treated as an equal, with the same rights and treatment. But Chris, seeing Mrs. Banks speak fondly of all the shock value acts the protestors did (e.g. throwing rotten eggs at the prime minister), decided to take it to the only logical conclusion he could come up with: stripping and fucking.

But Thank God and Jesus, my Guardian Angel from the other side of the world found me. She, a Good, Loyal, Honest Sonichu & Rosechu fan, got my YouTube and Facebook accounts for me, and, she was a real big help and the "Spoon full of sugar" I needed to "help the medicine go down"
”

Early in his e-mail conversations with Blanca, Chris mentioned that Mary Poppins is his favorite movie.
In the 25 September 2008 update to the OFFICIAL Sonichu & Rosechu Blog, Chris referred to PandaHalo as a "spoonful of sugar" (and felt the need to point out exactly where the reference came from).
In the For My Sweetest Ivy video, Chris sang a riff on Bert's musical number "Jolly Holiday." He sang it again in A CWC Audition, and did a Julie-themed version in BlueSpike Skype Logs 10.
During Mumble 2, Clyde Cash and other trolls drew Chris out on his love of the movie, and then made fun of him at length.
While talking to Julie in Mumble 3, he suggested that if she didn't know what to say, she could say "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious."
In Mailbag 54, Chris used "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" as an example of his substantial vocabulary.
In Chris's 2010-vintage The HooK Café personal ad, when asked for a line from his favorite movie, he answered with "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious."
Likewise, in his Book of Matches profile, he cites Mary Poppins as his favorite movie, and his Match.com profile mentions that it's one of his favorite things.
In his MyBUZZ! quiz about himself, the second question is "Which is his favorite movie of all time?" and the answer is "Mary Poppins."
Chris has been known to use "What is your favorite movie?" as a security question protecting the passwords to some of his websites and user accounts. The answer, invariably, is "Mary Poppins," which for a time made life easy for trolls looking to hack Chris's accounts.
Chris performs a horribly mangled version of "Step in Time" in his video I like Mary Poppins.
Chris's first Facebook post in November 2014 is a bit from "Step in Time", connecting to him voting for Election Day.

Mary Poppins in the comic
In Episode 17, Rosechu breaks into the "Votes For Women" segment of the song "Step In Time".
In Episode 20, Sonichu references Mary Poppins directly, but as he forgets to use a verb, it sounds less like a proposal for a nice evening with the family and more like pedofork/guro horror. ("Let's [...] head home for dinner and "Mary Poppins" with our children!").
In the special episode from Sonichu #11, "A Sonichu Christmas," Sonichu uses Mary Poppins's "Chim Chim Cheroo" magic trick to fly up the chimney.
