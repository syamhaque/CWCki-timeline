For G4s Web Soup is a video uploaded by Chris on 2 July 2009.
Chris found out that one of his videos was used on Web Soup. Thinking this was meant to be a respectful tribute making him appear as a respectable person, he promotes himself to the real TRUE and HONEST ladies in Charlottesville and Ruckersville area. Only a few days after uploading, Chris took the video down, perhaps after realizing that Web Soup is, in fact, a show dedicated to making fun of people on the internet like himself, and that the episode featuring him showcased his Tard Rage.
Crickets are heard chirping in the background, maybe due to how hilariously pathetic that Chris is being in this video.

But anyway, ah, ladies in Char--real true honest ladies in Charlottesville area, Ruckersville, with uh, with a subscri--who can watch G4, if any of them are watching this, I'm currently still single and looking, so yeah, like y'know call me on my cell phone if you can find it, or find me in person in Charlottesville.
