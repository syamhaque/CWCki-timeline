Title: My Coke Rewards

Chris, the closet telenovela fan. Who'd'a thunk it?
My Coke Rewards was a loyalty program that rewarded frequent drinkers of Coca-Cola brands with various products, operated from 20 February 2006 to 30 June 2017. Considering Chris's diet and eating habits, it's no surprise he'd be a frequent user of the website, although it remains unknown if he still used it by the time it shut down.
Chris had 8,000 points, enough to buy the most valuable prizes available through the program four times over.

Chris's rewards
In return for his prodigious consumption of caramel coloring and high fructose corn syrup, Chris has picked up a wide variety of prizes through the My Coke Rewards program. His choices include $50 in gift certificates for Simon Malls (the company that owns and operates Charlottesville Fashion Square), five free game and movie rentals from Blockbuster, and 40 free song downloads and one free album download from Napster, then Rhapsody. This possibly goes some way to explaining why he downloads all his music legally, instead of treating copyright with his usual contempt.
He also acquired a "30+ Minute Downloadable Motivational Workout Music Mix", which probably went unused.
