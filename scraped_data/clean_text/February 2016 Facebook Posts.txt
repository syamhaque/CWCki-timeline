The Prequel to the Begging
1 February 2016
Preface for the Above Post from this one: I have ended my embargos on GameStop, Best Buy and Simon Malls, because nothing has come at all from that.
GIMME STUFF FOR MY BIRTHDAY
1 February 2016
Also, My birthday is coming up later this month, and I would like a PlayStation 4 console, with a PS4 Camera. So, I am extending an offer: The FIRST Person who purchases and sends me one, and I receive it Before or On February 24, 2016, I Will make and issue to the person a Big Voucher for $500 off on Cwcville Shopping. Which is equal to Ten Sonichu/Rosechu family Figures (more or less, depending on which ones), so all the person needs to pay on that order is the Shipping, and that order will definitely take up to Eight weeks for material figure acquiring, creations and certification. The Console AND Camera MUST be purchased from a Store Website, such as Amazon, Best Buy or GameStop. And I will be able to tell from the printed receipt and papers enclosed with the goods there. So, definitely NO funny business.
As the Amazon Wish List is a definite fickle, because the list disappears as quick as I make it, I am posting recommended Links onto this post. As well as a few additional pieces for the PS4 I would like (Should they be included as well, I will add their value, as depicted on their receipt, onto the Voucher).
Private Message me if you need my address, but it's pretty well-known by now.
Thank You. :)
Chris included a bunch of links for websites selling PS4s, including GameStop, which he ended his "embargo" the day before. It is not the first time that Chris stopped doing something against a company just so that he could buy new vidya game related stuff.

Emotions
9 February 2016
I'm feeling off and mildly dizzy.
Not Dizzy Enough To Beg For PS4!
11 February 2016
I feel better today, and I will be making medallions today as well. I sent out a lot of books yesterday.
Also, just a reminder of my upcoming birthday on the 24th, as well as my offer for sending me a Destiny PS4 Bundle with a PS4 Camera and whatnot (see post below). I Must receive the console BEFORE the 24th, for the sender to receive the voucher to Cwcville Shopping, please.
If that is too much, the Wish List of Lego Sets in the Album on my Facebook here is still valid, but I am also looking for a few choice Vita Software Game cards to move the save data to, and clear space on my Vita's Memory. Suggested links from my GameStop Wish List are in this post.
Thank you all; have a great and safe day. :)
A Beg Big Note
11 February 2016
Just a Big Note that I feel must be understood: In Order for you to get the full $500 shop Voucher, should you send me the PS4 Destiny Bundle, the PS4 Camera, And a 1 TB Internal SATA Hard Drive, I require, Minimum, the PS4 Destiny Console Bundle AND the PS4 Camera, MINIMUM. Sending anything less than that, or a PreOwned PS4 Console alone, Will Reduce the value of the Voucher you receive down to that amount. AND the Console Must be New and Mint In Box. The gift must also be received no later than February 24, 2016, and no cheating, please.
Thank you. And have a great and safe day. :)
Chris's Logic: If You Have Money, Clearly You Can Spend It On Me
12 February 2016
***Listen, Everyone.***
I understand that some of the responses from my offer was mixed, counting the unconfirmable feelings of the haters. I have made a simple offer of My Time and Work to make some figures, or a combination of that and commission(s), medallion(s), book(s) and such, as offered on my shop; for a (white Destiny Bundle) PS4 Console with its camera. And Not only that, but Higher in value and retail of the console and camera combined. PLUS, to add more time and work for anything in addition to that in the same delivery. Alright? I Felt it was a fair cop, plus the person would get the better half of the deal.
I never said "EVERYONE, send me a console"; ONE Person to send the One console and camera is ALL. I am NOT the U.S. Air Force that needed over a Hundred Thousand PlayStations for their Super Computer. And I never requested for More than ONE. ONE PlayStation 4, with PS4 Camera, is all I requested, and is all I need. I do not like being left behind in tech, like the rest of you all.
Also, WHO in this world, WITH a Modern Touch Screen Phone, at least, Never felt even tempted to spend on APPS in their respective mobile stores?
AND, PC & Console Gamers, WHO, amongst you lot have NOT spent less than a hundred dollars on your NEW computer upgrades, software and apps, EVEN into the Thousands?
I should Not be Judged by Theoretical and Presumptuous prices of various game discs and downloads, when we ALL Know damn well they can be purchased Secondhand, and EVEN amongst them are Free to Play as a PSPlus or XBox Live Member, as well as Streamed through services like PSNow. And you all who have spent at least One Dollar on your App and Game Stores; you all are no more guilty than I am. I do not judge any of you all for spending on what you want; we each have our own wants and needs respectively.
So, when you look at my generous offer, Empathize and Put Yourself into My Situation: NOT Rich, Want to get back into the game, Require the New Hardware when support for the old is fading over time; what can you do? You look to trade for, Or up to, the new tech; reaching out towards other people for the help. And That is what I am doing and offering. Alright?
Thank you. Have a good and safe day.

Bleeding Autism
15 February 2016
Also, in regards to the PS4 Offer, I have received a note as to why this was met with mixed results, and I quote,
"OK, I just wanted to let you know that the reason people are hesitating to send you a PS4 is because they think you won't deliver on your promise about the voucher.
Look what happened when someone donated $1,000 for more Sonichu pages. You took the money, and it's been like six months since then, and there's no new pages!
A lot of artists get free gifts from their fans because they produce good content on time. People like your comic, but they hate that you take forever to create new pages.
That's why they're calling you greedy and selfish. They think you'll forget all about the voucher if you get the PS4.
You've gotta keep your fans happy before they'll think about making you happy with free gifts."
I will not forget the voucher, I Promise That. The reason I have been unable to draw pages as quick, is due to a number of life and personal reasons. Among which, while I DID have a plan for the routine of drawing pages nearly every other week initially in between weeks of working on medallions and all that, I have been unable to get that routine successfully habitual and set. The reasons are between my Emotions and Mood; I have to be in the right mind set in order to draw and create. Between my ADD, from the bleeding autism, and the stresses of life, including finances and keeping the household above water with the sales and keeping up with the orders, plus the publisher problem last December having weighed me down not helping either, not to mention my Fickle Internal Clock changing my sleep schedule from being a Day Person into a Night Person, and back and forth over and again... It gets frustrating to me. And that is why I needed the time to recover.
I am most able to create and issue the voucher most quickly, and hardly the creativity is required for that as well. AND, I Promise I Will be most able to Hold my end of the deal of what the sender of the console and camera redeems the voucher for from my shop. So, I can most definitely Promise that I Will hold my half of the deal after receiving the console and camera, and anything else added in that deal; No Problem.
Socializing
20 February 2016
I am watching ‪#‎PawnStars‬ and ‪#‎RickHarrison‬ in the beginning of Season 9, Episode 16, state how I Really Fell about Online Social Media, that I could not have said better, and I quote,
"Technology is great and everything, but I think everyone has lost all of their social skills; it Is More Socialable (and Better) talking to them Face to Face or on the phone."
And I do see that happen all around me when I am out and about; nearly Everyone is glued their bleeding faces onto their phones, tablets, and whatever; NOT really looking at other people or talking much. And regardless of me being more introverted, I really would appreciate the Past Common Courtesy of Face to Face Greeting in General; Not Just at a register or while at work.
Is That TOO much to ask nowadays?
PSP ads
22 February 2016
I liked the PSP ads, Including all of the Dustball ads. But the song in this, along with the other two with the same song, ad really resonates well. Does anyone know the name and artist of the track? Please comment.
Chris included a link to an old PSP ad on YouTube.
PSP ads 2
22 February 2016
‎PSP‬, and ‪#‎PSVita‬; they're like carpet, a nut, and cheese, you can watch, play with, and listen to Outside.
smile emoticon
Actually, I can do that better:
"Heeey, Sleepyhead! We're gonna play outside. Wanna come?"
"I can't. I'm watching Dreams."
"Aaaaaugh! But there's Portable Dreams!"
"You've got to be kidding."
"Hey! Have you ever heard of Dreamgal Wavey?"
"Not Really."
"Well then, Believe me when I tell you that there's ‪#‎Dreams‬ you can watch and play Outside."
"PSP and PSVita; they're like Dreams you can watch, play and listen Outside."

Life problems
23 February 2016
I sent out a lot of medallions today. Right now, though, I am feeling meh. I woke up with a spot of UTI, and I think there is a spec of dirt in my right eye, because it has been bothering me the whole day whenever I close my eyelid. And then, there's the usual other life problems that a lot of people have, counting all of them that care take the elderly. I'm feeling old too. Just life.

Lowering standards
26 February 2016
I am lowering the standards a bit on the USA PS4 console. I Still Require it New In Box, and the Bundle Deal definitely makes me feel better on getting everything I need on setup. I still require a console with at Least a 500GB Hard Drive, Initially. And it Has To Be NEW and Mint in Box. It does not have to be the Destiny bundle. I will accept the standard black. No Imported Consoles. I only need One PS4 Console.
Or, I'll tell you what: Purchase a $400 GameStop.com E-Gift Card and have it emailed to me at ChrisChanSonichu@aol.com, and I will make and email back the $500 Cwcville Shopping Voucher. You can't beat that: an easy reimbursement, plus $100, in Sonichu and Rosechu Figures and Merchandise.
Offer Ends on March 5, 2016.
Update 2/25/2016
28 February 2016
Accidentally deleted original video; my bad.

Not a mind reader
29 February 2016
I have a short announcement I feel need to get off of my breasts about the PS4 for Cwcville Shopping store credit on the voucher, alright? I Wish I could offer something Unique for a PS4, but the facts are, aside from new book pages, I am Not Psychic or a Mind-Reader. I offered the Voucher, because THEN, depending on what the person wants to choose from the store, That is Unique, as he/she can get the specific figures they want, and/or books, and/or medallion(s), commissions; whatever. I feel just flabbergasted and disappointed in that those of you all who do not understand and appreciate, fully, the opportunity to have such a unique shopping experience that I can offer, for a give-or-take about $100(+ or -) difference. OMG!
