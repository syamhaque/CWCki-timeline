================================================================================

The City of Cwicville Tour! is a stop-motion Game Boy Camera video made in a similar fashion to Mario Kart 64 Lego Raceway.
In this old look at Chris's make-believe happy place, we'll see that, early on, Chris hadn't settled on the proper spelling of "CWCville" yet, so in the name of artistic experimentation (or just overall sloppiness), he tries two different spellings of the name.
Most people will undoubtedly find all this cleverness (or lack thereof) quite breathtaking, considering the video is less than one minute in length. Although we do not, in fact, get to "meet the people" or "have lots of fun", we do technically get to "see the sites", plural, since we manage to pass two whole landmarks before the video abruptly ends. The Game Boy Camera can only hold 30 photos at a time, most likely the reasoning behind the sudden end.
