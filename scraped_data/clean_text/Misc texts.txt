Name change question
September 2014[1]
Christian, have you considered going by the name "Christina" now that you are a tomgirl? It's all the same letters as Christian, and it suits you. I think you look like a Christina!
Take care.
Valid Questions. Please relay that I have no plans on changing my name, and I am very comfortable being referred to by either pronoun (being mistaken or referred to as a woman flatters me good, though).

Not Norman Bates
16 October 2015[2]
I notice that one of your Amiibo figures is of your mother. In court today you were reportedly acting pretty intimate with her, holding her hand and rubbing her shoulders. Are you two sleeping in the same bed?
NO.
Not anymore, you mean?
Look, I was nervous and anxious for my time there to be over-with. And my mother looked nervous too. What I did was only to make us feel secure and less nervous. No intimacy. I am not a "Bates". OMG.
Claiming torn ligaments
12 May 2016[3]
In a message to a complaining customer on Etsy, Chris claims he had torn ligaments in his knee as an excuse for why he failed to deliver a paid video request. Note that Chris was exaggerating, as he was able to walk fine in the Proposition to Sega video filmed two days later.
I am very sorry about the delay. I, personally, have been under a lot of anxiety and stress the past few months, and I am still catching up on orders. And the past week was rough on me with having accidentally tearing ligaments in my left knee; that is recovering. And I have been having to cope with sleep troubles and fickle internal clock schedules the latter of the time. Anyhow, for this matter, I will issue a refund for this mistake shortly.
Anti-Pmurt
3 November 2016[4]
Hey Christine, could you give me some reasons why to vote for Hillary?
You have Got to be kidding! Trump is most Immature, Uncouth, and Not Valid to be president. Trump will ONLY make the Country go BROKE, as Groening predicted, and ALL the money will ONLY go to his own debtors and the Fat Cat Rich People, and Hardly ANY for us in the middle class and below. Not to mention he is Anti-LGBTQ, Anti-Immigrants, he puts down Women VERY BAD, and he is an all-around Bad Person.
Hillary will Tax the Fat Cats and fill the middle class and lower and get the country less in debt. And She is PRO-LGBTQ and Immigrants, AND She is more beneficial for EVERYONE in General. AND, this country is long Overdue for a Woman's touch.
You should Watch ALL Three Debates On YouTube. I'll send you the links in chronological Order.
Asking Chris to sell the Sonic Totem
6 April 2017[5]
Kiwi Farms user Buck Mullet texted Chris to suggest selling him the Sonic Totem as a joke.
Need $1000? Sell me the Sonic Totem.
Sure! Send me the money via PayPal to my phone number here, then I will get your address and FedEx the totem to you asap.

Afterwards, Chris listed the Totem on eBay where it was purchased by 4chan user ashuraglitch.
Fake Doopie profile
The fake profile.
On 21 July 2017, a ween made a fake Doopie Facebook account in order to befriend Chris and get a rise out of him.
Two days later, Chris had fallen for the ween and accepted a friend request. However, the account was disabled the same day, though a new one was created, which he also accepted a friend request from. He later contacted the real Doopie, who confirmed it wasn't real.
The ween revealed his actions and Chris's response on Kiwi Farms, under the username "TheDoopieTroll", and was promptly banned.
The Jig is Up! I have been long suspicious of the Facebook account, but I went along for the possibility of it being real. Then the first deletion from Facebook by others' flagging. And the birth dates did not match between your first and second profile trials. And then you said your email was from @mail.com. I offered a benefit, since you might have missed typing the "g". And the Big Flag, actual email from your @mail.com address. I had received actual email from the real Doopie before from her actual address. I emailed her and checked, she responded "No" to making a Facebook Profile Page.
Your Game IS Over Trollish Impostor! Consider yourself Blocked. Good day.

Sorbet deceased
25 October 2018[6]
Hey, is Sorbet okay? I've been worried about him.
Sorbet never came back; he had died. And it was confirmed that his soul merged with his counterpart in C-197, and thus, became anthropologic after the soul fusion, because I got to see and meet Sorbet as the anthropological cat he has been since. It's a common thing.
Oh, I see. I'm sorry to hear he passed away. He was a really cute cat, but it's good he's in a better place now.
CPU_CWCSonichu
12 February 2019[7]
[posts an image of CPU_CWCSonichu's Twitter account]
I think someone is impersonating you again
Nope, that is actually me.
I Am moving out of this Twitter into a new one I created, @CPU_CWCSonichu. New and renewed followers will all be screened by my ally, as to keep out the Haters and Harassers.
Starting it up fresh and new.
Jumping The Shark from old to new.
Thinking of selling bath water
9 July 2019
SonichuMerch, a troll, suggested to Chris selling his bath water[8].
In light of your suggestion, I might work with you in selling and distributing the bath water. My eBay is still not letting me relist or make new listings, so if you list it on your store, Tweet the link, and I'll retweet it; you PayPal to me the shipping and my part of the money out of the sales. What do you say?
I'll jar, label, and ship them out, based on the number sold.
SonichuMerch declined the deal.
Text from Enabler
14 August 2020
Reported by Naught in the cwc frens server:
Naught (giving context)
At the moment, I awoke to this bunch of text from this number [redacted]; I am wary and cautious.[9]
Transcription, sender's messages are in orange:
The sender
Good day Sonichu. I ponder if that is who controls the body whom I am contacting
I come to you on a time string of past and present, future and beyond. All possibilities therein in all dimensions.
It is Prudent that I, or we, rather, speak to Sonichu or the Goddess Herself, Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu
Chris (as Sonichu)
This is Sonichu, still in Christine Chandler's body; talk.
March 2021 fender bender
4 April 2021
A fan texted Chris to ask about his fender bender to his car after photos surfaced of the damage.[10]
What happened to your can Christine? Are you okay? Does the van needs to be fixed?
Ah. I see my van's status, and I as well, have been discovered and observed yet again.
I shall share with you the short version of the show so far, and you may relay it to others as you feel well to do.
I backed up into the tail end of a big rig's trailer last Sunday; dented the center point of the trunk door and smashed the rear window. We have been blessed with funds to cover replacing the door at a local body shop.
It would be very nice if we were to have a second car in this universe once again, but with eh? credit scores between my mom and I, we would do very well with 20,000 to buy said new or secondhand car of modern up-to-date standards and tech.
That is all I will share with you in response to your inquiry, my friend. I am most humbled and grateful for your concern.
You have a lovely Easter Sunday, with great blessings that you have earned for yourself in your respective situation. Lots of love.
Remove G5 demand
1 March 2024[11]
Chris sent the following DM to a Twitter AI artist of My Little Pony.
I will give you a follow back, but I ask you to please remove everything MLP G5 from your social media and stop acknowledging it, as it is Literally and confirmed to be Russian Licensed Propaganda.
The account itself, @SunTwiZX[12], has a variety of questionable AI art of My Little Pony characters, and has a NSFW alt account[13] which has an animation of Spike and Sweetie Belle engaging in certain activities pinned to the profile, in addition to all of the AI art.
