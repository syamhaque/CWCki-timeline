Happy Anniversary Fraun and James (original)
Happy Anniversary Fraun and James, originally titled "Happy Anniversary Fraun and Jessie" is a paid request Chris made, telling two Patreon supporters to have a happy anniversary. Chris did this a year prior for the same people.[1] Presumably getting a complaint from the two customers most likely due to customers taking issue with him saying the wrong name twice (Jessie instead of James), he changed the title of the video to "Happy Anniversary Fraun and James", then later deleting the video and recorded a new version the next day.
