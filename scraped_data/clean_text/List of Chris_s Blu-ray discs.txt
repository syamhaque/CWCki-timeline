YOUR TAX DOLLARS AT WORK!The contents of this page have been bought with taxpayer money!
A new version of the spreadsheet listing Chris's video game collection, leaked late in March 2010, also includes an accounting of his Blu-ray movie collection. The list is replicated below, leaving out some of the extra details from the spreadsheet (Chris also made note of each movie's MPAA rating, studio of origin, the number of discs in each package, and whether a disc included BD-Live features).
Most of the items on the list are fairly predictable, including titles like Disney and DreamWorks movies as well as comedies. Richard Linklater's A Scanner Darkly pops up again here, though, which comes as a bit of a surprise. Postmodern science fiction wouldn't seem to be his thing, but apparently Chris liked it enough that he had to have both the Blu-ray version and the digital version he downloaded through the PlayStation Network. (This might be due to it being an animated movie, albeit one using CGI rotoscoping.)
