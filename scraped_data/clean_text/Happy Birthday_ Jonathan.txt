Happy Birthday, Jonathan is a video Chris made on the 11th of June, 2016. In the video, Chris congratulates Jonathan for his birthday, then starts making unintelligible gibberish. After that, Chris ends the video with a second "Happy birthday!" Chris believes it to be another performance worth $50, even though it failed to meet the meager promise of a minute-long video.
According to a Kiwi Farms user named Vanillacone, who had bought the performance for a friend's birthday, Chris failed to spell the recipient's name (Johnathon) right. Regardless, Vanillacone claimed to be satisfied with the video, saying it was "money well spent."[1]
