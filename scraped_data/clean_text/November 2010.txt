================================================================================

On 11 November, Chris was spotted at a Kroger supermarket.
November was the penultimate month of 2010. It saw the Jackie saga ongoing, with Chris's activity throughout the month generally consisting of e-mail exchanges with her. His relationship with Jackie went into a very rocky direction; she became sick of his laziness, hypocrisy, and unwillingness to do things she wanted him to do, and would frequently chew him out over this. It got to the point where not even her threatening to go back to her old boyfriend Lars, and then having the two engage in a (surprisingly civil) phone call, would make Chris change his behavior, and at the end of the month, their relationship would end (for now).
Also at the end of the month, Chris made yet another claim to leave the Internet, FOREVER..... sort of. He would still continue logging into YouTube and playing games online, but he would not upload anything new himself until almost a full year later.
A Manchester High School reunion also took place this month. Chris, however, did not attend.
