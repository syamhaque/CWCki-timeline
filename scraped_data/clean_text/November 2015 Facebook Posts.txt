3 November 2015
Skipping the obvious Whys and Reasons, I wanted to make certain all honest inquiries in response do attach a most current photo of yourselves onto the email. The address to respond to is Anightinchristine@gmail.com.
Thank you, ladies. [wink emoji]
¡Santo Dios!
6 November 2015
¿Cuantos Cacahuetes?
¡Muchos Cacahuetes!
I will be seeing The Peanuts Movie today. Who else will be enjoying the nostalgic antics of Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Woodstock, Sally, Lucy, Linus, Peppermint Patty, Marcy, and the rest with me?
Thank You, Charles Schultz; your family of characters are still alive and having fun today.
:) feeling happy
Watermelon asked:
Which movie? The great pumpkin movie? Or that summer camp movie?
Chris replied:
The one that was just put into the theaters yesterday.
Now the Review
7 November 2015
I really enjoyed and liked the movie. It has a lots of great nods and references to the past comic panels and animated shows and movies. Charles Schultz would be really proud of the story in the movie. Charlie Brown got to see great emotional growth and progress. Even Heather, the little red-head girl, appreciated the good person Charlie Brown is. And Snoopy was fun to watch as well with his antics, and the revived Red Baron fight. Also, I do recommend staying through the credits for the comic panels, and the surprise finales during and After the credits.
Go, and Enjoy The Peanuts Movie. :)

The Amiibo Just Keep Coming
On 7 November, Chris posted seven photos of new Amiibo offerings. The following day he provided links to the Etsy listings.
Cera
Christine
Robbie
Jerkops
Simonla
Silvana
Borb and offspring
Wave 2 Almost Complete
8 November 2015
Cool; nearly all of the Wave 2 Figures are up now. I still have drawings to make and design the package cards for each of these figures. I will update the default photo for each figure's and each figure pack's listings with those fresh photographs soon.
Jerkop Amiibo
10 November 2015
Among ALL of the variations of the Jerkops and Janekops (by Gender, Skin Tone, Uniform Color, and Fighter Type), I have created a Package Card Front for Each of Every of them. Hair color does not have to match between the package and the figure/saved Mii. Here are just a handful of the created card fronts out of approximately 36 variations. The backs of each will be the same, regardless of the front.

Package Card Update
Autism Amiibo.
10 November 2015
All recent figures each now all have their respective package cards. Check them out on Cwcville Shopping.
http://www.etsy.com/shop/CwcvilleShopping/
Waterman asked about the appearance of the autism Amiibo:
Why does it have a gray band aid on its head?
Chris answered:
Black headband with silver front buckle, matching to the one optional accessory within SSB. I have it on there to keep hidden its eyes and blushing cheeks right underneath them. The symbolism of which is with Autism, eye contact is very difficult.
Family Should Appreciate All Family
10 November 2015
Customizable Jerkops and Janekops can look like anyone you wish in the face. Even those who were family, but have distanced themselves from you by so far and so long in time, that they may as well be dead and possessed by the soul of Count Graduon. Family Should Appreciate All Family.

Not Only Toys-To-Life Gameful
Chris provided a link to a new personal video and added:

Fight for True Love and help keep True Love, in general with everyone, Legal, and out of Count Graduon's lack of love control!
Waterhead wrote:
Hey, Christine, autism is actually a neurological disorder, not a mental one. You know, just like that guy said in that video you posted a while ago who studied autism for his smash bros. theory.
Chris replied:
Regardless, it HAS been, and still does now and then, slowed my thinking process, inhibit being able to Socialize better, give me headaches. And it killed my family's finances in having to put me through such mental rehabilitation and therapies.
Slaweel is Back
Not long after offering his Slaweel Ryam Amiibo for sale on Etsy, it was removed due to a ween complaint. But the trolls can't keep Chris down for long:
11 November 2015
Hey, Hey, Hey! Slaweel is back with the Count on the shop!
Let Yakko, Wakko, and Dot shout out from the tower, "SLAWEEL!" All day long.
He linked to the Etsy listing.

Empathy For Terrorists
Updated profile pic.
In response to the 13 November terrorist attacks in Paris, Chris posted a tribute:
15 November 2015
In respects to this, I also feel that something good to watch, in order, are BOTH "Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown (And Don't Come Back)", followed by "What Have We Learned, Charlie Brown?"
But, PLEASE, do read what I have typed in the image. I put heart and feeling into it.
The Peanuts Movie
He also trendily updated his profile picture.
The text of the tribute reads:
IT IS VERY SAD THAT FRANCE WAS ATTACKED BY TERRORISTS YESTERDAY ON THE 14TH. WHERE WAS I WHEN I HEARD THIS WAS HAPPENING? I WAS LITERALLY BEGINNING WORK ON THE BONUS ROSECHU FIGURE, AT HOME FOR THE PERSON WHO BOUGHT THE FIFTIETH SONICHU FIGURE RECENTLY. IT DOES MAKE ME FEEL DISPONDENT WHEN I HEAR SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD SUCH CHAOS IS HAPPENING, ESPECIALLY REMINISCENT OF SIMILAR ATTACKS ANYWHERE BY THE [R]ANDOM CARTOON VILLAIN, LOOKING TO GATHER ENERGIES AND POWER FOR THEMSELVES, AND THE HEROIC CHARACTERS DO WHAT THEY ARE ABLE TO STOP THEIR ATTACKS WITH [SU]PERHEROIC, AS WELL AS NORMAL, ABILITIES. BUT LIKE SONICHU, ROSECHU, AND MYSELF, [W]E ALL STAND TOGETHER, COMBINING OUR HEARTS AND SOULS IN THE EFFORTS TO SHARE THE LIGHTS OF FRIENDSHIP AND LOVE AND COMPASSION THAT THE VILLAINS HAVE BEEN OVERLOOKING THAT HIGHLIGHTS THEIR VIEWS ON OTHER PEOPLE OF THIS WORLD AS MISGUIDED. AND I FEEL THE TERRORISTS, REGARDLESS OF COUNTRY, ARE MISGUIDED WITH PARANOIA AND FEAR OF OTHERS. IF THEY ONLY UNDERSTAND THAT WE ALL CAN COME [TOGE]THER AS CARING AND COMPASSIONATE, THEIR ATTACKS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN NEEDED. WHAT GOES ON IN THEIR MINDS WITH SADNESS AND MENTAL FRUSTRATIONS, AND LACK OF BETTER OPTIONS AND IDEAS, IS MOST UNFORTUNATE. I WISH THOSE PEOPLE WOULD REALIZE AND BETTER UNDERSTAND, THAT ON THIS PLANET EARTH, WE ARE ALL STILL MANY OF INDIVIDUAL AND FRAGILE HUMAN BEINGS AND PEOPLE. TO FRANCE, MY PRAYERS GO OUT TO THEM AS WELL IN THEIR RECOVERY, AND MY PRAYERS OF MORAL GUIDANCE AND MORE COMPASSIONATE IDEALS GO OUT TO THE ATTACKERS AS WELL, BECAUSE, THEY, TOO, ARE PEOPLE OF THIS EARTH.

Alec Gets PEE-OWNED Much to Christine's Joy
16 November 2015
Hey, Alec Benson Leary, I heard you just got PEE-OWNED and your ASS-PER-CHEW is getting handed to you on a silver platter. This is a reminder of I, Myself, Always Have Had the true controls of Sonichu now, and you never had them to begin with.
That aside, I hope you are doing well. Have a good and safe day.

A Fleet of Sonichus
22 November 2015
I've just finished the Fiftieth Sonichu figure; gold base and shoes, along with a fleet of Sonichus going out in a few days. The Golden recipient get an unexpected bonus, because of the recent attack on France. I was literally making the Rosechu figure when I heard about the attack as, or shortly after, it was happening, so I ended up painting her in a French flag dress.
Watermelon asked:
There are 50 Sonichu amiibos? All made by you?
Chris responded with pride:
At this moment, I Have personally crafted and Certified Over 50 Sonichu Amiibo Figures, Prototype Included.
Waterhead sought clarification:
That's 50, just of Sonichu? You're not counting the wilds, magi-chans, rosechus, etc. in the other 49, right?
Chris answered:
Fifty Sonichu Figures; Just Sonichu.
Aside from at least ten Blake Sonichu figures, hardly any of the others in the expanding full collection have even reached ten; my past self figure as well; I have a sixth figure of past me to make that was recently ordered.
Someone Paid Money For This
22 November 2015
Also, check this out: the first Jerkop figure purchased will be going out soon as well. Made from a Captain Falcon figure. What a crazy pose.
Book Two Coming Soon
23 November 2015
I just received my personal copy of Book #2; Check This Out! Compared to my own personal prototype Sonichu Figure, "Shown at Actual Size!" LOL. Fun! :)
Have a great and safe day.
Defending a Fellow Lolcow
24 November 2015
I am personally making this post directly to the haters on the Internet, including but not limited to those within my own followers.
I have been made aware that among whom, y'all are still hating on those you consider naive, young and defenseless, including Gloria Tesch. And y'all also have belittled those who talk positively of her on y'all's forum. I have personally checked out her Facebook page for starters; I am impressed with the number of books she has put out, as well as being able to keep up with her own education and life during her fame. And not only that, and may I say, she looks really awesome.
And y'all want to mock her style of writing and interests, even to the point of repetitively posting Islamic Propaganda onto her timeline? To that I dare say, you may as well as tell our president to repaint the white house. In our beyond 80's Generation of people, a lot to most of us have become well aware of the Internet Trolls cyberbullying people with threats and mal-content statements, and we have learned to not only to ignore and disregard your words, but also to "Shake It Off" with Taylor Swift. Therefore, yours are all words that fall onto deaf ears and eyes, and what you say and do nowadays are all Moot.
Another valid point I shall make obvious: if not US, the Creators and Artist and Writers, to continue expanding the prime animated character dimension with our own respective and individual characters and worlds, you all would have nothing New to take interest in and shout your Love and Compassion for us in the only language y'all have ever learned: Hate and Pain. Without us, y'all would only complain further and further into what has been written in found and lost Books of History. While y'all can not help speaking out only what you know from your individual pasts, You can never really control each of us, or our lives and passions. In fact, who controls who is on the other set of feet: We of you all.
Dependent of what we say, write or create, y'all will each end up reacting or responding as you each will. And we, the artists and creators and writers, will continue to positively appreciate your responses to grant us energy and motivation to further create, expand and improve our works.
And to each person, their own words, opinions and wisdoms, so Do Not Hate your own kind for positively responding to people like me, or Gloria Tesch, simply because those words you could not think of yourselves, but allow them to be fully welcomed and unedited; without moderation. Because Talk is Talk; you take the good from the bad, or vice-versa, openly and objectively, and form your own individual feelings and opinions.
There is NEVER need for React and bloodshed, when you have Well-Thought Respond with Love and Kindness and Understanding.
‪#‎RespondNotReact‬
Thank You All.
