================================================================================

Holiday Greetings to Karen Riley is the fifth (and first public) of many videos produced by Chris as a result of an e-begging campaign in which he offered to make videos for people who donated $50 to him. However, midway through the short video, Chris lets us know that Karen Riley, a 21-year old female member of Kiwi Farms,[1] didn't donate to Chris at all. Presumably the video was made to get her attention.
Chris also reprises Christmas songs from earlier videos, including Sleigh Ride, Jungle Bells and You're a Mean One, Mr. Trump.

[in a sing-song bouncy rhythm] Here is a special Christmas dedication to Karen Riley. [vaguely waves phone] Hello, Karen! You lookin' fiiine, I saw your picture. And I do this video just for you! Didn't owe me a - [ shrugs] dime? Da-da-da-da-da. I dunno, I got Camptown Ladies in my - stuck in my head right now. Oh well, let's do a song. Um... [humming, then singing] come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with lovely weather... jungle bells, Tarzan smells, George of the jungle, swinging through the forest vine to vine, watch out for that tree. Woo! Missed the tree. [laughs, then hums and sings again] Ba-dip-a-dup-a-deep-da. You're a mean one, Mr. Trump, you have the tender sweetness of a seasick crocodile... I'd take the seasick crocodile over Mr. Trump and the Grinch. [checks phone] But special holiday greetings to you, Karen, hope you have a happy and safe one, make it everything that you want. Thank you very much.
