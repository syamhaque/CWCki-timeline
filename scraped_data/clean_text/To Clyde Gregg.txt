================================================================================

"To Clyde Gregg" is a video uploaded on 27 October 2009, in which Christian Weston Chandler attempts to blackmail Clyde Cash by threatening to post a video he has of Clyde (which is unlikely) by making him post a video showing his true face and telling him that he'll stop trolling Chris and his friends (of which he has none).
Throughout this video, he constantly censors himself, which is pointless, since he's cussed plenty of times. This is possibly a reference to Brütal Legend, which features a censored mode. The song playing in the background is "The Final Countdown" by the Swedish rock band Europe.

["The Final Countdown" by Europe plays in the background]
Ahh. This -- to Mr. Clyde Clash, Gregg Mays, or as I may as well call you: Clyde Gregg Cash-Mays. Or even Clyde Mays or Gregg Cash. Anyway, this message is for you [holds remote control to head, "The Final Countdown" by Europe begins playing]. I have something of major importance that I think you would not like shared upon the Internet. [sings] Ooh, the itsy-bitsy friendly neighborhood spider went up the water spout.
Yeah. So, if you do not want me to share that video with anybody, in video or even just a be'er picture form, here is my- here is my demand: I demand you make a tell-all video of where you tell us who you really are, your real name, and where you actually live. Show us your driver's license, and I ge- and you may even censor your customer number that's on- that would be presented on there. And tell us any other information about yourself that of- is of importance. And I want a promise: a promise, hands facing the camera like this: [holds sweaty manchild hands in front of camera, fingers outstretched] that you will stop and never ever again bother me, Christian Weston Chandler or my family, friends and acquaintances. And, with that, never bother me, my friends, my family, as well as my acquaintances.
But important- but here's a- anyway, here's the deal. You do the video with ALL THAT. Tell- tell us about- tell us the truth about yourself and show us your real face, and make thee promises. Hand to God. Make the promises. And I will delete all traces of that picture and the video from my hard drives. Otherwise if you do not respond by the deadline which I will be giving to you in just a moment or that you do no- that you do not- then you say- you will say you will NOT do it, THEN I will be sharing that video for b- as- with the picture in it on thy secondary YouTube account.
I know you, you're just a pussy... you're just a pussy. You're just a dang lowlife. You do not deserve to live, you mother-BEEPer. You hide behind your mother's skirt. And you just call- you just call your own BEEPin' sanctuary [displays the claw] your bu- in the basement of which you dwell in. You damn dirty BEEP jerk troll. [sighs] Anyway, here is the deadline. Tuesday, October 27th, 11:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. If I do not hear by- hear from you by then, or... if I do not hear from you by then or that you tell me you will not do it then, it's share time. Otherwise, if you do the video as such, I promise, hand to God, and hand on the Bible [places hand on Bible] that I will delete all traces of the picture and video from my hard drives.
I'll leave you with that. Aside from the first warning in the email which you may not have read because I have got word that you may not check your email on a daiwy basis, this is your final warning. [makes emphatic hand gesture with upturned fingers] And all- and wew will know soon enough by 11:30 tomorrow night. I bid you good day, and to everybody else who is true and loyal and honest, peace to y'all and stay safe. Thank you.

Mmm. Hello, just a follow-up here for uh... Clyde Cash or Gregg Mays, as he is also known as. I have uh, just been informed... by my... my noticeable person... that all the trolls are more loyal to Jack Thaddeus than to you. So you — you really are nothing more than a lowlife. So you will do as I — you will do as I ask and do your all — your tell all video with the promise, and continue on with the promise, or I will release that photograph. Live in peace, or in distress. Make your choice. [gets close to camera, makes dramatic hand gesture] At least the other choice is not TO DIE.
