Mewtwo and Magi-Chan married
5 January
Note: The phrase is actually Swedish for "Hello kiwi farmyard. This my self roar on you." Probably intended to mean "Hello Kiwi Farms. A shout-out to you."
Hej kiwi lantgård. Denne min sig vråla på ni.
(Hello, my friends. I am in good health.)
I am celebrating the love between Magi-Chan Sonichu and his mentor and Lover, Mewtwo. They had got secretly married recently. I am truly happy for both of them. 😊
And if Silvana were there, I would the three of them would have made a lovely harem.
But it is just Magi-Chan and Mewtwo. I Love, Care and fully support them very much. ❤️
Thank you.
Love,
Miss/Frau/Señorita Christine Weston Chandler
Shout-out to The End Games
7 January
Also, #Magfest2018, and the #ChristoryOfSonichuPanel, was brought to you in part by The End Games of Charlottesville, VA. For all your card, board and Dungeon/Dragon Gaming Needs, also now buying/selling video games and hardware as well, The End Games is the place to come to. Thank you, The End Crew for being among the Merchants and helping in part for making this happen! 😊
Note: End Games did not sponsor either MAGfest or the panel.
Bob's memorabilia
11 January
**NOSTALGIA TIME!**
Check out what I found yesterday in Mister Robert Chandler’s things. An article of his 25th Anniversary at General Electric Company. And the playbill for his old Musical Push-Cart. Yay! I liked that old cart when he had it.
Terse response to Quinn
27 January
Chris shared a link to a Patreon update for Sonichu 12-9, which featured Chris and Quinn's MLP personas.
Jessica Quinn:
This is adorable. Am I snickering over what I think I am?
Chris:
Diamond Melody is; you're not; you and she are separate beings. And yes, because of the mustard mustache.
