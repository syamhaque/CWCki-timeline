On "Unconsentual" Photos
12 May
11:52 AM
I feel like Japan is going overboard with the laws, yet I do agree with them in regards to certain tourists taking pictures of others without consent, as if the tourists were "Bigfoot spotting".
I speak from personal experience on that.
I wish I could just simply report every single unconsentual photo taken of me that is online.
But even the justice system can be wrongfully biased.
Chris watches the Knuckles series

I recently watched the #Knuckles series on @paramountplus.
I feel like it was good; 8/10.
It needed more of our favourite Echidna, Knuckles, and less Wade.
Divide it 50/50 instead of making it 70-80% Wade.
But I did like how Knuckles was accepted by the Jewish family and how much in common they had.
Plus #ChristopherLloyd did good as Pachacamac

Stalker gets caught on security camera

To the individual taking the recent pictures of me, we have cameras, and we know what car you drive.
We will not release your license plates.
But the puzzle pieces were easy to put together.
Square mirrors, and that was not even my car in the mirror.
Plus the time you u-turned and took my picture.
Point is, I really do not like photos of me being taken without my prior consent, in stores or anywhere, period.
I can very well easily go to the proper people, including store management or authorities, with the respective footage and find you.
So, to this guy and the rest of you, Please Stop taking pictures or videos of me behind my back and without my consent.
Thank you.
