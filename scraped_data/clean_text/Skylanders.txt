Chris's TRUE and HONEST Skylander figure.
Skylanders was a toys-to-life action-adventure video game franchise published by Activision. Originally conceived as a spin-off of the Spyro the Dragon series, Skylanders games are played by placing a character's figure on the "Portal of Power," a device that reads its tag using NFC and "imports" them into the game as a playable character, leveling them up and saving its progress on the figure to potentially be used on a different game (or even console) with all its saved stats. The games started a fad with the "toys-to-life" genre that lasted until 2017. The main reason for this falloff was that most people realized that spending all of that money on plastic was a waste of their time and hard-earned pay. Chris was not most people.

History
While the first game was simply a reboot for Sony's Spyro the Dragon series, it did not pique Chris's curiosity, likely since he initially saw it as an "impostor" series to Pokemon. The first we see of Chris mentioning Skylanders was in a November 2012 Facebook post where he liked two of their commercials.
Chris has since spent hundreds of dollars on Skylanders merchandise, with a whopping $945 spent on Skylanders merch alone during the Financhu Crisis, with a further $238 going towards LEGO Dimensions sets (a similar toys-to-life game, but with the added function of building the playable figures out of LEGO bricks). The Skylanders franchise also inspired Nintendo to launch their own toys-to-life series with amiibo figures (ironically enough, that line is the only one that is still being produce).
On 12 January 2017, Chris would "parody" emgo316, doing a review style video with his custom Skylanders figures.[1]
Modern Times
Take note of the laziness card.
Skylanders itself has been dormant since the release of Skylanders: Imaginators. Chris spent a brief stretch collecting figures and rambling about the series, then it quietly disappeared from his list of passing fixations. Like a lot of stuff in Chris's life, he dove in headfirst, wasted a bunch of money, and then dropped it. The figures probably still exist somewhere in his hoard. Images of his old custom Skylanders OC made to look like himself still shows up sometimes, usually in the background of his Tarot card readings, where an image of the character is plastered on the surface where the cards are laid out on.
