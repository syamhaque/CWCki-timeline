“
we were able to further analyze the zombie and robot-like state this body can tend to go into as a backup. We had recently heard of the term from #AvatarTheLastAirbender: the #AvatarState.

Chris (roleplaying as Sonichu)[1]
Chris in the "Avatar State".
Avatar: The Last Airbender is an animated fantasy adventure series which ran from 2005-2008. A sequel series, The Legend of Korra, ran from 2012-2014. Chris has copied an ability from the franchise, the Avatar State, and applied it to his own delusions of grandeur, also using it as another synonym for his autism conditions. The earliest known instance of Chris watching Avatar is December 2020.
Mentions
In December 2020, Chris told The Place that Bella had told him of the "Avatar State", and that he had looked it up and watched an episode of Avatar featuring it. Chris then incorporated the fictional power-up into his personal lore.[2]
In January 2021, Chris compared his autistic mannerisms, or as he phrased it, his "zombie and robot-like" state, to the Avatar State. Chris further claimed that the infamous 2007 photo of him from The GAMe PLACe was really him undergoing the Avatar State.[1]
In January 2021, Chris had a fantasy about himself and his lore, and later claimed to The Place to have known about it from being in the Avatar State. Chris then briefly drifted into his fantasies during the conversation, and rambled about math symbols, calling the experience as "Brain went Avatar State and streamed it from the Cosmos", and complaining, "Good grief, how many times is this noggin gonna Avatar link on me today?"[3]
In May 2021, Chris finished binging Avatar: the Last Airbender, calling it a really good show and spiritually insightful.[4]
The unreleased Jail Letter - 13 June 2022 allegedly has Chris writing about how he learned to be a goddess from Avatar franchise characters Aang and Korra.
In a jail art from 28 August 2022, Chris illustrated himself undergoing the Avatar State.[5]
In November 2024, a fan asked Chris what the difference is between versions of himself. Chris gave a rambling answer based on dimensions and the different abilities each version of himself has, then claimed that "I did fully get into Avatar State multiple times, realizing this even further for myself." This prompted another fan to ask how Chris reaches Avatar State, and Chris responded:[6]
I cleared my chakras, opened my heart, mind and soul, connected and meditated deeply. Why don't you compare me with one of my former identies in my past immortal life before being reincarnated. Unlike in the cartoon, I didn't die; I changed form and identity.
In a livestream on 29 March 2025, Chris brought up watching the entire Avatar: The Last Airbender series once, claiming he has "the DVD set." He also mentioned watching some of The Legend of Korra, but has not completed watching the series "yet."[7] Chris also once again mentioned how he has personally gone into Avatar State.
