================================================================================

RandomSong1 (which doesn't even come close to being a song at all) is Chris's sixth Flipnote Hatena entry in which a farmer sings a song to a cow. Interestingly enough, he sent the exact same song to Regina during their brief correspondence in a desperate attempt to be funny.
Description
Another Random Humor item of mine with no meaning. Well, Moo, where`s the milk? Twilc could have watched this Cow Flipnote, it it had been posted before his funny F.N.
