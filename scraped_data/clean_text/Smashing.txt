Frickin' Nazis... I am not afraid of any of you... an you do anything else in CWCville- I'm going to send you all down the river, you may as well send yourselves down the river... before I send you all down the river.
[Chris autistically does his best to pull apart his OC Pony Christine and grunts, pulling the head and limbs off of the defenseless children's toy]
You think I can be bought off like this by... having a few little toys of myself? Even the ones I end up putting together an you end up bugging? Well, I won't have it, and you all will not... be in CWCville for much longer - I'll see to it personally.
Wow I really glued this thing good. Anyway.
[Chris proceeds to put the broken toy on the dirty floor, and repeatedly crushes it with what looks like part of a bedframe]
So there!
