I put on my Wizard's cloak and magic hat is a video Chris uploaded on 14 October 2010. In this video, Chris dresses as a wizard (wearing his graduation gown)[2] in the Harry Potter universe and "casts spells" on an assortment of people who have wronged him. He said he would draw a lightning-bolt scar, but the video is too dark to see if he did so.[3]
The video was made for Jackie, who wanted the title to be "I put on my robe and wizard hat"[4], in reference to an old meme.[5]

Bob Chandler puts on his Wizard's cloak and magic hat
[Chris comes into view, wearing a robe over his shirt and waving his PlayStation Move controller. He's heavily backlit, so we mainly just see his silhouette.]
Aye, I have been in the world of Hogwarts and I have a learned a spell or two, and I shall cast ye spell.
[He makes some motions with the Move controller.]
On all ye vandals out there, who have cursed my name. For I am a straight man! And you all are the homosexuals, because you mislabel me and misjudge me. And now you shall be bespelled, and be spelled!
[He pauses to wave his wand some more.]
You speak ill of me and you speak of bad judgment, you shall have a pain in the leg! Ericcus trollisus ericcus bustisus!
[Having finished his incantation, Chris leans over and turns off the camera.]
