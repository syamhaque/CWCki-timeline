Notable for
Political discord, indie music, and somewhere for people in Ruckersville to go
Charlottesville (or C'ville for short) is a little Virginian independent city that's so quaint, yet equally historic. Founded before American Independence, it is home to Thomas Jefferson's Monticello and UVA. It hosted a notorious political rally in 2017. For a small town, it's a popular tourist destination for travelers all over the country and world.
For Chris, C'ville is home to his favorite mall, his favorite gaming store, and various other stores that he is now banned from.
It is also the nearest major city to Ruckersville, which is located 18.8 miles to the north. Chris was born in a Charlottesville hospital,[2] and he regularly visited this home away from home prior to his arrest and later relocation to central Virginia.

Charlottesville and the outside world
Look up Charlottesville on a map of Virginia or the eastern seaboard at large and its isolation becomes clear. The nearest major city, Richmond, lies 71 miles (114 km) by road to the southeast. Washington, D.C. is a 117-mile (188 km) drive to the northeast. To the north, south, and west lie wide expanses of not very much at all, unless you count the strip of small towns along the I-81 corridor that runs up Virginia's western border.
When Chris was a teenager, his family temporarily relocated to Chesterfield County, a suburban area south of Richmond; since moving back to Ruckersville, he has not journeyed far from his stomping grounds at all, save for a few short occasions.
C-ville
“
And when you diss CWCville you disf—you diss every "C-ville" within these United States.
”
Chris, Do Not Dis C Ville
Gardevoir spotted on Cville's East Main Street, 2020
C-ville or C'ville is a common local abbreviation for Charlottesville, although it is used in print much more often than it is spoken aloud. Chris has used the word as a CWC-ism to refer to every town in the United States that begins with "C," but he specifically uses it to refer to both Charlottesville and his fictional town CWCville. In the Rollin' and Trollin' video, Chris walks around the Charlottesville Downtown Mall and the adjoining Pavilion, referring to everything he sees as a part of CWCville.
It is clear that he wished to use the term to link his defense of his fictional town to his supposed patriotism. Essentially, insulting Sonichu means you are insulting CWCville, which means you are insulting C-ville, which means you hate America.
Interestingly enough, the local Charlottesville newspaper is entitled C-VILLE Weekly, first published in 2013 as a replacement for The Hook.
Twin towns
Charlottesville appears to be twinned with CWCville.
Chris has made many connections between the two cities, mainly as a result of his narrow perception of the outside world: for example, Chris presented footage of Charlottesville as that of CWCville,[3] while CWCville hosts the Dogwood Festival, which is an Charlottesville tradition.[4] Chris also stated that CWCville is as important and worthy of respect as every American city that begins with "C", but mentioned only Charlottesville by name, calling it "the most important one" of these "C-Villes"; as if Chicago, Cincinnati, Colorado Springs, Corpus Christi, Columbus or Cleveland, for example, were so much less important than it.[5]
