The classic, about to be ruined by a 42 year old manchild.
Minecraft is a sandbox video game released in 2011 by Mojang, a subsidiary of Microsoft. It has sold over 300 million copies worldwide[2] and is widely considered the best-selling video game of all time.
Naturally, Chris has played it, though took years to develop more enthusiasm for it – surprising, given it's a game with a massive amount of customization and where you can build virtually anything you want. Chris's first public mentions of the game occurred in 2015, and in 2023 he was playing much more actively. Minecraft joins the ranks of game titles of which Chris has multiple copies – to date, he has it for three PlayStation consoles,[3] Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and Windows.[4]

Chris is an avid fan... apparently
Even though Chris owns Minecraft on PS4, PS3, and PS Vita,[3] as well as Minecraft: Story Mode on PS3 and PS4, and has some achievements on them, he surprisingly didn't talk much about it much on the Internet, prior to the 2020s. The first hints about it came on 20 April 2015, when he criticized Nintendo supporting a blatant clone of the game.[5]
Ugh! Just give us MINECRAFT; no crappy copy like this. Even if you have to add a "U" to the title: "MinecraftU".
Two days later, his Minecraft account was discovered, ChristineWeston. A year later, on 20 March, during the CWC`s Autism Tutorial with Director Commentary, he was complaining about lack of cross-save between platforms, while praising Minecraft, which has that option.
And also I still felt disappointed that the PS4 would not allow me to play the PS3 games that I have in my digital library... Cause I was looking forward to migrating the Little Big Planet data, including save data and backed up profiles, from my PlayStation 3 to PS4. Like I believe to my understanding, with the uh, save data from the PS3 version of Minecraft to the PS4 version which I have heard about before...
It was also brought up on 28 March, during the CatKnight Interview 5, in which Arthur Spatchcock offered to help Chris set up a CWCville-themed level. Chris was unsure, noting that he had already ended his subscription and would have to rebuild from scratch.
Chat excerpt
Well, as before, I would love in any way whatsoever to help you play any games, especially anything with a multiplayer aspect. I know you're a fan of Minecraft, correct?
Mm. Yeah, it's all right.
Well, if you ever want to--
I haven't played it in a while, but, it's okay.
If you ever wanna make a Cwcville level or something, I'd be willing to help on that.
Mmph. Well yes, actually I had stored something on my lap-- on the laptop version of Minecraft. And uh, even though I just-- even though I had recently purchased and, uh, downloaded the console versions among my PlayStation consoles. Mm.
Yes.
Yeah, and pretty much I had, uhh... I had to end the s-- I had to end up ending the subscription, the online subscription. My uh, my uh, gal pal... was uh, helping me w-- was helping me with that as well.
Oh. Well, the PS4 one, you just have to buy it, and then you can play it as much as you want without a monthly subscription.
Yeah.
'Cause that's the one I have.
And it's like, you know, I have to start from scratch.
Well, true. But you'd have someone helping you this time.
Yeah. I'm sure my s-- my, my-- my gal pal, she also has a PS4, so... I'm sure she can help me as well.
Oh, we can get a little group together, that'd be fun.
All right. At least it's cross-save, also, between the three consoles, so that's... big plus.
Yes, definitely.
This was followed up on in a later interview by Internet Dream Lounge from 8 October 2017.
I've also played Minecraft and that was good. I was able to adept to that fairly well on the computer. And I did try the console version and that kind of was lack–that definitely, aside from it lacking in content. But, the control – that was kind of like hard to get used to compared to the laptop scheme. I know I might sound hypocritical when I don't play most PC games, and yet I can play PC Minecraft better.
It's the better version. It's just the better game.
It's endless. All right.
This doesn't, however, answer which version of Minecraft Chris is actually playing, as two of them exist on PC's, Java and Bedrock, but it's probably Java, as it's easier to make custom servers on and he complained about losing his PS4 progress.
Minecraft server plans
On 24 October 2023, Chris wrote the following post on Twitter:[6]
We are also looking for @Minecraft players to help in building a Hub area in my server from an island I started; skilled volunteers apply, please.
Send inquiries to cwcvilleguardian@gmail.com if interested.
Thank you very much.
Of interest is the "We" in the post, implying someone, possibly Praetor, is helping him out and covering the costs.
It's also unknown if this server will be vanilla or modded, but Chris himself, according to chats from 27 September 2017, doesn't know much about them:[7]

Not my expertise; sorry.
Realms
The Sonichu and Rosechu statues in Chris's Realm.
On 16 June 2024, Chris posted a picture of his Minecraft Realm to Twitter, revealing that he had been playing for years.
Just to give y'all a little something to look forward to, next live stream I do will be in my recently updated OG Minecraft world.
Give y'all a look at what I was able to do in Survival Mode over a matter of months years ago, and recently.
Chris wrote in a playlist description on 18 September 2024 stating he created the original world for the Realm "about a decade ago."[8]
Because Chris is able to play it on the Nintendo Switch, it reveals that Chris is playing on a Bedrock edition Realm. The name of the Realm is Cwcville (Cwcville)-60, and also has a description that is only partially known, which reads "d
of Jesus Christ Chan Sonichu Prime on Minecraft."[9] It appears Chris also has a backup of the world, which is named CWCSonichu1982.[10]
On 30 June 2024, Chris would livestream himself playing his Realm for almost three hours.[11] Chris also mentioned editing signs in-game to remove personal info of the people he played with on the Realm, making an effort to not dox anyone. Chris has since referred to these unknown people as his "new Minecraft Buddies" and "new friends."[12]
On 14 July 2024, Chris joined a Reddit user's Realm.[13]
On 27 July 2024, Chris defeated the Ender Dragon on his Realm with the assistance of his friends.[14]
On 15 August 2024, Chris complained about not being able to play Realms due to an apparent bug.[15]
On 14 September 2024, Chris would upload a video to YouTube in which he plays on the Realm and fights in the recently added trial chambers.[16] Chris reveals the usernames of three of his new friends via the chat, the usernames being T4ll3n47, CookSUCKS123, and PMDGrovyle. Chris also mentions that not all of his friends were online at the same time, implying the existence of more unknown friends.
On 18 September 2024, a series of prerecorded videos in which he plays on his Realm to build a giant Cubepy would begin releasing episodically in the following weeks.[17]
Minecraft friends
“
Please, uh, do not, uh, message them or add them just to troll them, there will be no trolling permitted please. Thank you.

Chris[18]
On 14 September 2024, Chris would upload a video to YouTube in which he reveals the usernames of three of his new Minecraft friends via the chat, the usernames being T4ll3n47, CookSUCKS123, and PMDGrovyle.[19] Chris refers to these people as friends, buddies, and allies.
Their earliest known appearance is in July 2024,[20] but Chris mentioned redacting their personal info in his Realm on 30 June 2024.[21] Chris claims to have played on the Realm for years, but it is currently unknown when or how Chris met these friends. On 27 July 2024, Chris would use Discord for voice chat communication with them, and he mentions a "convenient [Discord] server."[22]
Chris once mentioned that not all of his friends were online at the same time while all three of the known ones were, implying the existence of more unknown friends.[23]
