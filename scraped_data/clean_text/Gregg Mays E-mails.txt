Sonichu.Net Redesign for Nintendo Please Reply ASAP — January 6, 2009
Hello, Mr. Christian Chandler
I am Gregg Mays, hired by Nintendo to redesign your website in order to prepare the Sonichu promotion for Animal Crossing.
This is the design that was approved by the administration over at Nintendo.
I'm planning on updating most of the website tonight. Let me know when is the best time for me to update the site.
Do not worry, I will include a helpful guide on how to update your site with comics and messages after the redesign.
Sincerely,
Gregg Mays
I see. But please clearify for me; you sent me an image that would have appeared on Nintendo.com; are you updating Nintendo.com or asking to update Sonichu.net?
Please Clearify, and I will work with you on this.
Peace,
Christian W. Chandler.
Also, my Australian Sweetheart, Sarah Cassandra McKenzie is trusted with the information around Sonichu.net, as well as her own created Sub-Domain for Sonichu.net, The Offical Sonichu and Rosechu Fan Site; I advise checking in with her as well on the reconstruction; maybe even inprove her Fan Site. Her e-mail address is pandahalo@gmail.com.
Dear, Mr. Christian Chandler
This is Gregg Mays.
Nintendo would like to host all Sonichu related materials on Sonichu.Net while keeping the Nintendo design. If you do not like the Nintendo design, I can work with Nintendo on updating or revising.
Please get back to me asap, I would like to install some databases to set up the forums by tonight.
Sincerely,
Gregg Mays
It's cool; I just wanted to get a better understanding of the situation. I will still be able to make my updates to Sonichu.net that I have planned and any future ones as well, correct? If that is the case, I wish some of your recommended HTML code in notepad format, in addition to your guidelines. I appreciate Nintendo's input in the project, and I approve you of your work that you were hired to do. Please also send me the links to all pages related in this.
Christian W. Chandler.
Dear, Mr. Christian Chandler
The update process is done through PHP while the design itself is CSS. There will be a form that will allow you to make news posts as well as add new sections and subsections to the website. This is why I must install a database for your website in order for these new updates to take place. You will no longer have to use HTML, instead simply login to a form to update your website.
Right now, I must first install a database.
Sincerely,
Gregg Mays
Okay. I await your completion, and information on how I can log in and do what I need to do.
Dear, Mr. Christian Chandler
To further clarify the updating scheme, here is a pictoral representation of what my plan is.
I will be using the base coding from Nintendo as an example.
1: Current location of the user.
2: Home page
3: Section
4: Subsection
You will be able to edit the home page (although Nintendo would like to use a promotional Sonichu and Rosechu Animal Crossing front page until its release), edit or add new sections and subsections through a form.
It is a very simple system that I plan to implement and hope to do a test run tonight.
I will need to update your website to add a database and need your help to test the implementation.
I will also need a separate username and password as your official account for the new system.
I have taken it upon myself to convert your entire website into this new format (skeletal, meaning there may be some HTML errors, but easily fixable)
If you wish to make any changes after the test run is complete, feel free to do so.
Sincerely,
Gregg Mays
Dear, Mr. Christian Chandler
Could you please send a response within the next hour so I may begin work. Thank you.
Also, Nintendo has received notice of your AC video on your YouTube account.
They would like for you to make a promotional video including:
Introduce yourself.
Promote and explain Sonichu.
Promote and explain Rosechu.
Promote Animal Crossing: City Folk.
Sincerely,
Gregg Mays
Dear, Mr. Christian Chandler
I have done everything I can on my end of the website. I have finished the updating system which you may take a look here. Please supply a username and password for you to demo the system and the details for Sonichu.Net so I can update your site with this system. Thank you.
Sincerely,
Gregg Mays
Dear, Mr. Christian Chandler
I assume you are busy and will get back to me with the details ASAP. I was planning on bringing up the forums tonight; however, since I assume you are doing other important duties at the moment, I will let you get back to me tomorrow.
I apologize for springing this on you so fast. I just need to get this work finished.
Sincerely,
Gregg Mays
January 7, 2009
Thank you for understanding, Gregg. I had to get my daily amount of sleep, but all is green for you. Please make my username for the new thing, "sonichuchandler", and the password to be "nutmeg"; I'll change it later.
As for the password for the tripod account that hosts the pages of Sonichu.net, I understand your need to update it as well, but I don't wish to disclose the password so easily. I feel it adequate if you check in with my Sweetheart and partner, Sarah, on pandahalo@gmail.com; I have informed her of your cooperation in the project. She is capable of identifying e-mails from people, and she has an excellent "Sixth Sense" (if you will) in emotionally determining the true people from the trolls she and I had to deal with. She also has the current password to the tripod account behind Sonichu.net; we've agreed on its recent, more complicated change mutually.
I hope this helps you in your work. Thank you very much.
Peace,
Christian Weston Chandler.
Dear Mr. Christian Chandler
I have contacted Sarah and hope to receive a good response so I can work on the website later tonight. I plan to add the beta version of my blog/website updater and the forums, hopefully by tonight if all goes well. For now, I have some other clients I must work with. Please reply in about four hours if all goes well. Thanks.
Sincerely,
Gregg Mays
Mr. Mays, I thank you for getting in touch with Sarah. I have been busy today editing the pages of my previous and recent Comic Books. Earlier, I did think to check with the Lawer of Nintendo who I have been in good contact with and my associate behind Animal Crossing City Folk to verify you for trust.
I will get back to you with my decision of entrusting you with my Tripod password or not as soon as I hear from either of them, or Sarah.
Peace,
Christian W. Chandler.
Dear Mr. Christian Chandler
I'd really like to get working tonight. The lawyer of Nintendo is for Nintendo of Japan, correct? I was hired by Nintendo of America so I don't know about these people. Could you refer them to me so I can get them in touch with my employer?
Sincerely,
Gregg Mays
The lawer I'm talking to is James Zylberstein of Nintendo of America.
I've promised the edits and reuploadings of Past Comic Pages, and I am currently uploading the re-edited pages after a whole day of re-editing. So, with all due respect, my own personal routine and the routine-parts of my Autism, I'd like to finish updating the pages and Sonichu.net as I have previously promised James, Mr. Miyamoto and the rest of Nintendo of America and Japan, before I entrust it to anyone else's hands.
I thank you for your patience.
Dear, Mr. Christian Chandler
I understand, is it possible for you to finish tonight? I have a deadline to meet and I've set aside time for tonight. If not, that's okay, but really, this has been lingering in my mind for quite a long time. Sorry if that causes you trouble.
Sincerely
Gregg Mays
Dear, Mr. Christian Chandler
I see what you are doing. I will make note to use the new edited version of the pages. I will not tamper with any of the images. I will only create new pages for them. I will do all the coding work. You just need to take care of the images and I'll handle the rest, does that sound good?
Sincerely
Gregg Mays
Okay, I understand better now what you'll be doing. I will have the work finished within an hour estimated; I will e-mail you again when I am finished.
January 8, 2009
I apologize again for the delay. I am finished with my promised edits. I will entrust you; the password is 0urD4uGHt3r_cRySt4L.
Don't disappoint me, and do what you have planned.
Peace,
Christian Weston Chandler.
Dear, Mr. Christian Chandler
Alright, I will put up a temporarily index page informing people of the change. Please allow me around two hours to install the new software.
Sincerely,
Gregg Mays
Something has gone wrong. I can not access the site anymore.
Gregg Mays
I just got work that my job has been suspended for this client (you). Apparently the lawyer has told me that they did not finalize issues with Sega before realizing the website was initiated. I can not help you with this, I'm just a web designer. You need to speak with your lawyer to explain the copyright issues to Sega. If this ever gets cleared up, I'll get your website back up as good as new.
Sincerely, Gregg Mays
You've disappointed me, sir. — January 8, 2009
Because only YOU, other than Sarah Cassandra McKenzie and myself have the Password for my Tripod account; NO ONE ELSE should have been able to access the account and put the .txt file on there. I'm not pointing fingers here, but you are pretty much the main suspect in the matter.
Dear, Mr. Christian Chandler
I did not put the files on there, Tripod must have acted with Sega on this. I do not know anything more of this matter. I'm not much of a legal guy but you have a lawyer right? Just clarify the copyright issue and everything should be fine.
Sincerely,
Gregg Mays
I do not have an attorney of my own; the only attorney I have been in contact with was Nintendo of America's Attorney, James Zylberstein. And I have informed him of this dilemma.
Dear, Mr. Christian Chandler
I'm sorry about this copyright thing, I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding between Nintendo and Sega, I checked your video on the YouTube. I didn't see a mention of Sega, maybe you should do that. That'll ease tensions. I gotta head back to the wife and kids. Take care, man.
Sincerely,
Gregg Mays
Dear, Mr. Christian Chandler
It seems you have the copyright thing under control. I can restore your site as I made a complete backup if you want. I'll be able to install some forums and get that new form system up tonight.
Sincerely,
Gregg Mays
Yes, I have the Copyright thing under control. PLEASE RESTORE SONICHU.NET back to the way it was, RIGHT NOW! And what did you change the Tripod password to?
Dear, Mr. Christian Chandler
I did not change the Tripod password. I will restore it as soon as possible.
Sincerely,
Gregg Mays
Thank you; you have less than two hours.
Dear, Mr. Christian Chandler
I can't seem to access the site anymore. I can't work on it unless I gain access to it.
Sincerely,
Gregg Mays
Dear, Mr. Christian Chandler
Until you sort out these copyright issues, I'm afraid I can't help you. Tell me when you do, you'll be Numero Uno on my priority list.
Sincerely,
Gregg Mays
I KNOW — January 8, 2009
I KNOW that you are REALLY a Troll, as my Lawer at Nintendo of America has Confirmed for me. SEGA has NO INTENTIONS of Suing me for any infringements, he has also informed me of.
NOW LISTEN, SIR, I WANT YOU TO RESTORE ALL THE FILES YOU'VE DELETED FROM SONICHU.NET, THE SONICHU & ROSECHU FAN SITE, CWC'S POKESITE 2 AND THE OTHER CWC SITES THAT WERE ON THERE, OR I WILL HAVE MY LAWER, HIS PEOPLE OF NINTENDO AND THE PEOPLE OF SEGA, EVEN THE POWER OF MR. MIYAMOTO HIMSELF, BRING IN A TRACKING TEAM, TRACK YOU DOWN, AND FORCE YOU TO RESTORE SONICHU.NET AND ALL, WITH A CRUEL, BEATING-UP, TERRIBLY PAINFUL PUNISHMENT!
YOU DO NOT WANT TO REMAIN ON MY BAD SIDE; MY FANGS ARE SHARP, and I can thirst for blood, even though I am Cherokee, NOT a vampire.
Also, that txt file letter you left is a FAKE, I KNOW!
PUT SONICHU.NET AND ALL SITES ALONG WITH IT BACK ONTO THE TRIPOD ACCOUNT, RESET THE E-MAIL BACK TO MINE, OR I WILL BRING DOWN A WRATH OF GOD UPON YOU!
Dear, Mr. Christian Chandler,
I do not have the power to change the e-mail or password. If you allow me to access the account, I can restore the entire site back to the way it was before Sega managed to tamper with your site. I can foolproof the site as well.
Sincerely,
Gregg Mays
Dear Mr. Christian Chandler,
Please look at this proof of concept I had made earlier.
http://greggmays.tripod.com/what.htm
There must have been miscommunication within Nintendo. They are a large company. I am a hired employer outside of Nintendo for the sole purpose of web design. I have a backup of your site, I can restore if you want.
Sincerely,
Gregg Mays
I have allowed access for you to get into my Tripod account after I impulsively entrusted you with the password. And at the time, you were able to change the e-mail address associated with it and the password. I am hardly buying your likely stories. But you should talk to my Nintendo Lawer, J.Z. at jzylberstein@lawyer.com. RESTORE SONICHU.NET and ALL FILES AND FOLDERS WITH IT!
Dear Mr. Christian Chandler,
The lawyers should be talking to you soon. Once they do, I will begin work on the website.
Sincerely,
Gregg Mays
Look, thanks to a mistake on Sega's part, I've lost my job and now I can't feed my kids for the next week. I offered to restore the site but you wouldn't let me so the client (you) has been lost and my employer just fired me.
I am crying right now. Thanks.
Gregg Mays
January 9, 2009
My employer just allowed me one chance to get my job back, I have to satisfy the client (you) and restore your site. I can't do this without the access code to your website.
Please let me restore it.
Sincerely,
Gregg Mays
Access Code? I know only of my old password, which I had entrusted into you; I have no idea about an Access Code. If you can tell me how I can find this Access Code, I will inform you of it.
I mean password, I do not know the password to the site. The only way I can restore the site is by getting the password to the site. Please let me know of what the new password is.
Sincerely,
Gregg Mays
The password should be 0urD4uGHt3r_cRySt4L.
It says:
Sorry, but the username and password you provided don't match. Please check them and try again.
Sincerely,
Gregg Mays
Dear, Mr. Christian Chandler
Please reset the password on your account and give it to me to restore your site.
Sincerely,
Gregg Mays
January 10, 2009
I cannot restore your website unless I can gain access to the Tripod account. Without it, I am unable to restore your site. I'm sorry.
Sincerely,
Gregg Mays
PS, I have lost my only chance to regain my job so I'm doing this out of the goodness of my heart. Please, let me make things right.
I feel for you, and I wish I could help, but I can't do anything about the password problem. And if I could, I would certainly be glad to help you help me and yourself. Please tell your employer that your customer pardons the job, and wishes that you not lose your job over it.
Peace,
Christian Weston Chandler.
Dear Mr. Christian Chandler
Thank you for your kindness. Right now, I'm on probation but I think it should be good for me. Let me know if you ever get access to your website and I will restore it immediately and then some. I will do the promised upgrade and I will work ever harder than ever. Thank you so much.
Sincerely,
Gregg Mays
It is I, Jason Kendrick Howell! If you ever want to see your beloved site restored, you must meet my demands. — January 12, 2009
If you ever wish for me to hand over your beloved website, you must announce your homosexuality to YouTube.
You must not reveal that I told you to do this, otherwise you will never see your site restored!
You must detail how you've been kept in the closet for so long, your search for a sweetheart as a cover up and why Sonichu is so gay.
Toodles,
Liquid Snake
You must be angry! Of course, you could always make a video proclaiming how straight you are.
Either choice, gay or straight, which will it be?
Liquid Snake
"BROTHER"
If I make a video with a proclimation, will you give me the new password you associated my Tripod Account with?
Of course, I may be an evil troll, but I never go back on my word. I have principles.
Love, Liquid Snake
Very well; I will have the short video up soon.
It is being processed; and it has been fully uploaded. Now please send me the password, and ALL of the files for Sarah's Sonichu & Rosechu Fan Site in a Compressed Zip Folderin your reply.
SEVEN SECONDS!??! I am disappointed in you.
This is not a fair deal! I expected a 20 minute explanation of why you are straight and not gay.
I still think you are the biggest homosexual in the world so do many others, just look at your Youtube comments. You're doing yourself a favor if you make a REAL video.
Love, Liquid Snake
Fine, if you want a full 5-10 minute explination, I'll redo the video.
The longer it is, the better your fans will believe it. Look at those comments, my god, they are ruthless!
Love, Liquid Snake
The video is being uploaded; it is about ten minutes long. Please Send me the Password and ALL of Sarah's Sonichu & Rosechu Fansite Files in a Compressed Zip Folder after viewing the video for yourself.
It is uploaded — January 13, 2009
and currently being processed. PASSWORD, Sarah's Sonichu & Rosechu FanSite Files, NOW!
Alright, just one last thing before we part ways once again.
I will hand you the password to the rar and your site (which are the same) if you just make a video...sigh...it's a long story...
I recently lost both my parents in a car accident. I want you promise me that you will cherish your parents. They are important in your life. And I want you to appreciate it.
I want a short, maybe two minute video, with your parents having them explain why they are so proud of you and your accomplishments.
Despite all of us trolls, your parents have been there every step of the way. They must be proud of you.
Kinda sad now,
Liquid Snake...
I understand, and I will have it done soon.
And I do appreciate my mother and father every day. I offer my condolences and humble apologies for your loss.
January 15, 2009
Chris! IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME, BROTHER!
I have just watched your newest video. Hah! You can't denounce that page!
You know every last word of it is true.
FACE IT, YOU HAVE NOTHING! NOTHING!
ENJOY YOUR 4-CENT GARBAGE.
Love,
Liquid Snake
HA! Have you tried YOUR password on the Tripod account yet? IT WILL NO LONGER WORK!
January 16, 2009
I just tried it, it worked!
So, you know. Whatevs, dawg.
Love, Liquid Snake
January 17, 2009

The big brother of Ryan Cash.
Do you understand me?
VERY INTERESTING, I will note "Clyde Cash" as your Nickname, among my PRINTED/WRITTEN INFORMATION I HAVE OF YOU when I go to the Police Department to REPORT YOU.

Oh, I left a Message; go check for it on your RING.
I don't have a cell phone and I'm not Jason Kendrick Howell, I'm Clyde Cash.
What is wrong with you?
The Truth (DO NOT REPLY) — January 27, 2009
I did not go to Redmond. I had NO Financial or Emotional Support from my family, local friends, my church's congregation, nor my attorney; they DID NOT BELIEVE that I was talking to the TRUE Shigeru Miyamoto; they refused to help me, because they cared about me. And I could NOT afford the Trip TO Redmond Alone at this time.
It's for the better anyway; consider how WIDE the scheduled appointment was spread throughout the internet, I was able to have a peaceful weekend, with the Trolls in some other world. I've already Informed Sarah about this, but I created a CD-R with mySonichu Powerpoint Presentation and CADD Files for the Cwcville Shopping Mall, and a DVD with a LIVE reading of the Powerpoint and personal words, and shipped them to Mr. Miyamoto c/o N.O.A. So, basically, IRL in my person, I've been having a peaceful weekend, FREE from Troll and Internet worries. I had it shipped with Delivery Confirmation, so I KNOW it was delivered successfully on the 23rd.
Unfortunately, while I was hoping that would compensate for my being unable to make the trip, I had learned from N.O.A.'s auto-sender that they do not accept business materials via snail-mail, so the discs were discarded.
I have apologized to N.O.A. and Mr. Miyamoto, and asked him to send me a Hand-Written Document of the business between him and me via snail-mail, for me to present to my family, friends and attorney, so I could make the trip for real in the near future. My attorney would make the appointment.
There was chaos and confusion from the mix of Legitimate e-mails and Troll/Bully/Impostor e-mails, I had to play it safe.
I feel bad about this situation as well, because to Cover for my Family and Local Friends' Care and Concern for my safety and being, considering the possibility of an Impostor who could harm me if I made the trip at this time, I had to Half-Truth around. :(

These led into the Clyde E-mails.
