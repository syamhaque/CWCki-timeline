Transcript
Hey. Hey hey. Hey!Eyes up here, budde-
[Chris is sitting in his kitchen with his shirt obviously padded to make it appear like he has very large breasts. The radio or television is playing loudly in the background.]
Seriously, though, folks, there is something else that you should be aware of [He scratches his nose and glances off-screen.] you know, breast cancer. You know what that's both us both males and females, regardless of size. [He adjusts his fake breasts, pauses, then chuckles briefly.]
Anyway, make yourselves aware of this. You should feel your tatas. [Cups his own fake breasts, then delivers a creepy stare at the camera.] Feel your breasts. Check to see if you have any lumps, they could be breast cancer. You never know. If you suspect breast cancer, go get yourself checked out with a doctor. Breast cancer awareness. [Draws a ribbon in the air with his fingertip.] Pink ribbon.

One perfectly cylindrical object emblazoned with a Mountain Dew label.
Plastic bags, some apparently still containing matter.
Two chairs or movable set of draws, both covered in junk.
A potted plant sits atop the cupboard. Due to its healthy, uniform bright green color despite living in a trash heap on a high shelf with no access to sunlight or water, top men are certain it is fake.
Paper plates still smeared with some kind of off-yellow food are clearly visible sitting near the two fast-food drink containers atop a mountain of rubbish. Could be an overflowing bin.
A purple box of tissues right beside/behind the microwave in the far left corner.
Various knick-knacks on a small shelf obscure another part of the window; coupled with Mount Trashheap, this almost completely obscures the window.
