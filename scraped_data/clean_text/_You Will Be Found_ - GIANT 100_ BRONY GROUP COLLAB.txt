================================================================================

'You Will Be Found' - GIANT 100+ BRONY GROUP COLLAB is a musical collaboration project "between 28 brony musicians, with almost 100 people contributing to the music video", covering "You Will Be Found" from the Broadway musical Dear Evan Hansen. Its goal was to raise money for The Trevor Project, a charity organization dedicated to preventing suicides of LGBTQ+ people. The video was released in June 2018.[1]
Chris is among the collaborators participating in the song's "Heads, Hands and Hearts" chorus. He appears briefly alongside other collaborators at the video's 4:50 mark, in a Zoom call-style, holding up his artwork of his imaginary friends and spouses celebrating the LGBT-themed Pride Month.
Following the video's release, Chris promoted it on Twitter.[2]
