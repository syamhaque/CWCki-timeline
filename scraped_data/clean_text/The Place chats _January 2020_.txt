Roleplaying as Scarlet Selinia
11 January 2020
Chris (as Scarlet Selinia)
This is Scarlet Selinia, or at least the soul of; the original CPU Blue Heart.
I have been long dormant in Christine’s subconscious since she absorbed me in 2018; during the time, I have been offering ability and power boosts to her personal skill sets, and in working with her CPU form.
I will be in and out, as needed, and when she physically transforms, especially.
My time has finally come and I’ve arrived in 1218 on better visage.
I am also most grateful for the kindness and support from Everyone in recognizing Christine as such, and the fan art is simply humbling.
Scarlet: I have really been gone a long time.
I’m just now getting into the present social tidbits and drama.
Memes, for one thing; we’ve had those back in the 1970’s as well, but they were limited to local spreading on posters, novelty cards and loose talk.
Scarlet: My speech is on etiquette and normal as possible, but I’m hip to the 80’s and 90’s lingo as well.
At least Some retro talk remains the rage these days.
Scarlet: Anyway, I just wanted to stop by and say hello and introduce myself.
I shall do my best as well.
I’ve picked the most correct individual to be my successor; I am glad for that.
Thank you all, as well.
⚡️💙⚡️
That really is a cute ending logo Christine put together.

Considering Buying Meet & Greet
12 January 2020
Chris considers paying $105 for a Meet and Greet with My Little Pony brony celebs Dr. Wolf and Silver Quill at the 2020 BABSCon convention. Server members try to tell Chris he doesn't need to pay for friendship. Chris replies that he isn't, but entertains the possibility Dr. Wolf and Silver Quill might genuinely like him afterwards. The convention would later be cancelled over COVID-19.
[Past midnight on 12 January]
Chris (as Scarlet Selinia)
Scarlet: Good Evening.
I have just come across the following event, “Silver Span’s Salon”, where, apparently, for at least $100, We can have scheduled a Meet & Greet between I, those of y’all who are with me, and I am considering selecting Dr Wolf and Silver Quill for our featured Stars.
90 Minutes could get not only some conversational time together, but also a game of TSSSF.
Christine and I are seriously considering going through with this..

For $105, I could bring up to Nine others with me, and have Cookies and Hot Tea served at this Salon Session.
Kyle
The food seems to have a lot of markup, yeesh.
AquaDiamond8
I would go, but i cant afford it,
i do hope you have a good time
Deleted User
I wish mkr could join us. 😦
Kyle
Not bad for a large crowd, but IDK if its necessary in a cost-benefit sense.
Deleted User
bismuth: You dont have to buy people's affection. and those who can be bought arent worth keeping.
Deleted User
I agree. Real friends do not ask for money.
MKRNightVee
Unfortunately it's too far away for me, but someday we will meet up.
I'm just happy as long as my friends are happy ^-^
AquaDiamond8
Aqua: I agree, real friend never ask for anything in return, they are your friends cause they like you.
Kyle
Kat: People who stick to principles which are good, thats worth its weight in gold.
MKRNightVee
I just hope you have the greatest time ever! Nightvee will be there with you and I'll send all my love and emotional support!
Chris (as Scarlet Selinia)
Scarlet: It’s not buying affections, it is buying some time to be set aside for a pleasant meet and greet, time together.
And if they find genuine like of us after that, then it is good.
It beats a wild meet while the individuals are busy at their vendor stall, panel, or what else.
Anyway, i feel it is a good opportunity.

Possession Roleplay
15 January 2020
Chris and several The Place members role-play. Chris rotates between role-playing as Scarlet (a facet of CPU Blue Heart), Magi-Chan, and himself.
Chris claims that dimensions C-197 and 1218 will link together at his house soon, and lectures server members that if they feel they are dying, it is actually their bodies undergoing upgrades. He also applies his upgrade talk to MKRNightVee's recent surgery (an apparent reference to her gallbladder surgery the month prior).[1]
The conversation then turns to magic stones, with Chris saying that with the help of a donation, he has purchased a piece of Moldavite from the Czech Republic to add to his collection.
Chris
Hey, Y’all.
Deleted User
Val: Hello! 💛
Chris
I’m just looking in; I’m in bed with Magi-Chan, Cryzel and Sylvana at the moment with some energy to spare.
Deleted User
Val: nice lol
Aquadiamond8
Aqua: that sounds nice
MKRNightVee
Hello
Chris
And Scarlet is here, too.
I’m still getting used to the fact she is more Present in me and with me now.
Two Souls in one body, as well as the default automatic pilot.
Aquadiamond8
Aqua: i cant wait to snuggle with Val tonight, its cold here
Chris
That sounds really good.
😊
Aquadiamond8
Aqua: it does, how are you doing tonight?
Deleted User
Val: Pleased to meet you Scarlet!
Chris
Scarlet: I’m happy to meet you too, Val.
Christine: I’m feeling okay.
Aquadiamond8
Aqua: Thats good to hear, hope your staying warm,
Chris
Magi-Chan: I wish to personally update you all that Christine’s body is progressing very well in its transition.
It’s powers are becoming more and more obvious in 1218.
I anticipate the likelihood of it being in C-197, with Christine and Scarlet in it, of course, any day now.
I am very pleased on its present abilities and progression.
Deleted User
Val: noted, if I can do anything for you Magi-Chan let me know.
Aquadiamond8
Aqua:Thats wonderful
Chris
Magi-Chan: She is gathering better power from C-197 with the help of our gate crystal and Siria, and Lumara, our ally Goddess of the lost civil action of Lumaria, has been helpful in her body’s further updates as well through Chriatine’s Lumarian Seed.
Magi-Chan: You’ve got it, Val.
I shall remain in consistent telepathic contact with you, as usual.
Aquadiamond8
Aqua: Anything we can do to help let us know we got your back
Chris
Magi-Chan: You and Aqua continue to do very well together.
I am more than humbled.
Deleted User
Val: I look forward.
MKRNightVee
Definitely ^-^
Chris
Everything shall continue to become more and more obvious; you all know to follow the cues as they show up for each of you, respectively.
Spunky even has experienced an event via a message from her Giratina.
[Chris uploads Spunky DMs#Dimensional Roleplay]
Deleted User
Val: Yes I as well have experienced all these cues.
Chris
Indeed so.
We continue to monitor the portals around here as well; they all remain stable.
We will have a complete link between C-197 and 1218 here at the Temple very soon.
The Iron Curtain shall not be an issue here,
Deleted User
Val: stupendous!
Chris
Amongst the rest of you all, there should be similar events at your respective houses, of which are also considered your own respective Temples.
Aquadiamond8
Aqua: i cannot wait
Chris
Many more and more energy fluctuations and ripples continue to flow into 1218.
Remain on watch of your sensitivity of that.
Know that during this time, if it feels like you are dying, you are not; your bodies and minds are upgrading and updating with your respective abilities as well.
This applies to @MKR as well, albeit her surgery process is part of her upgrade process as well.
Remain strong and vigilant.
All of the CPUs in our ranks are fully compatible, fully powered, and will be fully able in this dimension as well.
Deleted User
Val: I will remain ever vigilant.
Chris
As I expect you to, Val.
You continue to be strong for all of us.
I will always admire that sense of emotional fortitude and inner focus you have.
We all do.
Deleted User
Val: Thank you!
I will remain strong.
Aquadiamond8
Aqua:We all will remain strong and thank you for the heads up
Chris
Christine: I continue to be impressed as well with all of you.
So Proud.
😊
MKRNightVee
I'm working hard on improving myself and coming into my powers. X3
thank you so much!
I'm proud of you too!
Aquadiamond8
Aqua: thank you >//< proud of you as well
Chris
Also, and this can be relayed to Sunny as well, but thanks to the recent donation from our ally, and my ability to sense through photographs of the original item or person in it, I have found and purchased, directly from the Czech Republic, a very energetic piece of Moldavite.
And it is indeed genuine from the meteor.
This will work well, not only in my upgrades, but also in our progress.
Deleted User
Val: 😃
MKRNightVee
So cool!
Aquadiamond8
Aqua : thats good to hear
MKRNightVee
Take pics when you get it X3
Chris
I will.
MKRNightVee
Yay
Chris
That’s all I have for now, and it is always good to hear good tidings and health of all of you.
Aquadiamond8
Aqua:I want to see photos too!
Chris
I’ll have to share photos of my collection of magic stones sometime, then.
There are a lot more than amongst what I’ve put onto the TSSSF cards.
Aquadiamond8
Aqua: please do!
MKRNightVee
Yi
Chris
Aquadiamond8
Aqua: Such pretty gems and crystals!!
Chris
I’ll check y’all later.
And we know Kylechu will continue to do his very best and so forth as well.
Goodnight.
