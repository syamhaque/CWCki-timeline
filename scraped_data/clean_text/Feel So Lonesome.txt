Lyrics
[sung over Britney Spears's "(You Drive Me) Crazy - The Stop Remix!"]
Lonesome
Aw man, I want a cute gal
But if anyone I have no ball
Aw man, I've tried a sign
But no girl reads it, am I not fine?
Every girl who don't look at me
They already have one, it's easy to see
I feel so lonesome, I can't think straight
To get a cute girl depends on fate
Oh lonesome, and it feels depressing
No matter how much I fail I keep trying
Tell me, don't I have the charm?
If no girl comes, I'll break my arm
Tell me, aren't I handsome?
What do I have to do to make one come?
I want a girl so bad
Not knowing what it is, I need it bad
I feel so lonesome, I can't think straight
To get a cute girl depends on fate
Oh lonesome, and it feels depressing
No matter how much I fail I keep trying
I feel so lonesome
Aw man
STOP!
I can't think straight
To get a cute girl depends on fate
It feels depressing
No matter how much I fail I keep trying
I feel so lonesome, I can't think straight
To get a cute girl depends on fate
Oh lonesome, and it feels depressing
No matter how much I fail I keep trying
Lonesome
Lonesome
I feel so lonesome, and it feels depressing
No matter how much I fail I keep trying
