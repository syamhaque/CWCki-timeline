Chris, addressing Hasbro.
Hasbro! MLP G4 Must Continue; NO MLP G5! is a video Chris uploaded on 13 August 2018. It is an early part of his My Little Pony Protests. Here, he addresses 1218 (what he believes to be the designation of our universe), stating that he has divined the future, and is highly concerned about its prospects.
Chris warns Hasbro, the corporation which owns My Little Pony, that they must continue My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic (his favorite series of the franchise) with five additional seasons, and that the impending G5 reboot must be stopped. Chris claims his fears have been confirmed by conversing with several Friendship is Magic characters.
In reality, Chris is probably just disheartened about rumors[1] he's heard about G5, the planned reboot of the My Little Pony franchise. Remember, Chris believes cartoons are real. So to him, any story changes would mean real-world consequences for beings he believe to exist in other realities; and the discontinuation of a cartoon series would result in the perpetual stagnation of its world, or possibly its demise.

Description
Heed Our Warning, Hasbro!
Applejack MUST become an Alicorn Princess, and Twilight must NEVER become an Earth Pony!
Transcript
Hey there everybody this is Christine Chandler coming to you live from home once again. People of Earth 1218 heed my warning! Spoiler alert, I have seen the future and I had to prevent it!
Princess Twilight Sparkle was about to upgrade Applejack to Alicorn status by-c-by order of Princess Celestia. Because a-Applejack is gonna come upon her own magic in a few days. But it backfires and instead of Applejack becoming Alicorn, period, Twilight's Wings get put onto Pinkie Pie and Twilight's horn gets onto Fluttershy and it's just no GOOOOOOD, and that's how we end up with that FRICKIN' G5!
We must prevent this! This is not gonna work out and I have foreseen this. This is very, very bad. So I had just confirmed with Twilight and Princess Celestia as well and... Celestia and I are in agreement as she has seen the future as well... We must prevent this G5 mistake from ever happening. And yes, G4 will continue... Applejack is the next Alicorn princess and she must become that without flaw. And so Celestia will take it upon herself to... upgrade Applejack as well.
But anyway. Heed my word, Hasbro! And everybody on the MLP show! Generation 5 must NEVER HAPPEN! And G4 must have at least 5 more seasons. And Applejack will become an Alicorn princess...
Heed this! Heed our warning! This is an official command from your CPU Blue Heart in agreement with Princess Celestia of Equestria all of which in our sister dimension.
[nods, pauses]
Thank you.
