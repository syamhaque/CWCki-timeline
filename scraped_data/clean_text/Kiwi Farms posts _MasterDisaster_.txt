Payday Loan
16 April 2016[1]

Another user commented, "Do we have any more info about this? Payday loans are typically the event horizon of the black hole of debt. Once someone on a fixed income fails to pay one of these off on time they're usually too snowed under in minimum payments to do anything but get professional help (or ignore it).
Even hitting the minimum payments on payday loans accrues RIDICULOUS amounts of interest. And we all know that's exactly all Chris going to even try to pay off each month."
MasterDisaster replied:
Chris 'borrowed' three thousand dollars. What he did with it is hazy, sure, but how do you think he bought all those lego sets for Lego Dimensions?
Fenugreek Seeds
23 May 2016[2]
In response to a user's comment, "*COUGH* @MasterDisaster *COUGH*
Maybe he's run out of into at this point but he shared an ass-tone of juicy deets.":
I still get quite a bit of info from time to time. The problem with sharing it is half the time I can say it but how can I prove it's really coming from Chris without some credible proof? Like this; Chris has been munching down Fenugreek seeds for quite some time now because they're supposed to increase estrogen. Funny thing is it only increases it if you if actually have estrogen to start with.
Name Change Drama
11 June 2016[3]
In a thread about the Cwcville Shopping is on Vacation video:
So then you didn't hear this from me but turns out there's a very real reason why Chris is stressed out; his little name change? He did that behind Barbs back and she found out. Now she's livid with him.
Chandler Finances
26 June 2016[4]
In response to a thread discussing Chris's tweet towards Cole Smithey, in which Chris had said, "@colesmithey You Live in Bleeding Carnigee Hall with $2K Rent a Month! You Can afford to help Our Own Mother!!!":
Hilariously enough Chris and Barb really do need money for electricity. they've been paying just the minimum for months and it's backpiled on them; that's what you get when you leave everything on all the fucking time.
