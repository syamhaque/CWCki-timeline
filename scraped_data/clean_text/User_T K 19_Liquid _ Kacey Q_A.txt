Sandbox while I put this together. Source is gone forever as far as I know, so this is all that will be transcribed.
The Liquid & Kacey Q&A was a thread on 789chan that occurred on 21 February 2011, providing insight on the Liquid Saga.
Questions
What made you decide to start playing the part of liquid chris?
There's not really a simple answer to that. At first, I simply thought (since we were in the middle of a huge drought at the time) that if Chris wasn't making content, then maybe I'd make some of my own. I thought others might appreciate it, too, but my summer was going slowly and I had only just found that I could do a decent impression. Chris was just so absorbing that it was almost like he needed to keep making videos or else I wouldn't get to see the slow-motion car crash of his life end.
It wasn't until later that I ended up actually confronting Chris instead of doing an imitation of him. Champthom from the CWCki sent me a message asking if I'd incorporate some things in my next script, like going to Otakon and selling Sonichu merch. I didn't find out til later that it was part of a larger plot concerning Jack and Samantha Thaddeus.
I would love to know how both of you truly feel about Chris. Bemused? Angry? Did you just think this whole saga would be fun, or were you driven by what a miserable insect he is?
I used to feel quite sorry for him. And one of the motivators behind the Liquid saga was to get him off his ass and doing things, even if it took a clone of himself to pursue him and make him do it. But of course, the farthest he went was starting his comic back up again. The thought was to be like "oh well the CLONE is doing this, you're the real CWC! You have to do this even better to beat the clone!"
But ever since he released "Twin Falling Towers," I've just hated him. He is an affront to humanity.
I think it was fun at first. Then it got a bit old. talking to him every night, he's a very boring fellow. I think the saga could have gone places if it was longer, but I think overall it should have been shorter.
And the obvious one, are you ever coming back?
We currently have no plans to come back. Think about it, though... there's not really any more ways to get a rise out of Chris as Liquid. We pretty much took it as far as it could go, and the story ended on the right note. Not to mention that Chris went along with it like nothing else.
I don't think we'd be able to. We lurk on the /cwc/ boards and as much as we'd like to come back, I don't see it happening. We did plan on releasing things though.
Initial reaction to "Gun comic"?
"HOLY SHIT, I THINK CHRIS CHAN WANTS TO KILL ME."
It was the first time I'd actually feared my safety, but then I remembered that he'd be too lazy to actually come find me.
My intial reaction was OMFG WHAT IS THIS? I wanted a fantasy thing with kacey getting her own furfag on. I was genuinely disturbed and almost wanted to leave it there just because of that.
I always wondered if he was supposed to be getting shot in the kneecaps and it's just Chris' concept of anatomy (or lack thereof) that's playing tricks.
What kind of faggot shoots someone in the ankles?
bad anatomy definitely. That was addressed in one of the kacey calls. chris's idea of how our bodies work is horrid.
Im planning on doing an spanish dub on some of chris´s videos, any tips on how to imitate his voice?
Yes. One, when you're saying a word, it's best to drag along the second to last syllable, especially if it's an 's', before you quickly enunciate the last letter of the word. For example:
"Out."
Ou...t'.
"Internet"
Innerne...t'.
Also taking gasping breaths before talking, stuffing your nose up a tiny bit. Slur your words like you don't speak your language.
Favorite "saga" besides your own?
That'd have to be Clyde Cash. The videos that Chris made during this period were the most useful for developing my impression, as they revealed patterns in how he'd talk when constantly stressed.
How do you think chris will end up on the near future?
My guess, based on my experience with him, is that he'll never change. The only thing more pathetic than Christian Weston Chandler today is Christian Weston Chandler a day later. He'll most likely come back to the internet, but it'll be to post videos such as video game reviews and his opinions on what game developers should do. I don't think he'll make known any online sweethearts, at least for a while. But he will never change, and he will always be a leech.
Kacey, how often did Chris call you?
Also, is there anything more you could add about your date(s) with Chris?
He never had my number. he tried several times but I said I had overprotective parents and they hadn't met him. I called him daily on skype.
If you want specific questions about the date then ask. It was very long ago and wintermute's account on the cwcki are my own posts from pvcc. you can count them as honest and true.
[Unknown question presumably related to BlueSpike.]
I think bluespike was just a young boy wanting to impress us. Nobody coached him. I dont think it was odd because, well, it's what you did. it's why I didnt want to be a heartsweet until Liquid. I figured liquid would be no nudes and no chris sex. I wont say it was right, but blue did it on his own and no one could have stopped him.
Having met Bluespike, and having won a rap-battle with him (as this of course shows one's true character), he most definitely was not coached. This is an independent-minded kid, one who was born to raise hell. Though since he has a sick sense of humor, he probably just found phone sex with Chris unbelievably hilarious and taking an active 'role' as his Sweetheart even more so.
A lot of people couldn't help but notice that Kacey and Jackie's voices were eerily similar. Long lost twin sisters?
On a more serious note, what was it like being face to face with Chris? Was it frightening? Did you have to stifle laughter on occasion? Did Chris invade your personal space at all? Was there any weird odors? Did he talk at all, or was his father soaking up all the conversation time? Does Chris make eye contact, or does he stare at the floor? Any weird habits you noticed in your short time around him, Kacey?
I can answer this one a bit, having been in the same Gamestop as Chris in the last year while on vacation. He's quite frankly the person in the room that you want to ignore, but he's hell bent on making sure that doesn't happen. If he even looks at you, you can't help but feel raped by his eyes. Even if he gives you a slight smile, it just makes you feel worse. When he walked right past me, it was like having a pig grovel and sniff your air and you're just like "ugh, stop intaking the air around me, you disgusting person" and he will always stare at you. He keeps his head down and sighs that stupid CWC sigh. It's all unbelievably irritating.
I think any girls who use high pitched voices sound somewhat similar. we are not sisters. I actually think I sound like another troll. now we should be sisters :) <3 I dont think jackie and I sound alike at all.
On the date Bob was never there. It was frightening, but not really. I was shaking after the first date. I think my subconscious was freaked out, but my conscious wasn't, if that makes any sense. He smelled like when you use an aerosol perfume too much, that alcoholy smell and that masked a lot of sweat smell. he has very overactive sweat glands. He stared at my tits. Some eye contact, but I'm slightly shorter than him. I stifled nervous laughter a lot. The only time I had trouble holding in laughter was in calls. He was always in my personal space and trying to hold my hand. I'd just walk quicker. Weird habits are just constant hand sanitizer use (he used it on his face after using my phone) and he widens his eyes a lot when looking at you.
So you have been in the same vicinity as him? Did he recognize you, or was this a planned meetup you had?
He didn't recognize us at all. Our appearances have changed slightly though (hair cuts, hair color).
When he walked past Kacey and I while we were sharing some magazine, I felt like for a second he knew who I was. But he just grunted and went over to the Xbox aisle. In which he proclaimed "Kick the hex-box, Kick! Kick!" and kicked the rack. Everyone in the store looked at him. Everyone. And I don't think he had a clue.
Will there be any future appearances from Kacey's father from the Skype call. That guy was a fucking boss.
I am no longer in acquaintance with him. I suppose if he shows up, he does on his own.
Was there ever a plan for Liquid and Ian to meet in person?
Yes, there was, but we unfortunately didn't get to go through with it. We planned on meeting him at Fridays after Five (while I was wearing the brown stripes) but he didn't show up. The whole story of observing Chris in person is actually quite interesting though, if you want me to go into more detail.
Yes, last year despite the saga being over. Didn't happen. Chris didnt respond.
How would you feel If someone made a drawfag of you and Ian making out?
if this is towards me, I'd enjoy it. I like all fanfiction and fanart. If it was liquid, I'd enjoy it even more because he'd feel freaked out.
I've seen plenty of them. And all of them are equally unnerving ;) But well-drawn nonetheless. Feel free to continue
Please link me to them(not homo just curiius...I SWEAR)
I'm the one who found them. I found them here. I think. I dont think we have them.
What is your favorite videogame liquid?
I'd say Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (even though everyone says that), though I do hold a fond affinity for Half-Life 2.
This is a weird question, but how do you think chris's little duck got bent?
I think he sprained it or did some sort of injury. It probably rehealed wrong. Or birth defect.
I think it was because he's some kind of retarded which actually does deform your genitals. It's pretty common with IQ-impairing genetic disorders. But that's assuming a lot. Either way, it doesn't excuse him from being a perverted psycho.
I'm guessing you didn't get to 3rd date with him? Was there ever a plan for a 3rd date?
No third date. It wasn't planned, but it was open to happen. I don't exactly live in the area anymore.
How will chris die?
Also would you attend the funeral?
I wouldn't attend the funeral because who really is gonna go besides family? I wouldn't want to deal with the drama. I would WANT to go though. I think since life isn't fair chris will live to a ripe old age eating up our tax dollars.
Chris will die in a car crash. He's an awful driver and doesn't deserve to have a car.
