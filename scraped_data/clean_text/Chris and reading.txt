This article is still yet to be completed due to stress. We get a lot of stressful torture in our lives that makes us crash into slumber. Given that inspiration is a big variable, and we may have been lacking of it, this article will be completed as soon as possible, at our own pace... HONEST! This article is missing the following:
• summary, books list
According to Bob, Chris taught himself to read by turning on the closed captions on television and following along with the words.[1]
Anyone who wants to be a good writer must be well-read. It's one of the most natural ways to become acquainted with good style, the elements of a plot, and correct spelling. Chris's ego is so inflated that he thinks he can produce something brilliant with no effort whatsoever. While in school, the only books Chris read voluntarily are paperback Goosebumps and Fear Street novels by R.L. Stine which are notable only for their sheer mediocrity. Chris read these books, which were written for elementary schoolers, well into high school.
In terms of the readings he was assigned at Manchester High School, Chris retained only a superficial understanding of them. During the Father Call, Chris said that he read To Kill a Mockingbird a mere month prior, which in all likelihood he only mentioned because it was assigned in high school. This was almost instantly proven false when started describing characters from Of Mice and Men, another high school assignment. The essay he wrote about a selection from Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales earned only a 69%.

Children's books and young-adult literature
Berenstain Bears
Berenstain Bears is a long-running children's book series by the Berenstain family, which began in 1962.
Chris enjoyed reading the series as a child,[2] ironically claiming that The Bad Habit was his favorite book.[3] Given that the books are simplistic morality tales about talking animals in which problems come out of thin air and are easily resolved by the final pages, it's not hard to see how they appealed to Chris.
Goosebumps
Main article: R.L. Stine
Goosebumps is a long-running children's horror novel series made by R.L. Stine and first published in 1992.
Goosebumps is Chris's favorite book series, and he continued to read the books up to high school. Chris has also said that The Haunted Mask is his favorite book of all time.
How to Talk to Girls
Main article: How to Talk to Girls
How to Talk to Girls by Alec Greven was published in 2008, when Alec was nine years old. It is a children's guide on how to get a boyfriend-free girl.
Chris purchased the book in early 2009 under the guidance of his pastoral counselor and the John Tesh Radio Show, and in Chris's words is a "great book". In Sonichu #9, several concepts from the book are used in the dating education class.
The Butter Battle Book
The Butter Battle Book by Dr. Seuss was published in 1984. It is a children's book themed on anti-war messages. Its plot is a metaphor for mutually assured destruction through nuclear weapons.
During the Gruppenfuhrer Fegelein chat from January 2018, Chris brought up the book's plot when arguing against the usage of nuclear weapons. Fegelein and Blanc then mocked Chris over the age range of the book, as Chris was 35 at the time.
The Giver
The Giver mentioned in Sonichu 13
The Giver by Lois Lowry was published in 1993. It is a young adult science-fiction novel about a dystopian setting which at first glance appears a utopia.
Chris read the book while in high school. In a August 2009 call with Kacey, Chris mentioned he still has the book in his collection, which also includes Goosebumps and To Kill a Mockingbird, and rambled about the book's plot to her.[4] In February 2010 (when Chris was 28), he recommended the book to The Wallflower in an email to her and quoted the book's summary.[5] In Sonichu 13, written 2017-2018, when comic Chris is role-playing a date with Blanc, the conversation turns to books and he talks about The Giver to her.
Graphic novels
Faux Facts
Faux Facts, by Mary Bellamy (who has worked on My Little Pony comics), is a series of ten graphic novels about a group of magical girls. Chris bought the first volume in April 2020 and tweeted that it was "really fun, cute and cool." He said he would buy the rest of the series.[6]
Transformers/Back to the Future
Transformers/Back to the Future is a crossover between the Transformers and Back to the Future franchises which consisted of four books and ran from October 2020 to May 2021. Chris is a fan and in January 2021 had read the first two and was waiting for the third to release. He liked a scene of the Transformers character Starscream being dunked into manure - a gag usually meant for Biff from Back to the Future.[7]
Adult literature
The Canterbury Tales
The Canterbury Tales is a collection of stories periodically written by Geoffrey Chaucer till his death in 1400, and compiled numerous times over the years.
Chris read parts of the book during high school, and did an English assignment on the story "The Nun's Priest's Tale".
“
Chaucer's Canterbury Tales gives us a great picture of life in the Middle ages. In the "Nun's Priest's Tale," Chanticleer had a dream that showed what was going to happen. And that the Rooster's and the Fox's pride got each other into trouble. And, the rooster and the fox learned that from the mistakes they have made. Well, that's it for the essay.
”
Chris's essay received a 69% score from his teacher.
Shakespeare
William Shakespeare (1564 - 1616) was an English playwright and poet widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and among the greatest writers of all world literature. It is unknown if Chris has ever read a complete Shakespeare play, although he admits in his OkCupid answers that he has never read Shakespeare outside of school. Nevertheless, some of the Bard's more famous lines have been quoted or bastardized by Chris, likely because he picked them up from various forms of pop culture:
In Sub-Episode 3 of Sonichu, Mary Lee Walsh quotes a famous couplet from the witches in Macbeth while stirring a cauldron: "Double, double, toil and trouble, / Fire burn and culdron [sic] bubble!" She follows it up with a much worse couplet of Chris's own creation: "I shatter hearts as I please! / I hurt them hard, with the greatest of ease!".
In Ode to Julie, Chris attempts to quote Romeo's famous soliliquy from Romeo and Juliet: "'Christian-o! Christian-o! Wherefore art thou, Christian-o?' And I would be there… int—in your heart – for I have—for my heart is with you. For if I called you up—for I would be there in your heart. And I would personally be calling out, 'I am here, O fair Juliet. 'Tis no—'tis nobler thy name be heard every mom—every waking moment. "And Ju—the sun is in the east, and Juliet is the sun.' Though I know not much Shakespeare, but at least I know enough… to getteth by!"
In Gilligan Be or Not, Chris sings a musical version of the famous "To be, or not to be" speech from Hamlet, directly lifted from an episode of the show Gilligan's Island where the characters put on a stage musical based off the play.
To Kill a Mockingbird
To Kill a Mockingbird is a coming-of-age Southern Gothic novel, written by Harper Lee and published in 1960. It is a commonly-read book in many middle schools and high schools in the United States.
Chris was likely assigned to read the book in school once, but claimed in the Father Call that he read it the month before the call took place. He seemed to have only really paid attention to the first part of the novel, as when Kacey's father Matthew asked him to say what he learned from it, he gives a vaguely correct description of the plot, albeit focused entirely on an earlier plot point (Boo Radley secretly hiding gifts for Scout, Jem and Dill inside a tree at his place). Prior to that, he got mixed up and started talking about George and Lennie's roles in the story (who are characters from a different novel, Of Mice & Men).
Dating for Dummies
“
I only had read the tips that I felt I needed; I did not read the entire book.
”
Chris's self-autographed copy of the book
Dating for Dummies by Joy Browne was published in 2006, with a third edition published in 2011. It is part of the popular "For Dummies" line of reference books.
In September 2024, Chris offered his copy of the book for sale on Cwclight for $100. In the listing, he stated that he had bought the book a couple decades prior, and that he only read through some of its tips.[8]
Develop Your Psychic Skills
Develop Your Psychic Skills by Enid Hoffman was published in 1981 (and republished in 1997).
According to an excerpt from the back cover of the book, it "gives you a broad overview of the whole field of psychic experiences. The exercises and practices given in this book are enjoyable and easy to do. Use them to strengthen and focus your own natural abilities and turn them into precise, coordinated skills. You'll be amazed at the changes that begin to happen in your life as you activate the right hemisphere of your brain; the intuitive, creative, psychic half which has been so seldom used for so long."
When Chris read the Psychokinesis chapter, which mentioned magician Uri Geller by name, he decided to try emailing Geller in September 2017 to ask for help with developing his psychic skills. Geller replied by politely, but frankly, telling Chris that he was just wasting his time.[9]
Numerology: the Key to Your Inner Self
Numerology: the Key to Your Inner Self by Hans Decoz and Tom Monte was published in 1993. It is a book on the mystical belief of numerology, an attempt to use numbers and math to interpret meaning in life.
Chris discussed the book with The Place during April 2021, where he chatted about using numerology to interpret his birth name of "Christopher Weston Chandler".[10]
The Man in the High Castle
The Man in the High Castle by Philip K. Dick was published in 1962. It is an alternative history novel based on the idea of the Axis powers winning World War II.
During the Idea Guys saga, Joshua Wise convinced Chris to read the novel. By 10 January 2018, Chris reported that he was on chapter 11.[11] The book is also mentioned in Sonichu 13.
The Ultimate Guide to Sex and Disability
Main article: Ultimate Guide to Sex and Disability
The Ultimate Guide to Sex and Disability by Miriam Kaufman, Cory Silverberg, and Fran Odette was published in September 2020.
Chris purchased a copy from Amazon for use during his incestuous affair with his mother. He described the book as "a valuable and informative book to add additional guidance".[12]
Fanfics
Chris has read some of the fanfics and stories in which he or Sonichu is a main character. The stories tend to be unflattering, and Chris has complained about his portrayal in these works.
Chris has also solicited fans for fanfics to be written about him. In May 2021 (during a timeframe in which his sex drive had shot up), he asked followers to write a romance story about him with the title "Romancing CWCly", but insisted he not be portrayed as a simp.[13] A day later, a fan responded to his request with a short story, but Chris was judgemental, deeming it as "a start. Simplistic and not bad."[14]

Use of highlighters
“
Also, so y’all know, I have a rainbow of highlighters, each specified within the false-true range, and then some. Pay Attention.

Chris, June 2021[15]
Chris's chart explaining his highlight notation
A highlighter is a writing tool for specially noting text. Chris has a system for highlighting, demonstrated on at least three occasions.
When reading Warhol / Chris Chan, Chris highlighted selected portions of the text in various colors. He explained his methods in a Twitter post:[15]
Pink - That's Wrong ~ See Facts of from me
Orange - Half-Right / Half Wrong, See my Facts
Yellow - Generally Interesting, or made me smile
Green - Additional Facts for Context, I have (More To It Than The Stated)
Blue - Totally Agree, and on Point
Purple - Highly Resonant with me
