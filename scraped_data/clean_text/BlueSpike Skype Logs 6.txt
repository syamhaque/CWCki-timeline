[01:55:06] BlueSpike:
Hi. :)
[01:55:37] Christopher C.W.C.:
Zlkavszka
[01:55:39] Christopher C.W.C.: :)
[01:55:42] BlueSpike: :)
[01:56:13] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'm still working on memorizing our greeting.
[01:56:20] BlueSpike: :)
[01:56:29] BlueSpike:
The game is ready. :)
[01:56:37] Christopher C.W.C.:
that was quick.
[01:56:54] Christopher C.W.C.:
then again, it is quicker to install than it is to download the majority of games and demos.
[01:56:57] BlueSpike:
Yeah, I was surprised. :o
[01:57:12] BlueSpike:
I'll invite you when you boot up the demo. :)
[01:57:32] Christopher C.W.C.:
okay. let me ask you, when do you go to work?
[01:57:47] BlueSpike:
In the morning, at about 9.
[01:58:00] BlueSpike:
Sent the invite. :)
[01:58:07] Christopher C.W.C.:
okay. when do you plan to go to bed?
[01:58:14] BlueSpike:
Hmm..
[01:58:19] BlueSpike:
Maybe in an hour.
[01:58:24] Christopher C.W.C.:
or is your biological clock as messed up as mine? :P
[01:58:35] BlueSpike:
Maybe. :p
[01:58:43] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'll have my demo booted up soon; Lucy wants to be let out.
[01:58:48] Christopher C.W.C.: :-*
[01:58:50] BlueSpike:
Okay.
[16:37:20] Christopher C.W.C.:
Zlkavszka, Julie-Kat. :)
[16:37:37] BlueSpike:
Hi. :)
[16:38:05] BlueSpike:
Still on for Mumble tonight, right? :)
[16:38:17] Christopher C.W.C.:
yes.
[16:38:25] BlueSpike:
Cool.
[16:38:30] BlueSpike:
So, what's up?
[16:38:32] BlueSpike:
Also, what time?
[16:38:41] Christopher C.W.C.:
I have some good news. About 10
[16:38:51] BlueSpike:
Oh, really? :)
[16:38:54] BlueSpike:
What is it?
[16:39:27] Christopher C.W.C.:
N.O.A. mailed back to me the CD and DVD I've sent previously; just got them. :)
[16:40:02] BlueSpike:
Neat.
[16:40:55] Christopher C.W.C.:
And also in my Mailbox today, I've received a handwritten fan letter from a Cheer Sensei in Norfolk, NE, with two enclosed drawings of herself.
[16:41:14] BlueSpike:
Really?
[16:41:19] Christopher C.W.C.:
She told me that I have inspired her to open her mind creatively (in an adult sense)
[16:41:31] Christopher C.W.C.:
she proved that very well in her drawings.
[16:42:57] Christopher C.W.C.:
She didn't write her return address on the envelope, but she asks that I address her in a video, so I will do that later. She also plans on hand-writing to me some more, so I'll ask her to put her address on the envelope, so I can thank her more properly in handwriting.
[16:43:43] BlueSpike:
Cool. :)
[16:43:48] Christopher C.W.C.:
She also has made it clear that she is not a troll, nor a person of E.D. or Anonymous.
[16:43:58] BlueSpike:
Good. :)
[16:44:23] Christopher C.W.C.:
so, it's been pleasant so far.
I'm going to draw some more comic pages today, but I thought I'd check in.
[16:44:33] BlueSpike:
Okay. :)
[16:44:48] BlueSpike:
Anything you wanna talk about?
[16:47:59] Christopher C.W.C.:
I've just talked about my pleasant event just now. Actually, I've also called my pastoral counsoler, Rocky, and asked her to put more effort in searching for volunteer work that can pay me (and allow me to be able to keep my Social Security. Because, Confidentially, in a nutshell; I get a job, I lose my Social, then there's the chance of me getting fired, then I would not have my Social. My family had to pull a lot of strings to get that set up for me).
[16:48:21] BlueSpike:
Ah. :o
[16:48:39] Christopher C.W.C.:
so, hopefully I'll have a volunteer job where I can earn some more money for our future.
[16:49:20] Christopher C.W.C.:
It just depends on what I, or Rocky and my congregation, can find locally.
[16:49:33] BlueSpike:
Chris, I'm not sure you can find a job that lets you keep your social.
[16:49:54] Christopher C.W.C.:
yeah, that's why I'm concentrating on getting Volunteer Work that Pays.
[16:50:39] BlueSpike:
But if you just do volunteer work, you might not even move up to big jobs that pay alot. :(
[16:52:55] Christopher C.W.C.:
There's plenty of time, and this is saving for our future. Have faith. God has a plan.
[16:53:09] Christopher C.W.C.:
and I'm planning alongside him.
[16:53:46] BlueSpike:
Yes, but Chris...
[16:53:50] BlueSpike:
Sigh..Okay.
[16:54:08] Christopher C.W.C.:
It will work out. :)
[16:54:15] BlueSpike:
I hope so. :(
[16:54:22] Christopher C.W.C.:
I have faith in you too, Julie.
[16:54:26] Christopher C.W.C.: :)
[16:54:46] Christopher C.W.C.: :-*
[16:55:01] BlueSpike:
Erm..
[16:55:04] BlueSpike:
Okay. :(
[16:55:06] BlueSpike: :*
[16:55:11] BlueSpike:
I'm still worried, though.
[16:55:25] BlueSpike:
Why do you need to keep your social? We can both work and you won't need it.
[16:56:21] Christopher C.W.C.:
my family worked very hard to get it set up for me in the first place; it would be very hard to get it back if I lost it.
[16:56:38] Christopher C.W.C.:
But, let's not worry.
[16:56:53] BlueSpike:
But I have faith in you that you can do it. :( If you can work hard, it'll also prove to me I won't make a mistake going to visit.
[16:57:15] Christopher C.W.C.:
If we have time to worry, then we have time to have a happy thought to keep.Christopher C.W.C.I will work hard for you.
[16:57:43] BlueSpike:
Chris, I know you promise these things, but something important like this needs some proving..
[16:57:59] BlueSpike:
To prove you can get a good job that can help keep us on our feet.
[16:58:36] Christopher C.W.C.:
My heart is strong, my mind is set, and I have someone of deep inspiration by my side. :)
[16:59:12] BlueSpike:
Chris..Moving to Virginia is a big choice for me.
[16:59:14] Christopher C.W.C.:
Give me time, and I will have it within my grasp to show you.
[16:59:18] BlueSpike:
I need to be sure 100%..
[16:59:19] BlueSpike:
And okay.
[16:59:33] Christopher C.W.C.: *hugs*
[16:59:38] BlueSpike:
Once you can prove that you can do your share of work as I will, I'll go there ASAP. :)
[16:59:40] BlueSpike: *hugs*
[17:00:17] Christopher C.W.C.:
I am proving it to you now for starters with a set mind and heart.
[17:00:31] BlueSpike:
I guess. :)
[17:00:42] BlueSpike:
What else will you do to prove it to me, may I ask?
[17:02:12] Christopher C.W.C.:
I will keep you up-to-date on my findings of the work. I will uphold my promise to have the newer comics online swiftly. I will always schwel you. Ickvenschwel, Julie-Kat. :-*
[17:02:22] BlueSpike: :)
[17:02:26] BlueSpike: :*
[17:02:59] Christopher C.W.C.:
I trust you will let me know when you'll be making your trip here, and an estimated date of when I can expect you.
[17:03:11] BlueSpike:
The date is when you can prove it to me, remember? :)
[17:03:23] BlueSpike:
As soon as you can prove it to me I'll swiftly plan it.
[17:03:30] Christopher C.W.C.: :)
[17:03:33] BlueSpike: :)
[17:03:42] Christopher C.W.C.:
keep an eye on sonichuandrosechu.com
[17:04:30] Christopher C.W.C.:
you will see the comic pages uploaded soon, at least the first few pages of the #9 book.
[17:05:02] Christopher C.W.C.:
that can be my proof.
[17:05:30] BlueSpike:
That'll get you about 25 percent, sound good? :)
[17:05:34] Christopher C.W.C.:
by soon, I mean before this week's end.
[17:05:48] BlueSpike:
Okay. :)
[17:05:54] Christopher C.W.C.:
where am I at now out of the full 100%?
[17:06:00] BlueSpike:
Hmm...
[17:06:04] BlueSpike:
I'd say...
[17:06:09] BlueSpike:
38%?
[17:06:15] Christopher C.W.C.:
cool.
[17:06:17] BlueSpike:
:)
[17:06:39] Christopher C.W.C.:
I gtg work on that now, I'll TTYL. Ickvenschwel. :-*
[17:06:47] BlueSpike:
Okay. :)
[17:07:17] BlueSpike:
Oh, wait!
[17:07:23] Christopher C.W.C.:
yes?
[17:07:37] BlueSpike:
What about the 18 year old section, could you work on that today? It'll boost you up 15% :)
[17:07:51] Christopher C.W.C.:
cool.
[17:07:56] BlueSpike:
So you will?
[17:07:59] Christopher C.W.C.:
yes.
[19:33:56] Christopher C.W.C.:
Zlkavszka, Julie-Kat.
[19:34:46] BlueSpike:
Hi. :)
[19:35:04] Christopher C.W.C.:
I've just uploaded the start of Sonichu and Rosechu's Luv Shack, and posted a link on Sonichu and Rosechu.com
[19:35:42] Christopher C.W.C.:
I feel it's satisfactory for a start.
[19:35:50] BlueSpike:
Could you link me to it?
[19:36:12] Christopher C.W.C.:
http://www.sonichuandrosechu.com/sonichuandrosechuluvshack/index.html
[19:36:40] BlueSpike:
brb
[19:36:45] Christopher C.W.C.:
ok
[19:38:52] BlueSpike:
Back. :)
[19:39:06] Christopher C.W.C.:
cool.
[19:39:48] BlueSpike: :)
[19:39:50] BlueSpike:
It's very cool.
[19:39:54] Christopher C.W.C.:
good.
[19:40:55] Christopher C.W.C.:
so, according to my math, you are at 53% full of proof, yes?
[19:41:56] Christopher C.W.C.:
*full for proof, or something like that, which we've discussed earlier.
[19:43:05] BlueSpike:
Yes.
[19:43:17] Christopher C.W.C.:
cool.
[19:43:23] BlueSpike:
What do you plan to do next?
[19:44:52] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'm going to take a short break from the computer; get my chores done in ACCityFolk, then at ten, I'll come back for the Mumble. After the Mumble, I will draw and color up some Comic Pages
[19:45:15] Christopher C.W.C.:
But I'm leaving right away if Clyde shows his mug on Mumble.
[19:45:46] Christopher C.W.C.:
He wears me out easily with the accusations, stress and whatnot.
[19:46:00] BlueSpike:
I guess. :(
[19:46:04] Christopher C.W.C.:
and I'd like not to feel that stress when I am ready to draw.
[19:46:12] BlueSpike:
I think he needs time to think, Clyde.
[19:46:16] BlueSpike:
But yeah, I understand.
[19:46:26] BlueSpike:
You know, Chris..
[19:46:28] Christopher C.W.C.:
You don't have to be sad, I'm still coming to the Mumble.
[19:46:32] Christopher C.W.C.:
yes
[19:46:50] BlueSpike:
Thank you. :)
[19:47:12] Christopher C.W.C.:
You're welcome. :)
[19:47:22] Christopher C.W.C.:
Ickvenschwel, Julie-Kat.
[19:47:25] Christopher C.W.C.: :-*
[19:47:43] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'll be back at about 10.
[19:47:48] BlueSpike:
Okay. :)
[20:08:52] BlueSpike:
Chris, I just realized..
[20:08:56] BlueSpike:
You should listen to Clyde.
[20:09:00] BlueSpike:
He's trying to help us.
[20:09:22] BlueSpike:
You should even stand up to him, he's a jerk.
[20:14:10] BlueSpike:
Chris, you gotta make a video, standing up to him. Tell him you're not gonna take it anymore, show him how well you can fight. Show ME your moves!
[20:22:05] BlueSpike:
You should maybe beat something up on camera to show how strong you are!
[20:25:27] BlueSpike:
It'll stop all trolls from trolling you if you show them what you can do!
[20:25:44] BlueSpike:
You can do a jump kick and everything!
[21:51:56] BlueSpike:
Hi. :)
[22:08:44] Christopher C.W.C.:
Hey, I just got here.
[22:09:06] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'll be on the Mumble shortly.
[22:09:44] Christopher C.W.C.:
that video sounds like a good idea, I will plan on doing that.
[22:57:23] BlueSpike:
Chris, do you think you could tell them about what we've been planning today? :)
[23:09:01] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'm sorry, the multiple inputs from the Mumble are clouding my mind, so what do you mean specifically?
[23:09:32] BlueSpike:
Like, the whole trust percent thing? :)
[23:12:10] BlueSpike:
Aww, you stopped typing. :(
[23:12:20] Christopher C.W.C.:
oh, yeah. I'd rather not, because it's more kind of a private thing between you and me.
[23:12:30] BlueSpike:
Aww, but I'd love if they knew...Okay.
[23:12:34] BlueSpike: :(
[23:13:27] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'm sorry I stopped typing, but I was answering these guys on the Mumble.
[23:13:36] BlueSpike:
Okay.
[23:30:34] BlueSpike:
Chris, I know this may seem sudden...But..Maybe we could 'cyber' later? ;)
[23:30:43] BlueSpike:
Before we do the real thing?
[23:33:23] Christopher C.W.C.:
that sounds good. maybe on the PSN, without PSEye; just audio, that way we can both be in the comfort of our own bedrooms.
[23:33:45] BlueSpike:
I would, but I can't find my controller! :(
[23:33:52] BlueSpike:
I don't know where it is.
[23:33:58] BlueSpike:
I looked for it for hours..I think I lost it.
[23:34:13] Christopher C.W.C.:
I'm sorry to hear that. let me get back to you on that.
[23:34:15] Christopher C.W.C.: :)
[23:34:28] BlueSpike:
Why no PSN, anyway?
[23:34:34] BlueSpike:
I mean..
[23:34:37] BlueSpike:
PSEye?
[23:35:30] BlueSpike:
I found it! >v<
[23:35:45] Christopher C.W.C.:
cool.
[23:36:01] BlueSpike:
But still, I wish I could see you on the PSEye. :(
[23:36:04] Christopher C.W.C.:
me2
[23:36:11] BlueSpike:
Then why can't you use yours?
[23:36:36] Christopher C.W.C.:
let me get back to you on that.
[23:36:44] BlueSpike:
Okay.
[23:39:20] BlueSpike:
Chris, I'm not sure my brother would like hearing me speaking like that though. :(
[23:39:29] BlueSpike:
Maybe we could use skype?
[23:41:30] Christopher C.W.C.:
I see. on Skype.
[23:41:34] Christopher C.W.C.:
cool
[23:41:52] BlueSpike:
:)
[23:47:15] Christopher C.W.C.:
;)
[23:47:24] BlueSpike:
;)
[23:55:21] Christopher C.W.C.:
Got out just in time.
[23:55:33] BlueSpike:
Yeah. :)
[23:55:44] BlueSpike:
He says he has important news about Panda..
[23:55:53] Christopher C.W.C.:
what's he saying?
[23:56:13] BlueSpike:
He says he'll wait until Chris is here....
[23:56:15] Christopher C.W.C.:
because I don't want to go back there and take his verbal abuse.
[23:56:40] BlueSpike:
I think he does know what's going on with Sarah.
[23:56:46] BlueSpike:
I think you should come back into the mumble.
[23:57:15] Christopher C.W.C.:
alright, but any verbal abuse aside from that, then I am out of there.
[23:57:19] BlueSpike:
Okay.
