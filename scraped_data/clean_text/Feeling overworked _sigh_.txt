On 15 August 2018, Chris tweeted a short video of himself screaming out of stress with the following message:
“
Feeling overworked *sigh*
”
Why he recorded it was unknown, though observers speculate it had something to do with G5, the reboot for My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic that Chris complained about last video and on social media at the time of this video's release.[1][2][3][4] Note that Chris is acting no more productive here than he usually does.
