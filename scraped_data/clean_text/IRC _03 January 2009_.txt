Title: IRC (03 January 2009)

================================================================================

On 03 January 2009, Chris spent a little over two hours on IRC talking to fans from Sonichu Girls.
The chat is painfully long, and consists of various purportedly female fans pandering to Chris's massive Ego so they can ask him embarrassing questions. While most of their conversation is mind-numbingly dull, there are a few notable highlights scattered about. Chris briefly talks fighting other girls' boyfriends, then states he is strong, can lift "a good number" of pounds, and can play Guitar Hero standing up. A little later, we're treated to a Spanish interlude, revealing Chris's somewhat shaky grasp of the language. Later still, Chris begins to babble about his supposedly 7-inch duck and reveals that he's taken pills in an effort to make it longer. From there, the conversation derails into a hypothetical orgy in which all the Sonichu Girls are naked in Chris's room at once.
Things finally take a turn for the interesting when a male fan shows up and begins hammering Chris on why he hates homosexuality. Chris all but ignores the questions for awhile, before going into a seemingly unrelated rant about how much he hates his father. He simultaneously blames his father for instilling him with a fear of homos, and claims that his dad is evidence that all men are jerks. The trolls, sensing weakness, jump on this, asking Chris to deal with an obvious question: if he hates his father so much, why doesn't he just get a job and move out? Chris quickly becomes stressed by this sudden onslaught of legitimate, non-ass-kissing inquiry and leaves the chat.

00:04 <@ChrisChanSonichu> *you've learned
00:04 <@Sarachu> Indeed, and I thank you very much for letting me know
00:04 <@ChrisChanSonichu> :)
00:04 <@CameronVanDierten> okay, b4 everyone breaksdown... I found a good heavy ? here
00:05 <@ChrisChanSonichu> ok

00:05 <@CameronVanDierten> man is this one heavy... okay
00:05 <@CameronVanDierten> here we go
00:05 <@CameronVanDierten> # Suppose some religious person suddenly declared playing the PS3 to be "immoral" and that all PS3 players should be imprisoned or converted to other, less evil consoles. Then say he didn't provide any reasoning behind why playing the PS3 is immoral. You'd think that he's a crackpot, right? Do you see how this relates to you? Can you justify your anti-homosexuality?
00:05 <@CameronVanDierten> that sounds like Vivian wrote that
00:06 <@ChrisChanSonichu> Yes, I see it, and I AM STRAIGHT. That's my FACT and I'M STICKING TO IT.
00:07 <@CameronVanDierten> amen to that
00:07 <@ChrisChanSonichu> NEVER QUESTION MY SEXUAL DIRECTION.
00:07 <@Sarachu> That was one odd question :/
00:07 <@CameronVanDierten> that said, what if someone did declare the PS3 as immoral? how would you feel about that?
00:07 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I hear that.
00:08 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I'd just ignore that crackpot.
00:08 <@ChrisChanSonichu> You said the word first.
00:08 <@ChrisChanSonichu> *crackpot
00:08 <@CameronVanDierten> true, but they could find out you have one and then make you play... shudders... xbox360
00:09 <@CameronVanDierten> the red ring of death sscares me
00:09 <@CameronVanDierten> HOLD ME!!!
00:09 <@BlueSpike> The Xbox is evil! :(
00:09 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I hear you.
00:09 <@Sarachu> No one can make someone play the Hexbox
00:09 <@CameronVanDierten> only in a policestate they could
00:09 <@Sarachu> I guess, but if I were them, I'd throw it at the wall :P

00:28 <@CameronVanDierten> so... what about transgender women tho?
00:28 <@ChrisChanSonichu> no.
00:29 <+GenesisRosechu> Cassie, I think Chris has made his ideas of homosexuality quite clear, and most of the SonichuGals agree. Don't we?
00:29 <@CameronVanDierten> i mean, they do have those parts, but they can still be considered true women... right?
00:29 <+GenesisRosechu> We shouldn't antagonize him.
00:29 <@Sarachu> There are transgenders and that's perfectly fine, but.. to draw a pickle on Rosechu, who was born a TRUE woman, is wrong
00:29 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I have given thought about the transgenders and transvesites; I do not feel comfortable with them.
00:29 <@CameronVanDierten> how so?

00:30 <@CassieRosechu> ill stop now
00:30 <@BlueSpike> I think it's fine, it's not against the law to draw such things, thought I don't like it.
00:30 <+GenesisRosechu> I think Chris is saying that we should be happy with what God gives us, and that to mess with that is to mess with God's plan.
00:30 <@ChrisChanSonichu> Sarah understands my point.

00:34 <@BlueSpike> ;)
00:34 <@CassieRosechu> Fans are noticing that much of your humor is taken from other sources, (Family Guy, Monty Python, ect.) Why do you continue to do this instead of coming up with your own original brand of humor?

00:40 <@GenesisRosechu> Chris chan, another fan is PMing me. I don't know if this question is quite appropriate, because it's personal, but may I ask it?
00:40 <@ChrisChanSonichu> please ask.
00:40 <@CameronVanDierten> if he can handle penis ?s, he can handle anything
00:40 <@GenesisRosechu> They want to know what would you do if Crystal was autistic?
00:40 <@GenesisRosechu> Since it is hereditary
00:40 <@Hot4Chrissy> hi chris, i think ur hot, that's why i came into the room so i culd talk 2 u :)

00:41 <@ChrisChanSonichu> :)
00:41 <@CameronVanDierten> oh, chris
00:41 <@BlueSpike> I have a question, too.
00:41 <@CameronVanDierten> my cousin rebecca is here
00:41 <@BlueSpike> Someone similar.
00:41 <@CameronVanDierten> hold on one sec
00:41 <@CameronVanDierten> blue, go for it
00:42 <@BlueSpike> What would you do if it turned out your girlfriend free girl was autistic herself and you couldn't tell somehow? :O
00:42 -!- CameronVanDierten is now known as RebeccaVanDierten
00:42 <@BlueSpike> Just, what if?
00:42 <@BlueSpike> And you truly loved her?
00:42 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I'd love her too.
00:42 <@GenesisRosechu> The other fan wants to know also, what would you do if you had sons first, instead of Crystal?
00:42 <@ChrisChanSonichu> it's really the low-functioning autistic people who really freak me out, period.
00:43 <@sonichulover1989> thats understandable
00:43 <@ChrisChanSonichu> My wife can name him, and I'd raise him just the same.
00:43 <@sonichulover1989> there unsettling
00:43 <@BlueSpike> What if it was low-functioning and you couldn't tell somehow?
00:43 <@RebeccaVanDierten> omg... omg omg omg... chris! hi! I'm rebecca and i just want to apologize for my twin brother's actions against you... he's a stupid jerk
00:43 <@BlueSpike> Again, just what-if. :O
00:43 <@Sarachu> These are all very personal questions
00:43 <@BlueSpike> Maybe I shouldn't ask that, pass if you wish.
00:43 <@ChrisChanSonichu> Hi, Rebecca. It's cool; I do not blame you for your brother's actions.
00:43 <@RebeccaVanDierten> thank you ; )
00:44 <@ChrisChanSonichu> Low-functioning are more obvious.
00:44 <@sonichulover1989> yeah
00:44 <@GenesisRosechu> Boy, these fans just love you Chris chan! They're so excited you're here that the questions are overloading me now.
00:44 <@ChrisChanSonichu> Rebecca, are you on the Sonichu Girls?
00:44 <@RebeccaVanDierten> i am
00:44 <@ChrisChanSonichu> cool.
00:44 <@HarinezumiShoujo> Ne, Kurisu, can you use hashi? I think they call them chop stick? If you had a girl from japan, you would have to use chop stick!
00:44 <@CassieRosechu> chris, are you planing to get a new dog... im really srry about patti, my dog was just put to sleep a coupl of days ago... so i know how that is
00:44 <@RebeccaVanDierten> i tried to send you a message about the trolls who were planning to invade your meeting tonight
00:45 <@RebeccaVanDierten> i pray nothing bad happened
00:45 <@Sarachu> Oh my gosh, those trolls were sooo annoying!
00:45 <@RebeccaVanDierten> i know

00:45 <@RebeccaVanDierten> oh, i just re-read your tribute to patti
00:45 <@ChrisChanSonichu> it's cool; I have handled chop sticks before very well. likely, but no plans at the moment. I just ignore the Trolls; if they have recorded their actions and posted them on youtube, well that's their smoke being blown.
00:46 <@RebeccaVanDierten> do you plan to get a new puppy? i love puppies
00:46 <@GenesisRosechu> That's a very mature way to see it.
00:46 <@RebeccaVanDierten> it sure is *sighs*
00:46 <@ChrisChanSonichu> maybe. and I meant it from the heart.
00:46 <@RebeccaVanDierten> i know... it made me cry
00:46 <@Luv4Sonichu> I just keep admiring u more and more, Chris
00:47 <@sonichulover1989> whats your favorite breed of dog?

00:48 <@ChrisChanSonichu> Patti was part beagle, part spitz.
00:48 <@GenesisRosechu> I'm sure those trolls will realize soon you can't mess with someone with the heart of a soldier. :)
00:48 <@RebeccaVanDierten> i have golden reterivers, they're awsome
00:48 <@Luv4Sonichu> I just kno ud protect me from those mean trolls

01:16 <+canine> i'm not homosexual, i do like girls
01:16 <+canine> i'm sorry if this distresses you, but my question was the question about the homosexuals
01:16 <@ChrisChanSonichu> Seriously though, if it meant to protect my Love, I would die.
01:16 <+canine> i'm not gay, but i don't see why you dislike them so much
01:17 <+canine> i mean, it's comparable to someone hating PS3 or hating the Wii
01:17 <+canine> do you have any reasons for it?
01:17 <@Sarachu> He gets this question a lot! Lol!
01:17 <@RebeccaVanDierten> canine... u silly

01:18 <@BlueSpike> I love Chris the most!
01:18 <@Sarachu> You're all very special to me. :)
01:18 <+canine> ChrisChanSonichu: do you have reasoning for why homosexuality is bad?
01:18 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I Love All of you Ladies too. :-*
01:19 <@RebeccaVanDierten> oui
01:19 <@Luv4Sonichu> Awww
01:19 <@Luv4Sonichu> :-*
01:19 <@RebeccaVanDierten> okay... i guess canine really really reallly wants to know,chris
01:19 <+canine> it bothers me greatly, because one of my best friends is homosexual
01:19 <+canine> and he's really nice
01:19 <@ChrisChanSonichu> Male homo acts are just offensive, gross and I just can not tolerate it.
01:19 <+canine> but
01:20 <+canine> suppose someone dislikes the PS3
01:20 <+canine> isn't that the same thing?
01:20 <+canine> should we make PS3's illegal?
01:20 <@BlueSpike> Isn't saying 'homo' offensive to them? :(
01:20 <@ChrisChanSonichu> it is not the same thing.
01:20 <@GenesisRosechu> Do you believe it's more of a religious thing, or just a personal thing?
01:20 <+canine> it is the same thing
01:20 <@ChrisChanSonichu> Both religious and personal.
01:20 <+canine> but
01:20 <+canine> again
01:20 <+canine> it's just like making PS3's illegal
01:20 <+canine> or saying that they're immoral
01:20 <@Sarachu> I.. have to go now
01:20 <@Sarachu> Sorry, Chris
01:20 <+canine> ok, bye sarah

01:24 <+canine> i'm sorry
01:24 <@RebeccaVanDierten> oh?
01:24 <@RebeccaVanDierten> how so?
01:24 <@RebeccaVanDierten> what happened?
01:24 <@ChrisChanSonichu> Men are mostly gross.
01:24 <@BlueSpike> Tell us more. :(
01:24 <+canine> my father died when i was young
01:25 <@GenesisRosechu> my father ran off without another woman
01:25 <@BlueSpike> Tell me about your father and how you don't get along.
01:25 <@BlueSpike> I wanna help.
01:25 <+canine> chris, men and women are equally unpleasant
01:25 <@ChrisChanSonichu> He rarely washes his hands, he starts more arguements than there are flies at a garbage dump, he just is a major stressor in my lifetime.
01:25 <+canine> that's a shame, but how does this relate to homosexuality?
01:25 <@GenesisRosechu> That's horrible.
01:26<@ChrisChanSonichu> while he can be civil, he ACTS DUMB when he is actually SMART, he raises his voice too often.
01:26 <@GenesisRosechu> It effects the whole family, doesn't it?
01:26 <@RebeccaVanDierten> does he... question your sexuality?
01:26 <@ChrisChanSonichu> he depresses me with his pitiful complaints.
01:27 <@GenesisRosechu> What type of complaints, if I may ask?
01:27 <+canine> i'm sorry
01:27 <@CassieRosechu> does he say anything to you for still being girlfriend-free?
01:27 <@RebeccaVanDierten> i am curious to know more, too, sweetie
01:27 <@ChrisChanSonichu> and because of his being a major influence in my life, I just do not care much for men, period.
01:27 <+canine> i know many mean people, and having to live with one would be exceedingly unpleasant
01:27 <+canine> oh, i see
01:27 <@RebeccaVanDierten> hmm
01:27 <@RebeccaVanDierten> okay
01:28 <@BlueSpike> Could you tell us some of these complaints?
01:28 <@ChrisChanSonichu> My father is OLD FASHIONED; he NEVER gives thought to homos, and he HATES them too.
01:28 <+canine> well, you're not your father
01:28 <@RebeccaVanDierten> maybe he has influenced your way of thinking?
01:28 <@ChrisChanSonichu> the list is infinite.
01:28 <@GenesisRosechu> Then if you hate him so much, wouldn't you want to NOT follow his example?
01:28 <@GenesisRosechu> Still, he shouldn't make such hurtful comments to you.
01:28 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I do not follow his bad examples.
01:28 <@GenesisRosechu> Do you think that maybe he is doing it only for your own good?
01:29 <@RebeccaVanDierten> like...
01:29 <@RebeccaVanDierten> ...
01:29 <@RebeccaVanDierten> he wants you to move out
01:29 <@ChrisChanSonichu> mostly, yes.
01:29 <@RebeccaVanDierten> be on your own
01:29 <@RebeccaVanDierten> i believe if u did, you would be happy
01:29 <@GenesisRosechu> Do you not want to be on your own? Or have roommates?
01:29 <+canine> unless you have a good reason to hate homosexuals, you don't have to hate homosexuals
01:29 <+canine> just because your father does isn't any reason to do it yourself
01:29 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I will only move out when I have my Sweetheart, so I can go to her place.

01:32 <@Luv4Sonichu> hahaha
01:32 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I am able to be naked in my own house.
01:32 <@GenesisRosechu> Or maybe volunteer outside of your house, or get a job.
01:33 <@CameronVanDierten> really?
01:33 <@ChrisChanSonichu> yes.
01:33 <@GenesisRosechu> Then perhaps your father will ease up on you.
01:33 <+canine> you can be naked 24/7 in your own place
01:33 <@CameronVanDierten> where can u be naked?
01:33 <@CameronVanDierten> like 24 7 like canine said
01:33 <@GenesisRosechu> Plus a job will let you know more people, AND GIRLS, and have more time away from the stress :)
