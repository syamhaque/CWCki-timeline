• The Lainchu Manifesto
This article is rated M for Honest Content
It may contain content deemed not safe for work. Reader discretion is advised.

Meghan Kathleen
Ringo,[14][15][8] more commonly known as MKRNightVee (MKR for short), CPUMagentaHeart, and sometimes referred to as Maker by Chris, appeared in December 2018 and was active as a white knight and fantasy enabler on Twitter and Discord, until Chris cut ties with her in July 2021 citing her toxic behavior.[8] She got into contact with Chris through Twitter,[16] then a friend looking up Chris's phone number for her.[17] She presented herself to Chris as being the CPU goddess of the Nintendo Switch, offering him validation on his fantasies of being a CPU and having magic powers. She has claimed that "My goal isnt to feed into his delusions so much as it is to gently offer kind advice and be there as a shoulder to lean on for moral support [...] I'm trying to help him better himself".[17] It is unclear how MKR thought encouraging Chris's delusions with Hyperdimension Neptunia CPU lore would lead to him becoming better.
MKR acted notably possessive towards Chris. She created or spread lies about several other people interacting with Chris, even to the extent of falsely accusing them of criminal activity. She also became irritated with Chris when she felt that he was ignoring her,[18] and reacted with anger when Chris decided to leave her group's Discord server The Place due to toxicity from her and others in the group. MKR attempted to emotionally manipulate Chris into returning, but he stood his ground and insisted she work on improving herself first.[8]

Interactions with Chris
MKR set up a Discord group for Chris, telling her friends from The Sons of the Miscreants Discord server to role-play as CPU goddesses to gain Chris's trust, while also instituting a no-trolling rule.[9]
Under her assistance, Owls and would-be Watchmen members would roleplay as goddesses while in contact with Chris. MKR has claimed to be doing it out of the belief that doing so will somehow "better" him.
Tings Tingz comments on her concern after seeing one of MKR's tweets.
When MKR first appeared on the scene, Tings Tingz was suspicious of her due to MKR being an enabler to Chris's delusions. Tings was particularly suspicious of MKR's usage of the Hyperdimension Neptunia CPU lore to gain Chris's attention - as the Idea Guys had pioneered the use of the lore to manipulate Chris. Tings reached out to Chris with her suspicions, to which Chris defended MKR.[19]
On 21 January 2019, a Kiwi Farms thread was posted about MKR. The thread included several pages of chatlogs from The Sons of the Miscreants Discord server, in which MKR had discussed her interactions with Chris and recruited Discord users to chat with him.[14] Tings Tingz pointed out the thread to Chris and warned him of MKR's "belittling" and "mocking" comments about him in the chats, her usage of the CPU lore to trick him, and also alleging MKR and her friends to be trolls and advising Chris to cut contact. Chris responded, "My head hurts." Tings pressed further, asking him, "Your still following MKR. Are you choosing the reassuring lie?" Chris answered, "I'm talking to her about the issue; I have not completely processed the details yet!"[20] Tings also confronted MKR.[21]
Art Chris drew of MKR's OC Nightvee.
MKR claimed to the Sons of the Miscreants that Chris had attempted to get back into contact with Megan Schroeder with her assistance, to which she declined.[16]
In August 2020, Chris offered MKR several of his possessions in his Last Will and Testament.
On 4 January 2021, Chris bought a Funko Pop figure of Transformers character Starscream, then mentioned to MKR that he thought it was something she would like and asked for confirmation of her address. MKR replied that the figure was cute and sent her address details.[22]

MKR has created a NightVee Amulet for Chris in 2018/2019.
Meghan enabling Chris's delusional thoughts.
MKR first tweeted to Chris's CWCSonichu account on 27 December 2018, claiming to have powers.[23] Replying to a tweet Chris made about the Commodore 64, MKR tweeted:
“
Great news! I'm so happy for you, I recently was gifted my switch as well I'm still trying to work out my powers
^-^" but I'll do my best for humanity's sake! And for you!
MKR 🌙💜🌙
”
During the TF2 Analysis saga, she created an alt Twitter account named Creamarina and shared it with Chris to enable him to evade blocks.[24]
On 17 February 2021, Chris lamented his feelings of loneliness in The Place. He posted that he had considered MKR as among a potential list of options for a relationship, tagging her Discord handle in the process.[25] Weeks later, on 12 March 2021, Chris posted in The Place about his Lovers Attributes List, tagging MKR and asking if any of the items on the list matched with her.
As a Watchman
“
Bulling the weens leads to more fun than cwc
”
MKR on "bullying the weens"[26]
During the Jacob Sockness saga, in which Sockness attempted to manipulate Chris into a sexual relationship, the Watchmen saw the potential danger in Sockness's activities, and helped steer Chris away from him during summer 2019; Sockness, who at the time was engaging in a full-scale war against Chris's enablers, followers and critics alike, considered MKR to be a notable enemy of his, and apparently abused her verbally on Twitter as his second dramatic cycle approached its climax in early November. She and the other Watchmen largely mitigated Sockness's influence over Chris, though Chris was still willing to listen to Sockness. In September 2019, when Sockness announced a plan to come to Ruckersville by train, Chris took to Twitter to post an audio clip, ChrisReleasesAStatementRegardingJacobSockness, telling him to stay away. MKR later claimed that "Christine herself came to me afraid and upset and asked Jacob not to come over"[27] and that Chris "asked for it to be stopped."[28]
MKR was involved with infighting within the Watchmen. On 28 June 2021, Spunky posted an account of her time with the Watchmen, in which she described being belittled by both Naught and MKR.[29]
MKR voted for The WCT to take over the role of Lainchu in February 2021.[30]
MKR has discussed with Kyle and an unknown Watchman about the ethics of enabling Chris in a 9 March 2021 Second Layer chat, stating that its necessary to enable Chris with his delusions in order to protect him from malicious trolls.[31] In this chat, she states "Most people don't understand what dealing with Chris is like, they say feeding his delusions is ganna kill him or something. But honestly it doesn't matter at this point.", under the belief that Chris cannot change.
“
The way CWC was acting, ignoring his true friends in favor of preator and ignoring the really nice heartfelt birthday message I posted to him while retweeting and responding to so many weens.
”
MKR on Chris talking to Praetor.[18]
Meghan lashes out at Chris in March 2021.
On 5 March 2021, MKR lashed out at Chris over Twitter in a fit of jealousy.
A month prior, MKR had learned that Chris was planning to use a taser on his quartz crystals in an attempt to activate the Dimensional Merge, which his new friend group Praetor was to let him borrow. MKR, among other Watchmen, took to spreading a vicious rumor on the planned taser usage.[4]
Though nearly a month had passed, on 5 March, MKR sent an angry Tweet directed towards Chris which expressed her disdain.[32]
She then temporarily deleted her Twitter account a few days later. However, this was a ruse by MKR designed to manipulate the public and Praetor - MKR believed that by dramatically acting as if she were quitting on Chris, it would lull Praetor into a false sense of security,[33] although Praetor members have not been known to care.
She also claimed to the other Watchmen that her Twitter account's true intent was to draw the attention of weens in order to put them on full blast.[18]
She reactivated her account, and tweeted again to Chris in April, replying to Chris tagging her to show her a gif file,[34] and later to reply to another of Chris's tweets in order to call one of his enablers a "faggot".[35]
MKR attempted to manipulate Chris into interacting with Alexander Jahans, another delusional lolcow which she and Naught had taken interest in.[26] In March 2021, when Chris was chatting with The Place about his psychic detective roleplay, MKR claimed that Jahans's abilities could help.[3] Behind Chris's back, MKR rationalized the setup as "two tards playing pretend in a controlled environment."[26] However, Jahans did not appear.
Chris cuts ties
Main article: Watchmen infighting drama
In June 2021, internal conflict arose among Watchmen members over Naught doxing The WCT which resulted in the group separating. MKR had sided with Naught and Chris against, leading to Chris distancing himself from MKR in the fallout. MKR attempted to emotionally manipulate Chris into returning to her side. On 29 June, MKR tagged Chris’s Twitter and posted, “Your obviously good at using people and then moving on to the next. Have fun getting fucked over by WCT and Praetor.”[36] She followed up by tweeting that she regretted having spent her time drawing art for Chris and accused him of being unappreciative of it.[37]
On 26 June 2021, Chris left the Watchmen Discord server The Place. He and MKR discussed the matter over texts from 1-3 July. Chris mentioned that he feels her, Naught, and Kyle were toxic, after hearing edgy comments regarding racism and Nazis in voice chats and movie nights and therefore dubbed all three of them to be part of "the toxic trio". Chris also complained about Naught's attempts at doxing both Spunky and The WCT for not allowing him to use their Kiwi Farms accounts.
Chris ended with a request for the "toxic trio" to
"shape up, clear themselves up spiritually, let go of their respective egos, and become most genuinely enlightened to fully comprehend", otherwise Chris would not return to The Place. Meghan tried to guilt-trip Chris into returning to her by telling him that she felt that her image has been ruined thanks to Chris, and how she feels "betrayed and hurt". MKR then said she "can only become better if you help me, I need you in my life," to which Chris stood his ground and responded that only she can help herself.[38]
Aftermath
MKR's Discord message, redacted by Spooky.
Following the Incest Leaks, Mean Girls leader Spooky Bones reached out to MKR over Twitter after she had falsely suggested that The WCT might have wanted Chris to kill himself. MKR was then invited to the Halal server, a Discord server run by Spooky's associates, where Spooky would interview her about WCT's role with Chris. MKR took advantage of the opportunity to spread more misinformation to the Halal Server, influencing the narrative that Halal Server members would later post on Kiwi Farms.[39] When Spooky uploaded a screencap of one of MKR's Discord posts on the CWCki, she redacted MKR's username and added the caption "Source affiliated with the "Watchmen" describes internal conflicts and how Sean Walker ("WCT"/"Conner") took over the "Lainchu" role from Anaxis, and Chris's poor response to the same."
MKR had also tried to get a former Watchmen member to convince editor PsychoNerd054 to add information about a NightVee medallion she made for Chris.
OCs
NightVee
Seemingly taking a page out of Chris's conception of Sonichu, MKR is also the creator of the OC NightVee, a hybrid of the Sega character Nights (of Nights into Dreams) and the Pokémon Eevee.
Creamarina
Creamarina is a hybrid of Primarina and Cream the Rabbit, appears in the NightVee comic, and serves as a romantic interest for NightVee. Later, a Twitter account was created for the character, and Chris was given access to it.
Angefly
The Angefly (anne-ji-fly)[40] was an aquatic legendary Pokemon OC that MKR had created for Chris in order to get his attention.[41] Not much is known about the OC itself, as MKR had intended to only share it with Chris confidentially, and little has been revealed from what has been shared publically.
CPU Magenta Heart
CPU Magenta Heart in TSSSF form.
CPU Magenta Heart was MKR's very own Goddess persona. She is the CPU Goddess of the Nintendo Switch.
Tri
Tri
Tri was one of three clones created out of the DNA of Angelica Rosechu and Magi-Chan.
Harriet
Harriet was one of the Broodals from Super Mario Odyssey. She acts as a crony to Giovanni in the NightVee comic.

Notes
↑ Used a cropped version of a three-year-old photo to claim she was gifting an item to Chris for his next birthday. See Medallions#NightVee Medallion for more information.
↑ Claimed via Twitter that she wasn't enabling Chris's delusions while away from Twitter and that she only watched movies and discussed interests.[1] However in her DMs with Chris she tried to introduce an OC named Angefly[2] and in Discord chats she helped enabled his fantasies.[3]
↑ Has falsely claimed that Praetor wanted Chris to use a stun gun on himself, and purposefully left out key parts of a conversation between them and Chris to make this seem true, in an attempt to smear the group.[4]
↑ After Anaxis tried to suggest the Watchmen approach Praetor less aggressively, MKR viewed this as him betraying her, and ended the conversation with "You'll grow to love me, they all do eventually. Except cat, he likes himself more."
↑ In a chat between MKR and Chris involving him leaving The Place server, Chris complains about her, as well as Naught and Kyle, making racist comments about Nazis. MKR then states that she doesn't regret her "dark or even cringey sense of humor".
↑ Has falsely claimed Praetor planned to use a taser on Chris despite the Taser Discussion call indicating Praetor was opposed to it.Has also falsely claimed The WCT "probably [wanted] Chris to kill himself in a similar manner [to Randy Stair]"[5] in response to The WCT and Chris leaving her group's Discord server. On top of that, MKR came to believe that Chris didn't appreciate her enough when he started talking to the Praetors.Claimed to GiBi that The WCT wanted to use Chris to become famous.[6]
