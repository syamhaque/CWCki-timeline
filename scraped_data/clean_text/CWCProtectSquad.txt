A profile picture Chris used in April 2018 until May 2018, drawn by Tings Tingz.
The CWCProtectSquad were a group of enablers and weens role-playing as fans who are starved for attention to the point that they frequently tweet to Chris and his orbiters over Twitter. Chris has added them to his Twitter friend list as they shower him with words of encouragement, fanart and even money.

Beginning
The floodgates opened during August 2017, seemingly due to Chris using NightStar2891, a sockpuppet account, which encouraged weens to create their own character accounts to troll Chris's followers into thinking they are him.

Amy
@LittleAmyChan
Account created 16 August 2017
Appears to be the spokesperson and de facto leader of the CWCProtectSquad. Her modus operandi is to shower unconditional positive regards
towards Chris. She got Chris's attention with a drawing that had the hashtag #CWCProtectSquad. CWCProtectSquad was pretty much the Twitter version of Sonichu Girls, as all its members were supposed to be young female artists that would stand up for or support Chris when needed.
On 10 May 2018, During the dallfall of CWCprotectSquad, LittleAmyChan sent Chris a private video, which Chris posted the video on his Twitter and when asked why, he basically said littleAmyChan looked like a man pretending to be a women and is probably a troll based on that alone. LittleAmyChan still followed him afterwards and still maintains the facade.
