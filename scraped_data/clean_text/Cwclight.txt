NEW Official Rosechu Medallion, Handmade by CWC
Listed 11 November 2024[1]
Price: $80
By popular request, here is the Rosechu Medallion, and updated with the yellow cheeks that Rosey always had but has become prominent in recent years.
The story of the lost OG (hand-crafted) Rosechu Medallion was that it was meant to be for my future sweetheart to-be, but then the past theoretical ex, Blanca Weiss, conned me out of it.
But the energy of it still resonates in the actual sweetheart-to-be along with the innate alternate Sonichu form inside her to be revealed.
It was clear that back then the intentions and goals were not as clear to me as they are now, and I was clouded with my share of desire for authentic mutual compassion, companionship and appreciation of each other.
And thus why the loss of those OG hand-made medallions was evident and not meant to be long-term, unlike the Sonichu Medallion I continue to wear today.
So, enjoy this medallion as a compliment with the offered Sonichu Medallions to connect you with your partner, regardless of physical gender and gender identity.
Fortunately, there are male Rosechus and female Sonichus in the species.
These medallions are equally blessed by me and my energy. All are handmade and autographed on the back with an Authenticity Certificate as well.

Dating for Dummies 3rd Edition 2011 - Autographed Guide
Listed 20 September 2024
Price: $100
I have actually purchased this book, once upon a time, about a couple of decades ago.
I only had read the tips that I felt I needed; I did not read the entire book.
Yet a lot of the advice in this book is still very much Common Sense applicable to today's standards, In Person and Friendship First and Foremost when developing a deep, authentic mutual relationship with your chosen, or more encouraged destined partner as you have seen them in your dreams at a younger age and over the years.
And I add, be sure to know and love yourself with soul searching, so you can manifest the same from your partner.
Also, write a list of the ideal characteristics you'd like in your partner; doing so is essentially making a sincere prayer to manifest them before you eventually.
Patience and awareness is worth it.
If you find many Dej'a Vu moments with them, then You Deeply, Authentically Know it was meant to be and to pursue keeping the relationship strong and alive as best as you can without letting them go to someone else.
Let Light Power and better Intuition guide you on this.
First Sonic the Hedgehog drawing by JCWCSP
Listed 20 September 2024
Price: $1,000
I drew this lovely simple piece back in mid to late 1991 shortly after Sonic inspired me from a Sega Genesis demo unit at the Sears in Fashion Square Shopping Center.
I had not signed it when I drew it, but I channeled my past self and signed it, albeit with the earlier name, as opposed to my present name of Christian at the time.
This drawing had been preserved in a plastic picture frame all of this time.
I realize and appreciate the irony of the arm colour used at the time when this was drawn. Sonic's arms are, and always have been, tan in colour, regardless.
I reiterate that this was drawn in 1991 after I had turned 9 years old and after feeling the resonance after playing Sonic the Hedgehog for the very first time at the Sears in Fashion Square Shopping Center. Comes with drawing and authenticity certificate.

Comes with building as pictured with Authenticity Certificate. Most pieces are permanently fused together.

Listed 20 September 2024
Price: $200 (sold out)
I had built the stud-to-stud replica of Heartlake High School, dedicated it to Manchester High School with internals and details inspired by M.H.S.
The top floor of the building melted in the housefire of January 10, 2014.
This was the third floor of the original building.
There are more melted pieces that will be identified and offered soon enough.
But it does make for a good art display piece, regardless.
Since the event, the school, with the first floor being salvageable, was reconstructed with new parts, bricks and pieces acquired with the help of State Farm Insurance and the good LEGO people. Comes with Authenticity Certificate. Most pieces are now fused together permanently.

Couple of personal favourites from that channel were "That Happy Feeling" from Bert Kaempfert, and this one song where I remember the tune and one lyric, "Time is now; you got to let it go.

Glen Miller + 2 disc Album - Original CD Burned and Decorated by JCWCSP
Listed 20 September 2024
Price: $120 ($100 sale)
For a little while, Mister C., my father, wanted more music for his collection that was spanned through records, 8-Track, audio cassettes, VHS tapes and some CDs.
For Personal and Private use, he asked me to borrow a few audio media from the library, since I figured out how to burn CDs and DVDs back about almost two decades ago or so.
This disc was one of which.
This is still considered Mix Tape media as such.
Also, I am a fan of Mister Glen Miller and his band; they made classic greats and covers that were part of what I grew up with.

Your eyes do not deceive you, for I am, indeed, selling my XBox One and games. The console has been factory reset and works great. It comes complete with power cord, controller and cable, HDMI cable and no less than 16 games. Plus, as shown in the photos, I have personally signed the console with a silver sharpie.
