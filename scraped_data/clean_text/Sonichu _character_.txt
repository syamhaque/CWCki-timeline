Chris was brainwashed into believing that Sonichu was born on 4/20/1992, shares a birthday with Adolf Hitler, and that Chris would need to sodomize him (either in a drawing[1] or real life) to conceive Crystal.[2]

Sonichu, also known as Sonichu Prime, is the titular and intended primary protagonist of Christian Weston Chandler's world-renowned comic. He is a combination of Sonic the Hedgehog and Pikachu and is also Chris's imaginary son/friend. He goes on adventures and "zaps to the extreme", in Chris's own words. Sonichu Prime's species, Sonichu, evolves from a Sonee, and can evolve into either Metonic or Ultra Sonichu. (Even though the original Sonichu mutated from Pikachu, which just makes the Sonichu comic even more convoluted.)
Sonichu is only nominally the protagonist and central character of the comic series, as he was swiftly pushed aside for Chris as soon as the comic became an allegory for real-life situations. Interestingly, Chris has consistently requested that he voice himself and Sonichu in hypothetical adaptations of his work, even in the event that he was able to get professional voice actors to voice his other characters.
Having humble beginnings as an innocent drawing to skirt around the rules of a high school assignment – Chris couldn't use copyrighted character Sonic the Hedgehog, so he improvised by... combining Sonic with Pikachu, another copyrighted character that the teacher didn't notice – Sonichu has slowly morphed into an all-encompassing obsession. The character became the pride and joy of Chris as he progressively inserted him into a variety of things, from a medallion made in the character's image that he'd proudly wear in public to a signature on the order to euthanize his elderly pet dog.
Even as Chris replaced his own character as the protagonist of the comic, the character and its lore expanded greatly into Chris's idea to get his "original" character turned into a sustainable franchise. Years after Chris's glory days on the internet, Chris was brainwashed into thinking that his creation was real, and that he and his family were all half-Sonichu. This line of thinking progressed to its natural conclusion in 2020, as due to his inability to attend BABSCon in the wake of the Coronavirus pandemic, Chris resorted to claiming that he was possessed by Sonichu while he possessed Sonichu's body in Dimension C-197 to attend BABScon as planned in that timeline as a coping mechanism. Even though the intended dates for that convention have come and passed, Chris would continue to roleplay as Sonichu for ten full months until stopping on 25 February 2021[5], thanks to the influence of an enabler.[6]

Creation and development
The first drawing of Sonichu, circa 2000, from one of Chris's homemade Pokémon cards[7]
The CD cover in question, Christian's Favorite Hits![8]
Chris revealed on his Wikipedia page that Sonichu is a product of a computer graphics class. In March 2000, Chris had to create a CD album cover for an assignment. Despite being a ridiculously simple project, with infinite possibilities for a possible CD cover, Chris still struggled with the assignment, because he could not use copyrighted characters. It seemed as if Chris's usual technique of "cover everything with shitty video game characters" wouldn't work this time... But then, inspiration struck:
“
Then it dawned on me at that moment after lunch, much like the random creation of Bionic the Hedgehog during Basketball Practice in my Freshman Year, Sonichu just bursted right into my imagination. A blur at first, but then it all became more clear and came together very well. So, as swiftly as the creation of Bionic, I drew Sonichu on paper from imagination, then I drew him on my currently open Photoshop program.
After checking with Miss. Chalifoux and my father, who is BIG on copyrights and whatnot; SONICHU WAS LEGAL THEN, and STILL IS and ONLY MINE! So, soon after, the CD-Cover was made, printed and Passed with an A+ Grade. :D
”
Chris on the origin of Sonichu, and why the public school system has failed us[9]
Thus, an Internet legend, Sonichu, was born.
It is universally assumed that Sonichu’s name is an obvious portmanteau. Surprisingly, in an obscure footnote of Christory, Chris himself has stated that "Sonichu" is actually the anglicisation of Sonic's Japanese name, Sonikku.[10] This version of events should be taken with a grain of salt, however, as this claim was made while Chris was propping up his character's originality.
Chris created the CWC's Sonichu Site! five months after the character's creation, in August 2000. A few drawings of Sonichu appeared on the site, mostly on homemade Pokémon cards and other various sundry shit.
The comic began shortly thereafter: Chris drew a few short comics in the following four years which eventually appeared in Sonichu #0. The comic was completed and released in 2005, five years after Sonichu's conception (and to think people bitch about waiting a few months for new comics to come out…)
Sonichu's character design has changed little since Chris' first ill-inspired scrawling. Due to Megan's influence (read: wanting her sweet, wet china), Sonichu took on a more anime-like appearance. However, despite drawing Sonichu for two decades, Chris has somehow managed to maintain the drawing skills of a six-year-old.
Over time, Chris's improvised drawing went from being a small part of his life to get around a creative impasse to an unhealthy obsession. He started including the character wherever he could, down to wearing the medallion and expecting everyone to know what his creation is. As of late, he came up with the concept of spirit possession and spent almost a year claiming to be Sonichu in Chris's body.

Sonichu's background, Sonichu's News Dash! #2
What would later become known as "Sonichu" hatched as a Pichu on 17 March 1988,[3] which interestingly enough is also the exact birth date of Chris's cherished dog Patti.[11] It would eventually evolve into a Pikachu on 26 February 1994.[3]

Sonichu #0
Our hero's story began as the Perfect Chaos Monster lay siege to the town of Station Square. Sonic the Hedgehog attempted to defeat the creature using the six Seven (though two are identical) Chaos Emeralds to transform into Super Sonic. In the midst of this epic battle, Sonic bumped into a Pikachu who happened upon the scene. This collision somehow mutated the Pikachu so that it evolved to possess the physical characteristics and abilities of Sonic (Sonic himself was unchanged). After assisting with the defeat of the Perfect Chaos Monster, the ex-Pikachu declared himself to be a new species of Pokémon: Sonichu.
After his transformation, he ran back to his parents' nest, where he found that they had been caught by Pokémon trainers. Showing the same callousness his creator does after a great loss, Sonichu made no attempt to find them, nor did he never mention them again. He went on to refer to Chris as his father.[12]
While Sonichu had gained new abilities from his transformation, his larger size made it impractical for him to forage for nuts and berries in the forest. Upon discovering Rosechu in the woods, he hoped to beg for food from her trainer, Kel and thus stalked Rosechu back to her and Kel's cabin, whereupon he introduced himself to them. Rosechu was immediately attracted to Sonichu for such qualities as being unable to name his favorite color. Their whirlwind romance was quickly consummated, and the two became passionate lovers. After rescuing Rosechu from Naitsirhc at CWCville Mall, Sonichu became recognized as the hero of the city. CWCville's Mayor, Christian Weston Chandler, congratulated him for his victory; Sonichu in turn commended his creator's work on the Sonichu comics and wished him luck in his Love Quest.
Sonichu #1
Although Naitsirhc had been defeated, he succeeded in obtaining a sample of Sonichu's DNA which his adopted father, Giovanni, and Doctor Robotnik used to create Black Sonichu. Black Sonichu (unironically dubbed Blachu) was sent to capture Rosechu to lure Sonichu into a trap; however Giovanni and Robotnik did not reckon on Sonichu joining forces with Sonic. Together they overwhelmed both Blachu and Metal Sonichu to rescue Rosechu, who later met Amy Rose.
Sonichu #2
One day while zapping to the extreme, Sonichu encountered The Destiny Cave, a mysterious Cherokian chamber guarded by an old man. The keeper of the Destiny Cave explained that Sonichu was the prophesied creature whose master would enter the cave and receive special powers. Sonichu reported this to Christian, and took him back to the cave. There, they learned the Anchuent Prophecy, which revealed that Chris is the reincarnation of his Cherokian ancestor and foretold of the release of an ancient evil. Sonichu blamed himself for allowing this evil force to escape, but Chris reassured him. After Chris took on the powers of Chris-chan Sonichu, transforming him into a hedgehog, Sonichu helped him adjust to his new powers and body. No sooner had Chris-Chan mastered these abilities when he and his son were ambushed by Wes-Li Sonichu, the reincarnation of the head of the Wasabi Clan, who sought to renew the hostilities between the Wasabis and Cherokees. Saramah Rosechu, the reincarnation of the wife of Chris's ancestor, intervened to stop the battle. Sonichu and these three prophesied hedgehogs formed a tenuous alliance to defeat a giant golem monster summoned by Mary Lee Walsh and Count Graduon.
Sonichu #3
When Sonichu learned of Blachu's attempt to steal the Legendary Master Sunstone, he zapped to the scene of the crime, only to discover five other electric hedgehog Pokémon born from eggs dropped by the Chaotic Rainbow. Sonichu led this newly formed Chaotic Combo into battle against Blachu, defeating him utterly.
Sonichu #4
During the third Sub-Episode, Sonichu serves as a backup/deus ex machina for Chris's battle against Mary Lee Walsh, entering in to save Chris after he gets his butt kicked. Sonichu joins Chris in delivering the final blow to Walsh, unleashing a Thunder attack that combines with Chris's Curse-ye-ha-me-ha to seemingly vaporize her.
Sonichu #5
While Christian and Sonichu were chillin' at the mall, Mary Lee Walsh's forces attacked CWCville, prompting Christian to summon the Chaotic Combo and transform into Chrs-Chan Pure with his twin sister.
Sonichu contributed relatively little to this battle, as Chris did most of the heavy lifting. In the aftermath of the attack, during which Crystal was imprisoned in Count Graduon's Dark Mirror Hole, Sonichu confided to Rosechu about dreams of seeing his creator with long hair in a mirror.
Sonichu #6
When Reldnahc Ha-Taque and Black Sonichu attacked CWCville Mall, Sonichu and Magi-Chan accompanied Chris in responding to the emergency. Sonichu largely hung back as Chris battled his homosexual evil twin. Magi-Chan and Sonichu ask Blake what he knows about Naitsirhc's transformation, but don't get much useful information.
Sonichu #7
After the threat of Reldnahc was eliminated, Chris, Magi-Chan, and Sonichu pooled their efforts to retrieve one of the seven Sonichu Balls from 1996. Magi-chan created a sphere to contain them, which Sonichu's tremendous speed would accelerate backwards through time. Although they successfully obtained the Sonichu Ball and returned to the present, Chris was lost in the time stream. Sonichu was disheartened by the disappearance of his father, but was able to console Rosechu so that she would be willing to have sex with him.
Sonichu #8
The next day, after hours of vigorous sexual intercourse, Sonichu and Rosechu discovered the website 4-cent_garbage.com spreading slanderous lies about them and their friends. Most notably, the site had pictures of Rosechu with a penis -- pictures which caused Sonichu to collapse into violent nausea. Outraged, the couple stormed the 4-cent_garbage.com building to confront Jason Kendrick Howell. When Howell refused to remove the offending content from his website, Sonichu attacked him in an rage, but was easily defeated. It instead fell to Rosechu to teach Howell a lesson by shoving her breasts and pussy in his face while eating his brain.
During Spring Break, Sonichu was briefly seen talking to Rosechu and surfing.
Sonichu #9
At the start of the issue, Sonichu is staring at his wife's panties like a horny mutt when he decides to tell her about some "not so good news" he read on the internet. Sonichu complains that a bunch of homos made a balloon of him for a gay pride parade. Sonichu then rants about how totally straight he and everyone else in Cwcville is before raging like a lunatic and breaking a bunch of shit in the garage. Rosechu, instead of reacting with shock or being upset about the stuff he just carelessly broke, just smiles like a Stepford Wife and says some feel-good nonsense. When they find out that forces of evil have attacked CWCville, the two run off to fight off the villains.
Sonichu and Rosechu fight off Jerkops together, but Rosechu's battle confidence is short-lived as she is quickly captured by Robotnik and Giovanni. Sonichu stalls Giovanni long enough for Bionic to come in and save him. Sonichu sobs incoherently over his wife, who wasn't even unconcious let alone seriously injured. Sonichu and his wife rushed off to face the evil Mary Lee Walsh, crying over the death of Ivy on the way over, before Sonichu finally battles Mary Lee Walsh one-on-one. When granted the opportunity to finish the primary villain once and for all, Sonichu released her in order to allow his father to grab all the glory of defeating her in the next issue.
Sonichu #10
Sonichu shows up to water down the Asperchu characters. For some reason, Chris saw fit to have the Asperchu characters treat him and Sonichu as divine beings.
After Chris's return from the Time Void, Sonichu returned to his role as second fiddle to Chris. He first appears as part of Chris's band as they play a song about Power Rangers which, somehow, causes the 4-cent_garbage.com building to collapse. Later, after Chris wipes out the homos, Sonichu uses the Sonichu Balls alongside Chris, turning into Ultra Sonichu. Sonichu is sent to RuleCWC and awakens Zelina Rosechu with his Mary Sue powers. He rejoins Chris at Alec Benson Leary's house, where Sonichu rids Alec's characters of their Asperger's and homosexuality, turning them into another group of bland, personality-less Sonic fan characters. Returning to CWCville, Sonichu uses the last of his power to free the Jerkops from Mary Lee Walsh's brainwashing. Finally, after the death of Simonla, Sonichu served as "plaintif"[sic]/witness in the mock trial of the Asperpedia Four. After the predetermined verdict, Sonichu took part in Alec's brutal execution, angrily insisting that he wasn't gay.
Sonichu #11
In Episode 22, Sonichu is seen preparing for Christmas, doing things like hanging stocking above the fireplace with his son Robee, going to the supermarket, and clearing snow off of his lawn. Later on, Sonichu and Robee encounter a homeless woman and decide, against the supposed spirit of Christmas the two had, to send her to a soup hotel. Sonichu is then seen watching the Nativity Play, of which his daughter Christine is the star as the Virgin Mary. However, she suddenly evolves, and Sonichu is sent home by Rosechu to get some of her clothes. Finally, Sonichu is among the group of Electric Hedgehog Pokémon to visit Chris, who has become a Tomgirl.
In Episode 24, Sonichu encounters Sonic the Hedgehog, who, unbeknownst to him, is actually Silvana in disguise. The two converse, with Sonichu talking about the evolution of his other daughter Cera as well as Robee, and Chris's transformation into a Tomgirl, somehow shattering the Sonichu Balls in the process. Sonichu does not take part in these flashbacks until the end, where he transforms into Ultra Sonichu thanks to the newly formed Sonichite, created after the Sonichu Balls were shattered.
Sonichu decides to end the conversation until after lunch, extending the storyline into the next issue.
Sonichu #12
In most of Issue 12, Sonichu is once again relegated to the role of side character while his creator does all the important stuff. The alternate cover implies there's going to be some tension between Sonichu and his son after his transition, but that never comes up. In spite of all this, he has a central role for the second part of Episode 25. Continuing from where the comic left off last time, Sonichu tells Sonic (who is actually Silvana disguised as Sonic because Chris believes somehow this circumvents copyright) about his wedding to Rosechu.
The story of Sonichu's wedding is mostly ripped off from a fan comic, with the villain removed and all the tension and conflict taken out. When Rosechu accidentally walks in on Sonichu and a naked Bubbles (a fairly tense and admittedly melodramatic moment in the original comic) she simply laughs instead of becoming angry. The wedding continues without incident, and the scene simply ends.
Back in the present, Sonichu explains the two had their honeymoon at a local hotel (an allusion to Chris and Ivy's wedding comic) and rambles about how his wedding was an inspiration to millions of people and he loves all the fanart and stories they make, but gets uncomfortable with the more "heavy" art. He then segues this into a story of how Rosechu injured herself in 2008, resulting in her becoming morbidly obese during bedrest. Though his daughter shows concern, Sonichu doesn't seem to give a shit at all. This story was written entirely to indulge Chris' then-girlfriend Jessica Quinn's disgusting fat fetish.[13]
Sonichu has a dream where Count Graduon kidnaps Chris and Rosechu and he's forced to endure a gauntlet of challenges, the first of which is swimming through a river of pickle brine. Even though Sonichu despises pickles, he still turns into a big fat slag. The sight of a absurdly fat Sonichu with manboobs will haunt the dreams of many for years. Sonichu immediately loses the weight in the next challenge, where he's forced to crawl through a Freudian-looking tunnel. Finally, he's given two doors: one to save Chris, and one to save Rosechu. He chooses Rosechu, but they both easily save Chris after, and they all have a group hug. This dream is finally brought to an end when Sonichu is crushed and nearly suffocated under his fat wife's form. Everything returns to normal in two weeks.
Sonichu #13
This issue is notable for Sonichu in that it's the first official acknowledgement that Sonichu is no longer the main character. Chris has now declared that the comic is "Our Story." Sonichu is one of the members of the CWCville Defense Force who battle against the new villains pushed into the comic by the Idea Guys, though his role in the battle is minimal at best. Sonichu is sent to ancient Africa by Akan. He is rescued by Emmet Brown who sends sends him back to the future. However, Sonichu is teleported to the freezer of a Country Cookin and gets locked inside. Later, Chris sends Sonichu into hiding during the Nazi invasion of CWCville, but he is captured until he's eventually rescued by Chris.
Chris' neglect of Sonichu, upstaging him in his own comic and all the horrific things that happened during the war cause Sonichu to have a mental breakdown and shoot up the CWCville mall. Chris intervenes and Sonichu believes the CPU Goddesses have brainwashed Chris into a cult(an unsettling mirror of the Idea Guys putting all this weird shit in Chris' head and influencing him to fuck his fantasy world up.) to calm him down, Chris mind-melds with Sonichu and shows him his memories, proving the CPUs aren't brainwashing him . Chris tearfully hugs his "son" and begs him to come back to him. Any potential sentimentality is thrown out the window when Chris starts incestuously making out with Sonichu, in a move he admits is sexual. It gets even worse when Sonichu angrily declares that he's turned on and tries to rape Chris, due to Chris' past lust "infecting" him. Sonichu slips it in there, but Chris pushes him off, fists him until he cums and ties him up, declaring he'll be punished later. What exactly this "punishment" entails is never shown. Later, Sonichu is one of the many characters who help "clean up" CWCville and reverse the damage of the past events and attends Chris' wedding.
Sonichu #14
Issue #14 is currently incomplete, but so far this issue is the first to not feature or even mention Sonichu, bringing his demotion to supporting cast member to a new low.
The issue is written as a continuation of the last, with Chris rambling off about things he did in C-197 and the real world, blurring the line between which is which.
Sonichu #0 HD
In a stunning and bold new leap for this comic called "Sonichu" it's actually about the character Sonichu. The story is mostly a retelling of Sonichu #0 with Chris detailing some things that were glossed over the first time around, heavily plagiarizing the fancomic Rosechu's Story in the process. For good measure, Chris also mixes in his inane Dimensional Merge BS in there because he can't go for more than ten minutes without rambling about it. It largely details the courting process between Sonichu and Rosechu, though the issue more heavily focuses on her side than his.
Sonichu #16
Sonichu appears prominently on the cover of Issue 16 racing towards the reader, but in the four pages that have been released he hasn't actually appeared. It's unknown what direction this issue will eventually take or if anything from what we've seen will remain.
Other appearances
This article is still yet to be completed due to stress. We get a lot of stressful torture in our lives that makes us crash into slumber. Given that inspiration is a big variable, and we may have been lacking of it, this article will be completed as soon as possible, at our own pace... HONEST!
As Chris's pride and joy, Sonichu is often featured in many of Chris's other creations. Sonichu is a founding member of Christian and the Hedgehog Boys, with him and Blake being the only Sonichu characters to have this distinction.
Sonichu has also made an appearance drawn in marker on Chris's duck.
Characteristics and personal life
MY ASS HAS BEEN REPLACED WITH FIRE!
Sonichu's hobbies include running, surfing and chillin'. He enjoys outdoor activities and the scenery around him. He appears to be undecided on whether his favorite color is yellow or blue.
He is deeply in love with his sweet-bolt, Rosechu, with whom he lives at a subdivision at 14 Brunchville Lane, CWCville, Virginia, 02024-1982. Sonichu is normally rather calm and collected, but when Rosechu's reputation is besmirched he flies into unthinking rage and/or vomits profusely. Sonichu is rarely seen away from Rosechu's side, and it is possible that his relationship with her has become overly possessive and abusive behind closed doors.
"Chris almighty, I zap to the extreme all fucking day, can't I have a goddamn can of Reeb and watch TV, woman?"
Despite maintaining an appearance of living in carnal sin, Sonichu and Rosechu have been secretly married since March 17, 2006[14] (a possible retcon by Chris to address complaints about Sonichu and Rosechu having sex outside of marriage). The two have gone to great lengths to keep it under wraps, wearing gloves over their wedding rings and keeping their three children — Cerah (potentially named after Sarah Hammer, Sarah Jackson, PandaHalo or Sarah May; take your pick), Robbie (most likely named after the retarded hero from The Adventures of The American Rabbit, or the not-so-retarded hero of the Chandler household), and Christine (one guess) — hidden in the attic like so many flowers. Whatever sordid reason for burying their union remains a mystery. It has become rapidly apparent that Christian believes that his characters exist outside the confines of his scented marker universe, though one wonders if a personage as bland and poorly-developed as Wild Sonichu could truly survive in our harsh world.
Since Chris is a rather closed-minded individual and requires all good people in his comics to be as he is, Sonichu, Rosechu and most likely their three abominations are Protestant Christians.
Although many of his friends are members of his own species, his closest friend is his father and creator, Christian Weston Chandler. As the Sonichu series has shifted its focus from the titular character to its writer, Sonichu's role has been that of Christian's closest confident as he struggles to persevere in his Love Quest and endure the Stressful Torture of the internet bullies. When Giovanni asked Sonichu to declare Reldnahc the new Mayor of CWCville in exchange for Rosechu's life, he chose to defend Christian's mayoral throne without hesitation.[15] Like father, like son.
Chris has revealed that Sonichu's son, Robbie Sonee, is transgender.[16] As of 25 August 2014, Chris claims Sonichu is still 100% straight,[17] but with the Idea Guy-retcon of Rosechu coming out as transgender, his sexuality can be questioned.
Voice
Sonichu's voice, as Chris would be his ideal candidate for a voice actor should there ever be a Sonichu cartoon, is more or less Chris's voice but in a slightly higher tone.[18]
Chris provided an example of Sonichu's voice in Update: 2/25/16.
More samples were recorded for a modded Sonichu character in Sonic World.
Sexual prowess
Sonichu's luck with the ladies apparently predates his transformation into an Electric Hedgehog Pokémon, as his CWCipedia biography notes that when he was still a Pikachu he made out with a Jigglypuff.[3]. Also, in Sonichu 8, Jiggliami says she used to have a Pikachu boyfriend. This raises some very disturbing implications, as the CWCipedia article also gives 1988 as the year of his birth and 1998 as the year in which he became Sonichu, meaning he could have not been older than 10 years at the time of said liaison.
Chris has provided very intense details about Sonichu and Rosechu's anatomy.[19] When erect, Sonichu's pickle is easily seven inches (18 cm) long, and often ruptures the condoms he uses when 69-ing his beloved Rosechu.[15]
Powers, abilities and weaknesses
Sonichu's stats. You know, for all the people who give a damn.
Aside from the obvious super-speed and body-spinning powers transferred to him from Sonic, Sonichu also possesses many powers based on his original Pikachu form, most notably his lightning and thunder attacks. Some of his special attacks include:
Sky Uppercut: Jumping punch to the head from below, presumably similar in fashion to the Shoryuken from the Street Fighter games.
Mega Kick: A martial arts-style kick, sometimes done in midair.
Double Team: The attacker quickly creates multiple false duplicates of themselves, disguising the real one temporarily and allowing them an opportunity to attack whilst the target is confused.
Spin Dash: Attacker curls into a ball and spins on the spot, before releasing and hurtling directly into the victim in a high-speed rolling attack. In the original games where this move came from, it was capable of breaking barriers, but this has yet to be seen in the comics.
Zap Cannonball: Attacker creates a ball of pure electrical energy in their hands, before thrusting their palms forward to fire it at the victim, in a similar fashion to the Hadouken from the Street Fighter games, or the Thunder Strike from Mega Man 7.
Iron Tail: Attacker swings his tail at the victim to hit them in a slapping attack.
Mud Slap: Attacker kicks conveniently placed mud to the victim's eyes to lower their accuracy.
Thunderbolt: Attacker charges up electrical power in body, before releasing it at the victim in the form of a long-ranged bolt of electricity.
Thunder: Attacker charges up electrical power, and uses it to summon lighting bolts down to the victim whilst simultaneously firing off electricity for a powerful lightning attack.
Sonichu may well possess other special powers that have only been utilized during the scenes where he is off-panel, while Chris takes over the story.
Interestingly, it is said that Sonichu and Blake are virtually the same. That being said, if one takes Blake's training in Sonichu #1 seriously, then that would mean that Sonichu is actually slower than Sonic. Blake's given speed was 200 km/h (124 mph), much slower than Sonic, who can apparently hit Mach 1 (1,225 km/h / 761 mph) unassisted (so far, the best Sega has been able to show in-game is around 300 mph (483 km/h) in Sonic Unleashed). Even more, it is said that Blake can reach a spinning power of 200 rpm (which gives us a speed of about 11 miles per hour), which is barely enough to get a cool breeze. (However, in Sonichu's News Dash! #2 Chris claimed that Sonichu can go faster than the speed of sound.)
Sonichu has a literally paralyzing allergy to pickles, and eating too much of them can make him swell like a balloon.[17]
Sonichu as a Mary Sue
Sonichu is as straight as Chris.
Aside from being an unoriginal Sonic recolor that blatantly violates international copyright laws, one of the chief traits of Sonichu that drew trolls to Chris is that Sonichu is a Mary Sue. In other words, he is an obvious avatar for Chris's personal power fantasies.
When the comics don't focus on Chris himself, they still manage to focus on Sonichu, who serves as Chris's idealized version of himself. Unlike Chris, Sonichu has a girlfriend whom he met, fell in love with, and drew into a meaningful relationship in a few hours' time; is agile, good looking, and loved by everyone; and despite his success, he somehow manages to "admire" Chris.
A notable instance of Sonichu as a Mary Sue is in Sonichu #8, where Sonichu merely stands in for Chris as he fights the trolls during the battle with 4-cent_garbage.com. The fact that Sonichu ultimately gets his ass kicked and has to be saved by his sweetheart just adds another level to this dumbfuckery.
Sonichu as a coping mechanism
Main article: Spirit possession
Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, many large gatherings were shut down. One of these was BABSCon, a My Little Pony convention that Chris had been interested in attending. As a result of this, he returned to his previous coping mechanism of body swapping, which saw him believe that he had swapped souls with Magi-Chan. This time, Chris declared in a Twitter post on 15 April 2020 that he had swapped bodies with Sonichu:
“
Anyway. Mama successfully attended BABSCon in C-197 the past weekend and had a good time with some of her friends from 1218, as well as Everyone else there in attendance, including Dr Wolf and his friends.
”
"Sonichu" on Chris's refusal to accept situations that don't appeal to him.
Throughout the rest of the year into 2021, Chris continued to roleplay as Sonichu, temporarily dropping the kayfabe on 24 September in order to provide the lyrics to "Ride or Die" in one of the Discord Q&A's (albeit claiming to be a "Dimension 1214" version of himself). This behavior continued for quite some time until an enabler named KwaiiSandbag pretended to be a psychic, and helped Chris escape his own delusion by safely facilitating a reversal of the body-swap. Finally, Chris gave up the act, announcing his grand return on Twitter on 25 February.

Sonicha Sonichu Primera is the female version of Sonichu from the genderbent dimension, first mentioned in October 2020, after Chris was inspired by seeing fanmade genderbent versions of Sonic and Tails in the game Sonic World.
Chris appears to consider her a sex symbol. During his phase of role-playing as Sonichu and pondering Sonicha, Chris remarked that "I ended up realizing that had I been born a female Sonee, I might have had a really hot bod that almost puts my ol’ bod to shame; Almost."[20] In artwork he drew of her, Sonicha is depicted wearing a sports bra and shorts, revealing her midriff.
