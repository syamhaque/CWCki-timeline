================================================================================

Correction of EX relationship status is a video Chris uploaded on 10 August 2011. Chris uses this video to clarify his references to The Wallflower in previous videos as his ex-girlfriend, instead insisting that she was simply a friend who is female, who he is no longer friends with. Chris also claimed that he has found a new sweetheart. Trolls and Chris watchers wondered as to whether or not this was true or that Chris was just lying. A half a year later a couple of videos Chris made for Jackie around the same time Correction of EX relationship status was made were leaked.[1] From these evidence we can infer that Jackie was the mysterious girlfriend Chris referred to.

**Normally, I would not mind a "Daria Morgandorfer" like "Wallflower", but after how COLD she was to me, and spooking me bad today, I would not want to have anything to do with her even if she did a COMPLETE emotional 180.

Hello! I am making this, uh, additional video on the side to, uh, note a correction. Uh, in the recent-uh, in the recent video, where I mentioned that, uh, [The Wallflower] was my ex-girlfriend, I did not mean that the way it sounded. I meant the term loosely in that she was a girl, and that she was a friend of mine, but then because of what happened soon after, uh, or near the end of the friendship, she dumped me as a friend, and doesn't want- any have- want anything to do with me ever again.
And, uh, with that aside, I would like to, uh, furder resu- furder resume the, uh, my revenge on the, uh, trolls, because everybody knows what they have done against me. My family, my, uh, friends, and the few I have around here, and uh, my con-my congregation at the church, they're all- they all back me up on this, including my- including my girlfriend whose name I will not be re- be revealing at this time... yeah.
And, uh, also, uh, just an additional note to, uh, Don over there. Uh, in-uh, if he wants to, uh, keep me updated, uh, more quickly, instead of, uh, recording new videos, he may con- he may still contact me at my AOL address, of which, uh, him, as well as the majority of other trolls are aware of. So they may respond to me through E-mail as well. Asi-uh, unless they wish to do a-do the video anyway to make their public apologies and whatnot... yes.
[Groans and smacks head]
Dang it, I'm losin' my- I'm losing my seriousness here, lost it there. But I am very serious on, uh, getting what-getting justice, what has-what ha-what I've been waiting for for the past four years. Anyway, with that, uh, I would also like to mention that I regularly, rarely do not check my voicemails. Pretty much, I, uh, check them when they exceed, like, ten or so. Because I am st-I am still paranoid of people abusing me over da phone lines... yeah.
So, I just leave y'all with that for... this. Have a good day.
