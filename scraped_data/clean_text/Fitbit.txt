On 30 July 2018, Chris took a walk to the post office and then back, a distance of several miles, as his car was in for repairs. At the end of his walk, he displayed his Fitbit screen which read 23,000 steps gained.
On 8 January 2019, displeased with his weight, Chris tweeted about cheating the Fitbit's monitoring, by hopping off his smart scale before the data could sync.[2]
On 24 February 2020, Chris tweeted about his Fitbit Alta HR needing to charge.[3]
On 2 September 2020, Chris, hopeful for signs of the Dimensional Merge, claimed he'd experienced an increase in power and vibrations the previous night while nearly asleep. However, he checked his Fitbit and found that it contradicted his feelings by reporting a normal level of sleep and heart activity.[4]
On 19 September 2020, Chris had an emotional breakdown over Megan Schroeder after viewing her appearance in the Chris Chan VS. The Internet trailer. He went to bed at 1:30 AM but spent the night sobbing over her. Chris's Fitbit "didn’t register body rest until about 2:30, and there were awake gaps until finally falling asleep and having a dream at what felt like about 5:30 am."[5]
On 29 September 2020, Chris, feeling a high heart rate earlier in the day, checked his Fitbit which read 91 BPM. Chris thought the reading was odd.[6]
On 17 December 2020, Chris told The Place about his good night of sleep. He also noted that when he bought the Fitbit, he had set an alarm for 8:30 AM daily.[7]
On 1 March 2021, Chris posted that an anonymous donor had sent him a Fitbit Blaze. Chris was ecstatic and thanked the sender, saying he had been wanting to upgrade and that he would give his older model away.[8]
On 31 July 2021, Chris complained that he'd had a rough night of only an hour and a half of sleep, as noted by the Fitbit. He had been banned from his home by Emergency Protective Order over an incest allegation and resorted to sleeping in his car.[1]
