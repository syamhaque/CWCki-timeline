Chris in March 2012.
Chris visits Washington D.C.
March was the third month of 2012. Chris spent the majority of this month playing his newly-acquired PlayStation Vita, and little else occurred. However, this was merely a cover for his deep fear about going to prison for the 28 October 2011 incident, and potentially dying behind bars as a virgin with rage. He became determined to starve himself if he was incarcerated, and decided that he needed to lose his virginity as soon as possible. This goal was ultimately fulfilled the next month with the help of a local hooker.
