Amazon.com, Inc., doing business as Amazon, is an American multinational technology company focusing on e-commerce, cloud computing, online advertising, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence. It is considered one of the five Big Tech companies; the other four are Alphabet (parent company of Google), Apple, Meta (parent company of Facebook), and Microsoft.
Chris has posted wish lists on amazon.com. He also purchased the book Ultimate Guide to Sex and Disability from Amazon while he was engaging in incest with his mother.[1] Furthermore, a self-published fan book by Don Lashomb comparing the output of Chris with renowned modern artist Andy Warhol was published via Amazon on 19 May 2021.

Wish lists
A wish list is an online registry used for listing gifts one wants. Chris has used Amazon's wish list feature in attempts to gain gifts from his fanbase during the Financhu Crisis, listing expensive toys such as Legos and Transformers. Trolls used the Buying it Elsewhere? option to trick Chris into believing he was really getting gifts. Chris appears to be sharing the list privately with financial enablers post-2018, as some items are marked as purchased even without Chris advertising the list.
Chris has been using the same wishlist since 2015.[2]
2015
On 13 December 2015, Chris posted an Amazon.com wish list. It was filled with over a thousand dollars worth of PS4 consoles, Lego sets and Skylanders toys.
Screenshots of the wish list can be found here.
Trolls responded by spamming the "Buying this gift elsewhere?" option[3]. Chris believed that the items disappearing meant that he would be getting lots of toys for Christmas. Of course, he reacted to this supposed good fortune by making another wish list, containing over $1,000 worth of Transformers action figures, Amiibos, and DVDs.[4]
Screenshots of the second wish list can be found here.
He also requested "pretty dresses of blue or red" and gave his measurements as "44/39/40." Notably, one of the items he had marked as highest priority was the Megatron pistol, implying that the original was lost or damaged in the 2014 house fire.
2016
During February 2016, Chris begged his audience to buy him a PS4 with accessories for his birthday[5]. He did not use Amazon, saying, "the Amazon Wish List is a definite fickle."[6]
He provided a wish list with several links to stores such as GameStop and Best Buy. Notably, he had ended his "embargo" against those shops, specifically to allow his fans to go there and buy him gifts.
He tried to provide an incentive, by offering a $500 voucher for his Etsy shop:
The FIRST Person who purchases and sends me one, and I receive it Before or On February 24, 2016, I Will make and issue to the person a Big Voucher for $500 off on Cwcville Shopping. Which is equal to Ten Sonichu/Rosechu family Figures (more or less, depending on which ones), so all the person needs to pay on that order is the Shipping, and that order will definitely take up to Eight weeks for material figure acquiring, creations and certification.
After his birthday passed with no PS4, Chris uploaded Update: 2/25/16, in which he complained about the lack of gifts, saying he had only gotten empty gift cards and a non-winning lottery ticket. He concluded the video by saying, "thanks for nothing!" like a spoiled child. In March 2016, Chris claimed that he had received a PS4 from Kagney Lynn Moore. In reality, Chris had bought it himself[7].
In November 2016, Chris posted another wish list, days after making death threats against President-elect Donald Trump. He requested $859.71 worth of toys[8]. He also forbade people from sending him gift cards.
Halfway through November, Chris tweeted that he had bought several of the toys off his own wish list.[9]
On 26 November, Chris updated his wish list, removing the items he had bought from it[10]and surprisingly not adding more toys, in spite of the Help, please begging video he had made in the meantime. However, the updated wish list's links were all broken, due to Chris simply copy-and-pasting the message from an earlier post. He failed to notice, even though the post has a large Page Not Found error thumbnail on it.
2018
Chris posted a link to it in December 2018 on his twitter.

Surprisingly he still updates the same wish list from 2015.
After realising that he will just get trolled if he posts his wish list out to the public, he stopped begging people to buy him toys.
