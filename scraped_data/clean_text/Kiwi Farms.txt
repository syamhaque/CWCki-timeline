Chris comments on the 'fall' of Kiwi Farms in September 2022
Kiwi Farms (also known as KF, The Farms and Kiwi), is a
gossip forum which focuses on lolcows (people and groups whose eccentric or foolish behavior can be "milked" for amusement and laughs) in general and not just Chris. It is owned and managed by Joshua "Null" Moon, who had taken over hosting of the CWCki Forums before rebranding it into Kiwi Farms in February 2015. The new name came from the way several lolcows mispronounced "CWCki Forums".
For reasons unrelated to Chris, the forum has become extremely controversial and has frequently been a target of DDoS attacks and deplatforming efforts.[2] In the early 2020s, it found itself on and off the Clearnet and between different domain names, but remained consistently accessible via Tor. More recently, however, the site has proven more stable and has remained consistently accessible on the Clearnet.

Chris's forum account
Chris's forum avatar.
On 4 October 2017, a user going by the name "LegendaryChristorian" began a thread on the Christian Weston Chandler board on the forum. While a few speculated about it being a ween, Null, the head admin, quickly confirmed that it was indeed Chris.[3] Under this account, Chris received questions to which he responded in a livestreamed Q&A video.
His motivation for joining and holding the Q&A was to reach out to trolls and try to satiate their curiosity about his life by answering their questions, in the hopes that they wouldn't bother Jessica Quinn.[4] However, since Quinn was herself a troll, the interaction with the Farms instead proved instrumental in her breaking up with Chris on 5 October, after which he made a final, angry post on the forum before cursing it in another video.

DMs
On 16 July 2020, Chris logged into his Kiwi Farms account and had a conversation with Null. Chris, wanting to role-play, rambled for paragraphs on being possessed by Sonichu, lore involving Jacob Sockness, and the Iron Curtain. Null replied that he would not be playing along with the game.[5]
Lurking

Chris doesn't read your posts

A somewhat inaccurate line from the forum guidelines.
Chris logging in to view a thread in December 2020.
Much like with the CWCki Forums, Chris has occasionally been known to lurk on Kiwi Farms.
In May 2015, after posting some photos to Facebook showing what he believed to be progress on his gender transition, Chris viewed the forum thread on it and was elated when a user commented "he looks like a D cup now".[6]
In August 2017, Chris, feeling refreshed after his trip to BronyCon, browsed the thread on it. On Facebook, he made a few posts responding to commentary and thanking users for featuring his photos.[7] In the same month, he referred to the Random Chris Updates thread to help prove a ween was trying to impersonate Doopie.[8]
In October 2017, Chris stated that he believed Jessica Quinn was not a troll because conversations between them hadn't been leaked, and he specified that he had not seen any such leaks on the Farms.[9]
In October 2018, Chris's Twitter posted a comment in Spanish; the translated phrase being, "Magi-Chan is watching you Mariposa Electrique!" This apparently was in reference to a Kiwi Farms user known for A-logging Chris. However, due to the comment occurring during the 2018 Twitter account compromise, it's unclear if it was indeed Chris writing it.[10]
In January 2019, a Kiwi Farms thread was posted, in which logs from The Sons of the Miscreants Discord server were attached showing MKRNightVee making fun of Chris and coordinating with server members on how to approach Chris through his Hyperdimension Neptunia delusions. Tings Tingz DM'd Chris and attempted to warn him of MKR's comments, linked him to the thread, and urged him to cut ties with her. However, Chris disregarded the warning, complaining, "My head hurts."[11]
On 4 December 2020, Chris logged in to search for SNT Vs Sonichu fanfic writer Opuscon789's posts and read them, since he had been harboring a grudge against Opuscon789 over the direction of the fanfic. Chris also tried to see if ProjectSNT, an artist he was obsessing over, had a Kiwi Farms account but found she did not.[12]
On 26 December 2020, Chris logged in to view a thread on Kiwi Farms member blank's fancomic The Real Sonichu, at Naught's recommendation.[13]
Forum ratings
Chris rated several of DoopieDoOver's posts from the end of the Jessica Quinn saga, the only ones he has rated so far.

at least that would be more interesting than this god damned shitfest[14]

I know I said I wouldn't come back and post, but this whole saga is really upsetting me. While I don't agree with a lot of the trolling and fucking with him for the lulz, this is going too far. Even if it's supposed to be a "troll", this is pretty fucked up and it hurts to watch. I can't stand to see someone with a disability be emotionally abused and manipulated like this. She's not even a funny troll. She could have at least gone on the date they planned, but she dipped out because she's a pussy.
I actually really feel bad for Chris.[15]
Optimistic
At this point, do you really think he's capable of growing and learning?[16]
Other mentions by Chris
On 6 December 2020, in The Place, Chris laid out a scheme to manipulate Opuscon789 into revising SNT Vs Sonichu towards Chris's favor. He asked MKRNightVee to contact Opuscon, hoping she would then influence his writing. Chris considered that MKR might "be putting yourself at risk of being further bullied by the other Haters and taunted on the Kiwi, and whatever", but believed he would be able to exploit his relationship with Kiwi Farms owner Null, adding, "Although, all of you are already reading on the Kiwi and know Josh, so he’s kind of a buffer shield."[17] This plan did not materialize, since Naught decided to attempt to harass Opuscon via Kiwi Farms DMs instead.[18]
On 13 September 2022. Chris drew a Jail Art comic depicting a fenced-off Kiwi Farms, a reference to the deplatform campaign against the forum at the time. In a speech bubble, Chris calls Kiwi Farms a "left behind cesspool".[19]
In The Chris Chan Interview from 16 January 2024, Chris thanked host Keffals for taking Kiwi Farms down a "massive peg", again referencing the deplatform campaign which Keffals had helped lead.
