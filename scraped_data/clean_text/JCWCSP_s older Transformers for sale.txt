This just an update video letting all of you know that I am selling all of the OLDER Transformers Figures in my collection. I am doing this to make space, and more importantly to raise money to completely pay off the Mortgage on the old Sonichu Temple. ONLY what you see in this video will be offered, as well as the Alternators shown in the Short that is now public alongside the upload of this video.
**I Clarify: This ONLY includes what is shown in this video, which includes the classic Gobots figures, Transformers G1, G2, Beast Wars, Armada, Energon, Cybertron, Generations, Classics, (Michael Bay) Movies, Animated, Prime, RID (2016), McDonald's, and Seaspray from Titans Return, as well as Siege Ultra Magnus and (Cybertron) Optimus Prime; ONLY those from the newer sets are for sale; nothing more.**
**Absolutely NONE of my copies of the Transformers Legacy United Merged Figures are for sale. I reiterate: I am Not Selling any of my Transformers Legacy United Merged Figures.**
Thank you all for your consideration. Have a blessed, safe day.

Transcript
Hey everybody, Jesus Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu Prime here once again, and I'm just giving y'all a little bit of an update that, uh, I'm cleaning up and I'm, uh, actually getting rid of a few old toys of mine, so... yep. I'm starting things off with just my c- the small collection of alternators as you can see right here. And, uh, two of these- well, more than two, actually did survive the, uh, house fire. You can still see a little bit of, uh, damage on them if you look closely. Only two of them have that, but, uh, fortunately we were able to fix them. And I'm being honest with you, so yep, just only one is like, uh, missing a door, some of them missing their weapons. But yes, we are going to be selling all nine of these figures on the Cwclight. And they each will come with a personally signed certificate authenticity that I personally owned these figures. And these will be shrink-wrapped. So that's just to let you know. So, I'll be providing a link to it on the, uh, on my... Bluesky, and if I can, I can put- c- com- I can put it- as a first comment underneath this one. And, um, yeah, just... come on down and buy these. Uh- now we are actually going to, uh, sell them at a good price, but I want to assure and promise you I am getting all that money and it is going to be saved towards paying off the mortgage. And more Transformers are going to be on the Cwclight as well. Only the older figures are going to be on there. None of the, uh, Autobots of Cwcville or any of the, uh, other figures from as early as, like, you know, uh, Combiner Wars and Times Return. So you're not seeing many of those there. You might see a couple because, uh... I am clearing out, but- and just felt like I didn't need space for those, but it's only like a few, but you're not really going to see any of those. But, you're going to see a lot of the older ones, even some classic Gobots figures. So come check it out, buy, and, uh... your investment towards your collectivity is always appreciated and it will help me out greatly. Thank you very much. Have a good, safe, blessed day.
