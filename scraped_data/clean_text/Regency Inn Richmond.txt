Chris on staying at the motel while being investigated for incest[1]
Chris being arrested at taser-point in his Regency Inn room
The Regency Inn Richmond is a motel in Richmond, VA. It is located about 62 miles away from 14 Branchland Court.
On the morning of 30 July 2021, after his Affair with Mother had been exposed, Chris was banned from 14 Branchland Court, his mother's house in which he also lived, due to being served an Emergency Protective Order temporarily forbidding contact between him and his mother. Chris drove to Richmond to attempt to stay at Aunt Harriet and Uncle Tom's house, but they too banned him from their residence.[1] Chris booked a room at the Regency Inn and briefly stayed from the afternoon of 31 July 2021 until his arrest on 1 August 2021.

Booking a room
Having been turned away from any family homes, and lacking money, Chris spent the night/early morning of 30/31 July 2021 sleeping in his car. He felt this arrangement to be uncomfortable[1] and insecure.[2] He then looked up Hotels.com[3] and booked himself a room at Regency Inn Richmond for $56 per night with a check-in time of 2 pm on 31 July.[1] To help fund the room, Chris logged into his mother's bank account and sent himself $750.[4] Though he noticed the two-star ranking of the motel, Chris was not aware that it has a reputation for drug use until he was informed by one of his arresting officers.[3]
Chris stayed at room 216, a room on the second floor.[5] For food, he went to the nearby Kroger store.[1] For entertainment, he considered going to the nearby Chesterfield Towne Center and Regency Square malls.[4]
Some of Chris's stuff on a desk
Chris had some items with him at the motel. These include his duct-tape wallet, various plastic medicine boxes, a box of Equate-brand maxi pads (for his DIRTY, CRAPPED BRIEFS), medications, and a stick of Krazy Glue. The Night Star plush toy ChuuChuuRocket had made for him was also present on his bed's pillow.
Spectators and arrest
Chris about to be driven to jail
On the evening of 31 July 2021, r/ChrisChanSonichu user Chrisisaman spotted Chris's car in the motel's parking lot.[6]
Ethan Ralph drove into town and attempted to find Chris at either the motel or the nearby mall.
On 1 August 2021, the Henrico county police arrived at the motel and arrested Chris at his room, and footage of this was captured on their bodycams. Ethan Ralph was nearby and livestreamed the arrest.[5]
Since Chris's car was left unattended in the motel parking lot before Barbara could arrange for it to be returned to her, a ween stole Chris's "Sonichu" vanity plate off of it.[7]
