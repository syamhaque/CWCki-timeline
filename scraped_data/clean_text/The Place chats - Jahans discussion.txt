MKR on the possibility of Chris and Jahans interacting.
NOTE: Chris was not directly involved in this conversation.
The Watchmen occasionally discussed the Youtuber Alexander Gordon Jahans in the second layer of their Discord server The Place, leading up to scheming to have Chris and Jahans interact.
The Watchman Naught has an interest in Jahans, also known as Farshnuke, posting threads on him on both the Kiwi Farms[1] and Onion Farms[2] forums. MKR also has an interest, posting about him in The Place, and in March 2021, tried to convince Chris that Jahans could help him in Chris's quest of role-playing as a psychic detective.[3] However, no sign of Jahans agreeing to talk to Chris has emerged.
The Watchman Kyle repeatedly expressed disapproval towards the attempt to have Chris and Jahans interact.

Sad that Chris is so uncreative these days.
He's not so much become afraid of failure, but more aware that it always seems to happen.
MKR

[quotes Kyle's "Because Jahans as a completely insane narcissist offers so much..." line]
how does he compare to Mr Sockness?
MKR
Well he wouldn't rape cwc to death and he lives in another country with no means of getting to Chris. So pretty safe.
Deleted User
yeah, I'd rather have Chris befriend Jahan all day.
he might be even better than all of Praetor. 🙂
MKR
Yep
And they can make weird lore together
Kyle
Chris is content with lore, fine, if you want to do that.
I'd just rather not Chris crossover with the woke mantit blob.
Deleted User
pick your poison.
better than whoever the fuck tried the crossover with the German cwc
Who tried to do that?
Vaughn
Kyle
Chris' life is kind of bad enough, two tards don't make a right.

Jahans has talents or skills cwc has yet to develop

Deleted User

[quotes Deleted User's "Vaughn" line]
Larry Ricky Vaughn.
Kyle

I don't know Jahans because the info is pretty anemic.
MKR
Consent is very important to him and he hate da nazis
Naught[note 1]

@Deleted User we have the go ahead from cwc, now we just need to get jahans in.
Kyle
This cannot end well.
MKR
If he even decides to join, jahans is paranoid af
Kyle
And Chris has demonstrated great ability to discriminate information into a useful means...
Deleted User
I kinda want to see what happens.
MKR
It'll just be two tards playing pretend in a controlled environment. Neither having any means of getting to the other physically.
