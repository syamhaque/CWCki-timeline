Robertchu is the Sonichu form of Bob Chandler.
During the Idea Guys saga, Chris's belief in multiple dimensions was exploited and his sense of reality hijacked to make changes to many of Chris's characters, concepts and perspectives of the real world, with him considering them to be valid. Perhaps one of the more heinous examples of this was the Idea Guys' manipulation of Chris's views on his own father; views which Chris has yet to abandon, despite the Idea Guys being removed from power by the Guard Dogs in mid-2018. Ideas involving Bob include:
Bob meets Ted Bundy in the hereafter.
Bob's spirit resides in CWCville, dimension C-197, as a half-Sonichu named Robertchu, styled in his Sonichu form as a beaver with checkerboard fur[1][2] (a reference to his troll-given Internet Lumberjack nickname).
Bob met serial killer Ted Bundy while in CWCville and helps defend it alongside Ted.[3]
Post-Idea Guys, Chris decided that Robertchu's fur color was really red with black ears because he found it too time-consuming to draw the checkerboard pattern.[4]
Robertchu as a Shipfic card.
Robertchu was featured as cards in Chris's homemade Shipfic expansion. In one, Chris photoshopped a photo of Barbara so that she is standing beside a drawing of Robertchu in his Sonichu form. The card text reads, "Honey, I'm Home" and states:
Every once in a while, Mister C. runs back home to offer comfort to Barbara. Before the Dimension Merge's completion, she has missed him everyday, and found the solace and comfort when he comes by. He continues to carry a torch for her in his heart and soul while he helps to protect everyone in Cwcville and at this old temple of a house.
