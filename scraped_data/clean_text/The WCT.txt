This article is too large or off-topic. It has been suggested that we smash its Heart level down to 15% and split off the pieces into their own article. Discuss on the talk page.
This article is still yet to be completed due to stress. We get a lot of stressful torture in our lives that makes us crash into slumber. Given that inspiration is a big variable, and we may have been lacking of it, this article will be completed as soon as possible, at our own pace... HONEST! This article is missing the following:
• The Lainchu Manifesto
Note on Misinformation:
This article previously included information that was primarily speculative or incorrect. This is being fixed. For more information see here.
Note on Credibility:
The WCT has been deemed to be an unreliable narrator for the following reasons:• WCT is noted for being egotistical and having many delusions of grandeur.[note 1]• WCT will often say edgy things for shock value.• Acts contrary to his claimed intentions.[note 2]• WCT has made bold, accusatory claims without verifying them first.[note 3]
Bear this in mind, and use healthy skepticism when taking statements from the subject being discussed.
Note on Sockpuppets:
The WCT has been known to use sockpuppet accounts. Since it is difficult to discern their sock accounts, it is best to avoid speculating an account belongs to The WCT unless fully verified.

You can go live in a video with your thoughts and insight about MLP G5, and comment with the details I have shared so far, and what you, as well, have seen in your visions, and even heard from talking with the spirits and angels from the realms.
This could very well be another instance the Messenger WildLeo (you) comes through in breaking up the chaos and boughts.

Sean Walker[11] (born 2000),[12] more commonly known as The Wildcat (WCT), CPU Onyx Heart, Psychic Espeon and Neko Onyx, is a former Watchmen member and amateur YouTuber who made documentaries on dark or edgy topics such as mass shooter Randy Stair, also using his YouTube channel to archive some Chris-related videos.[13]
As a Watchman, WCT attempted to protect Chris from malicious individuals. In 2019, he was involved with Chris Releases A Statement Regarding Jacob Sockness, an audio recording Chris released to Twitter in order to discourage Jacob Sockness from coming to his house. Two years later, WCT would again try to intervene against Sockness's plan to meet Chris at Everfree Northwest,[7] though Chris's arrest for incest would cause him to miss the convention.
In September 2020, Chris discovered WCT's YouTube channel while searching for a copy of the Chris Chan VS. The Internet trailer. He then browsed the channel's other videos and took an interest in some of Randy Stair's ideas about dimensions and incorporated those into his own roleplay fantasies (while disavowing the violent side of Stair). Chris occasionally chatted about the roleplay fantasies to WCT, who typically played along briefly.
During summer 2021, several Watchmen members had a feud which resulted in the collapse of their Discord group The Place. The feud began when Naught doxed WCT on Kiwi Farms in retaliation for WCT declining to share his Kiwi Farms account with Naught;[14] Kyle and MKRNightVee sided with Naught, and Chris sided with WCT and left The Place at WCT's encouragement.[15] WCT created another Discord group, The Knights of CWC, modelling it after The Place.
In August 2021, Chris was arrested for incest. The WCT responded by banning Chris from The Knights of CWC, bringing to a close the Watchmen's influence in Chris's social circle.[16]

As a Watchman
WCT's icon used for his YouTube channel. This was the icon most associated with him.
Becoming a Watchman
According to Naught, WCT joined the CWC Rebellion server, where he made friends with a user named "Smoky Chris" and that the aspiring documentarians met in Geno Samuel's Discord server some time in 2019.[17] Naught also claimed to have met WCT in the GenoSamuel server when Naught also hung out with Joseph Draft, director of CWC vs the world and that the two were both early Watchmen.[17]
The avatar MKRNightVee drew for The WCT
He later joined the Watchmen, where he mainly archived calls involving Chris while maintaining a YouTube channel that posted Chris-centric content which has since been privated. In February 2021, he attempted to become the fourth person behind the role of 'Lainchu,' an OC created by the Watchmen, but was rejected by Chris, who still preferred his predecessor.[18]
Internal conflicts
On Christmas Eve of 2020, Chris had mentioned concerns about The WCT being banned from The Place, alleging that it was due to political jokes he made.[19] Kyle replies that he is unsure about unbanning him, and complains about The WCT "leaking" information. When Chris responds that WCT hadn't been leaking anything, Naught and Kyle respond that he doesn't leak on purpose, with Naught claiming that WCT had hinted at the existence of The Place server.
WCT was doxed on /cow/ in 2019, and on lolcow farm. Early in June 2021, The WCT dox was reposted on Kiwi Farms by fellow Watchman and group leader Naught (also known as Bismuth).[20] When WCT confronted Naught in a voice chat, Naught denied the allegation, then threatened to further dox WCT in an attempt to silence him.[15] WCT explained the events to Chris himself, who believed The WCT's evidence and
cut ties with Naught over it.[15][21] Naught had eventually confirmed his doxing of WCT on 30 August 2021 in an Onion Farms message[22] and again on 29 November 2021 while editing his CWCki page.[23] Naught had also stated in the edit that The WCT acussing him of sending strikes on his videos would futher justify decision to dox him. After receiving strikes for his videos, WCT would then create a new channel to host his content, "Yosemite Cat."[24]
Shortly after, WCT was banned from The Place, the Watchmen's Discord server. In response, Chris left the server himself. In WCT's own words, "[Chris] saw my banning as a signal to him that my suspicions about Bismuth and the others were correct." The Praetor group, who had also been in the server, left it as well following Chris's departure.[15][21] WCT had claimed in a later post to an interviewee that he had decided to "take down the group" as a result of Naught doxing him, taking Chris with him in order to "punish" other members in the group.[25]
MKR later jumped to several baseless conclusions over the matter and circulated several rumors. In late June she tagged Chris’s Twitter and posted, “Have fun getting fucked over by WCT and Praetor.”[26] accusing WCT of having sinister motives, including "probably [wanting] Chris to kill himself in a similar manner [to Randy Stair].[27]
WCT created a successor group and invited in Chris and several of the Watchmen who had been in The Place, titling his group The Knights of CWC. There, he served as the Watchmen's third leader, though he was also unsure of putting the group under the Watchmen moniker. As leader, WCT sought to take a less aggressive approach to other Chris orbiters than Naught had, stating to Helena that he would "give anybody who befriends Chris a chance until it becomes clear to me they have awful intentions."[28]
WCT gave an interview to the CWCki explaining his side of the story.
Interactions with Chris
Chris's recent failings have helped CWCki gather more information for this article. Be a winner by adding this information in.
This new information can be found from the following sources:
• WCT DMs#Sockness alert
Main article: WCT DMs
WCT was one of the people trying to discourage Chris from his plan to tase his magic stones to start the Dimensional Merge. He also expressed concern over Chris's mental health when Chris uploaded Direct Message to Hasbro: MLPG5 Is Cancelled., a video in which an upset Chris ranted about My Little Pony, the background revealing several punched holes in the wall; WCT reached out to Chris to calm him down and asked Chris to talk things out instead of hurting himself. When asked by WCT what had happened to the wall, Chris claimed the damage had occurred in the past over trying to physically break the iron curtain between dimensions.[29]
In April 2021, Chris did tarot readings for both WCT and Naught.[30]
Chris and WCT's YouTube channel
WCT had a YouTube channel, since privated, in which he posted content such as self-made documentaries and interviews, and also archived Chris-related content. Chris has tried to use WCT's channel as a means to promote his ideas.
Chris's first known interaction with the channel stemmed from his search for the Chris Chan VS. The Internet trailer.[31] The WCT had a copy of it, which had been uploaded in April 2019.[32] In September 2020, Chris found the copy and left a comment.[33]
In November 2020, Chris watched some of The WCT's channel content, including his documentary on Randy Stair. On 6 November, Chris recorded an audio file, Chris channels Randy Stair, in which he hoped to help Stair get a post-death message out to the world by role-playing that he had been possessed by Stair. Chris gave the file to The WCT and gave his permission for it to be posted on The WCT's channel,[34] although WCT declined to upload it.
On 29 March 2021, Chris appeared in the live chatroom during a livestream of The Cat's Corner, a segment on the channel. Chris chatted about topics ranging from his past self, Bob's death, and the Christuber Smoky Chris.[35]
On 28 July 2021, Chris reached out to WCT and suggested he should record a livestream about My Little Pony's upcoming G5 reboot (a reboot Chris was extremely against). Chris also told WCT to "comment with the details I have shared so far, and what you, as well, have seen in your visions, and even heard from talking with the spirits and angels from the realms." Chris dubbed WCT as the "Messenger WildLeo," hoping that his video could help prevent G5 from launching. When WCT answered that he was considering making a video roasting A New Generation, the reboot's film premiere, after its release, Chris replied that it would be best not to wait until then, telling him the prevention of the movie was ideal for maintaining safety across the timeline. Chris did not elaborate on how exactly such a video would help in overturning Hasbro's decision to reboot My Little Pony.[3]
Randy Stair
Main article: Randy Stair
Among the material covered on The WCT's YouTube channel was a 9-episode docuseries he produced on Randy Stair,[36][12] who infamously killed three people and then himself after losing his mind. In November 2020, Chris found the series after looking through a playlist on The WCT's channel and took an interest in Stair's story, particularly the aspects involving Stair's belief in fictional characters existing in an alternate dimension.[37]
Chris recorded an audio file to "help [Stair] get a post-death message out," giving the file to WCT,[37] although WCT declined to upload it.
In conversations with WCT, Chris occasionally role-played that Randy Stair was a guardian figure and WCT briefly played along.
On 13 July 2021, WCT tried to help Chris avoid Jacob Sockness at the upcoming Everfree Northwest convention by asking him to record another version of Chris Releases A Statement Regarding Jacob Sockness. During their discussion, Chris coped with the issue of Sockness by role-playing that Randy Stair would be defeating Sockness with WCT's help:[7]
Chris
Ember just came to me with a message in regard to Sockness.
Randy and the Ghost Squad are working to break through the horde of demons around his apartment building.
In the present energy shift, there is a potential boost going to Sockness. But there is a counter, and it involves you, Sean.
To which WCT, seemingly confusing Sockness for Naught, replied:
The WCT
With Andrew and Ember's help, I will defeat Bismuth for good. And to ensure that he doesn't hurt another innocent again.
Role as Lainchu
Main article: Imposter Lainchu
After Anaxis got banned from the Place Discord server, The WCT was voted to be the fourth and final person to take on the role of Lainchu. WCT created a new account under the name "Lainchu (Current Host)", but due to Anaxis' ban however, Chris did not accept WCT taking on the role. As a result of this, WCT's take on the character is sometimes referred to as "Imposter Lainchu", a term coined by Anaxis in his Lainchu Manifesto.
Everfree Northwest
In July 2021, Jacob Sockness declared that he had plans to attend Everfree Northwest in disguise to meet with Chris.[38] WCT alerted Chris to Sockness's statements.
On 13 July 2021, Chris brought up Bella to WCT, telling WCT she would be accompanying him to Everfree Northwest.[7] Chris had earlier requested Bella to act as a bodyguard for him against Sockness,[39] which she agreed to do.[9]
On 19 July 2021, Chris invited Bella, as well as Fiona; who was also set to meet Chris at the convention; into the Knights of CWC,[40] a Watchmen splinter group headed by WCT and the group discussed plans to protect Chris from Sockness.
On the night of 19 July 2021, Bella invited WCT, Fiona, and Chris into her chess group #15 Discord server. WCT discussed his conflict with Naught, Kyle and MKR, and told Bella he had been "working with Former Kiwi Farmers to bring down the Watchmen" and asked Bella to assist him in doxing Naught, calling him an "evil man."[41]
The Incest Scandal
On 2 July 2021, Chris bragged to The WCT about having an affair with a woman "older than" him, but did not reveal to him that his affair had occurred with his mother.[42] Three days later, Chris also talked to WCT's Knights of CWC group about the affair, also not telling them of the woman's identity.[43] As WCT was unaware of the woman's identity, he stated to the Knights group he would not let news of the affair leak.[44]
On 27 July, Chris bragged to Bella that he was in the middle of an incestuous relationship with his mother.[45] WCT had created the group chat, Regarding Chris, where he and selected other Chris orbiters would question Bella on what was happening. Bella gave the files to Fiona and both would leak Chris's statements in the following days. Even after the leak, Chris was still willing to talk to Bella; it took both Null and WCT telling him he shouldn't to make Chris reconsider and cut ties with Bella.[46]
The WCT promising to share the Regarding Chris chats to Spooky Bones
On 5 August, after being threatened by Mean Girls leader Spooky Bones, WCT later leaked the chat logs of the Regarding Chris chats to Spooky, telling her to redact non-essential information. Spooky instead leaked the entirety of the Regarding Chris chats without obscuring any names or information.
Spooky/Regina
Things are looking extremely extremely bad for these faggots and you will seeing them on the news. If you want to leak anything or distance yourself from them or explain your contact with them do it now. That's all really.
The WCT
I will hand you files of my conversations with Bella and Chris on a couple conditions:
1. Please redact anybody that isn't Conner or NP2348. (who is Bella's account on Discord)
2. Promise that you won't leak anything that might be too personal on anybody's end.
And to explain my contact with them, I first got in touch with Bella on July 14th as a result of Chris inviting them into the Discord group that Him and I had created back in late June right after the fall of the Watchrnen. And like I told you, things were going smoothly from the beginning. But unfortunately, this happened and people are now accusing me of being a fail troll/ween that helped put Chris in jail. This is far from the truth. and once you go through these files, youtl know that I was actually concerned about Chris's well being, and I didn't want him to go down the path that he's on now.
So once I learned of Bella's true intentions, I had her banned from the group on July 31st, but it was too late.
Targeted by the Halal Server
Spooky had reached out to MKRNightVee on August 2021, believing that MKR might have answers regarding WCT's role with Chris. MKRNightVee and Naught were then invited into the Halal Server, run by Spooky's associates. There, Spooky had spoken to both to them, and MKR in particular told her rumors about The WCT, such as accusing him of plotting to have Chris killed.[47]
Interview
The WCT was interviewed over Discord about the Watchmen breakup on 11 July 2021. The WCT's messages are in blue and the interviewer's in green.
Hi. Someone told me you’re The WCT. If it’s okay with you, I’d like to ask you some questions about the Watchmen breakup for the Cwcki.
hi there.
and yes, by all means ask said questions.
The initial conflict seems to be between you and Bismuth, that Bismuth doxed you. How did it grow to break up the Watchmen group?
After I concluded that it was Bismuth that was responsible for the doxing, I made the choice to contact MKRNightVee (or Meghan some of you know her as) and I showed her a lot of screenshots in DMs that compared the typing style of his old Kiwi Farms accounts to one that he used to dox me. (which was Nightmare)
I recall telling her that I was 90 percent sure that it was him.
But in spite of the evidence that I had presented to her at the time, she didn't believe me. And during our VC on June 21st, She and Kyle were still not convinced.
They originally thought it was somebody who I angered in the past, but knowing what the Nightmare account was up to at the time, I knew that it was him.
How did Chris learn of the dispute?
Not long after the VC, I decided that I would contact him myself.
So with the help of a Former Watchmen who had his phone number, I was able to get in contact with him on June 25th.
And there, I had an hour and 40 minute talk with him that first started off as any conversation I'd usually have with him until I was comfortable enough to tell him the details.
Did you show Chris the same evidence that you did to MKRNightVee?
When I was talking with MKR, I didn't show her as much evidence at the time since the Investigation was still ongoing. And compared to what I shared with Chris, I shared less with MKR.
Not because I didn't trust her, but it was because there was not enough information available at the time. And what I ended up showing Chris was a combination of the Kiwi Farms posts and the VC that I had with the rest of the group.
How did Chris react to it?
It took Chris a while to process it.
With each screenshot, he began to believe that my claims were true. And when we were both going over the VC, he noticed how Bismuth was getting really defensive and thought that he was clearly lying to me.
Especially when I told Bismuth that Josh (Null) claimed to me that him and Nightmare were the same person.
And that 3-4 seconds of silence on his part was something that helped convince Chris that I was in the right.
He also noticed how hostile Bismuth was getting towards me as well, especially when I kept on asking him if he doxed me or not. Chris saw that as a red flag.
Did Chris cut ties with Bismuth?
From what I know, yes he did.
What happened between Chris and MKRNightVee? MKR’s recent tweets indicate they’ve had a falling out. Is it related to the Watchmen breakup?
yes it is.
Meghan was upset that Chris had sided with me in regards to what had happened.
How does Praetor fit in to this? MKRNightVee has said in a tweet that you’ve teamed up with them.
Praetor had nothing to do with what happened.
Its just that when they got word from Chris that he had left the server, they followed. So it makes sense on MKR's part to accuse me of working with them because we all either got banned or left the place at the same time.
It was a strange coincidence yes, but there is zero contact between me and Caden.
What server did Chris leave?
The Watchmen's Place.
as some of you might've heard of on the CWCki. - https://sonichu.com/cwcki/Discord#The_Watchmen.27s_Place
Why did he leave it?
when he got word that I got banned from the server (by Kyle that is), he saw it as a green light to leave it himself.
So essentially he saw my banning as a signal to him that my suspicions about Bismuth and the others were correct.
Are you still in contact with Chris?
at this moment in time, I'm not.
We went our separate ways not long after the Watchmen had broken up and I believe that its for the best for both me and him.
And rather or not if he wants to be in touch with me still is completely up to him, but I won't be too surprised if he had already moved on at this point, and I respect whatever path he goes on moving forward.
Forgot to ask earlier, but what was your motivation for informing Chris of the conflict between you and Bismuth/MKR/Kyle?
I was running out of options on what to do. When MKR and Kyle didn't believe my claims, I felt that I had no choice but to inform Chris on what had happened.
It was a very risky move on my part to do that, but I don't regret telling him.
That’s all the questions I have. Thank you for answering. Is there anything else you would like to add?
I just want to let people know that Chris is now a free man with nobody to dictate his actions. And for his sake, it needs to remain that way.
Thanks again. I'll look to getting this conversation to the CWCki. Do you want your username/avatar censored?
yes
Screencaps
Aftermath
“
I’m definitely going to go down in Christory.
unfortunately…
For the wrong reasons.
”
The WCT, after getting doxed a second time.
With his last remaining hours of freedom, Chris chose to send his final known online message to WCT, informing him that the pets were being taken care of.[48] Within a few hours, Chris was taken into custody, which WCT later claimed to have "felt a sense of pain" watching.[49] After the arrest, WCT blocked Chris.[50]
On 13 September 2021, The WCT was contacted by MKR on Discord for the first time since the fall of the Watchmen.[49] Throughout the conversation, WCT lamented his situation, calling himself a failure for not recognizing the signs of Chris and Barb's incestuous relationship as well as Bella's manipulation, thoughts he admitted caused him to contemplate suicide. Nevertheless, he insisted that he had no regrets and claimed that everything was meant to be.
In Jail Letter - 18 January 2022, Chris mentioned that he wished to get back in contact with Wildcat, presumably referring to one of The WCT's pseudonyms. Despite Chris's release from jail in 2024, no contact between WCT and Chris has been documented, and WCT's involvement in Chris's life appears to have concluded.

Notes
↑ WCT had often made comments about being "one of the final protagonists" of Christory, and has on some ocassions compared himself to the Kiwi Farms owner, Null or made comments about his influence and "power" on the CWCSphere. When he created the Knights of CWC, he also often times bragged about how much his group wasn't like the Watchmen, and how much Chris preferred his group over the prior one.
↑ Despite going after Chris enablers, he engaged in enabling himself when he took on the role of "Imposter Lainchu", and encouraged others to enable Chris for "fun".
↑ Attempted to throw Null under the bus by claiming that Null had been aware of Chris's Affair with Mother and did nothing to stop it.[1] However, Null's DMs with Chris indicate Null was not aware.[2]When Bella gave WCT her fabricated BDSM texts, he believed Bella when she claimed that Fiona also had those; subsequently attempted to throw Fiona under the bus by claiming her as the sole source for the text instead of naming Bella
