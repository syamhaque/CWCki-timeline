================================================================================

You're Always Pretty (leaked as hyigybybbhgy.flv, uploaded as SNORE LACKS) is a video leaked on 25 February 2012. It is the second video Chris's mother ever appeared in; she previously appeared in ChandlerFamilyChristmas2004. The time of recording is unknown - it can be estimated to be between 20 October 2010[3] and 4 September 2011[4].
In the video Chris and Barb solemnly make small talk while eating junk food. Chris throws her some strangely inappropriate compliments, which come off especially disturbing now given certain events. It is implied that they have been fighting and not speaking to each other, although there is no clear reason as to why (though this was likely early in the Tomgirl Saga, where Barb was still resistant to Chris's new changes. According to Chris's Facebook page, it may also be because he got caught flipping the bird to a Jerkop).
This video was made because Chris wanted to prove to a troll that Barb didn't control him[5][6].

A non-sequitur from Barb
Transcript
[Barb and Chris sit at a table eating fast food from McDonald's. Chris has apparently just brought out his camera and set it down. For some reason, Barb is wearing Chris's old pair of Pedo-Glasses with the blue Crayola Model Magic bridge. Tears for Fears' "Head Over Heels" plays in the background.]
Chris: -Oh.
Barbara: [Laughing like Jabba the Hutt]
Chris: Yeah.
Barbara: You got your digital camera?
Chris: Yeah. Just a little something there. Uh...
Barbara: Who- who're you gonna take pictures of?

Chris: Yeah. The shirt I picked out from Goodwill the 'udder day. Yeah. I am free as a bird! And this bird you cannot change!
Barbara: Enjoy your food.
Chris: Yes- [turns off camera]
