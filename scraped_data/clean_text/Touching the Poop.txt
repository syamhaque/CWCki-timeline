Touching the Poop (sometimes referred to as pozloading my neghole[note 1]) is a phrase used in lolcow-centric communities that refers to the negative repercussions that occur from interacting directly with lolcows, or being involved in their drama.
The phrase originated from Kiwi Farms, based on how, like with real life, where touching actual shit has the unsavory consequences of you smelling like shit, interacting with lolcows like Chris puts at risk of being in the distasteful position of you becoming a lolcow yourself.
