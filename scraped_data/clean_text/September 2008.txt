================================================================================

In September 2008, we meet Reginald.
September was the ninth month of 2008. Another active month for Chris, it saw him continuing his relationship with Blanca, and working on the notoriously sexual and violent Sonichu #8. Vivian tries to contact him, but Chris doesn't respond until much later. Chris was having a blast, right until his first nudes were leaked, sent to a troll posing as Blanca. The nudes cause Chris to feel a lot of stress, but doesn't stop him from drawing more this month, and gets in contact with Shigeru Miyamoto over a potential Sonichu game. Chris loses contact with someone close to him again, this time his half-brother Cole Smithey. The month ends with a video of Chris fapping being leaked, and Chris feeling a lot of love for Blanca.
