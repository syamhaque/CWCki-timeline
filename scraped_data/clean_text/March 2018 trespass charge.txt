================================================================================

On 23 March 2018, Chris trespassed at Fashion Square Mall, from which he had been repeatedly banned over the years.
He was charged with "trespass after being forbidden". On the document, Chris put his signature as Chris Chan Sonichu - even writing out the font in lightning bolts. He also stated that he had "$<10" in his bank account and put down $0 for his net income.
The court placed Chris into the Therapeutic Docket program in lieu of a jail sentence, which he completed by April 2019. However, the court's leniency failed to deter Chris - in September 2020, he again visited the Fashion Square mall, although was not caught.[1]
