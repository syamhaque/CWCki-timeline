Title: IRC (22 December 2008)

Categories: Category, IRC
================================================================================

An IRC chat with Chris took place on 22 December 2008. After some small talk, the chat settled into a Q&A format, with Chris answering questions posed to him by famed trolls Cogsdev and Vivian Gee. The majority of the questions were relatively innocent, especially compared to the perverse secrets that PandaHalo and Julie tended to extract from him. Were it not for the fact that Chris is Chris and his "fans" hate him, it would be much like any other celebrity interview.
Chris reveals that he'd like to visit Japan, England and France, claims that he's related to Anne Boleyn, and that he'd like to finish fifty full Sonichu issues in his lifetime. He claims he'd like to work for Archie comics, probably just because they publish the Sonic the Hedgehog comic. He also reaffirms the fact that he's woefully unaware of world events, simply because he doesn't like bad news very much. He also thinks that he's handsome, and claims that his figure is so "good" because he plays Guitar Hero. The chat ends with a solemn mention of the family of Ryan Cash, foreshadowing the hell that his unstoppable brother Clyde would rain down upon Chris.

00:35 <@cogsdev> okay
00:35 <@cogsdev> What countries in the world you would like to visit and why?

00:40 <@ChrisChanSonichu> a bug with Home Beta; removes all furniture behind my back, and I have to boot up my Namco Museum Beta to even bring up my Arcade Machines and Namco Chairs.
00:40 <@ChrisChanSonichu> *all furniture in the Clubhouse.
00:40 -!- asdf1XX0 [~chatzilla@Rizon-7599AD8.phil.east.verizon.net] has left #sonichu []
00:40 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I still have majority of the furniture in my apartment/summer house
00:40 -!- Sonichu_Fan [~chatzilla@Rizon-7599AD8.phil.east.verizon.net] has joined #sonichu
00:41 <@ChrisChanSonichu> still need to regain my echochrome and Ice Breaker unlocks.
00:41 <@cogsdev> From CutieBolt54: "Do you like going to the doctor/dentist? Needles and drills and stuff scare me!"
00:41 <@ChrisChanSonichu> AFTER Sony fixes that bug.
00:41 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I have no fears with docs or dentists.
00:41 <@ChrisChanSonichu> Eh, What's Up, Doc?
00:42 <@cogsdev> What ever happened to Bill the Scientist?
00:42 <@ChrisChanSonichu> How should I know what happens to Bill? That's NOA's thing.
00:42 <@cogsdev> oh, i thought he was your creation
00:42 <@ChrisChanSonichu> assumed wrong.
00:43 <@cogsdev> ah okay
00:43 <@cogsdev> We all know Britney Spears is the one for you musically. However, would you consider checking out and reviewing music from bands such as Front 242, Ministry, The Sisters of Mercy, Fields of the Nephilim, Killing Joke, Skinny Puppy, etc.?
00:43 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I am open-minded to all artists.
00:43 <@ChrisChanSonichu> so yes
00:44 <@cogsdev> here's another: What did you think of Episode One of Star Wars?
00:44 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I've enjoyed 5/6 Episodes, and Clone Wars; didn't see EP3 yet.
00:45 <@ChrisChanSonichu> although I am aware of 3's story.
00:45 <@cogsdev> We know now that the PS3 is your best life upgrade ever. What could top that?
00:45 <@ChrisChanSonichu> my Female Sweetheart.
00:45 <@ChrisChanSonichu> 'cha
00:46 <@cogsdev> Chris, what do you think is your most desirable trait?
00:47 <@ChrisChanSonichu> that depends on the woman's P.O.V.; my handsomness, gentleman charms, sharp, smart wit, etc.
00:47 <@ChrisChanSonichu> possibly good in bed, but that's to be determined.
00:47 <@cogsdev> a fan writes: A friend said that he did not like Sonichu, so I gave him a kick the in teeth! Was that right to do?
00:49 <@ChrisChanSonichu> well, he/she is entitled to his/her opinion, and violence over a petty detail of disintrest is discouraged. BUT if he/she/them put up a hate site, send threat letters or act violent physically or deep in emotions, then they deserve a good kick in the head.
00:50 <@cogsdev> in a similar vein: If a troll were to confront you in real life with violent intentions, what would you do?
00:50 <@ChrisChanSonichu> it depends...
00:51 <@ChrisChanSonichu> if the troll was easy to recognize, then I would confront, give a good talk-to, then if he/she strikes me after that, then I'd strike back.
00:51 <@ChrisChanSonichu> if NOT easy to recognize...
00:52 <@ChrisChanSonichu> unless that person makes it obvious IRL, like a upfront self-introduction and strikes, then I'd just be on my peaceful way.
00:53 <@cogsdev> Have you played any MMORPGs? (massively multiplayer online role playing games)
00:53 <@ChrisChanSonichu> Warhawk.
00:54 <@ChrisChanSonichu> oh, you mean like warhammer; no.
00:54 <@ChrisChanSonichu> warcraft?
00:54 <@ChrisChanSonichu> not played either, btw
00:55 <@cogsdev> okay
00:55 <@cogsdev> If you could have any girl in the world, fictionalor non fictional, who would it be?
00:55 <@ChrisChanSonichu> is Warhawk considered a MMORPG?
00:55 <@ChrisChanSonichu> ...
00:55 <@cogsdev> i didn't know it was an RPG
00:55 <@ChrisChanSonichu> INS either, but I'm just asking.
00:56 <@ChrisChanSonichu> ...
00:56 <@cogsdev> well, from what i saw of it, it was a shooter, but i haven't played so i'm not sure
00:56 <@ChrisChanSonichu> ok
00:56 <@cogsdev> but moving on to the next question: If you could have any girl in the world, fictional or non fictional, who would it be?
00:57 <@ChrisChanSonichu> Britney Spears.
00:57 <@cogsdev> What do you like about Japanese culture, and what would you do in Japan?
00:58 <@ChrisChanSonichu> their technology, kung-fu, ninja, peaceful ways of life outside of violence. SHOP for Playable Games on my Game Boy, GBA, DS or PSP at least.
00:59 <@ChrisChanSonichu> as well as explore.
00:59 <@ChrisChanSonichu> Region-Free Code.
00:59 <@cogsdev> Why do you think so many people give you hate?
00:59 <@ChrisChanSonichu> UMD Movies have a Region Code, so that's a no-go.
01:00 <@ChrisChanSonichu> they're probably jealous, but they have nothing to be jealous of; I'm only a simple human being, with life's ups and downs; outcast-like, so much that can be learned about me, like most others, etc.
01:01 <@ChrisChanSonichu> *and to be understood.
01:01 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I'll take one more question for now.
01:01 <@cogsdev> okay
01:02 <@cogsdev> oh i lost the question list hold on a second please
01:02 <@ChrisChanSonichu> ok
01:03 <@vivitheg> I got it cogs.
01:03 <@vivitheg> How much exercise do you get a day to keep up such a good figure?
01:05 <@ChrisChanSonichu> Plenty; I play Guitar Hero, Rock Revolution or Rock Band (FINALLY RELEASED THE PATCH for Rock Band; I can play it NOW with my PS3 Les Paul!)
01:05 <@vivitheg> just some final comments before you leave
01:05 <@vivitheg> A gay fan just wants to say: I just want you to know that despite your hatred for my kind, I want you to know that you are really handsome.

01:06 -!- Guest [~Guest@Rizon-E56A4103.hsd1.ga.comcast.net] has quit []
01:07 <@ChrisChanSonichu> thank you, yet I feel wierded; no offense.
01:07 <@vivitheg> And Ryan Cash's family (the boy who commited suicide over Sonichu) wants to let you know that they hope his departure from his mortal coil has not affected you that much.
01:07 <@ChrisChanSonichu> it is a sad loss, and I offer my condolences to the family.
01:08 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I've had an emotional moment, but I'm okay now.
01:08 <@vivitheg> Do you have a message for the family?
01:08 <@ChrisChanSonichu> Try to move on and live life as peacefully as possible; I'm sure Ryan would have wanted his family to be happy as much as possible.
01:09 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I know that God and Jesus would have told them the same thing from the bible.
01:11 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I gtg; I'll answer more questions after the Holiday season. Peace and Merry Christmas, Happy Haunaka, Happy Chaunaka, Happy Kawanza, and all the rest of the holidays as well. :)
