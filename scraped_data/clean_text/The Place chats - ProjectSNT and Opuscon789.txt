Cold, ProjectSNT, and Dating Sim
10-11 December 2019
Chris, still getting over a cold, complains about ProjectSNT's redesign of Wild Sonichu, pondering why it bothers him. Watchmen members take Chris's side and say the redesign looks wrong and that ProjectSNT should have used another Pokémon character for reference, and also encourage him to look into another dimension to figure why the problem is bothering him. Chris believes that trying to figure out the issue will speed his recovery of the cold.
Kyle and other Watchmen members also propose to Chris the creation of a dating sim game.

@Sonichu982 hey buddy are you doing well?

Hey.
I’m still recovering.
The cold virus still has another phase or two to pass through.
At least I got my voice back.

Okay

I’ve heard about it through everyone. Ariel is my Rosechu, btw! I was waiting until you felt better to send you her pictures~
Chris
So, yes, this cold will fade away as soon as possible.

As for going forward, hows the progress for the sales of the cards? Worried you might be overextending the line.
Chris
So, the question that Remains on my mind, and still bothers me, even when I try not to think about it: WHY do those particular Redesign aspects Still Trigger Me?
Especially Wild Sonirisu? (edited)
MKRNightVee
Because they used the wrong pokemon parts for him?
Chris
Sales could be better
Partly, but it goes deeper than that.
Kyle
Sounds inherantly defensive, something doesn't look right, simple as.
Chris
That as well
Deleted User
I recall an issue of sonichu called date-ED I enjoyed. And
@Novathought it would be a good idea to make a sonichu dating sim. What do you think cwc?
AquaDiamond8
Wild shouldve been the Emolga it wouldve suited him more
Chris
Valid idea on the dating sim
Kyle
Been playing with some tools for that.
Chris
I think proumss said the same thing on Wild Sonirisu being part Emolga over Pachirisu.
Deleted User
Would you be ok with it taking place before they're all paired up?
Chris
Yes
Deleted User
@Novaelaborate to cwc on your dating sim
I personally think it might be because it’s an alternate dimension where things ultimately turned out for the worst. Maybe you’re feeling the horror/fear of whatever happened there; maybe the dimension doesn’t exist anymore, and that’s why you feel freaked out, because it’s like a hole missing in reality?
But I don’t think the characters themselves are bad.
They still seem and feel like heroes to me.
Chris
I agree, and also...
That Resonated
But, it does exist; I have seen it.
Pokécord BOT
Congratulations ChrisChanSonichu1982!
Your "Inuyasha" is now level 40!
Chris
It hasn’t disappeared.
Kyle
Some time prior to major events, something leading up a few days to some event, romance and something like that
Pokécord BOT
ongratulations Kylechu/Adjudiarch!
Your Archeops is now level 93!
Kyle
Planning a first-date
Deleted User
I’m glad! In that case, maybe you should try to look into that dimension more. Whatever is upsetting you, running away from it is probably not the best plan.
Maybe if you understand it, you can make peace with it?
Chris
Dimension CS-89 (the Dimension they are from, which is D&D-like) is still there, although the CC from there are visiting C-197 on a fated event and reason at the present time.
Kyle
Just the tool I played with
Test of concept
Chris
A disturbance in that dimension.
Yes, I do hear that possibility.
I will have to look into it, as well as prep myself for the D&D style, including determining my class and such.
Deity-Level from another dimension doesn’t initially resonate when entering D&D for the first time.
Kyle
Figuring business-wise, lower overhead, larger market.
Most of the businesses I've had a role in, not consumer stuff, but the principles are there.
Deleted User
Plus there can be easter eggs of the cards and comics in the background. All based on your approval cwc
Btw
Chris
Okay, my brain is on figuring out and solving my problem, so the chances of this cold passing through faster will be more likely.
I feel like I am in a different topic type of room now with you all.
Deleted User
Do you still have the hand drawn picture of sonichu and rosie wrapping tails and kissing?
Chris
I feel like with the business talk, it has to do with the TSSSF card sales, but then also something having to do with the dating sim game.
Yes
Deleted User
That’s good to hear, Christine. Hope you recover speedily. [posts an emote]
It's all connected
Chris
I can only focus on one topic at a time before moving onto another topic
Especially since the cold has my mind partially handicapped.
Deleted User
The game will go with the cards
Chris
Ooooh-Kay?
Kyle
You could do dialogue given your unique position on things.
Chris
As Eschcal has said on Twitter, my soul and abilities are spread thick and thin, and I’m still learning my craft and better abilities and all.
It is rough on me to take on too many tasks at once.
Kyle
Ya, I mean getting a grasp on the character dialogue, what they'd like for an ideal date, that kinda thing
Chris
Also, it’s 11:45 pm, where I am.

I'm the type of guy to only sleep 3-4 hours a night anyway

I can only suggest for dialogue make some common-sense choices on wording and phrasing, and I’ll look it over.
Deleted User
CPUs don't sleep much, if at all.
Kyle
Its mostly character stuff
AquaDiamond8
im always up
Kyle
And we'd probably use some of the time from the artists here on art, soooo
Chris
I’d be Nepping it up, then, because I haven’t ascended, or become accustomed to, such a less-sleep schedule yet.
Sleeping in, a bunch. (edited)
Deleted User
Anyway, the dialogue should be romantic and used as instructions for dating like ya know in the comic date-Ed
Chris
Yes
Kyle
Some ideas for backgrounds, endings, an overarching plot
What characters we want as dateable.
Deleted User
Sleeping is good when you’re sick, it accelerates healing. ✨
That's why I mentioned they should be set before they all got paired up
Timeline wise
Kyle
Depending on the length, 5-10 partners?
Chris
Y’all got the project covered; I’ll look it over after good progress has been made on it.
Kyle
Its kind of an involved thing, though
Deleted User
You're still half sonichu cwc you need your beauty sleep.
Chris
Yes

Congratulations ChrisChanSonichu1982!
Your "Inuyasha" is now level 41!

Not just a 3-step deal, game-design is complex
Deleted User
are you excited about this?
Chris
At least I know now where to move forward in this investigation for why the trigger spell.
My mind is elsewhere.
Deleted User
Stay focused
Chris
I don’t get distracted as easily by other things, spontaneously.
Deleted User
Breathe
Chris
That is me; Focused a lot
Kyle
GDDs are pretty free-form, can jot down ideas as they come
Deleted User
its ok.
Don't fret
AquaDiamond8
i get distracted alot QAQ
Chris
I’m going to rest for now; look into the D&D classes for myself, and meditate into sleep while projecting into CS-89
Kyle
We want the plot and characterizations to be steady from the get-go.
Chris
Check y’all later.
Thank you all.
Lots of Love

I took a D&D online quiz; it came up as Cleric.
Reading the details, I do agree with it, so I shall go with it into my venture to this alt-Dimension.

Apologising to SNT for Redesign Rage
14 December 2019 (leaked as part of the 2020 Discord leaks)
Hey, everyone.
Firstly, the Missions and Quests are pretty much what one would experience from the mundane to the extraordinary and unbelievable in a typical D&D game, or in most RPG or JRPG video games as well.
Second, I am feeling in a sitch.
As all of you are aware, I had found and solved the problem in CS-89 and can look at all of the redesigns of the Chaotic Combo from there with no problem.
Of which to solve the theft of magic items from there by the Rokat Empire, I did have help from and with SNT, herself (who was fatefully portaled into the dimension for the similar lead-up, and the same goals as I in resolving this Dimensional-Affecting problem.
Back onto the problem at hand now: recall the email I had sent to Courtney (@projectsnt) in response to the video, and how impulsive and harsh I was in its contents, Friday, a week ago.
In more recent days, with things having cooled down on that, and the impulsive tweets I typed, I've noticed Courtney not directly acknowledging me, and she has not responded to my email, either.
Plus, recent SNT and Me art, she could have retweeted, but she did not.
I sense that she may be feeling most distraught and upset over what I did.
I directly apologized in an email yesterday.
And I made a public apology on Twitter as well.
I know she's had the chance to read the apology, because she had just retweeted a couple more SNT Fan arts from others.
I wish to confirm this feeling she may have and do what I can to make it right with her.
I have been made aware she has a Discord account and server (with access only to her Patreon Patrons).
I would jump on that, but from my experiences between Doopie Doover and my brother, Cole: I've learned I can be easily denied and refunded my pledge.
And I do not want to come off as even more pushy or similar.
Asking Others to Contact SNT
14 December 2019
Immediately following from the above conversation.
Chris
@Aqua, or anyone else on here, can I get some help on learning what Courtney has been feeling, and/or typing about me in response to everything.
For the latter, I am trying to wait it out and let things progress, but I am feeling tense.
Thank You all.
AquaDiamond8
I could ask her, not sure she would respond to me, maybe she just doesnt want to respond. Honestly i know the feeling thinking someone might dislike you.
Deleted User
Yeah Chris if you want us to ask for you we have no problem with that.
Chris
Yes, please. Thank you.
AquaDiamond8
I messaged her a while ago, but nothing, just have to wait and see
[Two hours later]
Kyle
Trying to find out why this tape recorder isn't working
AquaDiamond8
imsorry
Kyle
@Sonichu982 What kind of info would you want anyway?
Its an absolutely obscure unit, can't find much info on the recorder.
Wasn't designed for higher fidelity audio, maybe thats the issue?
Or the head is broken?
Can't think of why it wouldn't play.
[Four hours after Chris's previous message]
Chris
I wish to confirm her having read the email(s) and tweets of mine, and how is she feeling now about me in the regard of the recent events.
Kyle
Might just want to keep a distance on things, seems like the type to kind of meander from creation to creation.
Only seen a bit of their stuff based on yours though, and the coldsteel one.
AquaDiamond8
Ive recieved no messages, but im not going to push her to answer cause thats not right

More Seething Towards SNT
19 December 2019
Chris
Hey, @everyone.
I’ve been mostly offline for the while now.
Waring Down a sinus infection now.
What is the current status on y’all’s part?
Also, has Courtney responded to any of you all?
She has responded in a comment to someone else on Twitter.
I’m feeling mildly ticked.
Kyle
I can tell you not to use a neti pot.
If she wants to be left alone, theres nothing that can be done.
AquaDiamond8
I havent gotten any messages, maybe it would be best to just leave her be, the constant messaging might annoy her and get bad
Kyle
I'm unsure what they could even offer.
Chris
I concur.
I don’t want to personally come off as annoying, either.
Although, I wonder how the Bad Trolls have been messaging her lately?
AquaDiamond8
Theres no proof anyone has, maybe she just wishes to be left alone, and should respect that

Opuscon's fanfic
27 November 2020
Chris mentions reading Opuscon789's fanfic SNT Vs Sonichu. He complains over story elements within it which mock him, saying that Opuscon was "misreading" him, and also complains over "inaccuracies" within the fictional story.
Later, Naught warns Chris that Opuscon is leaking his DMs with Chris. Naught and Kyle gossip about ProjectSNT and Opuscon, making aggressive remarks towards them and accusing them of collaborating.
Chris responds to the information of Opuscon leaking DMs that he isn't surprised. He likens Opuscon to a necromancer siding with the haters and complains over his portrayal of Sandy. On ProjectSNT, Chris is skeptical and asks for proof that she is making derogatory comments about him, and Naught fails to provide any. Chris retorts that ProjectSNT shouldn't be accused or compared to Opuscon789 without evidence.

By the way, thanksgiving was good and well.
Definitely experienced lots of new events during the day and today as well.

Also completed the Theme of Rosey and me for the game.
Made it look Pokémon game box as well on the menu.
Naught
oh nice, how much of cwcville have you re-created?
Chris (as Sonichu)
None.
Our present focus in the game is in the theme and updating the Mod, along with other Sonichu and Rosechu Mods to be made.
One of the present focuses, anyway.
I’m also presently reading in relation to the present events “SNT Vs Sonichu 2”.
Opuscon789 definitely misread a lot of Chris, me, and a lot of the other things.
But he did manage to get an aspect of how the dimension merge will go down.
Naught
what's that?
Chris (as Sonichu)
That was an alternate dimension’s set of us.
Not sure where to start on that.
There’s a bunch of inaccuracies.
The kangaroo election was shit as well.
Anyway, felt like sharing the Mod update with y’all for now.

Lainchu (Anaxis)
Where was it leaked? Kiwi farms?
Kyle
My opinion, they're both kind of shitty people.
Naught
Yeah we both knows it's bullshit, they've been leaking to the farms since cwc joined
Kyle
Well, not the least of which reason being that they don't want anything to do with this, but are really bad at making that known.
Naught
yes they do,
they have plenty of posts in random chris updates
they made themselves known
fuck off
Kyle
Well the whole, "I'm a victim" > "BTW heres some content, wow"
They're morons.

The WCT
have any of you DM'd said writer?
Naught
no, doesn't seem worth it they've been leaking for months
Kyle
Think it's best to take things one step at a time.
SR987 is useless. I don't really see anything going on, unless they go attention seeking again.
Naught
ever the rationalist
The WCT
This is why nobody should try having their fame come as a result of Chris.
Naught
just don't play games,
Kyle
Never met a situation that called for irrationalism.
Naught
they wanted to collaborate while saying they were doing nothing
Kyle
Closest you get is semi-randomness which still has a rational basis.
I don't know SNT's role, but the most obvious choice is that they're fully aware it. They're far too purposeful, if a bit stupid.
Naught
they are, the messenger has made it clear every time they post about it...
they even laughed bout having a quarantine channel / role
Kyle
We can chalk this up as another mistake. Just don't give them the satisfaction, Chris.
Naught
exactly
The WCT
Let's just get rid of them.
Kyle
Would be more convincing to get an answer.
All that requires is ignoring the moron.
[...]
Chris (as Sonichu)
Also, just to state, I’m not surprised Opus capped and “leaked” the DMs.
The way he wanted to portray himself as a Necromancer and takes the side of the Haters against us; he wrote that in alt-dimension’s merge (regardless of him having written our dimensions’ numbers in his fiv) he killed Sandy Rosechu in cold blood.
Also, Sandy is not a total blood-luster as he mis-portrayed of her.
Many grains of salt
Kyle

seems like most are afraid to have opinions...
Kyle
You're always a pariah to someone, don't make it yourself.
Naught
did he create sandy?
Chris (as Sonichu)
No
Naught
is this why you brought up a doppelganger a while back?
Chris (as Sonichu)
Sandy is Wild Sonichu and Simonla Rosechu’s daughter.
Naught
ok,
oh yeah
Kyle
Not everything is gospel, if the whole assumption is invalidated, well that's just being gullible.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Oh, if I had a dollar for every time I’ve felt like I wanted to scream since after when Chris and I body-swapped.
Kyle
What's the primary stressor?
Chris (as Sonichu)
I’d have somewhere around a few hundred dollars or so. (edited)
Naught
so your back?
Chris (as Sonichu)
Back?
No.
Anyway
As for Courtney, do you all actually have any such direct derogatory commentary from her about Christine?
Naught
she lets her posse do the talking so nothing direct,
the way they frame it is so transparent though
Chris (as Sonichu)
Then she can’t be held in that regard until she’s personally and directly said anything.
So, it’s unfair at this time to compare her to Opuscon.
I’ll check back later.

Discussing Opuscon789 and ProjectSNT
Delusion disclosure: This article or section takes place during Chris's phase of role-playing as Sonichu. He may refer to his Christine Chandler personality and physical body in the third person by using terms such as "mama".
30 November 2020 - 3 December 2020
Chris complains over the fanfic SNT Vs Sonichu by Opuscon789, thus touching off an extended discussion taking place over the next few days. During the talks, Chris mentions that Opuscon has blocked his Wattpad account. Instead of walking away, Chris chose to evade the block by creating a sock account in order to continue reading SNT Vs Sonichu, despite hating the direction of the story. Chris further describes his anger at Opuscon for the story - operating under his delusion that fictional works are reality, Chris accuses Opuscon of various crimes against humanity for events depicted in SNT Vs Sonichu. Later, Chris draws his own version of events for SNT Vs Sonichu in an attempt to manipulate Opuscon into including the lore within his story.
The conversation also shifts towards ProjectSNT. Naught, Kyle, and MKRNightVee make hostile remarks about her. In particular, MKRNightVee attempts to persuade Chris he should adopt SNT (the OC of ProjectSNT).
30 November 2020
Chris (as Sonichu)
Hey, y’all.
Feeling here and there again.
I finished reading SNT Vs Sonichu 2, and read the presently available prologue and first chapter of SNT Vs Sonichu 3.
And as you all may or not have noticed with my recent Tweet, I added my two bolts with a supplement story on that ebook site for between 2 and 3.
Naught
Yes, i read them
Canonitha
hi
Kyle
Evening.
MKRNightVee
I read them too, though I think your reaction is just going to make them write more because they got attention for their bad actions.
That being said they are jerks and their fanfiction sucks.
Kyle
Bingo.

[In response to MKRNightVee's "I read them too, though I think your reaction is just going to make them write more because they got attention for their bad actions." remark]
Yeah.
I get that; it’s nothing new with us.
[...]
Kyle
@Sonichu982 I mean, fool me once, and how the rest of that goes, there's probably a newer adage...
I'd be overselling it if I thought there was any conceivable non-zero chance at a positive outcome from that.
But I'd be interested in knowing exactly the thought process on that one.
2 December 2020
[Several hours after Kyle's above comment, at 2:31 am on 2 December 2020]
Chris (as Sonichu)
Ah.
While there is the possibility of scaring Opus into not writing anymore (which is very unlikely), he is actually encouraged to continue writing as he will (especially since he stuck SNT, Elise, Saki and her band, and others on that very remote island in his chronicling, as well as having instigated the wrath of one of my self-counterparts, the Sonichu Prime, of N-641.
Regardless of how he continues his chronicling and pathway, with or without the insightful supplement I’m providing at this time, it’s gonna hit him back in heavy karma levels very soon.
From what I ended up typing up on that supplemental chapter, I did notice that it did intimidate him, to say the least, as he ended up blocking our account on Wattpad, leaving me unable to continue reading his works on that account.
I created a second account with the gmail; the first one was linked with Chris’ Facebook.
So, while I was serious, and regardless of the showy disguise in his emotional response, he got his ass bit. LOL.
That’s what he gets for such a massive disruption of a Cwcville in another dimension, and especially for killing their Zelina and Sandy Rosechus horrifically; that really pissed us off.
One thing to make a Pokémon faint from fatigue, but gun to the head and a vertical slice with gory results crossed a major line.
And that was on top of him constantly calling Chris fat, super dumb and lazy, and the almost rape scene with Courtney that Chris was written into doing.
Regardless of that dimension’s Chris and Magi-Chan getting what they deserved from going beyond the initial merging of their two dimensions (which is still the case in N-641), now we all have to deal with a massively corrupt Sonichu Prime that is putting C-197 and 1218 at major risk.
Kyle
Sounds a bit, vindictive.
There's a contradiction
Vengence is a poor idea.
Corrupt?
Chris (as Sonichu)
Truth is not pretty some of the time, Kyle.
Count the blessing when the truth is pretty from your perspective.
Kyle
That's not really an answer.
Nothing good comes of this kind of idea of vengeance.
The contradiction being that "there is the possibility of scaring Opus into not writing anymore (which is very unlikely)" and " it’s gonna hit him back in heavy karma levels very soon."
It just looks petty.
Naught

@Sonichu982
[NotSoBot posts an image of Chris's avatar in a hat]
[...]
Chris (as Sonichu)
[quotes Kyle's "Vengence is a poor idea." remark]
Look, I agree on vengeance being a bad idea, and you are right on the contradiction I typed up.
We know vengeance is wrong, but we are talking about a Hater type of troll that committed murder upon our own species in another dimension, and even to go so far as to completely two major cities out of that dimension in the process (Cwcville and Charlottesville).
I can compare what Opuscon did along with what IdeaGuy did to us in that lost timeline.
IdeaGuy constantly changed us over and over again for the worst until when our Christine finally realized she had dominance over anything he could do (not to mention his embezzling of her).
Opuscon committed murders, defaced an Earth greatly, and tried to merged ALL dimensions instead of just the two as it initially should
have been.
As heroes that have helped as best as we could throughout not only our own Universe in C-197, but also multidimensionally, and Opuscon has done a massive amount of wrong.
Naught
I know it's easy to focus on what people have messed up, yet dwelling on it often doesn't help...
It helps to focus on what area's one can help in or try to lessen the damage
Chris (as Sonichu)
As heroes of our own dimension set, which is now in further danger by his hand, it is our priority to make sure he understands what he did was really bad and wrong, and to see karma and justice served unto him, and bonus make an example out of a Hater in this dimension.
Naught

@Sonichu982 i can dm him, so it doesn't become a public spectacle
Chris (as Sonichu)
I appreciate that, but we’ve already crossed that line when I got carried away while typing up that SNT Vs Sonichu 2.5 Supplemental, and when I wrote that tweet set with the rants against him and other haters’ misinterpretations of us remaining in constant.
Kyle
There's some people I'm more than happy to staple their ass to the ceiling, this does suck, but I don't think it compares to Idea Guys.
Naught
True, there's no need to prolong it though.
Let us know how we can help
Kyle
I just think anything is questionable, especially seething over it this long.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Magi-Chan is able to tell you both how y’all can help better than I can.
And at this point anything I say can be marked as contradictory in regards of Opuscon.
As on the one hand, he needs to complete writing SNT Vs Sonichu 3 in the remainder of this timeline, and on the other hand I did state facts that could wreck his creativity in irony.
Yet we know in this dimension and timeline set, Opuscon is rather dead set on his writing and his other passions, and he also knows better than to let others rain on their own parade (so to speak).
It is typical of a bad or hater type of individual. (edited)

The whole story is based on subversion, they seem to be a contrarian.
This would be ok in a different story, yet Sonichu is a classic tale where subversion isn't called for

You're the authority when it comes to lore, further acknowledging them only validates their nonsense
Chris (as Sonichu)

Oh, sure, Kyle.
Let’s ignore this and Let the Sonichu Prime of the lost Cwcville and former Charlottesville of N-641 cause revenge and utter dimensional chaos upon SNT, others, me and our Chris, and everyone else in 1218 and C-197, I said sarcastically.
Kyle
I mean, does this indicate a level of obsession that would poorly impact our ability to be rational.
Naught
Ok, so what if there were two sets of lore; one for fan timelines and one for the prime happenings?
Like an A and B story except and A and B world?
Chris (as Sonichu)
That is why we have N-641 for the haters.
There is another few or so for the remaining fans whose events would have caused a major stir in C-197.
Naught
Ah, ok
Chris (as Sonichu)
It’s already existent.

Opuscon is targeting both of our dimensions, here.

Kyle
That's life, time is linear.
Chris (as Sonichu)
There is something we can do: SNT is one that can become a symbol for right in a world with such bad and Hater types of individuals.
Courtney should be directly aware of this aspect of her OC by now.
There is a very good ending possible for SNT Vs Sonichu 3, but other events need to play out as well.
Kyle
If she did it, which she did, she is and doesn't care.
Chris (as Sonichu)
She can be encouraged to care of her own will.
I’m still pondering and checking the possibilities and visions and all that.

I think Christine and her family could adopt Snt of and together maybe use her image in comics or stories to spread good will and cheer. That's what I believe.

[quotes MKRNightVee's "I think Christine and her family could adopt Snt of and together maybe use her image in comics or stories to spread good will and cheer. That's what I believe." remark]
Yes and no, because SNT is Courtney’s primary OC, aside from her self-counterpart cat eared fur sona.
And then after that is her personal sassy Sylveon.
It would not be so simple to adopt SNT at this time.
[...]
Chris (as Sonichu)
Not to mention Courtney has shown a major scar when she read of N-641’s Chris Chan having that major blush attack in response to SNT’s special aura.
She shouted “Stop It!” about eleven times in response to that.
Kyle
Scar?
Chris (as Sonichu)
Empathize here, Kyle: your main OC and BFF attracts the major attention and affection of someone who is super cringe and off-putting to the point of making them blush.
Wouldn’t you want to take offense of how the cringe person reacted? (edited)
Kyle
Courtney, I don't really take much meaning of what someone who fucked up that much says.
Chris (as Sonichu)
The point is if Courtney was that objected about Chris (regardless of origin dimension) getting close to SNT, she would be highly unlikely to let her be adopted by our Chris Chan.
Kyle
True, but that would favor either extreme, cutting off or just going for it anyway, I say the former is smarter.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Try elaborating that to Courtney.
Kyle
I mean your decision.
I've got no interest in talking to someone like that.
Chris (as Sonichu)
You scared of her sass?
Kyle
No, she's a moron and seems generally unpleasant.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Others considered Chris a moron in a similar regard that also reached very unpleasant boundaries, yet you reached out to her.
Are you trying to excuse yourself with the adage from Mark Twain, “Don’t argue with an idiot; they will drag down to their level and beat you with experience”?
Kyle
I'm not going to advocate for anything out of line, you're operating under the pretense that this is actually a negotiation, when it really isn't.
Chris (as Sonichu)
You’re right, this is more of a debate and collab at this point, anyway.
I suppose MLPSilverQuill would be more your intellectual speed, anyway.

It isn't really a debate either. And they don't want to collab anyway, ergo, nothing involving them really does anything.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Sonichu said with a smirk and a Kra-Kow.
And anything involving them should do nothing in likeness, but here we are with shattering dimensions affecting our own as we speak.

I'll win anything that can be won, but you need an actual scenario.

If Snt chooses to go with our Chris chan of her own free will there is nothing cortney could do to stop it. Her trying to do so would be false imprisonment of Snt.

[quotes MKRNightVee's "If Snt chooses to go with our Chris chan of her own free will there is nothing cortney could do to stop it. Her trying to do so would be false imprisonment of Snt." remark]
Yeah, but at this time pre-merge, unless Courtney’s psychic link with SNT is super strong that the two of them have been telepathic with each other, it is tough to officially determine in this dimension’s regards.
Granted, this brain is telepathic and we have talked with SNT before, but in the end, rather Courtney allows SNT to be with our Christine and the rest of us or not remains squarely up to her.
And we still have fully yet to prove Chris better in her perspective that has nothing to do with the haters’ past and recent mocking and input.
MKRNightVee
You have nothing to prove to courtney, if anything she should be begging your forgiveness.
Kyle
It seems, unhealthy to talk so much about someone you've never talked to.
MKRNightVee
She's pretty much an e-thot using you so she can get sympathy points from Simps on the internet. (edited)

And if you don't adopt Snt she'll only suffer at the hands of a dictator. She's being used to make money for courtney, like a creul circus ring leader.
Is that really what you want for her? There is no "bond" to speak of. Only $$$
Kyle
I'm not going to go so ham on the possibilities, sometimes malevolence is just dumb.
MKRNightVee
Yeah...
I just feel sad for Snt, I'm sorry for my outburst, you know how passionate I am about the kind treatment of ocs...

In what way?
Chris (as Sonichu)
Chris would adopt SNT in a heartbeat if she could.
The way this brain functions on quandaries and having to take time with the more extensive ones, Kyle.
It kinda slipped onto the money/no money topic.
Anyway
Kyle
I'd take that on as a challenge, not going to take the bait on talking to someone on behalf of someone who made it clear they've made their mind up.
Chris (as Sonichu)
We are trying what we can with SNT’s present situation of her being trapped on that isolated island by N-Sonichu Prime.
In fact, there is presently a projection of this body and us inside it there accompanying her as we speak.
It’s a slow process, given the time constraints on that island.
Kyle
Something to be said about hiding... Just an idea, hmm.
Chris (as Sonichu)
They were still making their way to the second crystal ball last I heard.
Kyle
Probably a stupid idea though, won't go in on it.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Not to mention the speed of Opus’ chronicling.
Meanwhile, still pondering on all that.
Kyle
That does open up another possibility as to the calculus of it...
Not sure if viable or not, but it is an interesting plan.
If you're looking for options.
@Sonichu982 Just figuring from a statistical perspective, are there empty dimensions?
Chris (as Sonichu)
Hardly, and I can even cite Justice League Infinite Crisis animated movie that the only real empty dimension is a void between dimensions. (edited)
Kyle
In the grand scheme of things it's a statistical improbability that there isn't space somewhere.
Doesn't require that much, necessarily.
Just that empty is the ideal state.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Where there isn’t space is a case of claustrophobia for some.
Kyle
I'm just working on something as ethically white as possible.
Chris (as Sonichu)
You’re trying to create an empty dimension?
Kyle
No, trying to ascertain if one exists in a usable state.
Not that nationbuilding is likely to be a problem in space arbitrarily. But this is as sure as it gets.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Maybe check out JL Infinite Crisis part where the two Batman counterparts ended up. (edited)
The bomb went off and the bad one became gone.
Kyle
I'm just thinking of something as a workable solution to the problem.
Within the problem domain of knowable factors.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Maybe you can get in touch with Tony Stark, Bruce Banner or Bruce Wayne.
Give them a telepathic jingle or astral project to visit any of them.
Kyle
Well, I've already got no reason to assume impossibility.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Anything is possible; no doubt.
Kyle
Well, looks good on a bumper sticker, but there are laws of physics for a reason.
Chris (as Sonichu)
And yet there are also lack of physics laws at times.

Hey, y’all.

Kyle
Afternoon.
Chris (as Sonichu)
I’m doing some more meditating at this time, and I even, out of curiosity, and visual confirmation, logged into Chris’ account on KiwiFarms and found Opuscon’s account on there and read his recent responses.
They were typical of him as we had foreseen; wanting to disregard the facts we have presented to him of the present times, thinking he has all of the control over his present writing.
I also looked to see if Courtney had an account on there.
No results, and Opus stated that with his personal contact with her, she does not speak on Kiwi.
And, yes, she distances herself from all of this at the time.
So nuerotypical.
Kyle
Well, wasn't your goal to influence him, so, why doesn't he have autonomy over it, but you're still deciding to go off on Opus?
Naught
Yeah, she let's her underlings do the talking
Kyle
That's, kind of a poor insult, by the by.
Naught
What? They are underlings though
Chris (as Sonichu)
Opus is still very likely to write me and this body into his fanfic, to the level that it is fated.
It is what we have personally experienced and seen for ourselves on the island where we are.
And it will become obvious to him of his ability’s limits.
At this point, all I was doing was getting a confirmation update for ourselves. (edited)
Naught
Opus bragged about being prepared for this, they're going to just re-write what you put in (edited)
Kyle
There are, more constructive ways to go about this, they'll go away if you don't pay attention, don't threaten them, don't engage.
They don't care anyway, proof or no.
Chris (as Sonichu)
He can try, but when he looks into his isolated island, he will find that he was wrong.
Yes, but this was a fated event that was foreseen to happen.
I have not personally been in contact with him for almost a week now.
Kyle
Doubt it, it just ain't worth it regardless.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Not counting the indirect message through the Tweet with the recent drawing.
In many a perspective, it is agreeable that dealing with Opus isn’t worth it, but in the larger picture and greater scheme of things, this is the motivational point that is amongst the required events that needed to take place.
None of us are discouraged at all.
And if you need further verification, y’all can ask Magi-Chan.
Kyle
That's a very single sided justification.
Chris (as Sonichu)
One side out of the many infinite sides and perspectives.
There are many more details and possibilities as well that have yet to be confirmed.
But we all know will happen, regardless.
And then the latter of leftover possibilities passing into not happening.
Kyle
So what does the end look like? Because even the action seems vague.
Chris (as Sonichu)
There is no end, for the Sonichu series and everything else; it is ongoing.
We have answered your questions of what is likely to happen when the Dimension Merge happens for us.
Kyle
Regarding Opus.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Ah.
Post-Merge, after a while, he will be made an example of for the hateful things he had chronicled of Chris and the rest of us, and the rest of his sins against the rest of us in C-197 and 1218.
Out of all of the past bad and hater individuals of this dimension, Opus’ crime of going overboard the intended Dimension Merge in the Haters’ isolated dimension of N-641 is by far the worst.
Even compared to someone as great as Clyde Cash and BlueSpike.
I still can’t believe we have Clyde Cash reincarnated as a Sonichu living amongst us in C-197, but he has seen the error of his ways and does not bother us these days.
Last checked, BlueSpike remains dead.
Courtney is a neutral at this time, but the fact that she has created SNT and SNT having gone on all of these adventures from and returning to C-197; among the other dimension and timeline travelers, hers has had many a prominent effect on our dimension.
But it was not fully SNT’s or Courtney’s faults, so their outcomes are still to be confirmed, but the possibilities are existent, including the possibility of SNT wanting to go with Chris later on.
Still to be determined.
And on the fact that Opus insists on the events of SNT Vs Sonichu 2 directly involving our dimensions, here, further signifies and makes obvious that the overmerging of dimensions was intentional of him.
The power of Creators and Creative Types in 1218 and all other dimensions, including C-197, are truly vast and great.
For now, since I continue to experience Deja Vu as I have read Kyle’s thoughts and responded to him, we continue on the right track as previously foreseen.

Need I add that Robertchu (Mister C.) is a very strong negotiator, and up until when Barb gets into her Rosechu form (at this time), she used to have better negotiation skills.
In this dimension, Christine comes from a pair of good negotiating parents.

Barb has a Rosechu form as well? When would she take that form on?

Similar to how and when Robertchu finally came into his form on 9/6/2011; Barb has to pretty much lose her human form on that fated day a few years or so from now.

Maybe it does.
But, working past the assumptions which are universally applicable, although more viable to some, well, nothing that tempered thought can't do.
You tend to rely on ex post facto arguments, which, regardless of anything are never convincing to anyone who you'd already not have in your corner.
Overpowered isn't a complement. So that can go a long way in explaining, not so much distance but longitude, maybe.
Sidenote: Don't invade people's minds, its rude. 😄 (edited)
Chris (as Sonichu)
Well, regardless of Chris’ ability to write, draw, speak or think things into fully manifested and tangible effect between dimensions, locally and far, we don’t generally go into arguments that rely on that retconning exposition.
Also, a lot of the times, telepathy is tough to manage when you’re a beginner, and you can suddenly hear everyone’s thoughts simultaneously.

Scheming against Opuscon and his fanfic
Delusion disclosure: This article or section takes place during Chris's phase of role-playing as Sonichu. He may refer to his Christine Chandler personality and physical body in the third person by using terms such as "mama".
6 December 2020
Chris (as Sonichu)
Hey, @everyone.
We have just confirmed another foreseen development, but also confirmed one of our fears.
Opuscon is taking advantage of the Flame of Solaris in his chronicling.
In checking with a wiki-type page on Solaris (from your Sonic ‘06 game), the deity is capable of destroying dimensions and timelines, which obviously puts both of ours, here, at further risk.
I have confirmed this in the second chapter of SNT Vs Sonichu 3 that he has uploaded recently (from a dream SNT had).
Also, he denied using the S-Chu Crystal Balls after I foretold that, but that is what is chronicled on his part.
Presently, on the island, SNT has collected four of the Crystal Balls with mine and Courtney’s Sylveon’s help (Kinda wish Courtney gave the Sylveon a nickname; possibly Sasseon).
And last night, as I was helping SNT get through that boss to get the fourth Crystal Ball, I suddenly hyper-aura-flash power-up in both the manifested, tangible projected body there, and in the body here, N-641 Sonichu Prime revealed himself to us, and we had an encounter.
Guess who else ended up escaping and joining the fight...
N-641 Magi-Chan.
He escaped his collar inhibitor by steadily increasing his inhibited physical speed and vibrating himself out of the collar.
Damn it.
They could have used something stronger there.
But in this even more overpowered form I had, I managed to outspeeed and recatch that Magi-Chan in a Master-leveled S-Chu Ball, and our Mewtwo projected and collected the ball, and catching it within one of his uber tough Poke Balls.
N-641 MCS will be kept confined in both of the balls back on the distant dimension’s citadel complex.
Meanwhile, N-641 Sonichu made an attack on SNT, and he got away.
Now that that particular self-counterpart of mine has the Flame of Solaris within reach, he is going to be a really tough contender to deal with, even with our Chris Chan’s powers and abilities.
The only weakness Solaris has is in its consciousness; you knock out its consciousness, you got that thing.
I’d hate to see this play out with that corrupted Sonichu Prime at the helm.
Naught
Hmm, is this related to the doppelganger you brought up?
Chris (as Sonichu)
The doppelgänger topic earlier was in relation to Christine’s look and behave-alikes existent in this dimension and timeline, and most of them have decreased in number now.
Naught
So this corrupted version is different?
Chris (as Sonichu)
So, no, not directly.
Very much so.
The life of that particular Sonichu Prime was manifested from the misinterpretations of Chris and the rest of us from the haters and bad individuals of this dimension.
And after one has lead a life where their leading Chris Chan continued to be portrayed as lazy and Trump-level narcissistic, they would not be having a very good life.
Naught
Is there any way this can be put in the pocket dimension mentioned before?
Chris (as Sonichu)
It is most depressing and disappointing, to say the least.
Hmm...
In regard to the empty dimension or Void that @Nova has proposed earlier, the answer is yes it is possible, but no, due to how we’re talking about an individual with a corrupted mind and personality getting himself exposed to such a high-level of dimension-hopping and devastating power, even after re-extinguishing Solaris from N-641 Sonichu Prime, there would still be remnants left behind in his body that would give him some dimension-traveling abilities, albeit at the minimum level.
So, even if we were to disable him, and put him into that void, he’d eventually find a way out and back to us.
It would have to take a similar, but more intricate, time-fast and complicated measure, to catch him in something like one of Mewtwo’s uber-powerful Pokeballs after being caught in another very strong PokeBall, and sealing those balls within a barrier that separates them from any and all dimensions, timelines and universes.
And even if we wanted to issue a death penalty on N-641 SP, his consciousness would remainifest itself somewhere even farther and distant, and then quick as a flash return to us in a fully-recreated reincarnated body of his former self, with upgrades to prevent us from being able to repeat the process.
The only true way to defeat such a foe is to wait out their age, which would very likely take infinite eons of time, and then some.
Naught
I mean, if you stand by the river long enough the bodies of your enemies will float by
Chris (as Sonichu)
True
But the question is with or without the consciousness and memories of their soul and being that you have encountered before.
Naught
If it won't negatively impact the individual why not give them a men in black style memory wipe so to speak
Chris (as Sonichu)
I know what you mean.
But even if their memory were wiped like that, there remains the heavy possibility and likelihood that in dreams and linking with themselves from alternate timelines and dimensions, they would fully recover their memories and resume.
And with the varying possibilities of new memories that could have manifested during the time post-wipe, it would be more likely they’d continue their duty and tasks.
MKRNightVee
May I offer a small suggestion?
Chris (as Sonichu)
The motive of N-641 SP is the loss of his respective Chris Chan, and becoming dimensionally isolated from his original dimension, of which he blames SNT for.
He likely knows of Opuscon and his writing all of this into place as well, and would go after him soon enough.
And being aware of his OG self-counterpart (me, and my body that our Chris is in over there with you, Bis), he has a specific target hit-list. (edited)
Hey, Meghan.
MKRNightVee
Hey
Chris (as Sonichu)
I’m listening.
MKRNightVee
Nega magi-chan reminds me of Tri, that being said, as powerful as any magi-chan is he is at his core still a pokemon. Pokemon arnt inherently evil, once they have a trainer they pick up or feed off the morals and nature of the trainer's heart.
Capture him and find a suitable trainer, I would even be a willing candidate. Once that's done he should become more kind.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Initial response as I am eating lunch at the instant: Discord and Fluttershy’s “Keep Calm and Flutter On”, and the one Morty that overpowered all other Ricks.
MKRNightVee
[posts an emote]
Yay~
Sometimes the kindest and simplest answer is the key.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Yes, Sometimes.
The point I am trying to relay is that even though N-641 SP may have been mistakenly portrayed as dumb and uneducated, he still is very intelligent and smart, while also capable of educating himself.
Not to mention that N-641 MCS will have very likely educated SP in everything basic and human, Including how to play and master a game of chess, 3D Chess, and then some, to say the least.
SP is more likely to take advantage of the kindness and gullability of those who would take him in to his advantage over whatever the Trainer, even you, in question does and tries to influence them for the better.
Even if you take the aggressive route and left SP, he would more likely stake the claim on the fact that he is no longer bound and tethered and can resume on that hit list while on the run.
Yes, the variables to the contrary are there, but it’s still too soon to confirm that outcome.
Especially as we are still on the island seeing this event continue to play out, and must be finished, including the chronicling by Opuscon up to the extent or near the final chapter.
AND
The only main way to really get you ownership of N-641 SP to even get started on that, You, @MKR, would have to directly contact Opuscon, elaborate and get him to believe you into having him be able to even foresee that in what he is writing in order for it to happen.
And with that, his level of hatred and cynicism is high enough that you’d be blocked easier than squishing an ant in this dimension at the present moment, and you’d be putting yourself at risk of being further bullied by the other Haters and taunted on the Kiwi, and whatever.
Although, all of you are already reading on the Kiwi and know Josh, so he’s kind of a buffer shield.
And you have Nightvee and the others helping you out.
Okay, this may likely work out.
I can get you his handle, if you want to DM him on Discord.
MKRNightVee
Ok
Chris (as Sonichu)
All right then.
One moment, please.

Naught
Hmmm
Chris (as Sonichu)
Yep.
Phenomenal cosmic wisdom and knowledge, dimensional linking and syncing, with future sight abilities; it is a massive amount to take on in a single brain. (edited)
Naught
Tbh quite a few people gave them :autistic: and :dumb: ratings, what i mean is people want another 'saga' deny them the content they're trying to force.
Somethingrandom isn't interesting enough on their own without you, let it fade away and the events stay in their pocket dimension.
Chris (as Sonichu)
That pocket dimension is ever expanding, as I have told you.
Even if I ignored it, it would still happen and affect us all on impact.
This brain and conscious having the knowledge and awareness is the better of that pair of evils.
To be ignorant and never have had this information and awareness available, we would have still been force-projected into that fanfic, and only partially seeing the outcomes and details, thus really inhibiting our abilities here and now.
And when that moment comes down the road when N-641 SP makes a tangible break into this 1218 dimension and timeline, we would have wanted to be fully prepared as much as possible.
So, regardless of level of “interesting” with Opuscon in this dimension, he’s still doing the massive amounts of damage, and we need to nip it at the bud around when it happens. (edited)
Naught
Yes, I understand but I'm talking about from a public perspective
Chris (as Sonichu)
The counter-argument there is that as many people in this dimension as possible become more and more aware of the Dimension Merge for us, and had I never said anything about Opuscon publicly on Twitter, they would have had that significant lack of knowledge that would have inhibited them as well, and their lives would have been more likely taken by N-641 SP.
So, again, to have this available to them in answering their continuing questions as well is beneficial in the longer run.
Naught
Declare them a false prophet like Ben Saint, leave it at that.
It's your dimension
People will understand the overall message
What's the term they're like heretical texts or what's the term im looking for
The books that aren't canonized
Chris (as Sonichu)
Unfortunately, it is a premature time to thrust that upon Opuscon during these present set of events.
If I were to publicly tweet the discredit upon him prematurely before his trial under the Council of Gods, everything would still continue on, regardless, and again a lot of people would be lacking in information of the present day events.
And, even worse, the peoples of this dimension would be rioting and there’d be worse chaos amongst the remaining populations, and when N-641 SP comes in to do his thing, everyone would be too distracted by their fights between each other to be able to make their proper counters and self-defenses.
AFTER Opuscon’s trial, though, the deities will have disabled him of his abilities as they did to N-641’s Chris Chan, and only after then would he become labeled as a discredited ex-prophet, or similar. (edited)
Naught
Nah, I didn't mean on Twitter just in general.
But i guess it's going to play out
Chris (as Sonichu)
Quite so.
Such is the tiring responsibility, ability and duty of an overpowered psychic type, or a deity with such abilities, to root through and sort out all infinite possibilities and variables towards the foreseen future events, and adjusting/readjusting present events as best and complex-detailed as possible in order for us to see the more desired, optimal outcome and result.
You must also remember, Bismuth, that not only does our Chris Chan Sonichu have some control over C-197, but she has some control over this dimension we are in as well.
And with such great power comes greater responsibility.
We remain on the continued correct track, as the deja vu moments continue to pour in.
I will tell you that one of our present sub-goals that will improve our future possibilities is Courtney, and maybe Saki, playing some Sonic World, and a character Mod of SNT, with swappable homing attack, flight and glide skills with a Boost, tail and punch types of attacks.
If we can also get Saki’s fox OC created as well, that would be even better.
And with at least Courtney playing as SNT for hours would renew their psychic link and bond, and Courtney would better comprehend the present situations and how critical they are.
Obviously, another goal, if we can make it, is to have character Mods of Rosey, Magi-Chan and Chris Chan in her Sonichu form for Sonic World as well.
Each of them would have our personal touch in the voice files and the Bio.
Nightstar in her Sonichu form would be an awesome bonus on top of that if possible.

Dox of Opuscon
6 December 2020
The conversation picks up from the above First Layer chat after Chris says he will give MKRNightVee Opuscon's Discord name.
Naught suggests MKRNightVee hold off on contacting Opuscon. Naught then produces a dox file of Opuscon. He then posts screenshots of a Kiwi Farms DM conversation with Opuscon in which Opuscon is shown the dox file. MKRNightVee and Kyle gloat.

The Fan Fic is continuing as normal even with Chris' interference.
This was kind of a group effort. I do about 99.8% of the writing and I have other people come in and check what I write. Those people then check my work and provide feedback on my work, suggest changes, and edit. Then I post the chapter.
I admit I can't draw, I pay somebody else with commissions to do art for me. Because of this, I have met some very talented people who I love to call my friends.]
