he may be the first but he's still not
as cracked up as he is made out to be
yeah you're
right he's too tall to even match a
radio
tower hey what's up everybody jesus
Christ Jan Soni Prime here once again
with another quick like review video and
today we are reviewing the second
Voyager in the way in the third wave of
Transformers Legacy Diverge PVC Citizens
Conractor the
First i forgot the joke i forgot to joke
i got I can only do this one more time
but first okay back to the
show all right anyway so here we are and
there he is and first and foremost as
always we'll take a quick look at the
packaging so right from here we got Mr
crector being all vetting all blue and
jetting all the way look at those bluees
coming out the uh thrusters in this back
and just hey you got to love the
improved art quality on these so
anyway he is a forger
classifier
classif on this side of bots you got the
uh artwork of uh Crack to the first and
a nice dynamic pose right there and his
arm and the gun on his right hand
continues into the uh other into the
front panel and just a big old shot
closeup of Tractor and there is his name
in
Cybertronian on this side of the box you
got half of the uh lovely artwork right
there the poster you got the top half
right here and there you go anyway so
yeah there's the top and there's the
bottom with the words things barcodes
and uh on the back of the box you have
your obligatory processes this that the
other combined to make a bigger robot
and a lovely bio if you'd like to read
that here or you may go to the quick
light and that's basically it for the
packaging
so moving right along here we have big
old crack the first and he had decreased
from being like you know essentially uh
when every when we was just everybody
PVC citizens everybody was essentially
deluxe class like the uh pun slabs and
the savvs of course that includes the
crafters they were deluxe class as well
and that was no different with this big
guy here who got really promoted by
Megatron just a bit of that extra all
spark energy and they had my combination
gave this guy a really sizable upgrade
from Deluxe class to
Voyager let's get a let's get a closeup
here look at the details so just
essentially got the big old nose cone
right there and
uh also more detail going on just
essentially just uh look at the top of
the jet mode here but yeah got lots of
nice details you got a shiny Decepticon
symbol center right there and you got uh
the badge of glory from Megatron on
either wing over there lots of more of
detail going on and side of B oh and
these little fins right here that makes
up the lang gear they are patched
separately in the bots you got put these
in yourself you see they are like that
they're meant to be this way cuz that is
meant for Mr crafter the first so
there's the side of this Jeff mode and
there's the uh back yep and uh so yeah
anyway so we just we've seen the top and
uh there's the bottom and the side from
head is essentially visible everything
which is just pretty much common with
the jet formers and he does slide as
jets tide ride for flying sliding big
old jet jet jet jet jet jet jets Jetson
so now for comparison here is Craft of
the First with the
CC82 a little tank with a big jet was
that supposed to be a big joke yeah
you're going to hear a lot of big
influences and commentary throughout
this video
cracktor
with Christian Prime right here
and we're gonna just do go all out here
right this one so here you go here he is
with
prime big old truck with trailer and big
old jet can't get any better than that
can
we yes all right so because I realized
it's a bit too hard or difficult to get
the group shop so we'll just do
individually so we'll just uh here is
crack to the first with wave
and here is crafted the first of the
remaining Quickville Autobot Comb of
Aubberats Roll Out Chapper and
Fireshot
with
Sonu and now we have the trio together
in their group comparisons so Kraton the
first SAV the first and Punlab the
first all right and here is Cracktor the
First with the Deceptic Clones SAVV and
Cracktor yeah look at that big Jet small
jet
shar and here he is with Glammy Makoto
and
Crusher
with
Starscream hey the Decepticons are not
that great but they shall fight
alongside this guy
and of course
with
bigs big jet big
tank and now for the considerable mold
comparison here is Kratch the first with
combiner wars
silverbolt and here you go now we can
finally do this from K the from before
Crack the first here he is with
Transformer Cybertron
Thundercracker because it's
precious oh so Thunder Kraken crackctor
precious so there you
go all right now so let's run through
the accessories he only comes with just
a few obviously two which are important
that's his
uh pair of guns right here the rifles
and just obviously so you can get a
closeup of the uh details right there
and that's good molded in details on
both sides and uh back front bunch of
gray plastic and yes he has the uh
combiner mode feet he's got feet both of
these big feet right here put one right
there see got the molded details all
around on the foot all around yes and
the little foot in the back and you've
got a slot for a Titan master or prime
masteraster right there and of course
the incorporation of these is uh you
know obviously simple so you got uh 5 mm
ports underneath there on the bottom and
you got the the hands right there on
either side so they can hold the uh
weaponry so obviously
we'll have him holding his own
guns and just that's simple and elegant
enough as is but here we go but if you
just you still want to do it anyway you
can put these in those holes in the
bottom and
well that's a
thing that's a thing you could say he's
a lacrosse valkyrie walker or pretending
to be anyway and if he's pretending to
be one that's pretty much the worst
imitation right
there all right so that's basically it
for vehicle boats let's get down to
transformation shall we let's All right
so we're going to go into combine mode
first because this guy becomes the torso
of Pornocra Penrave Bay so let's see for
starters we're going to flip the tail
fins down and we're going to pull the
wings out and
up and then uh actually leave them up
that way we're going to go ahead take
the uh nose cone cockpit that cockpit
yeah and then rotate there's like a tab
right there that goes to this slot right
here and just make sure you get that in
there there you go all right so there
you go now you got visible head syndrome
yep no but all right so anyway you take
the uh arms and uh you're going to
rotate the fractious joint and
uh yeah this is the front yeah rot like
that and you go make a video mode you
want to take the hand there and uh flip
it up so it's like that and same thing
on the other side just rotate that down
and those are going to become the thighs
for the kabay mode and then you got
let's see and then you want to go under
here see make sure I remember I get this
oh that's right all right so you want to
pull on this first i take a little I
figured out or screwdriver or
something get this out come on come on
there we go yeah you take that out pull
that up you got this little slot right
here
this tab right here is going to go into
so you're going to flip that down like
that and pull that up and there you go
the head is in place and then these will
come all done off the side and just flip
these in and they're going to meet in
the middle and become the chest oh I
forgot so you got take this flip it up
so you got that and then you do and then
you do this all right so there you go
there is the punctctor V torso and the
head yes and yep it's quite the thing
and we'll go for the for the Oh I forgot
to mention so these right here you want
to flip these down for the arm
pieces so that's just let you know about
that
okay but yeah so like I said we'll go
into further detail when we go into my
mode but I will mention this so let's
get a little closer look there's that
head scope right there lots of uh silver
some grays the blacks right there and uh
promote Decepticon symbol right there
there's like this little thing in the
belly and there you go and then just uh
looking up the back got all this going
on right here all right so that is the
Kabotes let's get down to transformation
again shall we lights so we got to take
these put them down the middle and put
them put them back where they
were this will get flipped back down
we're going to take the combine mode
head pull that down rotate that back and
flip that back in we can flip them
upside down at this point they
definitely recommend they got these in
the center so the legs so fold them out
there's like a little slot right there
this tab right here goes into for when
you're going back into vehicle mode so
you rotate that down
oh flip those back in yep okay now you
got like a little things try to pull it
out right there you better off just
pushing right here to get the foot to
come out do that and then Yep push like
that or you can use your fingernail
right there get the heel to come out and
then you rotate that forward and uh put
that there and then second purse just
like the first pull that
out push the foot out push the heel out
put that in rotate that and um yeah
that's a weird looking superhero type of
thing goop from this perspective it kind
of looks like an eagle it reminds me of
an eagle face or something that's funny
anyway so we'll flip his hands back in
we're going to rotate these down pull it
to the mouth rotate that down put that
out and on a soft click so you got just
do that to this to engage the elbow
joint and then we'll pull on this and
then push that out to flip the head out
we'll put the wings out a little bit
further and
uh so essentially yep there you go that
is Mr collector the first off center in
his robot mode he's quite fat in robot
mode look at how beefy and big and tall
he is he's just all over the place here
so let's get a closer look and look at
look at the details not at that belly
but at the head that there's no enough
with the big jokes i'm not going to take
any more big jokes to the narrator or
the
audience is
that all
right no actually you know what that
came in perfect time so we get great
Well there you go yes so we get great
look at the head sculpt there lots of uh
reds and silvers and the eyes are red on
the red as well and then yep lots of
good molding detail over Papey forearms
red shoulders blue orange and the faux
cockpit and then going down there got
lots of uh the blues and even some
details on the uh a little bit of detail
on the feet and uh going back up the
side little bit of uh more detail on the
heel and uh all that and uh with that
particular type of landing gear he's got
this look going on and that's uh
decently cool all right
anyway
so articulation wise what have we got
i'm going to tell you so the head is on
ball joint so you got you got a little
bit of wiggly wiggly wiggly right there
can look up a tiny bit uh he can't
really look down on just a little bit if
you use that transformation joint at
least a little bit he can get to
squirrel and hunch into his shoulders
and hard to rotate a full 360 uh these
wings can move in and out depending on
the how you want them the arms can
rotate a full 360 on a ratcheted joint
and they can move and they ar move in
and out on that ratchet joint you got
bicep rotation and then you have
uh slightly under 90 degrees bend there
at the elbow uh the hands do not rotate
but you can put them upward if that's of
any use to you uh there's no waist
rotation the way he transforms and then
legs can move forward that far and um
back that far and outward
yeah you can do the full splits and then
some you got thigh rotation and then
uh you got full you got full range of
knee movement right
there and then
uh feet uh can't really move up beyond
the certain point on the uh foot but
they can move down quite a lot and the
uh heel joint can move down and up there
as well
all right so let's talk about the uh
weaponry once again so the big feet and
the big guns so you have uh ports on
either Popeye form right there if you
want to remove these they can uh expose
a couple of five mess right there and
then you can be stored in the hands or
in the uh forearms be like
uh some sort of
uh knifer dagger i don't know there you
go there's that option they definitely
should they're definitely better off
back there all right so typically the
guns will be stored on the Papey
forearms in a way similar to uh the
seekers so you got that going on and uh
just when in storage mode I just like
having them uh flipped this way like you
know it's like you know they're not
engaged so I feel like that works
decently well and then uh yep these you
can just you can put them in the
forearms or you can just uh put them in
his hands and you can hold them like a
couple of big old blasters right there
so you got your pew pe bag pew pe bag
and all that good stuff going on right
there
but yeah I feel like the uh answer is
pretty obvious as uh get him to stand
right dude dude come on come on dude all
right but anyway
yes these
what these weapons are indeed Blush
compatible that's right so we get our
blue effects here so pop a blush here on
the uh tips of the tips of his normal
guns and we'll pop bushes into these
uh bush okay yeah there we go yeah I
thought they weren't gonna I thought
that was not going to hold for a
second
okay well that's a bit of a bummer why
is that not holding there oh well um you
know what we'll just do it with the uh
two guns right here just
uh Yeah there you go all right i guess
just that don't work out all right but
I'll do this anyway so we can uh pretty
much got ourselves a big old cracker in
the first
and a kraken but now it's all cracked up
to be
blouch and now for
comparison here is Crash of the First
with the CCA2 and
Sonu
with Christian Prime and Octopus
Prime that's definitely a good size
comparison right there so there is cr of
the first in comparison with the all by
combiner team wave fire shot roll out
armorats and
chapper and the firstly trio are now
together in their dynamic group shot so
Katr the first path the first and
scoundrel as vessel the first and here
is crack the first with
decept and little cracker it's like a
little family going on right here isn't
it and here is Cracktor with the Gwen
Makoto and Crusher and here he is with
the Screamer and the
Megs let's see what See how big they are
the big boys are in town again it sure
looks like
it and then of
course here he is in comparison with
Combiner Wars
Silverbbo okay that's looking good yep
and then of course last but not least
but most importantly here he is with
Transformer Cybertron Thundercracker
because it's you know what it is it's
precious so there you go and there you
have big old character the first and I
say yes quite a decent big old figure
right there the joints are secure and uh
he's got like quite all the physique
going on and just uh just there's quite
a bit of appeal to this big guy i mean
just uh hey how high he can get as far
as he can go without actually feeling a
bit dizzy because that's how it started
out when he went from Deluxe class to
Voyager class he got dizzy quite a bit
so of course he just feels sensitive
about his height and then you got to
feel empathy for those that uh just have
a hard time well being short like
Lightning Bliss but just still give him
respect appreciation me no offense
anyway this you know big guy this big
bad guy right here so of course I have
right to mess with this guy
anyway so yeah this essentially get
quite a decent figure and obviously
we're gonna have a good time with the
combined mode in a little while so uh
yeah there you go now I picked this up
at Target now these figures are pick are
popping up in your Targets your Walmarts
your Amazon.com the Big Bad Toy Store
Entertainment Earth and all other toys
sell toys things whatnot and uh don't
forget to look me up for look me up on
blue sky and of course uh find me on the
quick light i'll put all the links to
those and uh where you can read the bio
of this if you didn't read the box in
the description down below and uh yeah I
think that's pretty much it so this is
Transformers Legacy Diverg Mr corrector
the first and this is Jesus Christ ch
you prime s remember you don't stop play
because you grow you go because you play
be g be proud and crush the
cracker all right everyone listen up we
had a quite a failure the last time we
tried in attacking that electric plant
but this time we will not fail i was
down last time because my wings were out
of order and they needed lots of repair
but the time has passed the moment has
cleared we have made more of all of you
and we are ready to make the next attack
makoto still wants us to get what we can
from that electric power pet so we will
give that another crack but also she's
asking us to get more goods and
resources and John from the active
volcano on the nearby island just off
the coast a bit of a flight but we all
will be able to make it we'll be
able we will succeed this time my big
body forces here and nobody is going to
make another big joke about me ever
again do I make myself clear sir yes sir
we will do our best for you sir yeah all
right then everyone get to your stations
we'll head out in no less than two hours
get your air jaw get your recharge and
we're going to make our move
double guys let's
go hey hey hey good job big guy i didn't
even make a sweat i'll tell you what we
didn't even need siv here no we just
needed you and it worked out very good
didn't it uh yes quite so but still
nobody can deny my gun it could kill
crafter here if I wanted to you better
not be thinking what I am thinking that
you are thinking as I me there is no way
you're going to be bigger than me there
is no way you're going to be able to
take me down with that big gun of yours
if anything that requires a big joke is
to be made is that gun how is the
weather up there you dang blasted gun
it's actually looking pretty good right
now okay I need to work on new material
uh excuse me pl Slav first sir yes for
this young fellow i just have a question
if I may all right go ahead ask a
question we'll give you an answer you
like it or not all right then all right
so I was just wondering so how many bots
do you think are going to try to come
back to us this time i mean do you think
the quick vill can actually fly to the
volcano i kind of feel like we have a
bit we'll have a bit more success at the
volcano and that we probably just
wasting time so why don't we send our
troops over to the volcano sir oh yes
you know what i have a ship in
that boss lady it's her command we don't
argue with boss
lady and that's that's pretty much it to
say
so we'll make sure we have a good number
of our deceptic cloud and troops all
over the place between both places so we
are sure to win and actually get
something good this
time very well then sir I will take my
leave i will see you in the two hours
time sir here you go take your time bad
fellow
