Journal
4 May
Chris quote tweets a tweet from SEGA Japan asking what kind of wish would people want to make into an emerald.
If there is anything I could wish for at this very moment, I’d wish I had done better at personally keeping and writing personal journals throughout my life, without interruption. 💎⚡️💙⚡️🌕✨

Christorians:

All of you Christorians are not a joke to me at all. Had I done better at journal keeping, you all would have more good and accurate information to work with. It’s my bad that’s not the matter in this timeline.
May The Fourth Be With You
4 May
“A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, May 4th became a holiday.” May the Force be with you in enlightenment.
⚡️💙⚡️

Mandela Effect
6 May
Hey, everyone: I have a word of the day for you all: “Freshappl” (fre, shap, pul).
It means a sudden change in the present universe, dimension, and/or timeline.
example: “I went to the store and bought a bag of apples, and on the way home, it became a bag of oranges. I went through a freshappl as I distinctively and actively remember buying apples and not oranges.”
Better self-love
7 May
Eponasuu (@eponasuu)
I did my own version of @CPU_CWCSonichu latest drawing, it really inspired me, so hope there's more to cum! ❤️ ^ ^ ❤️
[Artwork based off of Chris's earlier "romanceable" NPC artwork]
Aside from the lack of quills on the back, this is very lovely, indeed. Good job.
😊⚡️
And for the general information for those who asked: I have been working with my body in better self-love. We’ve removed all the negativity and toxic vibes from the past relationships and such with the fakers and haters. And our rebonding work also included sex exploration, so been feeling my improved oats, so to speak.
I definitely would have figured out and found myself a lot sooner had I not been abused with a number of cock and asshole images shoved into my screen, my late websites, and shit from said haters and fakers.
Do not push on anyone who is still in their own soul-searching and self-evaluation developments; it is not only most uncouth, but degrading; like spanking a baby after it was just being born. But, again, I’ve recovered myself, and included my present mentalities and improvements in that to set my boundaries. The few of you all had your respective chances, But taking advantage of my kindness, good nature, and naive mentality at the times, did all of you nor I any positive flavours at all. I am a literal Goddess, and I shall no longer be privy or prone to such shenanigans against my own will and intentions again. I know my self-worth throughout not only here, but throughout the multiverse as well.
That is all for now.

Cool! I can always trust Finn to bring in a choice of good vibes and fun! 😊⚡️💙⚡️

Hi, Mom. Remember, everyone, regardless of situation, your Mom, Mother, or Motherly Figure had a life and past of her own back in the day before you came along. She has gone through a lot for not only you and yours, but herself as well.
And Barbara Anne Weston Chandler still looks good for her wise age. #happymothersday2021
Also, to whoever found and uploaded the pages and photos from the #RandolphHenryHighSchool 1960 yearbook, Thank You so much for doing that and allowing me to find this old photo of my mom. 😊⚡️💙⚡️

Age 18 to 25
13 May
Aaron (@IAmAaronWill)
Age: 18 to 25
The age where you can build your life or destroy it.
Curious topic, but reminds me. At 18, I had a birthday party with my good friends invited; it was lovely. Later that year of 2000, I graduated from High School with an award for my grades, but no awards for my Talents and personal Progress. On retrospect, the friendships and memories remain of very good and continued developmental value, despite me being naive on dating, and often being in observational mindset. Back then, I became feeling very depressed from having to leave my friends and alone.
Positive side, after turning 18, in March, I discovered my Son, the one-and-only Sonichu Prime, and really developed further from that.
Between 18 and 25, I tried to be socialable, but I was still feeling damage from the Graduation trauma, and difficulties in #PiedmontVirginiaCommunityCollege, the Infamous Sweetheart Search. Back then, I was really still innately trying to find myself, but was more focused/misfocused externally. These days with my better comprehension of not only self-confidence, but also auras, chakras, and my #PsychicPowers and Goddess abilities, I realized between that seven year span, and up til about 2014 with my coming out, I was not attracting others, because my aura was indecisive and unfocused during the time. Not to mention that in later years, I was actually destined for better partners that I authentically love, appreciate, and care about, as they each do me: Mewtwo, Sylvana Rosechu, Cryzel Rosechu, and, of course, our OP, compassionate and devoted, Magi-Chan Sonichu.
I also now understand how uber unique I always have been; back in the early 2000s, I was not attracting others in my search, because my aura literally shielded me and made me invisible to Most and the typical. And with the toxic types finding me offline and online to torment and test me down the road, like moths to a bright light-powered flame. But, also, with me having been undecided about myself back then, as well as it not being in the events of me meeting others in searching, it was certainly obvious that my intentions were being misinterpreted for solicitation.
At least I had started work on my chronicling my Sonichus and Rosechus in our sister universe of C-197, as well as my central self-counterpart from there, despite keeping details lacking and leaving plot holes, as well as going overboard talking about myself as much as I had.
Ah, but come 2007 and my turning 25, I started to venture further towards my light-powered workings and interdimensional Goddess responsibilities, with an informative message video, similar to a gospel, BUT it does not stand the test of time, and I would definitely update it, personally, when I get the moment after the Dimension Merge events are completed.
But, I digress. During that seven year mark of 18 and 25, I’ve actually ended up doing both in going downhill, as well as going uphill. But I needed all this in order to better shape myself to where I am and continue to follow my immortal path with my immortal body, working hard for me, for my loves and family, and for everyone in general.

I wonder if there's an Actual @CPU_CWCSonichu who comes from a Japanese-Inspired Dimension!!!What are your thoughts? ⚡️🐸⚡️
[Artwork of a character from Avatar: The Last Airbender]
Very much possible, and in fact, I have personally met with this particular self-counterpart of mine.
Funny bit of irony that this particular art piece came into my visual view today, because last night, my loves and I had just finished binging the entire series of #AvatarTheLastAirbender; really good show, I do agree. Also spiritually insightful.
Universe-wide illusion of separation
16 May
Everyone, the barrier that separates us in this universe 1218 and every creature and individual in C-197 is a centuries-old illusion, and our ultimate success is to dispel the universe-wide illusion of separation. We all live, exist, and co-exist together as a collective. ⚡️💙⚡️

💜 "Like + RT + Comment your fav #GFUEL flavor" to win a 4 Pack of cans! Picking 2 winners tomorrow just because! 🤠
Hey, #Pewdiepie, here’s a shout-out to you, because I like the Lingonberry flavor. 😊⚡️
I also like #SonictheHedgehog’s Peach Ring, and Rainbow Sherbet flavours. Blue Ice comes in fourth to me at present.
Also, to only comment on it: I have also liked the Nemesis Tea flavour, but to me, it felt rather Meh, especially compared to regular tea with lemon.
But, me personally, I would gladly and more than happily put my human form and Sonichu form visages on @GFuelEnergy cans of Passion Fruit/Mint flavour; call it the “Electric Hedgehog Power” Flavour.
And Sonichu Prime and Rosey Rosechu would love to be on @GFuelEnergy cans of Apple/Lemon flavour; that’s “Zappin’ It Up” satisfaction.

Please, don't ask me

thank u for understanding 🥰

considering that a solid chunk of the cast is based on real people its kind of impossible for it to not be, but we don't judge here
Sonichu is the one only fandom where are no shipping wars
And yet we have our own set of #SecretShipficFolder cards in an individual deck, expansions, and Promo cards.

Smaller diameter pin for a slightly larger hole for a not too tight, but secure enough fit. 😉⚡️

Sister and I have been knocked completely flat from the second vaccine dose these last couple of days. Luckily we both broke our fevers last night, now we're just fighting the residual aches and pains.
Looks like another day of staying in bed. 😴
Yeesh! Well, count your blessings, both of y’all. Shortly enough, you both will catch up. And then y’all can sport your completed cards like Convention Badges.

I’ve did something similar for my mom as well; I laminated it with shipping tape as well, and attached it to her purse.
More vaccination stuff
20 May
Chris responds to his previous tweet announcing that he and Barb were vaccinated.
Just to mention this, but I got vaccinated as well not only as a precaution, but with me, it was a Formality for the present guidelines of this timeline at present. Yet, also, me being vaxxed, rather you all sense, feel, know it or not, is mutually beneficial for all of you and everyone else as well, in general. The incoming blessings and good news around this Earth will prove this as well.
I will also mention that, in the way, I Did foretell that there would eventually be a form of vaccine needed for something, and I would be amongst those in that (then) future time to do more with it. Although, my mistaken and selfish interpretation of what the vaccine would be for was most unfortunate of me to have drawn of my self-counterpart to be part of.
I need not further elaborate or explain, for me to do so now would be major spoilers for all of you, and when it comes to divine events, even the common folk knowing would cause the major disturbances in the sequence. All I can advise of you all, each and respectively, to do is to become spiritually enlightened for yourselves, as well as being kind with everyone, and loving of yourselves. And be observant of the local events, news, and sensations around you and what you read. In due time, all of this will not only have transpired and completed successfully with the Merge’s completion, but there will be various published and chronicled literature and media for all of you to read, watch, and take in to learn for yourselves the greater details from the first-hand perspectives and so forth.
Lots of Love, and Be Safe and Well.

These are super kawaii. But the one of Magi-Chan looks sad; typically, even when a vision is a sad one, he tends to find a work-around to make it work out in general, so his expression, albeit feeling a bit tired, is motivated, encouraged, and ready to take action within reason.

School rivalry
24 May
In response to two Twitter users discussing what should be the name of the rival school of "CWCVille High"
I had not thought of High School rivalries; that was not my thing at #ManchesterHighSchool, even though during my time as a Manager in Freshman year of the Varsity basketball team, we did visit a rival HS among the away games in ‘96/‘97. On the other hand, such rivalries were observed and noted from certain tv shows and movies I’ve watched at the time and before then. There are two High Schools in the city of Cwcville, one on the North-East side, and one to the South-West; both named Cwcville High (NE and SW).
Mary Walsh did, however, get an honor or a new High School in New Comma being named after her. So, I would say that’s a fair rivalry.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
26 May
Hey, y’all. I was just remembering the classic TMNT episode, “April Foolish”, and the turtles crashed a costume party; obviously mistaken for wearing costumes, themselves. Donatello accepts an award from the host on their “costumes”, even if it was for Ridiculousness. But, thinking it further, they essentially won an award for Being Themselves. And when you receive a prize or prestige for literally being yourself, that is a very high Compliment; amongst the best compliments one can ever get. 😊⚡️💙⚡️

Very much true. I always appreciate authenticity and honesty in others when they express it. ⚡️💙⚡️
Bizarre Twitter rant
26 May
Here’s a #Brainbender for all of you: No Judgment, but Considering a number of individuals in the past have sought doing kind things for and with me to seek favour and praise from me, And the number of the past online Exes (Fakers) who played me in relationships for a time, Did anyone of them, or you all in that similar light, think to genuinely be good with me for an extended time in order to actually learn and experience me on massive extension?
This is Not an invitation to start such a relationship with me based solely on that.
[GIF of Rafiki from The Lion King hitting a lion over the head with a stick]
And now, after some time since whenever the hell in this universe I ranted online, I’m going to put forward a rant I feel, now, is appropriate since I brought up the question.
How could everyone who could have, while they had the opportunity, not think to actually continue on with me and offer more content than Lois Lane is with Superman? Not just the thoughts and musings I would privately have and confide, but the entire experience of being with me, feeling my aura of energy, and even supporting me while I supported them the best I could have. And lack of money does not count at all in this, because what I have always had to offer was in emotion, compassion and support. And that is despite and regardless of how more Naive I was as early as 2007.
But NOoooo! All they thought of was “How could I take advantage of Chris’ heavy heart and over-abundance of kindness and love? How can I toy and mess with him, emotionally and mentally moreso than the bastard already had?”
And, indeed, to take it a step further, let’s talk about that Sex, or genuine lack thereof. “Oh, I don’t want to contract anything with Chris and his overweighted belly and butt. I know! I’ll play “Call Girl” with him and shit his rocks off by his own hands, embarrassing him in front of his own dad. For The LULZ!”
Catherine Sorrentino had a closer vantage point to get that mark that those before her were afraid to ever venture to: the Actual Intercourse. Everyone had the opportunity, even Emily and Kacey, since they actually met me in person, to yank me along and claim the “V-Card” before April, 2012. “Oh, Sure, I’ll bang rocks with him from a massive distance from in front of my computer, but I’ll never go and play “Crying Game” and farther by shoving my cock up his ass.”
“Also, Haters, let’s get Vivi to hack his website and post Gay Porn Ads all over it; that’ll really warp his fragile mind.” Everyone Had their chance to actually have me, but they didn’t. Leaving being remainingly satisfied with just Imagining their penises up my ass, or my penis up their asses and vaginas and cumming on their chests and faces. Or, even Post-2015, having the idea of “I Know! I’ll pay for Christine’s gender reassignment; vouch for a donor uterus and ovaries, so she can Still conceive, even though she could never lose her sperm sack, or what’s left of it. And, Oh, Yes! I’m gonna ram her soo hard up her pussy, she’ll hardly feel anything after I’m done with her.” And even with other women wanting to feel up my vagina and using a double-sided dildo, or whatever they privately please.
I Can Go Onnnnnnnn.
But, suffice to state the obvious of how too late everyone of this side of the Iron Curtain with the fake and hate in that minority of the remaining toxic populace to take any form of advantage over me like that.
On the one hand, I am, however, most grateful that the majority is genuinely a lot better than that; at least you all do better than you think outside of behind your screens around you, and so on. And I actually am proud of you all for Not taking advantage of me like that at all. It demonstrates that this world is mostly kind-hearted and compassionate and moved on from the stereotypes of yesterdecade.
😊⚡️💙⚡️
On the other hand, my body has not had it as easy as I in my interdimensional travels, since I’ve had to astral project and leave it with its backup systems keeping it in check and safety; My Body is sexually over inexperienced and Starved.
THAT in itself, counter-demonstrates that on this side of the Iron Curtain, not even One Genuine, Authentic, Enlightened, Individual with a similar aura to mine exists. This, before the completion of the Dimension Merge/Collective Shift, I had prayed and wished to be proven wrong about. But now the Merge Is On, and that has been passed by. Magi-Chan, Cryzel, Sylvana and Mewtwo would not have minded a sixth in our polyamorous relationship who was born of here.
Just gonna let that sink in for all of you who had considered over the years. I am finished with this rant. Thank you for listening. I will also state I have no regrets in sharing this with all of you. I feel this is a major truth you all needed to hear. I can hear the thoughts of “Retarded Faggot” and “Get a job” already amongst all of you in response. But, I also hear the remaining responses that are actually kind and empathetic with this situation and bunch of emotions amongst the Majority of the world. 😊⚡️

Text from the fanfic
Chris-Chan in: Romancing CWCly
Written by Kill3rQu33nie
Boom! Crash! Just another day in CWCville, various fighting between the heroic electric hedgehogs and various baddies sent by the evil witch hslaweel Ryam.
“I will succeed in tearing this universe apart before your so called dimensional merge happens!” She shouted at seemingly no one. The various hedgehogs on the ground looked at each other.
“She talking to me?” Sonichu asked while looking over to his friend wild, who just shrugged back at him.
Just as Ryam was charging up a magical attack, a beam of divine light shone across the battle field, then nailed Her directly in the chest, causing her wand to fall out of her hand and shoot the charged up beam of energy out, hitting a building square in the base.
“Worry not my children! I, Christine Weston chandler has arrived!”
Chris floated in the air looking down at all her sonichu children, and a few other characters who joined the battle to help out the heros. she nodded at them seeming to thank them. When she turned to fly back where she came she noticed the previously hit building begin to crumble, slowly leaning and falling over. Below on the street was a distracted Rosechu, her nuzzle stuffed into a book, with air pods in. She clearly didn’t hear the danger heading her way!
Quick as lightning, Christine swooped down and instead of picking up the building, went to save the Rosechu.
“Hey what?!” She shouted, dropping her book as Chris quickly picked her up in her hedgehog arms.
“Sorry about your book! I can replace it for you later!”
The Rosechu looked up at her savior’s face, still being new to CWCville she didn’t recognize this hero. A small blush crept across her face.
“Oh well, it’s fine I guess. It was just a CWCville locations guide...”
Chris gently set down the rosechu, who quickly dusted off her shorts. “Thanks for saving me I really appreciate it.”
“No problem hun! As the goddesses and creator of CWCville it’s my duty to protect everyone here!” She placed a gloved hand on her chest over her heart and radiated a calming aura.
“Still, you totally didn’t have to do that. That’s very kind of you to go out of your way to save me when you had bigger fish to fry.” She looked around as the damage on and along the streets, Romeo roseraid was with wild handcuffing Ryam after she got knocked out so she couldn’t cause anymore trouble. Romeo waved back at Chris.
“we got it here ma’am!” He shouted to her.
“Well looks like my work here is done.” Chris began to levitate back into the air before her hand was grabbed by the rosechu.
“Wait uh is there any way I can thank you?”
“Just by being a loyal worshiper—“ Chris was quickly interrupted.
“No I mean actually something I can do, a movie? Some coffee? “
“Some tea sounds nice actually, flying around really makes me thirsty!”
“Tea it is then, just take me to a tea shop you like and we can talk and I’ll pay for it along with a pastry or something like that.” The rosechu began to rummage through her bag, trying to find her phone to look up any close locations.
“Oh I totally forgot to introduce myself, I’m Himiko! I’m a Togedemaru-rosechu. I think. I’m still kinda newly created.”
“Very happy to meet you Himiko, but you won’t need that phone, I’ll just fly us to the CWC-Tea shop!”
“Huh? I can’t fl—“ Himiko was quickly interrupted by yet again being picked up by Chris and whisked away into the air, heading for the shop while leaving everyone else on the ground to clean up.
“There goes mama, guess she made a new friend?” Rosey asked herself, deadlifting a big chunk of derby that had landed on punch earlier in the fight.
“Guess it’s a date?”
—
“—and that’s how I got my electric hedgehog powers!”
It’s been hours, the pair have been chatting in the tea shop, Himiko mostly listening to Chris talk. She found it all very interesting! So much more than her own boring life.
“What about you?” Chris asked her, snapping her out of her thoughts.
“Huh?”
“Your life, things you’ve done, where you're from. You know that kinda thing?”
“Oh hrm.” Himiko tapped an iron clad claw against her muzzle trying to think where to start, things have always been hectic for her.
“Let’s see, I think I’m from dimension E-2499 originally. I’m not anyone important or anything, I want to say six months ago Magi-kun—“
“Magi-Chan?”
“Oh? No, his name is Magi-kun, he’s purple and has like five eyes. He's kinda weird.” She snickered a bit “he’s always following this one Girl around like a lost puppy!”
“Oh Magi-kun must be your dimension’s version of Magi-Chan then! Magi-Chan here is also purple and a well known psychic type. He’s very knowledgeable.”
“I didn’t know there were other dimensional versions of him, I hope yours isn’t as weird as E-2499’s version.”
“Oh no he’s an absolute sweetheart! I’m married to him actually!” When the word married left Christine’s
mouth Himiko felt a little hitch in her throat. Damn again? Every time she thinks she finds someone nice, cute, and friendly they always have someone else. She slowly stood up from her chair and grabbed her purse.
“Huh where are you going?” Chris asked with a look of concern on her face. Was it something she said?
“Oh it’s just-“ Himiko stumbled on her words. “Well you're married I wouldn’t feel right going on a date with someone who’s married...wait shit, was this even a date? I’m sorry I messed up!” She started heading to the door, before her hand was grabbed by Christine’s.
“No don’t worry it’s fine, I’m actually polygamous. Magi-Chan is just one of my spouses.”
“Oh dear, I don’t know, if I wanted to keep seeing you would I have to see your other spouses too?”
“Of course but they’re all very nice, I’m sure if you meet them and show them the same level of care, dedication and respect you showed to me they’d be more than happy to date you too!”
“Well... back in my dimension, Magi-kun said I would get involved with a group of people who would turn my life around. I think he said there would be five total?”
“It must be us! We’re a couple of five! Clearly it’s fate—“
“But my Magi-kun isn’t always right with his predictions! What if he meant a different group of five? What if I date all of you and it changes my life in the wrong way?! What if—“ Himiko was cut off by a surprise hug from Christine.
“You must be so frightened about this prediction, if you’d like we can go to magi-Chan, my magi-Chan and ask him about it. Unlike E-2499’s Magi-Kun, my magi Chan is all knowing and is always correct on his predictions.” Chris stepped back and gave Himiko a little bit of space.
“All right, I can do that. I’m just worried about meeting others. After being thrown into a new dimension and just getting used to these new surroundings, it’s some whiplash you know?”
“I understand, I’ll do everything in my power to make sure things turn out alright for you.”
“Thank you Chris I really appreciate it.” Himiko wiped a silent tear from her face. She had been crying and hadn’t even noticed. Damn crying in front of someone on their first date? ‘What a mess’ she thought to herself.
“Would you like to meet everyone now? It is a bit late out...”. Chris looked out the big glass windows of the shop to see the sun had begun to set.
“It’s not like I have any home here to go back to anyways.” Himiko gently smiled back. ‘Even if this relationship doesn’t work out, I'm sure we can still be friends, somehow.’ She thought to herself as Chris grabbed her hand and began walking with her outside and to her house.
Tell you what, it’s a start. Simplistic and not bad.
