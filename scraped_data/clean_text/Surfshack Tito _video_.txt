This article is about the video titled Surfshack Tito. For the troll of the same name, see Surfshack Tito (troll).
"Big kahunas need bigger boards."
Surfshack Tito (also known as Surfshack Tito.MOV) is a rather odd video uploaded by Chris on 02 March 2010.
In it he makes his first threat against rising troll Surfshack Tito, who hacked his PSN account on 24 February 2010.
The small finger motion and corresponding sound effect Chris makes is consistent with a Curse shot.
This flies in the face of the claims Chris made in the 8th Alec Benson Leary call, where he conceded that cursing people was evil, and claimed he was atoning for it.
