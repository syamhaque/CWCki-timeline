Cover song: “I’ll Be Your Mirror” by Velvet Underground is a video posted to YouTube on 27 May 2021. In it, Chris sings the song "I'll Be Your Mirror" by The Velvet Underground with vocals by Nico, as part of a promotion for the fan work Warhol / Chris Chan: The Lifespan of American Pop Culture, or The Suppression of Reality. He takes some liberties by adding his own spoken-word intro, interlude, and outro. Although Nico was known for her deep voice, Chris opts to perform her lyrics in an ear-splitting falsetto.

Transcript
[Highlighted in bold are Chris's original lyrics]
[Spoken intro]
If you love yourself, forgive our mutual flaws
Heal and love yourself, forgive our mutual flaws
Heal and love yourself, forgive our mutual flaws
[Verse 1]
[Horrible falsetto]
I'll be your MEEEROR
Reflect what you are, in case you don't know
I'll be the wind, the rain and the sunset
The light on your door to show that you're hoooome
[Chorus]
Wheeen you think the night has seen your miiind
That inside you're twisted and unkind
Leeeeeet me stand to show [raises hands to cover eyes] that you are blind
[Puts hands down] Please put down your haaaands
'Cause I see you
[Spoken over instrumental]
Oh, do you think I don't know you?
I look inside you as you look inside me.
You find yourself―your body language, your thoughts and insight.
If you're scared of me, you're scared of you―you have truths to face. [shrugs]
[Verse 2]
[Horrible falsetto once more]
I find it haAArd to believe you don't know
The beauty you are
BUUUt if you don't, let me be your eyes
A hand to your darkness so you won't be afraid
[Chorus]
When you think the night has seen your mind
That inside you're twIIIsted and unkind
Let me stand to show that you are blinnne
Please put your haaands down
[Chris sees you] 'Cause I seeeeee you
[Outro]
[Awkwardly returning to his normal vocal range] I've got in my body and soul...
[spoken] so don't follow the past, follow the present.
[falsetto] I'll be your mEEEROOor
I'll be your meeroOor
I'll be your meeroOor
I'll be your merOOOoooUUUr
