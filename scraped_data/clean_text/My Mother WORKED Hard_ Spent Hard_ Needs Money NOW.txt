My Mother WORKED Hard, Spent Hard; Needs Money NOW. is the very long title of a YouTube video Chris uploaded on 14 July 2018. In it, Barb begs Chris's audience to purchase a blanket from her.
The blanket Chris (or Barb) listed came with a hefty asking price of $200 (plus free shipping!).[2] A fan, considering the blanket to be a piece of "Christory," purchased it for the full $200 price the following day.
The video was set to Private around November 2023,[3] however a copy was archived.

[Barb stares rather frazzled into the camera, lying on a bed and holding the blanket she and Chris intended to sell] My name is Barbara Chandler. I'm asking you to buy this blanket...from me. Recently, I have been...working really hard, clearing...out...all...the uh... things that we-they moved into the house three and a half years ago. I had a lot of trash... uh, to put out, and I had to pay the trash people a lot of money to uh-take my trash... uh... Friday. So, I'm asking you to please, uh... help by bri-buying this blanket, 'cause I'm c-low on funds and...we need help. Thank you for buying this blanket. I appreciate it.
