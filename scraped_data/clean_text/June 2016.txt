Chris in June
June was the sixth month of 2016. The month began with Chris’s sex-off competition with Johan coming to a close, with Johan emerging as the victor. Chris was banned from selling on Etsy, due to his failure to send orders. He made a video lying that the account was "on vacation." He ramped up his e-begging campaign, claiming that the money would be used for necessities, such as medication and bills.
Chris also bizarrely decided to try to revive his career as an escort, offering to have sex with local non-transgender women for extremely high prices, giving himself the hooker name "Stephanie Bustcakes." Chris also resurrected his search to find a caretaker for Barb this month, once again harassing Cole Smithey on Twitter and Facebook in the false belief that insulting someone would make that person want to help you.
