================================================================================

Chris probably mourned his childhood hero on this Robot Chicken skit.
Adult Swim is a late-night programming block on the American television channel Cartoon Network, catering primarily to adults age 18-34. Due to Chris's biological clock, he would stay up late at night and would frequently watch Adult Swim, especially since it catered to two of his chief interests - anime and random-access humor. The name of the block doubles as a CWC-ism, meaning pornographic.
He has also downloaded $120 worth of episodes from various Adult Swim series since fall 2009, through the PlayStation Network.
Owing to his love of Adult Swim, in 2009 Chris was discovered on the Adult Swim message boards. He discussed things ranging from Robot Chicken to his custom ponies, but later on, the account was hacked by the dang, dirty trolls.
Given that Sonic Boom aired on Cartoon Network in the daytime, it was possible that Chris stopped watching Cartoon Network for Adult Swim, and fulfilled his fix for its shows through other means. However, he shared a video of The Amazing World of Gumball--and called out trolls at the same time, natch--on Facebook in January 2015, meaning that he most likely still watched the network despite their airing of the blue-armed bandit.

Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law
Main article: Harvey Birdman Commercial
Chris has always been a fan of Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law, so in 2005, he entered a contest in which the participant had to to make a commercial for the first DVD release of the show. Of course, he felt the need to shoehorn in off-topic references about his life issues, similar to his his later videos. He did not win the competition.
King of the Hill
In 2009, Chris has imitated the protagonist of the show, Hank Hill, on at least three occasions,[1][2][3] suggesting he has watched the show. Whether Chris actually understands the sarcasm behind the show, much like Moral Orel, has yet to be seen, albeit more likely that he takes it at face value.
In August 2025, he watched all 10 episodes of the show's 14th season, in less than three days after its premiere.[4] He then posted about it on Bluesky, praising the season for its continuity and jokes, and saying that he feels it is "great quality." He also revealed that he had "watched the entire first 13 seasons beforehand over the years."
Moral Orel
Foreshadowing.
Of interesting note is the show Moral Orel, which is a claymation series mainly focused at deconstructing fundamentalism, and the merging of church and state, which is common in the Midwestern United States and Bible Belt. It openly criticizes the blind faith and intolerance of many American Christians, and people like Chris are exactly who they are making fun of.
Chris has stated in the Mailbag that he has watched the show, and said it was "okay". It is likely that all of the jokes and truths go right over his head, even obvious ones such as when Orel said "I guess lots of things get misinterpreted and lost in translation" while scratching his head with a Bible. The subtlety and sarcasm is lost on the autistic mind. He probably didn't like the pilot episode which hinted at a homosexual relationship between two characters.
Rick and Morty
On 5 June 2018, Count Dankula asked Chris how Rick and Morty fit into the universes. Chris replied that it was "beyond [his] knowledge at this point," also answering that he thinks they are being kept out of Cwcville.[5]
In June 2018, Chris bought a Pickle Rick Funko Pop figure.[6] Chris also owned a Mr. Meeseeks Funko Pop figure.[7]
On 23 August 2018, while trying to decide on the name of "our sister dimension" (in which fictional characters across most pop culture and fiction reside), Chris said Magi-Chan has given him the possible names "1672" and "C-197." Chris added right after that "Rick and Morty visit there and here sometimes, but you know their original dimension is not either of these numbers."[8] On 2 September, Chris posted to Twitter to announce that the name of our sister dimension had been "verified" by "a very well-educated and well-read ally of ours, along with Magi-Chan Sonichu" to be C-197 (NOT to be confused with Rick’s home Dimension of C-137 at all).[9]
On 29 November 2020, Chris posted a Wattpad story that mentioned a "Council of the Gods." He also wrote implying that there are "paradox rules" that are not to be broken in dimensions, adding that it is similar to the Council of Ricks.[10]
On 2 December 2020, Chris mentioned the citadel from Rick and Morty in The Place Discord server.[11] Four days later, he mentioned Rick and Morty there again.[12]
On 20 April 2021, Chris replied to a comic by Helena on Twitter. In the comic, Pickchu and Chris Chan Sonichu fight Rick Sanchez. Rick ends up getting eaten by someone else, and Pickchu asks Chris Chan Sonichu why she didn't punish him, she replies with "I... might be a liiiiitle bit... powerless." Chris criticized the comic, saying "she would not have just stood there and done nothing," saying it was "DUMB."[13]
On 19 July 2021, Chris mentioned in The Knights of CWC Discord server that he had watched "the new Rick and Morty last night on the Adult Swim app," saying it reminded him of "the hellspawn of Beastly from the Care Bears series."[14]
On 18 January 2022, Chris wrote in a jail letter to Kenneth Engelhardt that Rick and Morty are in C-197.[15]
On 29 November 2023, Chris posted to Twitter to explain a commission he had finished two days prior.[16] The drawing, titled "Addressing the Toxic, Darkest Sinning Minority", depicts Chris, Sonichu, and Pickle Rick at Peter Griffin's house, with Peter wearing The Classic (presumably because he is a part of the Toxic, Darkest Sinning Minority). Pickle Rick's inclusion isn't explained however.
On 11 December 2023, Chris posted to Twitter that Season 7, Episode 9 of Rick and Morty, Mort: Ragnarick (which premiered the day prior), is "quite accurate."[17]
On 19 January 2024, Chris explained to Ren Ryghts what will happen to him when the merge comes, saying "With the timing of the Merge's completion, one of you [Ren and his C-197 self-counterpart] will survive the other by that moment. And you will be reincarnated if one of you two is dead and then the other later on." Right after, he added "Simple as that, with the transition point being the dimension point as described in Rick and Morty, season 7."[18]
On 16 August 2024, Chris watched the first episode of the Rick and Morty: The Anime.[19] He posted his thoughts on Twitter, saying the first episode was a dud, but he was still giving the rest of the season a chance. On 6 September, Chris posted that he was watching the fourth episode, commenting that he didn't like the new voice actor for Jerry Smith because he sounds derpy.[20] On 22 September, Chris posted that he had watched the sixth episode, adding that he felt the series was "catching up with the flow of the original show."[21]
