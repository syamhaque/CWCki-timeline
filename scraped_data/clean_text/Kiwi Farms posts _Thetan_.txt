Relaying Catherine Email
16 March 2015[1]
"Catie" emailed me recently regarding the bowling meetup, and I've been given permission to share some of that email with you. I'm posting it here because it adds new information to the dog's situation (which is being discussed here) and doesn't, IMO, warrant a thread of its own.
Thetan then quoted the Catherine message:
The dog's situation is really bad. I didn't know how bad until the second outing, and now months later I'm angry that I didn't do anything about it. There's just so much insanity in dealing with Chris that you sort of lose the ability to react any further.
The second outing nearly didn't happen because of a bunch of personal, car, and logistics issues on everyone's part. Barb had to go deal with the insurance/rental people because the insurance wasn't going to pay anymore rent for them because, I guess, they expected the Chandler house to have been rebuilt by then. It was almost eleven months by that point, after all. So Barb was away from home and Chris called me saying he couldn't leave the house without his mom there. He suggested I come 'hang out' at the rental, but no way was that happening.
When I asked why he couldn't leave, he explained the dogs couldn't be left alone. Why? Well, Barb and Chris have never, ever, EVER left then home alone. Ever. If errands need to be run, then someone has to stay home with the dogs or the dogs have to come with them and wait in the car. Chris claimed they would "destroy the house", tearing up furniture and chewing everything and peeing and crapping and basically all the bad things dogs are capable of doing. He said it like this was totally normal, that all dogs must do this since his dogs do it. I told him that that's what bored/frustrated/understimulated animals do, but he brushed it off. I was stunned, but also trying to salvage the meetup.
Chris said he'd wait til Barb was home, but after he found out it could be a few hours until she got back, he came up with this stellar plan: he was going to load those dogs into his car and leave them there while we bowled and had dinner! Dey like da cawr, mmm! I desperately tried to dissuade him from this, and when Al and I stopped for gas, I got the Virginia SPCA phone number and resolved to call them and anonymously report if Chris had those poor animals in his car. (I'd slip away to the ladies', but for all I know Chris would have followed me since girls always go in pairs, teeheehee!) Barb turned up last minute and so we never got to see the SPCA Saga.
Now I'm wishing it had happened. But when you deal with Chris, there's so much crazy going on that you basically run out of reactions. I wish I had done something.
Gal Pals
18 March 2015[2]
In response to a user's comment, "...... - and if it's true about him 'paying' for Chris' gal-pals...":
According to Catie, Barb confirmed that Bob paid the gal pals. (Chris told Catie about the incident in an attempt to elicit pity from her.)
Another user commented, "Is that reliable though? Barb is a crazy old woman who twists things both in her own mind and in what she says to others.
I am not usually one to be obstinate about "facts" that those closer to Chris than I am have confirmed. But I have always wondered about this one. Part of me suspects that the true story is a little less transactional than people assume. But I have no evidence for this claim at all.":
Thetan answered:
I communicated (via email) with two of the gal pals. They confirmed the story as well, although they referred to it merely as an arrangement they had with the principal. They didn't offer any details beyond that.
I don't think they were paid (although Bob did pay someone to walk Chris home from school).
A lot of schools now have mentoring or "buddy" programs, which pair normal students with intellectually disabled ones. I believe these programs came into existence after Bob's little arrangement, so maybe the Chandlers can add "invented the Buddy Program" to his list of accomplishments.
Mimms Impersonation
31 March 2015[3]
I've started this thread to serve as a repository for miscellaneous emails that don't fit into any particular category.
To start off with, here's an email from "Rebeckah", where she tries to convince Chris to stop obsessing over Megan.
Here's one from "Mimms".
Before people start in on me, yes, I acknowledge that impersonating Mimms (and everyone else was wrong) and it's not something I'm proud of. I made a lot of mistakes and went way out of line at times, but what's done is done. The best I can to is to ensure that I never "go there" again regarding these types of interactions.
I had mixed feelings about posting this one, since it reflects poorly on me, but I decided to go ahead because I thought people would find the content interesting.
"Mimms" was trying to make the case that not all of the trolls were "bad people". I used Mimms, because I thought Chris would consider him a sort of spokesperson for the trolls (and therefore credible). Once again, I had "Mimms" say the things that Rebeckah couldn't. (Rebeckah forwarded this to Chris, since Chris wouldn't speak with "Mimms".)
Edit:
The purpose behind sending "Rebeckah" the house tour videos wasn't to be ween: I knew Chris would lie about the condition of his home, so I wanted him to think that Rebeckah had seen the videos (leaving hims less wiggle room).
Fake Or Real Gal-Pal Emails?
12 April 2015[4]
In response to a user's comment, "I think this email from Sarah was real:
October 2013 Facebook Posts#Reality Comes Knocking
And everything else was from people pretending to be MHS classmates.":
Yes, that was quoted from an actual email and is genuine. Pretty much everything else is fake.
I did speak via email with a couple of the gal pals, and I based my interactions with Chris on those conversations (I framed things a lot differently though. I didn't mince words, or beat around the bush. I called Chris on his bullshit.) The gal pals were always very "diplomatic" in their responses to my questions regarding Chris.
Basically, the gal pals did something nice for the "special kid" when they were in high school, and now they just want to get on with their lives. They have no interest in having any kind of relationship with Chris.
Persona Secrecy
17 August 2015[5]
In response to a user's comment, "Could this be considered retarded? Sure. But this is Chris's life we are talking about here. The idea isn't that farfetched in relation to him. The dedication involved in trolling always makes me question the legitimacy of certain correspondence. There have been entire personals created for sweethearts and friends that interact with Chris, and outside of two or three people, his "friends" have all been trolls.
There was, after all, fake correspondence from "the gal pals" that makes me skeptical of their emails, without screenshots.
So were you friends with high school members on Facebook (or whatever site, I'm just assuming Facebook) to see this and email them? Was it easy to get them to open up on the situation?
I don't think you have excuses for not posting this info, and when I say "you probably have a good reason for not being able to answer", I mean that genuinely. Reading my comment again, it sounded accusatory. I may disagree on some of the ways you have obtained information, but the last thing I want is that content flow compromised by blowing a secret persona/violating wishes of people you talked to prove your point.
I'm just curious about the legitimacy of people passing on their info about Chris, with so much of his life readily available on the internet, and the previous fake emails, and want all the proof that's available. ":
The main reason why I can't reveal any more than what I've already said regarding my interactions with the gal pals is because I don't want to get these people involved in the ongoing drama that swirls around Chris. It's really as simple as that.
I also don't want to "inspire" would-be Chris trolls.
I honestly wish I could share more information with everyone here on the forum but I simply can't, for the aforementioned reasons.
I realize that saying that you'll have to take my word for it may [unintentionally] come off as sounding evasive/ dismissive but that's pretty much what it comes down to. Sorry :(.
For the record, I haven't had any communications with the gal pals or any of Chris's former classmates since January (and I'm not planning on involving myself any further - I'm done).
Thetan and Tiffany
17 August 2015[5]
In response to a user's comment, "Agreed.
The emails I am thinking of are these: Rebeckah Bentley E-mails#Fuck off (P.S. good work Asperhes and CWCtime).
These are the Tiffany emails that are presented to Chris by Rebeckah. I think Rebeckah wrote them to try and get Chris to give up (that's what I've heard before anyway).":
The Tiffany emails were 'real' in the sense that they were based on conversations with the real Tiffany. I essentially paraphrased what the real Tiffany said, but I used much more frank, sometimes harsh, language to get the message across. (The gal pals are genuinely nice people which is another reason why I didn't want to get them involved in any of this.)
The whole point of this, as I've said before, was to convince Chris to stop obsessing over his high school glory days, make a clean break with his past, and get on with his life (which, ironically he seems to have done now as he's more interested in going out to Impulse, etc.) I don't remember the last time he mentioned high school, the reunion, or the gal pals. Of course, it's too early to tell just yet if Chris has actually moved on.
Rebeckah was simply the "voice of reason" who served as a kind of "buffer" between Chris and the [fake] gal pals. While Chris was more inclined to be on the defensive around the gal pals, he was more reasonable with Rebeckah (which was the intent).
There was also one other factor that motivated me to try and get Chris to give up his obsession with the gal pals. Someone had given Chris Tiffany Gowen's work address and he was actually planning on showing up to "surprise her". Tiffany was aware of this and, as you can imagine, she wasn't too happy about it. (I don't know if she every spoke to her employer to tell them to be on the lookout for Chris or otherwise warn her if he showed up because we never finished that conversation.)
