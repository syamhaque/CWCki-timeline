Background
“
When Chris got word that [Sockness] was going on a train trip, he asked me to record a message for him. After he uploaded the clip I made, people for once stopped trolling Chris and went after Sockness. And he was intercepted while he was on his way.
”
The WCT[2]
In 2019, this audio was posted by Chris to discourage Jacob Sockness from completing his trip to Ruckersville, VA. According to Watchmen member The WCT, he had recorded the clip at Chris's request.[2]
In 2021, WCT considered reusing the same tactic to discourage Sockness from interacting with Chris at Everfree Northwest,[3] however, Chris's arrest for incest made those plans moot.
