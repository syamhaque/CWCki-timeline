I'm selling my father's stamp collection; come on down and buy some of it is a video Chris uploaded to YouTube on 1 March 2017 in which he advertises stamps he inherited from his late father for sale. Though many of Chris's fans regard this as a controversial move, Bob had given permission to Chris to recycle his inherited collections back into the world for others to use.[1]
