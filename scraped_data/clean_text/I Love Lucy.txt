================================================================================

Ricky and Lucy; unsure what to make of Chris's affection.
I Love Lucy is a 50s sitcom involving the antics of Lucy Ricardo, who is married to popular night club act Ricky Ricardo. The original black-and-white series originally ran from October 15, 1951 to April 1, 1960 on CBS (including The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour). Although the original series ended in 1957, the show continued for three more seasons with 13 one-hour specials, running from 1957 to 1960, known first as The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show and later in reruns as The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour.
The show's plot often hinged on Lucy trying to convince her bandleader husband Ricky Ricardo to let her appear in his mambo-centric variety show. Ricky insisted on his wife remaining home to do wife things. Lucy would come up with a cunning plan to subvert his authority, by either making her own money or sneaking into the show.
There are several reasons for why Chris could like this show. One is the fact that Chris's parents are ancient and would remember when this show was first on the air, so Chris has taken a liking to it and has made several references to it. Also the idea of a man bossing his wife around would probably appeal to him.
