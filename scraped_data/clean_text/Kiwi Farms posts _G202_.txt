I had no idea she was THIS involved. I knew Fiona had contact with him, but I gave her the benefit of the doubt. I knew she liked CWC, but I thought it was ultimately platonic.

Grant's Introduction
2 August 2021[2]
I am one of the people mentioned in this thread. I’m a friend of Fiona. My part in this whole mess is not as substantial as the others, but here goes.
a year ago, me and her became interested in Christory. It was fun at first. We both found him funny. We joked about him a lot, and that’s when the CWC plush was made. Eventually, my friend decided to text him. It started off innocently enough. (Asking about the merge) they texted more, and eventually Bella met my friend, on discord. I have never met “Bella” online or in person. In addition, and have only heard her in recorded calls, such as this one. I’ve never contacted Chris either, as I felt harassing him was wrong. I admit I was scared when I saw my personal accounts, but I admit I was a bit quick to delete them and wish I hadn’t.
As for Chris and his mom, to my understanding it was an organic response, though I have no idea what “Bella” has been up to behind the scenes, so I have no liberty to say. Though I’ve been told Not great things about her. I am really sorry for any kind of inconvenience or anything I may have caused.
Keep living your best lives, everyone.

To my knowledge Bella wasn’t going and neither was I. Apparently Fiona just wanted a chance to meet CWC, maybe get an autograph or something. I first heard mention of Bella about one week ago

Fiona's Feelings about Bella

We actually talked about that today. She’s really angry at Bella, not only because of how vile she was to her, but how much of a Kacey-Like bitch she was to CWC. Bella is the bastard child of Kasey Devoria and the Idea Guys
