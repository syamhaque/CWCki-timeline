A lovely paid shoutout in proposal and encouragement towards my trip and everything else on Everfree Northwest! So with that, this shoutout- that goes out to the kind and generous Lifegaaauaaarddd Hermit! Well at least your name's not Kermit, hmm. Anyway, let's send this out your way, [Chris holds up a drawing of a blue tiger] you got a tiger in your bed! [Chris does a poor impression of a tiger growling and then blows a raspberry] Anyway, aside from reaching the goal and going beyond it, more money is appreciated, so keep it lu- keep up the donations please, I'll put a link in the description down below. [pounds his fist twice on a table] I'm doin' the work today, and up to then, so thank you all very much!
