Chris[1]
The 1980s was a very eventful decade, known to most for neon colors, Nintendo's rise in the USA, the home computer revolution, synthesizers, and Reagan. But to us, it's the decade when Christian Weston Chandler was born, under the name Christopher (his name wasn't changed until 1994).
Source material referring to the 1980s is scarce, and this article is mostly based on statements made by Chris at a later age, and on image material. Being mute for most of the decade, Chris has few reliable memories of it. Chris would often indicate that his early childhood was filled with trouble. His true nostalgia sits mostly in the 1990s.
However, his second album features a plethora of '80s music parodies, indicating he has some fondness for the decade, or at least likes its sound. He has also twice referenced being born in the '80s in his June 2021 social media posts.
