Naming
Before referring to God as "Emmanuelle", Chris often times referred to them and Jesus Christ collectively as one entity, referring to them as "GodJesus".
The exact origins of Chris calling God "Emmanuelle" of all things are unknown, but it can be assumed that this comes from the fact that it derives from how the name, which if of French and Hebrew origin, stems from the name "Immanuel", which translates to "God is with us".[2] The first time that Chris referred to God as "Emmanuelle" appears to go as far back into 2016 in a Facebook Post. Said Facebook post has Chris criticizing Lizzy the Lezzy for a comic they made about a gay cure. Unsurprisingly, even Lizzy was confused on what the fuck Chris was talking about, replying with "Who the fuck is Emanuelle".[1]
Early Beliefs
Chris invokes God and Jesus, saying they told him that Blanca is real. Proof that God and Jesus are on the trolls' side.
God and Jesus ('sup?) tell Chris he is meant to be with Ivy.
Traditionally, Chris had a fundamental belief in an omnipotent, benevolent male God. He also accepted Jesus Christ as the son of God and the savior of mankind. He was reluctant to mention God without also including Jesus, perhaps out of some sense that he must stress his specifically Christian notion of God (despite other Abrahamic sects using completely different words for Him). In effect, Chris frequently referred to "God and Jesus" (or "GodJesus"[3][4]) as if they were some sort of Binity, a deviation from the mainstream Christian concept of the Trinity ("The Father, The Son, and the Holy Spirit") that his churches would regard as heretical.
Chris believes God has a special interest in his own life, which would be consistent with Western monotheism - except Chris seemed to view God as more of an instrument of his own will than a supreme being to Whom he is subject. In Chris's view of God, the Almighty will overlook his misdeeds, but will punish any who malign Chris. Case in point, the fact that Chris cheated in the PaRappa the Rapper contest is not nearly as important as the suspicion that Adam Stackhouse did, and Chris invoked God numerous times in his threats to Adam. Adam is no exception - Chris has been commonly observed invoking the wrath of God in his infantile threats. Along with punishing all trolls, Chris expects God to hand him a sweetheart on a silver platter[5] but is oblivious to the fact that God has yet to back him up on any prayers.
Much like Ayatollah Khomeini, Chris attributes most of his impetus to commands given to him directly from GodJesus in visions. “I'd say my spirit is active while I am awake, but it does more when I am at rest or sleeping,” he wrote in 2014.[6] His exact beliefs concerning these prophetic dreams are difficult to pin down, but the most rational interpretation is that Chris dreams about something he'd like to do, then wakes up and decides it was God telling him to do it. In Chris's mind, each vision is simultaneously a directive to do something and proof that it will happen no matter what occurs. For instance, after Chris had a vision about fathering a daughter, he decided he was required to actively make that happen while also assuring himself that failure was impossible. When Chris was being accused of racism for insisting that he can only date white women, he justified this by arguing that his prophesied daughter must be white.
Visions from God supposedly confirmed that Blanca Weiss, then PandaHalo and finally Ivy were to be the mother of Chris's child, despite the fact that each of these women subsequently turned out to be trolls. This proves that God, if He exists, is either not responsible for Chris's supposedly prophetic dreams, or is having a laugh at his expense, an idea which Chris may have later taken to heart.
Later Beliefs
After prolonged exposure to the Idea Guys on 18 December 2017,[7] Chris abandoned his earlier Christian faith in favor of worshipping the CPU Goddesses from the Hyperdimension Neptunia series. As his delusions deepened, he came to believe that he himself was the goddess CPU Blue Heart, destined to trigger the apocalypse and usher in a new heavenly world. He later declared that God is a woman, influenced by his belief that women are inherently good while men are evil. During his incarceration, after reading the Bible again, he adopted the conviction that he is the reincarnation of Jesus Christ, merging this belief into his own personal religion Neo Spiritual Christianity.

Notes
↑ Chris is very inconsistent with the spelling of their name, as to be expected. Some spellings of the name include "Emanuel" and "Emanuelle". For the sake of consistency, the CWCki uses the spelling "Emmanuelle", the formal way to spell the name.
