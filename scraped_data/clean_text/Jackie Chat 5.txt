[7:24 pm] CWC:
Hey, Jackie. :) h
[7:24 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
hi!
[7:25 pm] CWC:
How has your day been?
[7:25 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
oh, alright
[7:25 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
how about you?
[7:25 pm] CWC:
Mine has been okay.
[7:26 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
did you make a video for me today?
[7:26 pm] CWC:
I've just uploaded my video for today, talking about Mary Poppins being my favorite movie; I've just received your e-mail with the Hamburglar idea; I'll do it tomorrow.
[7:26 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
ooh! let me go watch
[7:26 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
brb
[7:27 pm] CWC:
Also, the Lars video; the upload failed the first time; I'm reuploading it now.
[7:28 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
ok
[7:28 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
:-D :-D :-D
[7:28 pm] CWC:
And I stayed up the night before last, because I started work on recreating the Uncut Aqua Teen movie I had before I reformatted my PS
[7:28 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
that video was great!@
[7:29 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
what do you mean recreating the movie?
[7:29 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
did you have to download their movie?
[7:29 pm] CWC:
Last time I created the uncut movie, as well as this time, I had used the movie, plus the deleted scenes and parts from the deleted version from my copy of the 2-disc DVD.
[7:30 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
ah, i see
[7:30 pm] CWC:
First time, I used my PC's movie editor for the video files ripped from the DVDs.
[7:30 pm] CWC:
But now, it's funky with me on the format it would use, but I've figured out and used successfully the Video Editor App on my PS
[7:31 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
funky monkey, eh?
[7:31 pm] CWC:
LOL
[7:31 pm] CWC:
seriously though, the PC's program found the video file formats unacceptable.
[7:31 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
ah
[7:31 pm] CWC:
IDK why, and I forgot how I did it the first time.
[7:31 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
did you get it completed?
[7:32 pm] CWC:
Yes.
[7:32 pm] CWC:
Thanks to my PS3 now, instead of the crappy program on my PC, I can most definitely put the deleted scenes from any show and movie on DVD into their respective movies and shows.
[7:33 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well thats good.
[7:33 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
what program do you use to edit your videos on the pc that was getting weird?
[7:33 pm] CWC:
it was called "showbiz"
[7:34 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
you could try something professional, like final cut pro
[7:34 pm] CWC:
I have never heard of that program.
[7:34 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
its a video editing software package
[7:35 pm] CWC:
I will consider looking for a downloadable file of its installation exe.
[7:35 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so i was sitting in class yesterday, and i thought to myself
[7:35 pm] CWC:
but the video editor on my console works very well for my needs.
[7:35 pm] CWC:
yes?
[7:35 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i dont know a whole lot about your college days.
[7:35 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
what was it like for you?
[7:36 pm] CWC:
I can talk about that tonight. :) h
[7:36 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
:-)
[7:36 pm] CWC:
Mostly though for me, college was not so swift.
[7:36 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
no?
[7:36 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
what was it like?
[7:36 pm] CWC:
but there were a few positive perks at PVCC during the first couple of years I went there.
[7:37 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
tell me about them!
[7:38 pm] CWC:
One time, we had a hypnotist appear to do a show; I was a volunteer. I was actually aware of what was going on while I was "hypnotized", so I went along with the gag.
[7:38 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
ah, so it was like an illusionist?
[7:39 pm] CWC:
One of the tricks was when he said a word, I call him something stupid, so I called him a current catchphrase back then; "Uncle Screwy Louis".
[7:39 pm] CWC:
no, not an illusionist.
[7:39 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
screwy louis! lol
[7:39 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
my favorite uncle is Uncle Jesse, from full house
[7:39 pm] CWC:
that was a good show.
[7:40 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i liked the early years before michelle could talk. it jumped the shark once she stole the limelight
[7:40 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
what do you think of mary kate and ashley olen?
[7:40 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
*olsen
[7:40 pm] CWC:
Another time, we had a game show with audience participation. I didn't get to get up on stage and win, but it was fun to watch.
[7:40 pm] CWC:
The Olsen twins are okay; they're fun in their own way.
[7:41 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
me and my friends had a bet that they would pose in playboy once they turned 18, i was surprised they never have
[7:41 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but anyway
[7:41 pm] CWC:
I haven't seen much from them in their teen or adult years.
[7:41 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
did you ever have any foreign exchange students in any of your classes?
[7:42 pm] CWC:
not that I was aware of.
[7:42 pm] CWC:
When it came to classes, I was mostly by myself, and I paid great attention to the details of the subjects.
[7:42 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so you didnt make too many friends?
[7:43 pm] CWC:
And I did great in the computer classes portion for my degree.
[7:43 pm] CWC:
yeah, I had few acquaintances.
[7:43 pm] CWC:
but no friends.
[7:44 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
awww...
[7:44 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
of all your classes, what were your favorites?
[7:45 pm] CWC:
And in an English class, as we were starting to read "Wednesday's Child", a story of an autistic girl, I told the professor and the class I was H.F.A.; between that, and some misunderstandings, he kicked me out of his class on my 21st Birthday.
[7:45 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
wait
[7:45 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
what misunderstandings
[7:45 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
?
[7:47 pm] CWC:
essentially, when it came to critiquing the papers of the others' students, when they started talking about drug use and homosexual content, I wrote with exclamations you'd likely hear from a black person in church. Note, this was back in 2002, and I was not as mature as I am today.
[7:47 pm] CWC:
*not as mature then as I am today.
[7:48 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so, you were critiquing each others' papers?
[7:48 pm] CWC:
yes
[7:48 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
what kind of exclamations?
[7:48 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
like, did you shout OH LAWDY or something
[7:48 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
thats kind of a stereotypical black church saying
[7:49 pm] CWC:
I don't remember verbatim, but stuff against the smoking and such, and yes, I did go "Hallelujah, Lord" once or twice.
[7:49 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
on paper or vocally?
[7:49 pm] CWC:
on paper
[7:50 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
what part of the paper were you commenting on when you said that?
[7:51 pm] CWC:
I think it was on a homosexual statement that was on that paper.
[7:51 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
what was the assignment for these papers? were they book reports? or editorial pieces?
[7:51 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
something like that
[7:51 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
?
[7:51 pm] CWC:
story reports
[7:52 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
on the story your class read?
[7:52 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
what was yours about?
[7:52 pm] CWC:
I'm not sure I understand the question
[7:52 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
was the report about the story you read?
[7:53 pm] CWC:
no, it was on a different story we were reading before Wednesday's Child.
[7:53 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
ah, i see
[7:53 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
what was that story? was it about gay people
[7:54 pm] CWC:
I do not remember.
[7:54 pm] CWC:
It may have, or it may have not been.
[7:54 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i'm just curious why the paper you were critiquing had stuff about homosexuality
[7:54 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i know you don't remember the words exactly, but what sort of things were you saying about being gay in your critique?
[7:56 pm] CWC:
because of the way the student wrote his paper; he went into details of the story we had read where he saw something about homosexuality, which I did not see myself.
[7:56 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so, that student saw like an allegory in the story about homosexuality?
[7:56 pm] CWC:
yes
[7:56 pm] CWC:
and I did not.
[7:57 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
what made you say "hallelujah"
[7:58 pm] CWC:
because I was on a roll on the way I was writing against what the student was saying, and I got carried away.
[7:59 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so did a debate start about it in class?
[7:59 pm] CWC:
no
[7:59 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
no one talked further about it?
[7:59 pm] CWC:
only the professor offered me his input on what I wrote after class.
[8:00 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
maybe he thought your critique wasn't constructive because you were using such strong language?
[8:01 pm] CWC:
I think he felt confused, and wanted to correct me and my misunderstanding of how to critique others' papers.
[8:01 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
yes, thats probably how he felt
[8:01 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so what was your discussion like?
[8:02 pm] CWC:
I'd say mid-volume; I mostly listened to what he told me, and I told him that I was only expressing how I felt about the subject of the student's statements.
[8:02 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
how did you feel about the student's statement?
[8:02 pm] CWC:
offended.
[8:02 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
offended? how so?
[8:04 pm] CWC:
I understood that homosexuality was wrong, and I was angry at it on that definition mostly; this was before I understood more of the details that I know today.
[8:05 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so your critique was telling the other student his views on homosexuality offended you?
[8:05 pm] CWC:
Which WHILE I do feel strongly against their doings behind closed doors and whatnot, they are still people, and I respect them as fellow people nowadays.
[8:05 pm] CWC:
yeah.
[8:06 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so that's why you were kicked out of class that day? because you weren't doing the assignment properly?
[8:06 pm] CWC:
NO, this was BEFORE I was kicked out of class.
[8:06 pm] CWC:
I was kicked out of class LONG after that, and shortly after I told the professor of me being autistic too.
[8:07 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
if your getting kicked out happened long after, what does this critique assignment have to do with getting kicked out?
[8:07 pm] CWC:
I had theorized that he had little understandings of autistic individuals, and was probably afraid of me.
[8:07 pm] CWC:
the statements I wrote in the critique he probably considered a metaphorically loud outburst
[8:07 pm] CWC:
I do not remember ALL of the details, but I understand at least it was between the critique and my autism.
[8:08 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well it sounds like he just thought you weren't doing the assignment properly
[8:08 pm] CWC:
likely.
[8:08 pm] CWC:
but I don't know.
[8:08 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
how long after that were you kicked out?
[8:09 pm] CWC:
over a month.
[8:09 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so what happened the day you were kicked out?
[8:11 pm] CWC:
One of my worst Birthdays in my life.
[8:11 pm] CWC:
I'm sorry, my mother came in.
[8:11 pm] CWC:
anyway,
[8:11 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
no problem
[8:12 pm] CWC:
it was simply, I went into the classroom on time as usual; few minutes later, the professor comes in, and tells me to leave, straight out!
[8:12 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well something must have happened before that.
[8:12 pm] CWC:
and I tried to find out why, but he was loud and direct about it.
[8:13 pm] CWC:
after leaving the classroom, I spent the remainder of the time I would have spent in the class, sitting at a table crying and feeling depressed.
[8:13 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
you have no idea why?
[8:13 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
none at all?
[8:13 pm] CWC:
I've just told you what had happened beforehand.
[8:13 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
students dont get kicked out of class for no reason
[8:13 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
ok, so it was the critique incident that caused it.
[8:13 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
seems odd that they'd wait a month to do anything
[8:14 pm] CWC:
that And/Or the autism thing.
[8:14 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
do you really believe your being autistic got you kicked out
[8:14 pm] CWC:
the autism note came in about a couple of classes before when I was kicked out.
[8:14 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
was PVCC was regularly kicking autistic students out of their classes?
[8:15 pm] CWC:
no
[8:15 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well why would your autism be different
[8:15 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
why would they kick you out for that?
[8:15 pm] CWC:
it was on the opinions of the one professor; NOT the school.
[8:15 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so does that professor have a history of kicking out autistic students?
[8:16 pm] CWC:
I do not know his own history.
[8:16 pm] CWC:
at all
[8:16 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
why do you assume it was your autism then?
[8:16 pm] CWC:
it was a most recent event right before he kicked me out of his class; simple math.
[8:16 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
maybe some of the other students were offended by your mean-spirited critiques
[8:16 pm] CWC:
IDK
[8:16 pm] CWC:
maybe
[8:17 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well, people aren't as afraid of autism as you think
[8:17 pm] CWC:
not nowadays, because they are becoming more aware and understanding of the condition.
[8:17 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
autism was pretty well understood back in 2003, too.
[8:17 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
it seems like you're leaving something out, this doesnt make sense
[8:17 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
some event had to have happened recently before you got kicked out
[8:17 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
did you criticize someone for homosexuality again?
[8:18 pm] CWC:
I have told you all that I can remember; I know nothing else. No.
[8:18 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so what happened after that? were you permanently kicked out of that class?
[8:18 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
or allowed back in later?
[8:19 pm] CWC:
I was allowed to retake the class with a different professor next semester.
[8:19 pm] CWC:
*the following semester.
[8:20 pm] CWC:
but I was kicked out perma from the first class then.
[8:20 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
because of your hate speech
[8:20 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
sounds like
[8:20 pm] CWC:
I do not disagree; it does sound like so.
[8:20 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
the homosexuals in that class probably thought you were being mean-spirited and cruel
[8:20 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i bet they complained, and thats what caused it
[8:21 pm] CWC:
probably.
[8:21 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so you say you've learned from that, and wouldnt make those sorts of comments again
[8:21 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
which is good
[8:21 pm] CWC:
yes. :) h
[8:22 pm] CWC:
let me move forward to another thing of my college days.
[8:22 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
wait
[8:22 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but you said earlier that you are still offended by what gays do, even privately?
[8:22 pm] CWC:
yes
[8:22 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
what did you mean exactly?
[8:24 pm] CWC:
the sex for one thing, the way they act towards each other in couples. To me, it is just wrong to see two males doing what is done between a male and a female.
[8:24 pm] CWC:
it just really creeps me and offends me.
[8:24 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so you dont like to look at it, which is fine
[8:24 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but you still think its wrong even when you dont have to look?
[8:25 pm] CWC:
hearing about it puts the pictures in my head as well. yes
[8:25 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well, that means you dont like to think about two men having sex.
[8:25 pm] CWC:
obviously
[8:25 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but just their being gay bothers you too?
[8:26 pm] CWC:
yes, but as people, they have their equal rights too, and as much as I am bothered, I still respect them as people.
[8:26 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but you think that being gay is wrong?
[8:26 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
why?
[8:28 pm] CWC:
to me, it just is.
[8:28 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but that doesnt make sense.
[8:28 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
there must be a reason
[8:29 pm] CWC:
because of the graphic details and how they bother me, it backs up why I think homosexuality is wrong.
[8:29 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
dont you get mad when you think that others consider autism wrong for no reason?
[8:30 pm] CWC:
yes, I would feel offended if others considered autism being wrong for no reason.
[8:30 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but you consider being gay wrong for no reason
[8:30 pm] CWC:
I just told you my reasons.
[8:30 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
no, you said "it just is"
[8:30 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
wait, you said "backs up". do you have another reason for thinking homosexuality is wrong, besides that?
[8:30 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i mean, you said it makes you feel sick, but would that be ok if a person said autism was bad because it made them feeel sick?
[8:32 pm] CWC:
I am also homophobic.
[8:32 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
yeah, thats pretty much what saying "homos makes me sick" means
[8:32 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so thats really the same thing
[8:32 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but there's a difference between not wanting to watch gay people have sex, and thinking they are wrong to be that way
[8:32 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i dont want to watch gay people have sex, but i dont think they are wrong to do it.
[8:32 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
what is your reason for being homophobic
[8:35 pm] CWC:
I am homophobic, because I feel fear of becoming one of them if they came too close to me. Why I think what they are doing is wrong; it is only because I feel what they do amongst themselves is wrong; no reason I can put into words; I just feel that way.
[8:36 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so if its okay for you to be homophobic, is it okay for someone to be autisphobic?
[8:36 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
like, if your teacher hated autistics, wouldnt it be okay then?
[8:36 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
not that im saying he did, i dont believe he was that way
[8:39 pm] CWC:
Look, I do not know what the professor was thinking on the day he kicked me out of the class; I told you what I am able to remember of way back then. He may not have been "autisphobic"; I just do not know. While I am not avoiding the issue, I am feeling stressed out on how deep this discussion has gone.
[8:39 pm] CWC:
besides, it did get worse AFTER that event in my college days.
[8:40 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i'm just posing it as a hypothetical.
[8:40 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
at the start of this discussion you said that you believed your teacher's fear of autism was probably the cause of your being banned. so i'm just asking why its okay for you to hate gays if its not okay for a person to hate autistics.
[8:40 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
you know, sometimes I get stressed that you don't seem to want to have serious discussions. you act like i'm attacking you
[8:40 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
when i'm not
[8:42 pm] CWC:
I understand you are not attacking me; I feel confusion on the hypothetical, and I am uncertain on how to respond to that.
[8:42 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well you could just offer supposition. i'm not asking for concrete answers
[8:42 pm] CWC:
I did offer supposition.
[8:42 pm] CWC:
I agreed with your theories.
[8:43 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
okay, so here's another question for which i'd like a supposition
[8:43 pm] CWC:
okay.
[8:43 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
whats the difference between gays and autistics?
[8:45 pm] CWC:
Autism is a mind-block that promotes intelligence but inhibits social abilities; Homosexuality is a strong attachment or bond between two males or two females.
[8:45 pm] CWC:
two completely different things.
[8:45 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
one similarity i see
[8:45 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
is that both gays and autistics are born the way they are
[8:45 pm] CWC:
WOAH!
[8:45 pm] CWC:
oh
[8:45 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
what did you think i was going to say? :-)
[8:46 pm] CWC:
I don't know.
[8:46 pm] CWC:
I did feel fear when you said you saw a similarity.
[8:46 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so anyway, here's what i wonder
[8:46 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
if you feel that you are persecuted for your autism
[8:46 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
wouldn't you feel extra bad about persecuting another group who is in the same boat, like gays?
[8:47 pm] CWC:
I would not want to offend or persecute another autistic individual.
[8:47 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so you think gays are the same as autistics...?
[8:48 pm] CWC:
I feel it not only would be wrong on me, but it would seriously damage the psyche and frighten the autistic individual horrendiously
[8:48 pm] CWC:
I never said that.
[8:48 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but i asked about persecuting gays, you answerd about persecuting autistics
[8:48 pm] CWC:
are you trying to warp my mind with this logic?
[8:48 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i'm not trying to "warp" anything.
[8:49 pm] CWC:
okay, maybe I misunderstood the question.
[8:49 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i repeat: if you feel that you are persecuted for your autism, wouldn't you feel extra bad about persecuting another group who is in the same boat, like gays?
[8:50 pm] CWC:
I thought you were asking if I would feel extra bad about persecuting another autistic person.
[8:50 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
no, i meant if you know what its like to be treated unfairly because you're a minority, why do it to another minority
[8:50 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
thats like a black person getting fired for being black, turning around and attacking a chinese person for being chinese
[8:51 pm] CWC:
Yes, I would feel extra bad for persecuting another group solely because of their being gay.
[8:51 pm] CWC:
That's called discrimination, and it is wrong.
[8:51 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but its how you feel towards gays.
[8:51 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
dont you think you're hurting gay peoples' feelings?
[8:52 pm] CWC:
just because I feel that way about gays, I would not turn them away because of that; they are people too.
[8:52 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i dont know, you seem to get mad whenever you suspect someone doesnt like you for your autism, even if they havent done anything to you yet
[8:52 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but anyway
[8:52 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
what else happened in college?
[8:55 pm] CWC:
I have made the suspection before, and I did get mad, but after confirming that was NOT the case with the other person, then I would have a change of heart.
[8:55 pm] CWC:
Anyway...
[8:55 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
wait
[8:55 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but if you confirmed someone didnt like you for your autism, even if they didnt do anything to you, would you still be bothered?
[8:56 pm] CWC:
if they have NOT done anything to me, I would NOT be bothered. I was talking about Post-Action.
[8:56 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
oh
[8:56 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
well then, lets move on
[8:56 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
tell me more about college
[8:56 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
:-)
[8:56 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
CWC (ChrisChanSonichu) is available 8:56 pm
[8:56 pm] CWC:
cool.
[8:56 pm] CWC:
CWC (ChrisChanSonichu) is offline 8:57 pm
[8:56 pm] CWC:
IMs are delivered when the buddy signs in. Send CWC (ChrisChanSonichu) a text message
[8:57 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
what was school like after that?
[8:58 pm] CWC:
While my grades still continued to be A Average, and I made the Dean's List later, it went downhill emotionally there for me...
[8:58 pm] CWC:
About August, 2003, that was when I realized I heavily required a girlfriend, and I started my Sweetheart Search.
[8:59 pm] CWC:
And I hung around with the old sign next to me. And as they say on the Cwcki, which originated from my own words...
[8:59 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
thats the sign they asked you to remove, right?
[9:00 pm] CWC:
yes.
[9:00 pm] CWC:
And that battle started; I got kicked out of PVCC for one year, with anger management and psychiatrist visits during then.
[9:01 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
what was anger management like?
[9:02 pm] CWC:
After my return, I shut up and finished my courses towards getting my degree. Which was the complete opposite of my Graduation at Manchester High; I was HAPPY to be leaving that hell-hole that was Piedmont Virginia Community College.
[9:02 pm] CWC:
Anger Management was like a Coping skills class.
[9:02 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
why were you sent there? what was your confrontation with Mary Lee Walsh like before you started it?
[9:02 pm] CWC:
learning ways to cope with our anger, finding other resolutions to solve our problems, etc.
[9:02 pm] CWC:
first, she came up to me and told me the sign was bothering her, and she said it bothered some other people. I told her I was on my quest for a girlfriend, then she tore it up.
[9:04 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
so how did you respond to that?
[9:05 pm] CWC:
Later, I recreated the signs, one by one, and finding other methods of attraction paper-wise.
[9:05 pm] CWC:
Then in March of the following year, I had to meet her in her office, and I got angry at her then. yada, yada, yada; anger management and all that.
[9:06 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
but wait
[9:06 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
what happened in that office meeting?
[9:06 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
how did you express your anger
[9:07 pm] CWC:
I gtg; my mother wants to go out and get something to eat and wants me to go with her.
[9:07 pm] CWC:
I pretended I was talking with Sonichu, and he talked through me, and I cursed Mary with a Curse-Ye-Ha-Me-Ha attack.
[9:07 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
did you do it loudly?
[9:08 pm] CWC:
yes
[9:08 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
did you stand up and do the full hand motions?
[9:08 pm] CWC:
yes
[9:08 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i see
[9:08 pm] CWC:
that was back in '04
[9:08 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
what did sonichu say to you
[9:08 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
in this conversation
[9:09 pm] CWC:
I do not remember.
[9:09 pm] CWC:
I have to go.
[9:08 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
wait
[9:09 pm] CWC:
but when I remember that event more, I will inform you about it.
[9:09 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
i'll email you about it, that way you can write me a response when you have time tomorrow
[9:09 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
where are you going now?
[9:10 pm] CWC:
I have to out with my mother so she can get something to eat; it is night, and she feels safer with me.
[9:10 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
ok. well, goodnight
[9:10 pm] CWC:
she does not like going out alone.
[9:11 pm] CWC:
I enjoyed talking with you some more. :) h
[9:10 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
me too :-) :-) :-)
[9:11 pm] CWC:
And I am happy you liked the poem I sent you earlier.
[9:11 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
aww...
[9:11 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
:-D
[9:11 pm] CWC:
I Love You. :-* h
[9:11 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
love you too
[9:11 pm] CWC:
Stay Safe, Sweetheart.
[9:11 pm] Jacklyn Romy:
goodnight~ ~ ~
