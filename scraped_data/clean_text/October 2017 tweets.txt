REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE DRUMPH!!!!!!

That’s an upsetting bummer, and I’ve clicked and read all the preceding tweets. Frigging Drumpf! He Has Little Heart! 😤
Chris offers relationship advice, Twitter edition
1 October
In response to @JaJamesa92
I wrote a poetic post in response to someone else who was having a similar problem.
He then linked to the Facebook post in question and continued
In short: Make Many Friends; Keep an Open Heart; find your Sweetheart from within your circle. Read the full post for more details.
in short: "make friends first and expect one of those friends to eventually fall in love with you" basically what you said.
Guess What? It Happened to me, and It Happens Popularly!!!
Chris is mad at a ween
1 October
In response to a Twitter fight between @spicyart198 and @JaJamesa92
I do not stalk people. Please, Quit making my supportive and neutral comments and responses something they are Not.
Chris and the Vegas Shooting
2 October
In response to Melissa Joan Hart.
I hear you. 🌸🌸🌸
In response to Cathy Weseluck.
Yep. No matter the people count, this one is just as sad as the other past shootings. #RememberPulse #LoveIsLove Kindness Helps Everyone! 🌸
Chris eggs on a white knight
2 October
In response to @JaJamesa92's continued Twitter slapfight with weens
You go, girl! I thank you for not only your support and counters to the bullies, but also your own wisdom and attitude. You Rock! 😊🤘🎵🎶
Be Fearless, Be Kind
2 October
This is Awesome! Thank you, Hasbro, for reminding us. I Pledge, as best as I can, I Will #BeFearlessBeKind!
Mini Commodore 64
2 October
In response to Gamespot.
I would take a Full Size version, if it had the ports that allowed to plug in not only the C64 cartridges, but the C64 Floppy Disk Drive too
Chris snaps, bickers with weens
2 October
In response to this tweet in @JaJamesa92's continued interactions with Chris's weens.
Chris has proven he doesn't want help only attention and has done the alienating all on his own. Now the best that can be done: containment
News For You, Kaisar, but I Have actually already had received Help, Locally. Why You didn’t get the memo was because I can’t fully /1
receive Help from people who are beyond a certain distance from me; my needs were Emotional, and you don’t win friends with insincerity /2
and lack of being able to Actually be there for me. I Learned That the Tough Way with my theoretical exes. And I am not only better and /3
able to love myself with some dependability, I am a Lovely Woman, and as mental as I may be, This Bitch (me) Will Not be Contained! /4
Put That up your Pipe and A-Holes and Smoke Up, you Dopey Bullies!
Chris denies attempting to commission porn from Doopie
2 October
In response to a Twitter user arguing with another over Doopie's interactions with Chris (Note: the first "she" refers to Doopie)
She did ignore her than she made creepy videos, drawings, requested porn, and even a alt acct to interact with her so she told chris off.
I did Not request porn from her; she had an NSFW account on Patreon, and since I liked her drawing style, I was curious. As for the /1
Suggestion I had made, Not a Request, I was being Supportive and presenting another media topic she might have liked to check out. /2
As for the videos and drawings, I was acting in her defense, since She was getting Harassment from the Bullies, Not Me. My tweet number /3
is Pittance in comparison to the Number of Offensive Tweets, Mislabeling me and my support from the Bullies. I even took the drawing /4
a bit further, as I had thought the Planet Dolan crew would have been happy to support and defend Doopie from You Bullying Lot. And as /5
it Had been My fault on that #NationalGirlfriendTweet that started the whole mess, that was Why I chose whole-heartedly to Harass Me /6
instead of Doopie or Anyone Else who was being harassed with the mis-content from Years Ago from me taken Out Of Context, Mind you, /7
because Harassing Anyone at Anyone else’s Expense is Just Plain Wrong, Bullying, and Uncouth!
Replying to VimHomeless and ShadBase
4 October
A Twitter user claimed VimHomeless to be a fan of Shadbase. VimHomeless answered that Shadbase did awesome backgrounds for some of his favorite YouTubers' cartoons. Shadbase entered the conversation to apologize for VimHomeless getting shit on for following him.
VimHomeless said in response to Shadbase, "It's duck season". Chris entered the conversation and posted:
Wabbit season

There's a difference between fame and infamy Chris
7 October
I realize I am famous like a princess; I have obligations to keep as many people, and Loved close ones, happy. I try, but it is difficult.
I try, but I can’t always succeed, especially if it is not making myself happy as well. @KSheridanVoice and @tarastrong share that with me.
of course it was a link to stalking non-responding actresses.
I am not stalking anyone. Please, quit saying that.
CWCville is in Mexico City

I do like this comparison art piece a lot. It’s funny, although I Do would like a few, but I do not have any ruffled skirts like that one. 😉

Chris encourages ILoveKPAlot
8 October
In response to @ILoveKPAlot
I hear you, KP. I am coming around myself in dusting off the old memories to shed some light for my “Christorians”. I know there are 1/
...and will be people who will want to document your stories as well, to prevent the type of harassment upon you for future generations. /2
As @KSheridanVoice told me after I told her a bit of my trolling problems, “You’ve made it.” (Successfully). Welcome to our club, friend. 😊🌸
Chris on MLP's Season Finale

You will not be disappointed; we get continuity from the Legendary Stories told prior to this in Season 7. Really Good two-parter.

In response to Tara Strong
Is that the same reaction you offer for those who find similarity to Twilight in ourselves?
Or is it more like this? 😊🌸
Chris attempts to fight stupid with stupid

Hey, @AndreaLibman , Happy Pinkie Pie Day!
Responding to @Star__Side141
That Is Kawaii! 🌸
In response to @ILoveKPAlot
Huh?
Perhaps in the fact of how much chaos there was in the movie, that was not of his personal doing, then I would agree.
In response to a @MLPMovie tweet announcing a minor contest
When Fizzlepop Berrytwist reveals her name at the end!

Good! Just watched your new Powerglide review. I have something cute you could have done for the skit. 1/

Chris is still egotistical
10 October
In response to @BruhOgerLord
Being like a princess and sharing how I feel isn’t positive enough for you?
Wut?
10 October
“Remember, that day in September, in the rain”, and in the sunlight! 😊
Frogs
10 October

This frog’s not in a coconut tree. Not a Carribian amphibian, but he’s still cute anyway! Ribbit! 😊
Fanart
10 October
In response to @handofgalochio
Keep it up; complete her; I would delight in meeting her through your piece. 😊🌸
Chris and a white knight
10 October
In response to @JaJamesa92
As long as you are feeling happy with & about yourself, doing what you like doing, you’re meeting your own #1 goal: taking care of yourself.
You Go, Girl! 🌸
Chris finds out about Rosechu's Story, is confused by the title
10 October
In response to @handofgalochio
Colour me confused, but do you mean Rosechu’s story in my pages and art, or a fan story I’m not aware yet titled “Rosechu’s Story”?
Chris confuses fire retardant for fire
10 October
In response to Melissa Joan Hart
WOAHLY CRAP!!!
Although looking at the photo, it appears the jet caught on fire and started it. Regardless, many prayers for all affected in California. 🌸
Note: The picture posted by Hart clearly showed a plane dumping red chemicals onto the fire.
#NationalComingOutDay

Sharing my kindness and support to Everyone in our SLBTQ communities: Be Yourselves; Not Afraid! 🌈🎵🎶🏳️‍🌈🌸❤️ #NationalComingOutDay

POLITICS HOOOOO!!!!
11 October
In response to Tara Strong talking yet again about President Trump.
I get your point. But despite politics, I, for one, among a great number of people, continue to stand strong for myself, and for all /1
who are in my communities; sharing and spreading kindness and compassion with everyone, including the downtrodden! Bring us your /2
questioning and undecided people; we’ll show them kindness and support in figuring out who that person is for themselves! We Are Kind! /3

Chris wants fanartists to send him work
11 October
In response to @MLPNightStar
Perhaps, but then those pages would Not be bound into a single book, would they? I’m paying for printing and shipping of My Book.
Misc
11 October
In response to @lana_rain
That’s interesting; I definitely see that for you. I just watched the intro video for onlyfans. Good food for thought. Thanks, Lana. 🌸
Chris then posted [youtu.be/IYzlVDlE72w a song]
Just saying, but this is a really good song.
Misc MLP stuff
12 October
In response to [1]
I send kind and good vibes and prayers your way, Max. You’re okay. 😊🌸
Chris misses Jessica
12-13 October
*sigh*
I miss her... — feeling melancholy
I Miss My Sweetheart! You Bullying People Scared Her Off!!! Night Star and Diamond Melody are Still a Loving Couple!
Should ANYONE’s Fan Base Have to be intimidating about that person to Anyone Else?!!! Is My Fan Base That God-Awful? 😭 God, Help Us.
By the way, Please Do Not Message me pretending to be her; I will not respond; I am not falling for it. — feeling melancholy
Autographing his own copy of a SJW comic
13 October
In response to @LifeofBria
Hey. I just got my copies of your book. Did you get enough for your surgery?
Not quite. But i'll get there soon enough :)
I pray for your success. Best of Blessings for you. 🌸
@LifeofBria Thank you for your note in my copy of the book. I put my sig in the back cover. Thank you for liking me too. Stay Awesome! 🌸😊
Trans-formers
13 October
Just a last thought for today. G1 Arcee is Not Only the Leading Lady Of #Transformers, but Also the leading #Transwoman too! #IDWComics
She Was a guy, and Galvatron’s Twin Brother, before Jhiaxis experimented on him to become Her (against his will), but she likes being woman!
Possible cameo in MLP
14 October
I was just made aware of this speculation from the MLP Zappelin episode. I highly doubt that Unicorn was based from myself.
The only way to confirm or bust this is by the testimony from Tara or someone official on the MLP staff.
Aside from that, I would rather be on there, personally voicing my OC pony, Night Star.
Writing advice
16 October
@handofgalochio:
I hate having an OC I am not doing anything with. What should I do with Luna?
Chris:
Clear and open your mind and heart to your Luna; ask her what he/she has been doing in their world since you last talked. Depending on what or how much Luna tells you, do as much as you feel deemed appropriate. If Luna tells a LOT; Story, or a Little: short.
Sonichu 0 and 15 cover comparison
17 October
@AmbientParallel:
Looking just as amazing when you started back in 2004, well over a decade of guaranteed quality.
Chris:
Put the cover side by side with the Sonichu 0 Cover; I have improved quite well over the years.
Quinnspiracy
17 October
Chris links to a Facebook post rationalizing that Jessica Quinn wasn't a troll. He adds the following as a Twitter-exclusive response:
Dunk That into Pickle Brine and Eat It!
Accepting paid interviews
20 October

Tokyo Treat
21 October
I have just sampled the Kirin Chocolate Mint Tea: 😊 in a divine tea blend, the blend of chocolate and mint makes this beverage Heavenly!
Hirtes is impotent
24 October
Chris replied to one of the many accounts used by Michael Hirtes.
While your comments do come into my view, I take them with the grain of salt, and shield my emotions and mind from your spite.
BBW
24 October
PrincessPony222:
Will you draw me a bbw version of Sonichu?
Chris:
What is “bbw”?
On furries
25 October
In response to a tweet war between Michael Hirtes and a white knight:
Not all people who identify as furries are bad.
Anti-Bullying
26 October
🤔BULLYING IS NOT OK AT ANY AGE...WOULD LOVE TO SEE 3 FRIENDS COPY & PASTE.😡
Clogged shower drain
26 October
I vote there be Two bath tubs in each household for when one clogs up and you can’t wait for the Liquid Plumber to work to shower. Ugh.
Night Star Rosechu racing
28 October
Look who is catching up on Two! Night Star Rosechu!!! :D
On blocking trolls
27 October
andiemations:
I've blocked 5 accounts by them and they just keep trying to follow me. 🙃 Guess I'll be blocking this kid forever lol
Chris:
I would have advised and done the same thing; the bad trolls are persistent. You block one, that same one comes back behind a different mask/account. Nowadays, I just make sure I do not have notifications turned on with this kid, and let him go on; ignore the kid. He’ll get bored from the lack of responses and acknowledgment sooner or later. I put anything of my past bad trolls Long behind me years ago in 2011, around when my father passed on. But I digress.
