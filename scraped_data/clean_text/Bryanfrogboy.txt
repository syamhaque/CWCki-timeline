Bryan Shickley, posting online as Bryanfrogboy, is an animator, graphic designer and the creator of Chris Chan: A Prequel Comic. He acted as a manager for Chris's commissions and also engaged in weening and carpetbagging.
Bryan's creation of Prequel Comic appeared to have caught Chris's attention on 2 January 2018,[2] and he began following the production of that comic as well as Bryan's Twitter. At that time, Chris, along with a couple of bystanders, was curious about what this comic would become. Bryan explained that the comic was meant to be less a parody of Sonichu or Chris's life, but instead a retelling of Chris's life as told from what he believed to be Chris's point of view.[3]
In May 2018, Chris, due to the Idea Guys having brainwashed him into believing he was bisexual, acted out by describing Bryan as a "sexy Shrek-like vampire" and writing an erotica poem involving him. Bryan's girlfriend objected to the sexualization and Chris doubled down with an off-color joke about polygamy. This caused Bryan to begin ignoring Chris, but The Captain, concerned over a potential loss of Prequel's income stream for Chris, intervened by telling Bryan that Chris was sorry for what he'd said.
In February 2019, Bryan uploaded an animated version of Prequel.
Bryan has since deleted his tweets chatting with Chris.

Retrospective Tweets
Bryan drawn in his own style
Main article: Bryanfrogboy Chats#Retrospective Tweets
Bryan's comics would get Chris to reflect on many of his past mistakes, espescially those that had hurt other people in his life in some way.
Business Ventures with Chris
During the Financhu Crisis, which was worsened by the Idea Guys allegedly extorting sums of money from him, Chris would take advantage of the creation of the prequel comic, seeing it as an opportunity to gain more money. He would promote it on various platforms, including Twitter and YouTube.
Bryan made some merchandise for his comics, some of which used Chris's art, which included pillows, notebooks, and clocks. Chris would collaborate with Bryan to sell the merchandise by promoting it in some of his Twitter posts.[4]
Bryan also acted as a manager for Chris. As Bryan put it, people contacted him and said they were interested in a commission from Chris. Bryan then discussed with Chris and arranged the commission. Chris kept all the money from sales.[5]
Controversies
Gay erotica poem
On 28 April 2018, Chris participated in a Twitter contest held by Bryan, #MakeBryCry, in which the person who drew him in the meanest way would win $50. Chris's entry was a portrait sketch of Bryan, which included a love poem from what seems to be Chris-chan Sonichu's perspective:[6]
Bryan, the sexy Shrek-like vampire with messy hair; there is a unique charm that really gives you great flare! Come on over and toussel my quills, and maybe my shock therapy will cure your ills. One that brings out repressed urges, you are the man with the surges! ♥
On 30 April, Chris went further, saying, "I could kiss your good-looking face anytime" in a tweet to Bryan.[7] This took place during a time when the Idea Guys had brainwashed Chris into thinking of himself as bisexual.
Argument over Fantasies
On one occassion, Chris had gotten in an arguement with Bryan over the existence of OCs and Reality Cartoons.
Unfollowing Chris
On May 4, Bryan stopped following him via Twitter after Chris was trying to find an excuse on why he hasn't worked in anything Sonichu-related in the last couple of months and at the same time he mentioned Bryan, in which he replied by saying, Please don't drag me into this. I've drawn your OCs more than you at this point and I don't make a percent of a percent of what you make for doing nothing. As of February 2019, Bryan was following Chris's CPU_CWCSonichu Twitter handle, but has since unfollowed it. Bryan remains following Chris's alternate MagiChan111448 account. He also deleted his tweets interacting with Chris at some point.
Troll accusations
People have noticed that he has been tweeting in a conversation between him and Chris that in a way seems like he's mocking Chris, for example, him saying that Chris is a beautiful soul[8] that would never lie,[9] someone else posting a fake picture of an Amazon ad of his comics and saying that his comic is selling well and making lots of money with Bryan jokingly going along with it, and more recently he made a template of Sonichu's face for people to print out and make their own medallion, and he claimed that Chris approved of this, only for Chris to tweet that he did not approve.
Bryan mentioned in a video that he had started off making Prequel flattering towards Chris, but then became more critical in order to see if Chris would react negatively to the portrayal, but was surprised that Chris instead had a more positive outlook and expressed that he wouldn't again do the things Bryan's panels criticized him over.[5]
Chris Chan: The Prequel video
On the eve of Chris' 37th birthday, Bryan uploaded an animated feature based on his Prequel Comic, which he gifted to Chris via Twitter. Chris responded with plenty of gratitude.[10]

The Art of Criticizing Chris Chan
Chris, holding the comic
As soon as Chris Chan: The Prequel went up on YouTube, the comments were completely infested with weens. Bryan was already well-aware of the children attacking Chris, but with the massive new surge of interest in Chris, the weening got really bad. He decided to make a video defending Chris. He argues that trolls have a major part in Chris' delusions, and people who troll him are just as bad as Chris himself. He also gives his opinions on Kiwi Farms, some of it negative and some of it positive. The next day he deleted the videos in their entirety due to claims of hypocrisy and white knighting.[5]
Bryan also claimed that he was called by The Captain and that he explained the Idea Guys saga to him, and Bryan also seemed to claim that one of Joshua Wise's tactics was convincing Chris that certain things, such as shitting on the floor, could bring Bob back to life. However, none of the Guard Dogs have backed up the latter claim. The Captain also privately complained about Bryan's claims to another person, mentioning that he had not told Bryan explicitly about the Idea Guys and that Bryan had exaggerated some details.[11]
