“
Chris Chan’s making Dungeons and Dragons Progression! Oh, My Fuck!
”
A tweet by Chris.
Profile picture, based on Ulala from the Space Channel 5 series.
Creamarina is the name of a Twitter account created by MKRNightVee when many bronies blocked Chris on his main Twitter account, taking on the persona of the OC of the same name, and later shared it with Chris to enable him to evade blocks people set on his other accounts.[1] The profile picture features MKRNightVee's artwork.
The account came to the attention of an observer on 28 January 2019 who noticed that, of the 60 accounts it was following, 50 were known to either be actively followed by Chris or confirmed to be have blocked him on his main account.[2] At the time, the account had no tweets.
However, months later, Chris seems to have felt it was safe enough to tweet.[3] Only a few tweets were made, which match his writing style.

Advice for brony
2 September 2019
Josh Scorcher (brony who blocked Chris's main Twitter account):
Ughgh.... I'm super torn right now. Spoilers for the MLP series finale keep showing up in my YouTube recommended feed and they've already blown some things for me, it's Endgame all over again. Should I just... watch the leaked episodes so people don't spoil me?
Chris (during his phase of being possessed by Magi-Chan):
Hold your composure, Josh; you have the option to select the three dots by the preview of the video and click “Not Interested”. Keep your gaze clear of the leaks; I warn and urge you. [Purple heart] [High voltage sign]
Passive-aggressive remark to End Games
30 January 2020
The End Games (card game shop which declined to undo Chris's ban) posted a tweet advertising their Dungeons and Dragons group.
Chris quoted a tweet from his main CPU_CWCSonichu account about his Dungeons and Dragons character sheet, and tweeted:
Chris Chan’s making Dungeons and Dragons Progression! Oh, My Fuck!
What animal is Josh Scorcher?
5 December 2020
Josh Scorcher:
Just curious, what animal(s) do you guys associate me with and why?
Chris:
Well, for one, your pony OC and all of his devilish ways. Mwa-ha-ha to say the least. If I had to pick another animal for you, instincts are telling me goat or ram. I’m not sure, but I feel like something with horns would be relatable with you.
DMs
Main article: Midnight Moonflower DMs#Creamarina
On 29 April 2020, Midnight Moonflower DM'd Creamarina to ask if it was MKRNightVee's account. Chris replied, saying that it was, but that it was shared with him. Midnight continued the conversation over text messages as she did not trust MKR, and told Chris she would block Creamarina since the account was shared with MKR and that Chris's other accounts wouldn't be blocked.
