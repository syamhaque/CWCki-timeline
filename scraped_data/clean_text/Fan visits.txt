Chris's recent failings have helped CWCki gather more information for this article. Be a winner by adding this information in.
This new information can be found from the following sources:
• https://www.reddit.com/r/ChrisChanSonichu/comments/1oxabw5/chris_chans_old_house_today/
https://www.reddit.com/r/ChrisChanSonichu/comments/1p7evni/current_state_of_14_branchland_ct/
PROTIP:
We strongly recommend that you avoid visiting 14 BLC, as the pros of doing so are greatly outweighed by the cons. Chris no longer lives there, and taking pictures of the property and posting them publically can lead to questioning amongst the community.
Fan visits refer to unsolicited visits by those allured by Chris's infamy into seeking him out at his home for photo ops. In some cases, this has extended to seeking out his mother after Chris moved out following the Affair with Mother scandal. Such visits also include being confronted and questioned after taking photos of the home.
The normalization of unsolicited visitors may have influenced Chris into attempting to do the same to emgo316, a Transformers toy reviewer of which Chris is a fan. In October 2020, Chris drove to Pennsylvania, motivated by the idea he could show up at emgo316's home by looking up his address online, only to find that emgo had moved out by then.[1]

Joey Vance
Chris with Joey (far left) and his brother.
On 18 October 2019, Joey Vance and his older brother visited Sonichu Headquarters to meet Chris. Their accounts were posted on Reddit in r/ChrisChanSonichu the next day.[2]
The two brothers were initially visiting Charlottesville and since Ruckersville just happens to be in their way, Joey decided to make the most of their time together to personally visit Chris. The overall visit was described as a calm experience between the two parties, with the older brother (known by his Reddit handle xv5qx) even giving a Sonic toy as a "peace offering". One interesting note Joey mentioned is the fact that Chris smells of weed. Whether the musk is the result of his usual poor hygiene or his new drug habit is still up for debate.
Audio
Joey also recorded conversations regarding Jacob Sockness.

On 20 February 2021, a Ruckersville local by the handle of Aggravating_Art_2982, along with his older brother and his brother's girlfriend visited Chris and documented his (now deleted) experience on Reddit's r/ChrisChanSonichu subreddit.[3]

hoov2002
On 27 July 2021, Reddit user hoov2002 visited Chris at 14 Branchland Court, and took two photos with him. Of note is how both of these images feature Chris wearing his negligee, which he claimed he had been wearing during some instances of his affair with his mother.[4] This visit was not publicly posted about until March 2022, likely due to the fact that Chris' incest came to light just a day later.

e1ectricthunder
Party on, Garth! e1ectricthunder is a young woman who posted a very brief video of her and an unknown friend interacting with Barb. The two of them went to the Chandler home, claimed to be friends of Chris's looking to get in touch with them, and were met only by a very confused-sounding Barb. Their visit was not well-received, especially on the Kiwi Farms, where this was viewed as the harassment of an elderly woman, for Internet clout, which lead to her doxing.
On 20 September 2021, she and an unknown male visited 14 Branchland Court, knocked on the door to reveal a seemingly confused Barbara, and asked, babbling, whether Chris was home or not. Barb was previously described as looking frail, more "gone" than usual, and growing facial hair.[5] Barb seemed to be confused when asked about where her son was while Clover howled at the door. Given that Barb did not know that she was being recorded, this was seen by some as evidence that she is not faking having cognitive difficulties as some claimed she did in Chris's begging videos, or at least that her alleged difficulty hearing is getting worse.
The video was then posted to the r/ChrisChanSonichu subreddit,[6] but was deleted though not before being mirrored.

JacksonStarship
On 3 January 2024, r/ChrisChanSonichu user JacksonStarship stopped at 14 Branchland Court to take photos. He claimed to have rang the doorbell and that Barbara answered.[7]
To preface, I know I saw Chris in public just a couple weeks back. I’m not an obsessive stalker, I can already see those comments flooding in. The spotting was a coincidence and I only stopped at 14 BLC as I was going through Ruckersville.
Anyways, onto the meat of it. We pulled into BLC, I took a few photos from the vehicle and then got out and got the individual I am with to take a couple of me by the house, from the street.
After I took these photos I stopped to gather my composure for a second, their were cats running around the yard, they looked healthy and happy.
I walked to the door and rung the door bell, I wouldn’t have done so if I wasn’t able to hear the TV from the yard, I figured whoever was home I would greet them.
Barb came to the door after I had retreated, she asked who I was looking for, I told her that i “just wanted to see if anyone was home,” I see now I should’ve said something a little nicer but I was not expecting to see Barb in the slightest. I said “have a nice day ma’am, sorry for bothering you.” And she seemed slightly taken aback that I wasn’t harassing her. She said “you too” and went back inside. She seemed fully lucid, and if she is demented or senile it isn’t as severe as some might think. She didn’t sound or look unhealthy or frail. I took no photos of Barb as I see no point, she’s just a lonely old lady. If I ever come through Ruckersville again I might drop her off a gift basket or care package.
EDIT: Me by 14 BLC, face censored, I can provide photos of the shirt to verify if anyone wants
TL;DR, Barb and the Chandler animals are live and well, and OP (me) didn’t harass or stalk anyone

CamIsYolo
On 24 February 2025, CamIsYolo drove to view 14 Branchland Court. According to him, Barbara stepped out to ask why he was there, requested not to be filmed, then asked him when his birthday was before commenting, “I have a son, It’s his birthday today”. CamIsYolo snapped two photos of her approaching him.[8][9]

Anon on /pol/
On 28 June 2021, an anonymous user on 4chan's /pol/ board trespassed at the yard of 14 Branchland Court to take pictures of the house and the Dodge Caravan. The user played the flute near Patti's old doghouse and apparently saw Chris peeking through a window in the house.

Phillip Jeffries
On 29 August 2021, during the fallout of the incest incident and the August 2021 arrest, a Kiwi Farms user called Phillip_Jeffries visited 14 Branchland Court with a friend in order to see the condition of the aforementioned Dodge Caravan and the cats. Phillip was able to confirm that the vehicle was back at the house, and that at least two cats, Baby and Sylvia, were still living at the residence. Most notably, it was also confirmed that Barbara had returned to the house and that the Caravan had been registered with replacement license plates.[10]

Larry Vaughn
On 16 December 2021, Larry Vaughn decided to visit 14 Branchland Court after the totaling of Son-Chu. While there, he took two photos of the property, most notably with the van missing. He would later post both of these photos on Reddit. Larry had also claimed that Barb still lives at the house, despite the accident, and that the property had been cleaned, although saw some of Chris's belongings still present.[11]

xQqrKE
On 8 August 2022, Kiwi Farms user xQqrKE fraudulently represented himself as a pizza delivery man and knocked on the door of 14 Branchland Court while recording video. No one answered, though he heard dog barks. xQqrKE claimed that after he had shut his camera off, a man in business casual pulled up to the house in a black van, told xQqrKE that Barb had not lived there for a long time, and then entered the house.[12]

While Iron_Taipan posted other images, only the ones of the house are relevant here.
On 22 January 2023, Reddit user Iron_Taipan posted[13] to the /r/ChrisChanSonichu subreddit, posting images of a recent trip to Ruckersville. The post included images of what was once The GAMe PLACe, Fashion Square Mall, and some photos of the house.

DATSJUSTWATINEED2BUS
On the evening of 3 May 2023, redditor DATSJUSTWATINEED2BUS posted a series of images of 14 Branchland Court.[14] What makes this visit notable is that the Redditor saw a glimpse of Barbara Chandler, without being seen by her. DATSJUSTWATINEED2BUS saw her in the upstairs window in the third pic, obscured by the tree. He left immediately after noticing Barb, confident he wasn't spotted. He planned on visiting once more the next morning, although decided against after he found Barb was not in a nursing home.
After I took the third pic I drove a little bit forward to get an additional angle of the house and then thats when I saw her. It was unmistakable, it was her with her white grown and white hair looking off to the right side of the window, possibly doing dishes something, idk whats up there. She wasnt looking at me thankfully but she couldve came to that window after hearing my car (which isnt very quiet, especially at 10 at night) and seeing who was out there.
Maintenance of 14BC's exterior and lawn is continuing to occur, as the lawn appears to have been raked frequently and is actually regaining a healthy green colour. Inside, Chris's Sonichu poster visible from the window to his room is the only obvious sign of his former residence at 14BC. The lights within Chris's room are on.

Aggravating Art (2023)
Throughout 8 September 2023, Aggravating Art visited 14 Branchland Court again and posted photos on Reddit.
On his first trip, he claimed to have found the house completely empty with no one inside or outside the house.[17]
Just went to Chris home. It’s empty and no one home
Aggravating Art later visited the house again in the evening and found that the lights and fan inside the house were turned on, but there were still no cars at the house. He also claimed he had been staying outside the house all day.[18]
2nd Chris visit of the day. Lights are on and fan is but no car is there and has been all day.
An orange and white cat is seen in these photos, though it is unknown if it is one of the Chandlers' or just a stray.

PROTIP:
While EldwichHowwowCthUwU posted other images, only the ones of the house are relevant here.
On 10 February 2024, Reddit user EldwichHowwowCthUwU posted several photos of himself and his friends at 14 Branchland Court to the /r/ChrisChanSonichu subreddit,[19] the Gearharts chocolate shop and the entrance to Fashion Square Mall. The post was met with a negative reaction, calling EldwichHowwowCthUwU and his friends out for essentially violating Barb's privacy.

CapitalPurple108
On the 26th of June 2024, Reddit user CapitalPurple108 posted an account of a visit he made to 14 Branchland Court[20] a week prior while returning home from a camping trip. He uploaded three photographs of the house's exterior and front yard, remarking on the state of the house and its surroundings and the absence of cars in the drive. He confirmed that Barb was not home. Many Redditors remarked upon the dire condition of the yard at the time, making comments that hearkened back to Chris's infamous statements about the back-breaking work he endured pulling weeds.
Tennis-Ball-Tony
At around the beginning/middle of June, slightly before CapitalPurple's own visit, Kiwi Farms user Tennis-Ball-Tony took two snapshots of 14 Branchland Court's front porch[21]. Tony would claim that he saw Barb sitting outside, and the second photo appears to show her doing so. Tony explained that he didn't pull in for a closer shot because of regular police presence in the neighborhood.
October 2025
On the 16th of October 2025, X user RazorwindVT visited the house and posted two photos. They claimed that users rose_dax and Elijah_Knightly were with them when they visited and left immediately when the neighbors caught them.[22]
