Three-Quarter Woman is a homemade CD "made with love and care" by Chris, created specially in September 2014 for Catherine. Cousin Al published the CD details on CWCki Forums.[1] Most of the songs on the album range from pop/country songs probably favored by Chris's parents, to obvious favorites sung and/or played by Chris in the past, along with songs by Japanese performers.
Despite the CD being made as a tribute to one of his gal-pals, the strange title of the album refers to Chris himself (and specifically his gender identity) shortly before fully-identifying as a transwoman, which he would formally do in late November 2014 (just before the Boxing Day incident at GameStop). At this point, Chris still considered himself a crossdressing "Tomgirl", but was leaning more heavily into his feminine side; just not enough to fully identify as female.
Worth noting is that Chris has included a song by Tara Strong on the album, even though he at one point said that Strong contributed to cyberbullying with her "Twilightlicious" video, and was publicly insulted by her as a result.
In I Love You, Catherine, uploaded on 4 October 2014, Chris asked the person who obtained the CD to mail it back to him. Whether or not they complied is unknown, but highly unlikely. Also unknown was Catherine's response to the album itself.
