“
I am strong. I can lift my office chair in my room over my head, even with a moderately heavy object in the seat. The chair alone is Heavy.
”
Chris to Vanessa
Power is a zipfile published by The Miscreants containing three videos in which Chris performs various dubious feats of strength. The .zip includes the three videos, an audio file edited from "I Got a Fish" and a "special thanks" document. Chris gave these files to Joshua Martinez to give to Vanessa Hudgens to meet her request for a "test of strength" as part of her audition process. The zipfile was leaked along with CWCFlyingElephants on 27 April 2009.
The original zipfile had long been considered lost media since the shutdown of the original Megaupload, on which it had been hosted. In October 2025, however, Statustjej confirmed the special thanks file's contents in the comments of their Chris Chan creepy smile reupload, before uploading the original zipfile (along with other Chris content) to the Internet Archive on 12 November.
Since Power's release, videos of Chris exercising (or attempting exercise) have been dubbed "Power Videos".

BY THE POWER OF NUMBSKULL!
[Chris stands in the middle of his bedroom, with no shirt on and the Gitar of Fail in his right arm. He proceeds to hold it above his head dramatically before thrusting it forward, causing his man-breasts to jiggle noticeably.]
I HAAAVE THE POWEEERRRUUUAARGH! FEEL MY WRATH!
[Chris then lowers the Gitar and performs a "guitar solo" on it by wiggling the whammy bar and screeching, looking like a complete child.]

[Chris stands in the same spot as before, albeit now with a swivel chair in front of him. He flexes his jelly-like arms]
(Spoken in voiceover) We will now be watching the strong man, lifting a very heavy office chair. Note: the chair weighs a grand number of pounds.
[crouches and lifts up the chair, albeit with considerable effort]
Ahhhhh! Ta-da! FEEL MY WRATH!
[gently puts the chair back down]

[Much like before, Chris stands in front of the chair, again flexing in an attempt to look tough. However, there is now a plastic basket filled with what appears to be books placed on the chair as well]
(Spoken in voiceover) Now we will be seeing the strong man lifting the same chair, but with...a very heavy basket full of junk in the chair.
[bends down to pick up the chair, giving us a view of his underwear and plumber's crack in the process. He struggles to lift the chair, and two of the books tumble out of the basket]
HHHNGG I ONCE KNEW A MAN FROM NANTUCKET!!
[puts the chair back down very quickly]
