Mmm… I'm sorry—uh, I’m so—I apologize deeply for, uh, missing our meeting earlier today, but, uh, yeah, my—yeah, my mom, uh, w—was in disbelief, but yeah, also, my father was in full belief… and, uh, still conflicting—all the conflicting prob—all the conflicting opinions and whatnot just made me feel unsure. But I promise—I promise-- Emily, I promise… [shows “promise ring”] I will—in the—in the next chance that I—next opportunity we g—uh, we schedule a meeting, I will definitely make it.
Mmm…

And I did pop—and I did drop by the, uh, mall… in front of the—in front of the—at the Chick—in front of the, uh, Chick-fil-A there. And I sh—and I called out—and I called out for you, but, uh… no response. So, I just didn't know what to make of that… at that point, as well.
