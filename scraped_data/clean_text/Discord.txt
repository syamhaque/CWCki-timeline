Notable servers

Main article: The group

Midnight's Nightlings and Starettes
Main article: Midnight's Nightlings and Starettes

CopperCab's server

Arbitarch CWC Alliance
Main article: Arbitarch CWC Alliance
Chris joined in fall 2019.
The bulk of the chats center on Chris role-playing with Watchmen feeding into his fantasies.
During the server's operation, people on Twitter commented on Chris's posts about it, revealing some troubling aspects of the server; not only were the admins and mods notoriously power-hungry and dictatorial, but in order to take part, users had to 'verify' their Discord accounts through a rather shady bot which requested access to user data, including any other servers the user was a member of.
ProjectSNT Patreon Server
In January 2020, Chris paid to join ProjectSNT's Discord group, in an apparent attempt to get his foot in the door after she had given him the cold shoulder over Twitter in response to a tantrum he threw over her redesign of one of his characters.
In November 2020, Chris sent a DM to Opuscon789 regarding SNT Vs Sonichu; Opuscon later wrote that he assumed Chris found out his Discord handle from both being members of ProjectSNT's server.[5]
Official CWCki Server
Main article: Official CWCki Server
The Official CWCki Server is a Discord server for the CWCki which was established in July 2020. On 10 August 2020, Chris was briefly a member; he posted two messages before moderators opted to ban him four days later for the purpose of maintaining distance between the server and Chris.
cwc frens
Main article: cwc frens
cwc frens is a defunct sister server to the Official CWCki Server. Chris was directed to this server after the Official CWCki Server's moderators opted to remove him from the server. cwc frens was later shut down.
The Place
Main article: The Place
The Watchmen are a group of enablers who sought to protect Chris from malicious actors. Chris joined their Discord group. A large amount of chats from it were leaked by the Watchmen in summer 2020. Chris has also done a Q&A with a CWCki editor in the group.
Chris left the server in June 2021 due to infighting among the Watchmen.[6]
Sonic World DX Lounge
Main article: Sonic World DX Lounge
Server creator on Chris's removal.

Glorious Golden Church of Sonichu
Main article: Golden Church of Sonichu
A server created by Praetor for those who have purchased their limited-run $60 golden medallion. Chris was present in the server.
The Knights of CWC
Main article: The Knights of CWC
A Watchmen splinter server founded by The WCT in June 2021, who took over as Watchmen leader following the infighting in The Place server. The server would only last for two months due to Chris being arrested for incest shortly afterwards.
Chess Group #15
Bella had also created another chess server, Chess Group #15. Unlike most of her other servers, Bella notably uses much more friendlier language with her guests, and generally acts a lot more genial towards them. In other servers, she would often speak negatively about such guests while they aren't present. She invited Chris at one point for a brief visit, as well as Fiona and The WCT.
Catboy Ranch
Main article: Catboy Ranch
Catboy Ranch is a Discord server associated with Keffals. Chris quietly joined the server on a secret alternate account on 21 July 2023, and joined on his main account on 16 October 2023. Keffals would later interview Chris in January 2024 in a failed attempt to use Chris as a puppet. Most of Chris's messages sent in the server are thought to be lost for unclear reasons. The server is notably paywalled. Both of Chris's accounts are still in the server as of March 2025.
itemLabel server
On 30 July 2024, Chris joined the Discord server for itemLabel, a company that makes and sells various plush dolls. Chris was particularly interested in their Cubepy plush around this time.[7] Chris never sent any messages in it, and he was noticed absent from the server in January 2025.
Main account
JCWCSonichuPrime1982 / jcwcsonichuprime1982 / CWCSonichu1982#9390
On 28 April 2018, Chris created a new Discord account.
Chris has occasionally changed his name and avatar.
Original "ChrisChanSonichu" name and avatar.
Changed to reflect his belief that Magi-Chan had possessed him in August 2019.
Changed to Sonichu theme during April 2020 to reflect his belief that he and Sonichu had swapped bodies.
Name change to JCWCSonichuPrime1982 post-Jail Saga
Alt account
ChristChanSchuPrime#1982 / christ.chan.sonichu.prime / ChristChan#0334
The account in the Catboy Ranch server.
On 26 June 2023, during the third exile, Chris created a new Discord account.
The account was found to have joined Keffals's server on 21 July 2023. The account was given access to the main server, having the roles "Verified" and "T1". Interestingly, as of now, the account has zero messages sent in the server, despite bots saying that the account has leveled up (usually something done by sending messages). This could imply that chats have been deleted, but it's not exactly certain.
Other servers this account is in, if any, are currently unknown.
Discord selfies
To provide proof of his Discord account's legitimacy, Chris takes poorly-photographed selfies to post in the servers upon entering.
