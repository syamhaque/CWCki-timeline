Chris (Farley) struggles even to hold on to the bar.
100 2278 is a video Chris created on 12 October 2010, at the behest of his sweetheart Jackie.[1][2][3] It leaked to the public the next month, on 6 November 2010. Chris attempts to do pull-ups, but shortly after beginning, gives up and admits defeat due to his weight. This event marks a historic day in Christory as it is the first, and one of the very few, times we have witnessed him acknowledge that he is not, in fact, superhuman.

Transcript
[We see Chris's hands and knees on top of a jungle gym. He crawls backwards to grab hold of a horizontal bar.]
[Chris hangs from the bar, not far off the ground, for about five seconds. Quickly, the exertion causes him to lose his grip and drop to the ground.]
[Chris grunts and jumps up to grab the bar again.]
Ugh...
[He quickly falls back down, and then looks to the camera.]
Alright, fine, I can't do a pull up. At least I tried.
[Chris springs up and tries to grab the bar again.]
Still tryin'.
[Chris makes grunting and gasping sounds.]
Well, can't do it.
[Chris tries to do a pull-up again with visibly shaking arms, grunts and sighs.]
Uh... Too sensitive to my... [sound of slapping belly] weight.
[Chris walks off camera.]

Accompanying the leaked video were a selection of images, presumed to be ones Chris took for Jackie.
Gallery
The corner of Chris's room, with famous artifacts such as The Wall of Originals, the Sailor Moon poster of Straightening, the Gitar of Fail, and the fan favorite, the Marge poster.
The other corner has a whole slew of consoles and other devices, including Chris's PlayStation 3. Clearly arranged in order of importance, otherwise he wouldn't put the Commodore 1541 disk drive on open and hide the Wii among the junk.
The McIntire Park sign.
The table with Lego blocks, also carrying Transformers and Sonic toys. Also a boatload of video tapes, CDs, magazines, yet another Gitar, and ironically a box or book cover whose only visible words are "the hidden".
A view of the window and the chair, with too much junk to count.
The remnants of the Megan Shrine, now almost completely dismantled and used as shelves for DVDs, a bunch of folders undoubtedly containing much the original hand-artery drawings of Sonichu comics, My Little Pony characters, and in case you forgot this was Chris's room, two more Gitars of Fail.
Game shelf meets the DVD shelf.
The doorway that leads to sweet freedom (which is a lie), with the bathroom visible opposite. Notable artefacts in this area of the room include the blinking light ball seen in several videos, the original drawing of Espanolic and Vegaton, various torn posters, and a piece of paper stuck to the door indicating that this is the 'Cwickville Gym', using an earlier spelling of CWCville.
A bit of the Sulking Couch beside the door and PSP/DS game shelf. Letter box labeled "current and important". Two posters for mass debation, the Plush Breasts, Lil' Chris and a badass chain or something can also be seen.
More video tapes and toys beside the Sulking Couch. Noticeable failure at photographing the Sonic trinket.
Back to the first corner with the Wall of Originals and Marge poster.
Female martial artists are awesome! ...Except that's not a martial arts move. And that's not a female either. We've been duped!
Now with extra boobage.
TITTY MONSTER
Has Chris been improving his art during the dry spell? SPOILER: NO
Chris's fursona, from ECV 00002.
