Chris attempting to divine the future
On 9 October 2020, Chris chatted in the Watchmen Discord server The Place on interpreting a dream he had involving a golden disc inscribed with Zodiac and Bushido signs and attempting to divine how the disc could breach the iron curtain between dimensions. Chris primarily discussed it with Kyle.
During the chat, Chris mashed up elements from various sources, such as the Zodiac, the Bushido, numerology, My Little Pony, Sonic the Hedgehog, lore from the Idea Guys, and his own life, to interpret the dream. He excitedly determined that between 22 and 23 October 2020 would be a key date for breaking between dimensions.
Server members present in the chat below are: Chris (@Sonichu982), Kyle (@Nova), Naught - aka Bismuth - (@ภคยﻮђՇ), and The WCT (@Neko Onyx (Kat)).
Chat
The Golden Stone Disc from Chris's dreams which he analyzes.
The conversation continues from a portion of The Place chats - Pennsylvania Trip, in which Chris said, "The Golden Stone Disc. Going back to that."
Chris (as Sonichu)
Kyle, you said something about adding the number of birth signs to the number of Bushido.
Kyle
I know a fair bit about mesoamerican revivalist art, so it sounds vaguely similar to that.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Thing of that is on each of the pieces, other than the center piece with only a spiral on it, there is more than one symbol on each of them.
The way I see it, it’s linking the birth signs, Bushido, and year animals together in a common theme on each piece.
Kyle
Would be strange to have something that assembles
Signs and zodiac could correspond 1 to 1, if only because that's 12 and 12.
Chris (as Sonichu)
And should the number of pieces total to 20, there would be eight pieces without a birth sign, but instead with such a symbol as a star or a darkened circle that could go between every first or second piece.
That’s the impression I get from what I saw.
How many Zodiac Animals are there?
As in “Year of the _”
Kyle
12.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Twelve?
I had thought there were 20.
I know cat is not one of them, as described in “Fruits Basket”
Kyle
12 with a blank divider gives a grouping of 2, meaning 24, I think.
[posts an image captioned Chinese Zodiac Animal Set]
Chris (as Sonichu)
Ah
I see your point, 24 might be the number of pieces.
Kyle
Angles between segments being 15, so how big was the radius?
Chris (as Sonichu)
The fuller details of the disc revealed to me in the dream became blurred in the transition from dream to awake.
Kyle
It would be rare that an ornamental object was designed to be disassembled.
Chris (as Sonichu)
I’m not sure, but in the dream, it was scaled to that where Scrooge McDuck was able to hold it in one hand, and it scaled at least double the size of his hand.
In the dream, the pieces were disassembled, and they all had come together.
In light of those in-between filler pieces, they also had writing on them that would very likely describe a history detail, a magic spell, or something.
Yeah, the majority of the writing looked either Chinese or Japanese or something similar.
Kyle
So, he's about 3 foot tall, sounds like it would be 8-12 inches?
Contemporary writing systems?
Chris (as Sonichu)
Going from a radius of a foot to a diameter of 24 inches, that sounds about right.
Probably contemporary.
Anyway
There is likely such a disc in existence in this dimension as well.
Kyle
No, that's the radius doubled to give diameter.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Yeah, from 12 inches to 24.
Kyle
At 24 inches it would have been 2/3rds the height of him.
Chris (as Sonichu)
All right, whatever.
Kyle
I was using, it was 2x the diameter of the hand so the length of the hand is the radius.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Okay, I misunderstood what you said.
Kyle
About the size of a discus on the lower end.
Chris (as Sonichu)
As for How this disc relates towards the ability to go through the iron curtain between dimensions is not totally clear to me at the moment.
It could do with one of those in-between filler pieces.
The highlighted birth sign symbol that became obvious to me with looking at me was Scorpio.
Kyle
Well if it was able to be disassembled, that's a sign it had some mechanical factors.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Maybe it has to do with the in-between moment of Scorpio and the next one after that.
Or even before it.
October 23 to November 22.
I just checked
October is one of the highest magic months.
Woahly Crap!
Kyle
A calendar wouldn't be able to be disassembled, so it's not that, and the dead zones wouldn't be of equal size.
Chris (as Sonichu)
It was around October 23 when IdeaGuy’s Johnson Wiles contacted Mama in regards to our SEGA Dreamcast being the one-and-only link in this Dimension with Uzume.
Perhaps, then, it has to do with the exact millisecond between October 22 and the 23rd.
The stroke of Midnight.
Kyle
Bearing in mind, it's going to create a lot of false leads if you've got a large sample size to pull from.
Like how the simpsons predicted everything, that's just basic statistics, if you predict 2 things a week for 30 years, you've got a data set of 3120 things that only need to be partially similar, so you're going to hit something, but your accuracy is going to be horrible.
Chris (as Sonichu)
The birth sign right before Scorpio is Libra, and the symbol for Libra is...
Omega!
Naught
[posts reaction image]
Chris (as Sonichu)
This has to do with that millisecond in-between between Libra and Scorpio.
Kyle
Also the symbol for electrical resistance, but that just demonstrates how easy it is to connect 2 things with only tentative anecdotes.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Hey, Bis.
Catch up; we’re talking relic stone disc, birth signs, bishudo, zodiac animals, their links with each other, and the in-between pieces.
Naught
[posts a reaction image]
Chris (as Sonichu)
Considering the above zodiac animal image is in chronological order, that would put the Monkey in with Libra, and the Rooster with Scorpio.
There may be more than one Bushido associated with each pair of birth sign and zodiac animal.
Kyle
Well 7 isn't a divisor of 12 or 24.
Chris (as Sonichu)
So I realize.
Even to multiply seven: 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77...
Kyle
There's no way it maps equidistantly.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Wait
56 is divisible by eight.
Kyle
So that would be a grouping of blank-relevant-blank. However it would be crooked because there are 2 top elements.
Chris (as Sonichu)
And 28 X 2 = 56
!!!
There are four Bishudo that relates with each of the 12 signs and animals.
And it repeats.
Going with this image, you take the first four, Meryl, Rei, Gi, and Yuuki for January.
And then Makoto, Chuugi, Jin, and Meiyo for February.
Kyle
A bit arbitrary but it does add complexity, I don't think it'll be equal of each though, I think the ordering here might be arbitrary.
Chris (as Sonichu)
It loops back to the January set in August.
Wait...
Meiyo, Rei, Gi, Yuuki - Jan (edited)
Makoto, Chuugi, Jin, Meiyo - Feb (edited)
Rei, Gi, Yuuki, Makoto - Mar
Chuugi, Jin, Meiyo, Rei - Apr (edited)
Gi, Yuuki, Makoto, Chuugi - May
Jin, Meiyo, Rei, Gi - Jun (edited)
Yuuki, Makoto, Chuugi, Jin - Jul
Meiyo, Rei, Gi, Yuuki - Aug
Makoto, Chuugi, Jin, Meiyo - Sep
Chuugi, Jin, Meiyo, Rei - Oct
Gi, Yuuki, Makoto, Chuugi - Nov
Jin, Meiyo, Rei, Gi - Dec
Honor, Respect, Integrity, Heroic Courage, Honesty/Sincerity, Duty/Loyalty, Compassion
September - Honesty/Sincerity, Duty/Loyalty, Compassion, Honor
October - Respect, Integrity, Heroic Courage, Honesty/Sincerity
Kyle
Zodiac does also ascribe a bit more depth, if only because most people who believe in horoscopes are louder about being wrong.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Right now, I’m analyzing to figure out this detail, Kyle.
I’m not finalizing anything into fact yet.
Ah!
The common theme is where the Bishudo is repeated in the in-between, which is the date range for each sign.
Like for Libra (Omega), with its Monkey, its Bishudo is Makoto (Honesty/Sincerity)
And Scorpio, with its Rooster, its Bishudo is Chuugi (Duty/Loyalty)
Mama’s first spoken word was Monkey.
And Barb is a Libra
It is unraveling itself here.
Or at least beginning to.
The two months!
Element of Honesty is Applejack
Kyle
Weren't there supposed to be 4 per?
Chris (as Sonichu)
Element of Loyalty is Rainbow Dash
A Bushido gets repeated in each month, therefore it is the repeated Bushido that is the central one for that sign and animal.
Mama’s top two favourite Mane Eight Ponies of Equestria.
And I am counting Starlight Glimmer and Sunset Shimmer.
Elements: Magic, Kindness, Laughter, Generosity, Honesty, Loyalty
Honor, Respect, Integrity, Heroic Courage, Honesty/Sincerity, Duty/Loyalty, Compassion
Honesty and Loyalty ARE amongst the Bushido!
The other four are not.
Applejack has Libra, Omega, Monkey, and Honesty/Sincerity. (edited)
Rainbow Dash has Scorpio, Rooster, and Duty/Loyalty.
Not linking their actual birth dates into this at all, but their common elements in this grander schematic. (edited)
I have more to meditate on with this information that I have just uncovered, and @everyone, you all have a lot to meditate on with this as well.
But I can definitely finalize and attest that something really magical will happen on the stroke of Midnight between October 22 and October 23.
There is more to figure in addition to and aside from that.
Kyle
Seems a bit less airtight to ignore information that is normally the whole basis for the theory.
Chris (as Sonichu)
True
One theory speculates that the remaining three Bushido could be the in-between filler pieces that go before their respective months, OR that the details I have just listed are the in-between fillers, respectively.
Which on both of those, for that particular Midnight stroke, that would either bring up the Bushido of Compassion, Honor and Respect, or Otherwise, Rainbow Dash, Scorpio, Rooster, and Duty/Loyalty.
One fact that we can definitely determine from this is that September and October are two months that heavily involve a common bond between Earth and Equestria in more ways than one Applejack or one Rainbow Dash.
Also, we can attribute the aspects of Physical Strength and Speed.
A speed increase.
Since AJ is slower in running speed as opposed to RD making Sonic Rainbooms often.
Kyle
Good time to go for a run on the hiking trails.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Or Knuckles to Sonic. (edited)

Reminds me of RPS101
Chris (as Sonichu)
Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock
Naught
LeL
Chris (as Sonichu)
Leonard Nemoy
Yeah, neither his birth or death dates correspond with this date in October.
Nor Transforms The Movie, which released in August, 1986.
Trivia note: Nemoy voiced Galvatron in that movie.
Again, we all have a lot to meditate on with this crucial millisecond moment between the 22nd and 23rd of this month.
But in correlation with everything else amongst the events in Mama’s life, this syncs up very well.
Kyle

The WCT
sweet jesus.
Kyle
https://www.umop.com/rps101/alloutcomes.htm
And the logic.
"Bird of peace prevents nuke"
And so on.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Kyle!
You’ve just stumbled onto something by saying that logic quote.
Bird trumps Fish
Rooster!
Rainbow Dash!
And Fish relates to Pisces.
Kyle
A lot of incinerating going on. Sometimes symbolism is harder than being literal.
[posts an image captioned Nuke]
I'd have at least gone with NEMP for computer.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Rainbow Dash, Sonic, Chris Chan Sonichu!
This further solidifies that midnight millisecond moment.
Kyle, I could kiss and hug you right now, you big beautiful, awesome, intelligent being!
Kyle
Actually wonder why they never tried making a hardened microcomputer.
Thanks.
Wow, there's an executive order for hardened infrastructure, that's actually a really smart idea, Donald is really on the ball on these things.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Chris Chan Sonichu, Pisces, Ox, Honesty/Integrity.
Sonic was born on June 23rd; makes senpai a Cancer
The WCT
"Cancer". lol
Kyle
That or the obligatory crabs joke.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Sonic, Cancer, Snake, Compassion
Well, with Mama’s set including Honesty/Integrity, that does match with Applejack.
And her set which includes “Monkey”.
Sonic still links into this by being the one that instigated that Chaotic Rainbow on February 1, 2003 during that day in Station Square when he collided with me and made me and Rosey into Sonichu and Rosechu, and Mama having literally come out from the apex of that very rainbow.
And all of the Chaos Power therein as well.
These are the puzzle pieces we are given, @everyone.
I’m laying them out for you all right now.
Kyle
Mapping things, we're not 100% sure if the underpinning model is accurate enough yet.
I guess try and find some edge cases that are hard to classify.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Still, we got the Chaos Control date and time.
