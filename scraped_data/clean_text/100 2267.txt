================================================================================

Quality cosplaying is so overrated.
100 2267 is one of three videos Chris uploaded on 7 October 2010. In this video, Chris attempts to insult Clyde Cash by doing an overblown impression of him. He dresses up in orangeface (in a method reminiscent of a certain political figure), and tries to copy Clyde's characteristic hairstyle by slicking his hair back. The theme suddenly changes when "Clyde" starts rambling about how he deserves to die.

Transcript
[Chris jumps into view, face covered in brown paint and wearing a white t-shirt with "I GOT WHAT I DESERVE" on it]
[Strange, relatively low-pitched voice] Heeeeey, folks! It's me, Clyde Cash. I am the ruler of the internet and the internet trolls. I am an adulterous foe, a bastard and a self-righteous idiot [voice begins to break] who spends his time wallowing and trolling the one Christian Weston Chandler, and making up a whole bunch of dadgum rumors all over the internet! [Raises arms angrily] I am a phenomenon! And you know what, I am a spawn of spatan so I got what I deserve! Nothing! Nothing very good, nothing good, nothing decent, I have no... sense of pride for myself, because I got everything handed to me on a silver platter, I raped his Australian girlfriend! And then married her! And now I have a one-cent daaaauuuughteeeer. I am AN IDIOT!
[Voice changes suddenly, gets harsher] Rule over me, watch over me! Seriously, take me down! I want you to kill me, Clyde Cash! Kill me now! Kill me now, I don't want to live this life of being a spawn of Satan anymore! Aaaaah!
