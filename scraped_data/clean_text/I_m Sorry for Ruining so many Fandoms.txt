Idea Guy Manipulation Disclosure:
The views Chris expresses are extremely unlikely to be his own. This video was orchestrated behind the scenes by the Idea Guys putting ideas in his head or goading him to act out; not all of these interactions were released to the public.
I’m Sorry for Ruining so many Fandoms is a video where Chris apologizes for ruining fandoms associated with him, mostly notably My Little Pony. He also appears to be very desperate to be forgiven.
Chris later mentioned that this video was an Idea Guy production[1].
