“
So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone....
”
John 8:7, a Bible verse Chris seemed to miss
“
Judge not, that ye be not judged.
”
Matthew 7:1, another verse Chris seemed to miss
On March 8, Chris watched an episode of Family Guy ("Family Gay"), in which Peter Griffin is injected with a gene that makes him become homosexual, and Stewie cites the Bible verse Leviticus 18:22 in opposition of this development. Because of this, Chris was inspired to make "CWC with Bible - Leviticus".
After his Bible reading, Chris mentions that he is hard at work on a new Sonichu medallion, and publicly announces that he is no longer focusing the Internet as a front in his Love Quest. Instead, he has begun using a kids' self-help book written by a nine-year-old to help him talk to girls in person. This is another case of Chris being a hypocrite, as there are a number of things in Leviticus Chris doesn't follow.

Captain's Log, Stardate: March… 9th, 2009.
I am here just to, uh, remind everybody I am wearing my ring. And I want everybody to know that when I am wearing my ring, I am being most honest and upfront, just like I did when I wore my medallion. And incidentally, I'm working on another one. Hopefully, I'll have it coated in metal.
But also, on another note, I would like to, uh, state an obvious fact that has been revealed in the latest episode of Family Guy, and backs me up on the f—on the fact that… ho-mo-sex-u-al-i-ty-and-gay-ness is just plain wrong. And Stewie has quoted that—the Bible verse that has just—that basically says it in a nutshell. Leviticus: chapter 18, verse 22:
“Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable.”[1]
And to go on further, among the first number of verses:
“The Lord said to Boses, ‘Speak to the Israelites and say to them: “I am the Lord your God. You must not do as they do in Egypt, where you used to live, and you must… not do as they do in the land of Canaan, where I am bringing you. Do not follow their practices. You must obey my laws and be careful to follow my decrees. I am the Lord your God. Keep my decrees and laws, for the man who obeys them and will live by them. I am the Lord.”’”[2]
And majority of the laws is basically do not sleep with, uh, your relati—with your close relatives or the, uh, relation of those relatives. And, uh, because in the end, it just described here, uh... from, uh, 25, and so on.
“Even the land was defiled…”[3]
…among such things…
“…so, I punished it for its sin, and the land vomited out its inhabitants. But you must keep my decrees and my laws. The native-born and the aliens living among you must not do any of these detestable things…”[4]
Especially sleeping with a man as you would a woman... you homos.
Now, where was I? Oh, yeah...
“…for all these things were done by the people who lived in the land before you, and the land became defiled. And if you defile the land, it will vomit you out as it vomited out the nations that were before you. Everyone who does any of these detestable things… such persons must be cut off from their people. Keep my requirements, and do not follow any of the detestable customs that were practiced before you… came and- before you came, and do not defile yourselves with them. I am the Lord your God.”[5]
This was chapter 18 of Leviticus, in the Holy Bible. And verse 22.
[shakes head and shrugs] Sorry, homos… but I stand behind the truths of the Holy God and Lord. Thank you, and have a pleasant day.
[jump cut]
And, uh, also, just to add another note: I am also—uh, I have also stopped in trying to find true love and romance over the Internet, and have currently—I have currently at lea—or—and possibly temporarily ceased to—ceased talking from instant messages and the Mumble on the Internet. I've taken the first step into encouraging myself to actually talking to the women around here. And I quote the book that I have learned about from the John Tesh radio show, as well as my, uh, pastoral counselor: How to Talk to Girls by Alec Greven... a 9-year-old. You can find a video where he talks about his book on Amazon.com. Great book!
The only thing that I disagree about is the—is the fact that, uh... men are the magnets and the women, they are the metal. Because it can go either way. He just basically backs up to the fact that—ab—of us guys being the magnets—only on their brains! Only on the brains. Only if they're smart enough. I mean, not every man is smart! I'm not saying I'm dumb, or naïve. But not every man is smart. So... that's a false statement, Alec. But I commend you on the rest of your words, if you're listening to this, Alec.
Thank you. Have a pleasant day.
