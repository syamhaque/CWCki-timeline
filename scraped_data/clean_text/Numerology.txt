After having a dream about a golden disc, he talked about his and Praetor's interpretation of the dream with Kyle.[2] Kyle brings numerology into the conversation, talking with Chris about the number of pieces the disc had and its length. Chris also talks about numbers that are associated with the Chinese Zodiac. From this discussion, Chris predicted the 22nd or 23rd of October to be the day that the Dimensional Merge finally happens.
In a 28 May 2021 social media post, Chris talks to Don Lashomb about numerology while citing a passage from Warhol/Chris Chan. Chris believed that the passage he was citing was a reference to numerology, and also states that Bob was into numerology as well.[3]
In a response to a jail letter from Eels and the Egg-man, Chris talks about the qualities of the numbers 13 and 666, the former being deemed an unlucky number in most Western cultures and the latter being associated with Satanism.[4][5] Chris argues that these negative connotations are non existent, as the digits in 13 add up to 4[note 1], and that the repeating 6's in 666 are actually a message from the angels.[6] In another jail letter, Chris wrote a sort of equation in the header of the lined paper he was using, trying to make sense of the date 22 December 2021.[note 2][7]
Notes
↑ (1 + 3 = 4)
↑ The equation he wrote was 1+(2x5)+1=12=3, which appears to be based on the date being written as "12/22/2021", while arbitrarily ignoring the zero.
