================================================================================

"Boys Boys Boys" is the eleventh track from SPARKLE like you mean it: ROBEE'S BALLAD by Robee Sonee and the Tomgirls. The song is a cover of "Boys (Summertime Love)" by Italian 80s pop singer Sabrina Salerno, but Chris, being Chris, changes all instances of the word "boys" to "girls".
It should not be confused with the 12th track from the same album, also titled "Boys Boys Boys".
24 seconds into the track, there is a rather odd noise that does not belong to the original song...
