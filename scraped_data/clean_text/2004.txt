2004 is the year in which Chris turned 22 years old. This year saw Chris continuing his ongoing Love Quest, leading to the appearance of the first Sonichu's News Dash and its dissemination in Piedmont Virginia Community College. In turn, this also started his mythical feud with the college dean Mary Lee Walsh; Mary was worried about his practices disrupting school education and being little more than him attempting to solicit sex, but Chris was convinced she was refusing to let him find a true and honest sweetheart. Things reached a boiling point when Chris's stubborn refusal to dial back his attempts resulted in him getting arrested at and briefly banned from the local mall, and him getting suspended from college.
Things weren't all bad for Chris, though. Besides meeting Megan Schroeder in August, he took the newfound free time he had to his advantage, and at the end of this year started drawing Sonichu #0.
