The Chris Chan Conspiracy is a documentary film series created by TheGamerFromMars (real name: Arthur James McDaniel), a channel dedicated to covering strange individuals and odd phenomena. Chris, having gained his own cult following on the internet, was one of the most requested topics for TheGamerFromMars to cover, so he pulled out all the stops to make a four episode series with an approximate runtime of five hours. Despite the suggestion of the title, no conspiracy concerning Chris Chan is actually chattered about, and that choice of word is only there for alliterative purposes.
This documentary is more detailed than Sachumo's and covers a much greater period of time than that documentary, but it is less in‑depth and more succinct in comparison to Geno Samuel's documentary. The documentary makes use of several previously unseen interactions between TheGamerFromMars and Copitz with Chris at 14 Branchland Court, Ruckersville, and Charlottesville, which were filmed in December 2019, showcasing Chris's daily life and providing additional insight into his hobbies and public behavior, along with his descent into his delusions. Sections of Chris's life are depicted in the form of artwork resembling Chris's own.
A trailer for The Chris Chan Conspiracy was uploaded onto YouTube on 18 March 2022, and the series proper ran from 19 March 2022 to 9 April 2022, covering everything from how Chris's parents met to Chris being sent to a mental hospital.
In October 2023, TheGamerFromMars mentioned in a podcast that he was sending DMs to Chris, and that he had liked one of them.[1]
TheGamerFromMars met with Chris in March 2024 at the River Ridge Mall in Lynchburg, VA to record a segment for the fifth episode in the series, which premiered on 11 April 2025.[2] Notably, TheGamerFromMars communicated and collaborated with Praetor, receiving full exclusive access to the yet-to-be-released Goddess Logs (Chris's jail diary).

TheGamerFromMars is introduced to Chris. The crew first visit Chris's room, where he films an "intro". At Copitz's wish, they make their way to the gazebo, where they sit in the dark for a little while. They call it a day and awkwardly leave.

[Narrative intro]
1:27 – [Title card fade in: "The Chris Chan Conspiracy"]
[TheGamerFromMars walks to his car, then is shown driving]
TheGamerFromMars: So for years now people have been asking me to do a video talking about Chris Chan, and the problem is, I just never knew where to begin on the subject. So for the past month now, I've been trying to get in touch with Chris Chan in any way I could, uh, but after all that failed, I messaged Copitz, he responded right away and asked me if I wanted to do an interview with Chris Chan, and the answer to that was "absolutely yes", so within a few days I get a camera­man and I am heading down—couple hours—making a roadtrip out of it—to meet the notorious Chris Chan in person.
And this is the street. Is that it?
Cameraman: I… mean, that looks—
TheGamerFromMars: Sonichu! Look!
Cameraman: Sonichu…
TheGamerFromMars: Zoom in on the license plate.
Cameraman: Hold on… huh‐huh… see if I can get that.
[They exit the car.]
Chris: Hello!
Cameraman: Hello ! Hi!
[Hellish, still distant wailing from Snoopy and Clover. Worse is to come.]
Copitz: Hey guys! How's it going?
Cameraman: Hey! How are you?
Copitz: Art? Is that right?
TheGamerFromMars: How's it going?
Copitz: Nice to meet you.
Cameraman: I'm Jesse.
Copitz: Jesse, nice to meet you.
TheGamerFromMars: It's an honor to meet you!
Chris: Nice to meet you too.
Cameraman: Christine, hello. I'm Jesse, nice to meet you.
Chris: Yeah, Jesse.
Copitz: Alright, suppose we can go inside.
Cameraman: [mumbles] Okay.
Chris: [stutters] We're gonna do the interview downstairs.
Copitz: Yeah—
Cameraman: Okay. Ha-ha-ha.
[The dogs begin barking torturedly and torturously. Camera­man zooms in on license plate.]
[Everybody enters.]
Cameraman: Oh.
Chris: Go [?] down­stairs. [Goes upstairs]
Cameraman: Okay.
Chris: Snoopy, no! Quiet down, quiet down! Quiet! quiet! Alright, everybody's inside.
[The crew are taken aback by Chris's room.]
Cameraman: O-kay… [Films the walls. Copitz nods understandingly. Chris talks to the dogs in the background.] Alright, well… this is, uh… very nice! [Camera­man zooms in on the sheet of paper pictured above]
Copitz: Yes! [indistinct] uploaded…
TheGamerFromMars: Yes, this is the room where it was all made!
Cameraman: This is where it all…
TheGamerFromMars: Sonic‐chu!
Copitz: Those dogs are screaming bloody murder!
TheGamerFromMars: Yeah! [laughs]
Copitz: They calm down after a little bit some­times.
Cameraman: Yeah, yeah.
[Cut to Chris sitting on his bed.]
Chris: The thing— is that thing on right now?
Cameraman: Yeah, is that okay?
Chris: Oh. Yeah. Hello! Hello dear ip— hello dear YouTube and the Internet, all that! Hello! Hello. Hope y'all having a good day. There is your intro. Kinda.
Cameraman: Yeah. Kinda. [laughs]
Copitz: [laughs]
[Title card: "Episode 1: The Birth of Chris Chan"]
Cameraman: Good enough.
Chris: [sigh]
4:00 – [Middling narration of Chris's early life commences.]
53:36 – [Middling narration of Chris's early life stops at the creation of the Sonichu comic.]
Copitz: …feels good, feels good. Uh, is there—is there anything else, uh, what would you—what would you like to, I mean…
Chris: Uh…
Copitz: …I guess, like maybe wanna go to McDonald's or something like that, or we can hang out in the gazebo, maybe…
Chris: Uh… well it's dark out, now…
Copitz: It is.
Chris: …so, might not— not— be able to see the gazebo…
Copitz: That's true.
Chris: …but I can… point it out, it's, uh, you know, behind the house, and, you know where the pen is, the green of the fence right at the, that's, alongside the road there, and then—
Copitz: Uh, I haven't seen it.
Chris: Oof, anyway, you're driving down Westwood,…
Copitz: Right.
Chris: and you look to your right. You see, you will see a doghouse before you see… [dogs start making noise again] the… the, the, the pen—the gazebo's behind the doghouse.
Copitz: Gotcha, I gotcha. Okay.
[The two dogs bark deafeningly from the stairs. Chris talks inaudibly. Everybody exits. Cut to Chris holding a flash­light in the yard.]
Copitz: Here we go, I got the gazeb— and then I get the [in­audible]
TheGamerFromMars: Gazebo's over here.
Chris: Watch your step. This is your light source, I'm the light source.
Cameraman: Yes! [groan]
Copitz: Alright.
Chris: [inaudible]
TheGamerFromMars: It's a very low gazebo.
Copitz: Yeah, it is, ha ha.
Chris: You gotta watch your head if you're more than…
Copitz: So, I'm able to, I'm able to stand, barely, but… at five ten.
Chris: Ah… If you're Brad Garrett you'd have to hunch down.
Copitz: Ooh. Yeah…
Chris: 'Cause his height's more than six feet.
Cameraman: Yeah.
Copitz: [unintelligible]
Chris: Hm… yeah, watch your step.
Copitz: Thank you.
TheGamerFromMars: So, Christine, do any of your neighbors know about, uh, Chris Chan and every­thing that goes on online?
Chris: Uh. Among which, yes.
TheGamerFromMars: Have, uh, the trolls ever harassed them?
Chris: Hmmm… not that I'm aware of.
TheGamerFromMars: I see.
Chris: I pray they haven't!
TheGamerFromMars: Yeah.
Chris: Anyway, so… bye guys!
TheGamerFromMars: [gruntingly] Yeah.
Chris: Let you all… walk all back to your vehicles.
TheGamerFromMars: Sounds good!
Cameraman: Okay.
Chris: I'll walk y'all back to your auto­bots.

Analysis
The live‑action segments focus exclusively on Twilight Sparkle's Secret Shipfic Folder. In an arrange­ment remi­niscent of a child­hood sleep­over, Chris single‑mindedly forces his guests to play his autistic twist on an autistic game. After two awkward hours, Copitz manages to put an end to the agony by winning.
Transcription
0:00:00 – [Title card: "The Chris Chan Conspiracy"]
Chris: Uh, the ga— the pre‐existing games, it's, it's the same game—
Copitz: Mhm.
Chris: — but essentially we got a s— we're playing a Start card in a set [?], we're gonna—I'm gonna play my "house". It's—the Start card—
TheGamerFromMars: [laughs]
Chris: —is essentially the author or… center‐piece of the whole fanfiction. [cut to Chris reading off a card, laughing to himself] "Twilight Sparkle is Eque— is Equestria's most prolific (and horrific) fanfic author. She ships herself, her friends, and her family together, regardless of relation, orientation, or harmonious mane‐and‐coat color combination. In order to help fulfill Twilight's dream of writing the perfect fanfics, you take turns expanding the shipping grid, joining new Ponies with Ship cards. If you are the first to make one of Twilight's narrative goals a reality, you earn the points for that goal! Of course, you also earn the shame of enabling Twilight's horrible penchant of shipping her friends, but nobody's perfect. [shrill cackle]
Copitz: [mumbles politely]
[Shot of Chris's phone showing his custom Liquid Chris TSSSF card. Copitz imperceptibly says "thank you" to Chris or the camera­man.]
Chris: Also we want to achieve on the shipping grid, the which in this case we start off with fulfilling the prophecy [?], we ship uh… any Sonichu with the prime key­word with Chris Chan or Christine Chan, we get the, or, we get, three unicorn sh—ships on the gri—, unicorn on unicorn ships, so that's, you know, um…
[Another shot of a custom card on Chris's phone: Robertchu.]
Chris: There's my daddy!
TheGamerFromMars: What kind of, um, animal?
Chris: So— he's a Sonichu! [close cut] …you know, then each player gets… four ponies and three ships, that's their starting hand. [cut] [reading off materials] "Each player plays at least one card from their hand if the— into the turn… [cut] All Pony cards closely shipped—as in, you know, attached to the ships [Audio tracks of Chris start to overlap incomprehensibly in a torrent of words. Editing eventually stops in order to highlight Chris saying:] Ah, told you it gets crazy!
Copitz: Yeah…
[Title card: "Episode 2: The Rise of Chris Chan". "Eine Kleine Nachtmusik" starts playing.]
0:02:04 – [Narration resumes at the publication of Sonichu #0]
0:58:06 – [Narration stops at Chris Chan Update 21 October 2008]
Chris: [stress sigh]
TheGamerFromMars: Lots of cards.
Copitz: Mhm.
Chris: But… situationally… strategically, situationally… ah, that is why I have want to do some shipping breakups!
TheGamerFromMars: Are people able to bring their own decks into this game? [being talked over] people have this, decks… around?
Chris: Yeah… Mos—mostly, yeah, actually, yeah… yeah, I figured out a rule where, like, you know, you can have two completing— you can have one deck playing against the other. That's another— that's a set of rules I came up with and had this…
Copitz: You would think they would get mixed up too much.
Chris: Yeah… Alright…
Copitz: Are there any places around Charlottesville that, where you can play this game with people? Like in, in…
Chris: Yeah, like, yeah, the, the End Games one if, uh…
Copitz: Oh, okay, yeah, if you can get back in there, yeah.
Chris: Yeah…
[Camera­man or The­Gamer­From­Mars holds up a hand of cards with "Skylander Chris Chan" on top]
Chris: Ah, the Black Moon, um… On the Black Moon of Jakoba… is some autism!
Copitz: [taken aback] Oh… autism me!
Chris: Yeah.
Copitz: [clears throat] Oh!
TheGamerFromMars: Never heard of that one.
Copitz: That's something!
Chris: That's… Yeah, made up that me, just has gotta wear disfigured [?] face, but, simply, yeah…
TheGamerFromMars: Players allowed to trade cards in this game?
Chris: What?
TheGamerFromMars: Are we allowed trade cards?
Chris: Uh… Yeah, I do believe so, but mostly— buh— you don't have randomized booster packs or anything like that.
TheGamerFromMars: [losing patience] Like, during a game.
Chris: Oh— No. Ha ha—
TheGamerFromMars: Oh.
Copitz: Ha.
[Title card: "After 2 hours, I slipped a card to Copitz off‐camera that would allow him to win the game."]
Copitz: Okay.
Chris: So now you can actually add to that—
Copitz: Yeah, I'll put a ship.
Chris: And then, and then, points, you can also reconnect with the other Start card ships on the grid…
Copitz: I get ya, I see, I see. So I'll put a Ship here—
Chris: Yup!
Copitz: —facing east, and then I will place, I, I, I have this crazy card, "Skylander Chris Chan"— [black‐and‐white video of the card shown earlier]
Chris: Oh, yeah.
Copitz: —and that works out very very nicely.
Chris: Yes!
Copitz: Because what that gives me is two points, which is just what I need…
Chris: To win the game! [TheGamerFromMars claps once]
Copitz: The final, the final that I need, the final card…
Chris: You made the quick play!
Copitz: …right here, and that gives me an even eleven. [music swells]
Chris: Yip… Yaaay! "Crisco" has won the game!
[sickly clapping from all]

Analysis
Certainly the most eventful of the episodes, its two halves feature Chris in complementary, yet equally unusual dispositions.
The first half sees Chris stressedly struggling to accommodate a Tetris 99 session in his disaster of a room, culminating in an unexpected outburst.
Watching Chris struggle with uncooperative electronics, with a camera on him, in a space so cluttered as to give you sensory overload, with the deafening and constant braying of the tortured dogs, is an anxiety‐inducing experience. Chris's slip is therefore one of his most understandable, yet still manages to leave the viewer with a bitter taste. Indeed, the collected episodes of tard rage we've gotten from Chris have been directed at immaterial threats in the sole company of his camera; aggression in a social setting is actually quite unlike Chris, especially as of late with his cultivation of a superior, transcendent image.
Chris does have the social awareness to at least realize his mistake, and immediately tries to mend the situation by adopting a goofy tone. However, one gets the impression that his subsequent autistic stomping to shut the dogs up was conditioned by a "might as well" attitude after the cat was out of the bag.
The second half sees Chris in an entirely different disposition: freed from his house of horrors, he happily prances around Charlottesville's Downtown Mall. The crew enter an Indian restaurant, which sets off Chris's random access humor and prompts him to do an Apu impression. His companions hurriedly shush him. Besides this, Chris acts uncharacteristically well‐adjusted and makes small talk with the waiter. Outside, Chris is accosted by a female fan who asks for a picture.

Barbara: [off screen, upstairs, to the dogs which incessantly bark throughout the entirety of the video] Come 'ere.
Chris: [fiddling with electronics] …this gon' do, we'll [unintelligible]
TheGamerFromMars: Yeah, we're gonna some, some, some three‐player Tetris here… [TheGamerFromMars or the cameraman mumbles "okay"]
Chris: Aah, actually four‐player, I have—
Copitz: Ah— do— can, can you play it just three player, if Jesse's gonna be filming?
Chris: [perhaps a little irritated] Oh. Oh yes of course, we can play it three‐player. [someone "mhm"s]

[Shot of framed Son-Chu license plate]
Chris: [unintelligible] —find the— my mom's clapping up the dogs! Aaand everything's falling. Freaking gravity! It busts me, it confounds me! [squeak]
[Shot of the furniture the monitor is sitting on, cluttered with numerous My Little Pony figurines and a tiny picture of Bob in a paper frame drawn with hearts]
Chris: An organized chaos, this is my creative method, hah. Anyway, I— just gotta plug in my Switch dock, 'cause… I didn't have enough plugs left to do this, hm! [cut] Figure out how we can… [burping sound from someone] I got two pairs of Joy‑Cons, obviously, so… see if we can… play Tetris this way.
[Shot of a stack of Sonic, Super Smash Bros and Guitar Hero game cases. Dogs start howling. Tension mounts.]
TheGamerFromMars: [drowned out by hounds]
Copitz: Yeah.
Chris: I'm tryna set up here, see if we can all play with these… hm.
[Shot of the PSP of Fail on a cluttered piece of furniture, next to a figurine of Donald Duck. Tension is rising.]
Chris: [whispering] Joy‑Cons… [unintelligible] we're gonna finally… [Barb says something to the dogs. Camera pans to an uncomfortable TheGamerFromMars.] regular basic controller I have. [slurred, unintelligible] I— ah…
[Shot of a shelf full of game cases]
TheGamerFromMars: [with Chris going on in the background] …really need to find that controller?
Copitz: GameCube adapter maybe?
TheGamerFromMars: Yeah!
Chris: It's all I've got [raises voice] No, no, we don't have GameCube.
Copitz: But the, but the Pro Controller?
Chris: No, no, I don't have an adapter for GameCube!
Copitz: [taken aback] Do… do, do you have the Pro Controller?… [pan to TheGamerFromMars's "told you so" expression]
Chris: [realizing he'd messed up, taking on an amiable tone] I have a Pro Controller, I just don't know where it is right now. [cut] [unintelligible] The dogs are barking, they're driving me bonkers. Uh! It's definitely not— defilly… does not get boring around here.
[Cut to Chris rummaging through heaps of miscellanea on the table with the visitors mumbling indistinctly. Something tumbles. He pauses in defeat, adjusts his glasses, belatedly stress sighs and wipes his forehead]
[Shot of TheGamerFromMars holding a latter-day version of Chris's business card, with Chris's info blurred]
Chris: It does not focus right now, got the… [drowned out by barking] [cut] Ah, here, I'm gonna try an Xbox controller, see if I can plug it into a USB port, see if that'll work. [cut] Plug this into the puss [?]…
Copitz: Alright… Now let's see! A Microsoft controller is compatible with a Nintendo system, it's the moment of truth.
[Chris is fiddling with buttons during a brief respite from barking]
Copitz: No.
Chris: No! [cut] DOGS,
SHUT UP!
YOU DO THAT ONE MORE TIME, I'M GONNA BE LIKE "wawawawawa"! [cut]
TheGamerFromMars: Let's just make the [?] find the controller.
Chris: Ap!
Copitz: Yeah.
Chris: Ap!
Copitz: Alright.
Chris: Ap! Ap! Aah! [triumphantly holds the controller while the visitors applaud]
TheGamerFromMars: Alright.
Cameraman: Ayy.
Chris: Phew.
Copitz: Right when you said that.
Chris: I just need to turn…
TheGamerFromMars: There's no batteries.
Chris: …on. It has batteries, I was just gonna turn it on. [clasps the battery door] [cut]
Copitz: [to TheGamerFromMars] No, yeah, I understand, yeah.
Chris: Ugh, IF THOSE
DOGS DON'T SHUT UP
I'm gonna BARK my head off! [cut to Chris stomping his feet on the staircase]

Chris: Yip! Got their attention with… stompitude. Phew. Alright. [cut to Chris, Copitz and TheGamerFromMars ready to play Tetris]
TheGamerFromMars: I'll go ahead and do the intro, I suppose.
Copitz: [YouTuber voice activated. Chris talking indistinctly about the game in the background.] Hey guys, it's Copitz, I'm here with Christine Weston Chandler and TheGamerFromMars, or Art. Today we're going to be playing some Tetris 99.

East Main Street due west, at the intersection with Heather Heyer Way, coordinates 38°01′48.6″N 78°28′45.7″W.]
Copitz: Do you like Indian food?
TheGamerFromMars: Yeah sure!
Chris: Oh yeah, Indian— I could go for Indian at times.
Copitz: "Taste of India", this is one of my favourite places. [Shot of restaurant signage]
Chris: [going downstairs, in a sing-songy voice] Oh! Taste of India!
[cut to everyone standing inside]
Chris: Mmm, it smells good in here.
Cameraman: I mean, it's—
Copitz: [indistinct] I'll ask.
Cameraman: It's pretty empty.
Chris: [energetically] Oh boy, I'm gonna— okay, now I just— I just feel like I have to do this, first time in here, feel like I got to do this: "Hello, my name is Apu! I want to do—"
Copitz: No, no, no, no, no, we don't have to do that.
Chris: [somewhat embarrassedly yet unrepentantly putting hand in front of mouth and chuckling]
Copitz: That's alright.
Chris: "Welcome to Kwik‑E‑Mart!"
Copitz: [to waitstaff] Hello.
TheGamerFromMars: Hello.
[cut to Chris at table]
Chris: [polite, in total contrast to his previous demeanor] First time coming here, this is a lovely place, I'm surprised— I mean, I walked the mall many, many times and didn't think of coming in here. [shyly looking at his attendants] Feels really good, smells good!
TheGamerFromMars: So you like Indian food?
Chris: Ah, I'm open— I— I keep an open mind for all kinds of foods, so… I mean, if there's something I don't like, then, well, at least I've tried it once. [Way to go, Chris!] [cut] Yeah, and I'd definitely be open‐minded for trying some [adopts Scottish accent] haggis if I ever go viti— visit Scotland or something! Ha ha ha!
Copitz: What is haggis?
Chris: Sheep guts! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Copitz: Oh!
[cut to Chris flipping through a MLP comic book from a shelf of kids' books]
[Everybody is outside now.]
Chris: [pointing a sign for a shop called "O'Suzannah for Littles"] I never noticed this, but [singing uncharacteristically tunefully] "Oh! Susanna, now don't you cry for me, I come from Alabama with the banjo on my knee, twang twang twang twang twang twang twang twang!" [cut]
Female Fan: Oh 'scuse me, is it possible that we can get a picture? You're the author of Sonichu, right?
Chris:
YES!
Female Fan: Yeah! Can we get a picture?
Chris: Yes!
Copitz: Do you want me to take it for you guys?
Female Fan: Yeah! That'd be great. Thank you so much. I couldn't believe that I saw you, and I was like…
Copitz: It's awesome.
Chris: Yes, hello! [embraces three fans]
Female Fan: [chuckles]
Copitz: There you go.
Female Fan: Thank you so much, it is great to meet you!
Chris: Nice to meet you too!
Male Fan: Nice to meet you too!
Chris: Thank you!
Female Fan: Have a good day!
Chris: Take care! [walks away] [to the crew] It doesn't— it doesn't happen often, but when it does, it's very humbling.
Copitz: Yeah, I've never… [trails off]
Cameraman: So you don't get people coming up to you too often?
Chris: Hmm, I say, on average, probably once or twice a month.
Cameraman: Okay.
Chris: But it's, it's very humbling and good when it happens.
Cameraman: Yeah, happens.
[cut to Chris & Co. walking on East Main Street due east after the intersection with First Street, coordinates 38°01′50.5″N, 78°28′52.7″W]
Chris: But anyway, that was one side of the park with the statue, we come on the other side of the park and the, in the side of the street, where the library is at, right there.
Copitz: Right.
Chris: [possibly to the tune of "I'm Walkin' " by Fats Domino] And I'm walkin', into the "Love".
Copitz: Oh yeah.
[cut to Chris behind the "O" of a giant "LOVE" in the square at the intersection of East Main Street and Second Street, 38°01′50.2″N, 78°28′50.0″W]
Chris: Feels good, send 'er [?] in.
Cameraman: [apathetically] Yeah.
Chris: Send 'er in and I'll do my thing.
Cameraman: Alright.
Chris: [imitating Porky Pig, a character who, at the end of Loony Tunes cartoons, bids the viewer farewell] "Th-Th-The, Th-Th-The, Th-Th... That's all, folks!"

Episode 5: The Resurrection of Chris Chan
This article is still yet to be completed due to stress. We get a lot of stressful torture in our lives that makes us crash into slumber. Given that inspiration is a big variable, and we may have been lacking of it, this article will be completed as soon as possible, at our own pace... HONEST!
Background
The meeting, photographed by an onlooker before its release.
On 9 April 2024 TheGamerFromMars appeared on episode 122 of Some Ordinary Podcast. TheGamerFromMars confirmed that he had met with Chris the month prior to work on part 5 to The Chris Chan Conspiracy series. He also revealed that SomeOrdinaryGamers was originally going to come with him to meet Chris, but couldn't make it due to scheduling conflicts. He claimed that Chris made both of them custom medallions. TheGamerFromMars said that Chris was more "mentally with it" and was better at not oversharing compared to the previous time they had met at the end of 2019. He also said that Chris visits Barbara about once a month. TheGamerFromMars tried to go visit her with Chris, but couldn't due to the timing of the visit not working out. He mentioned that he briefly spoke with "a team that runs all the financials" and called them a "solid group of people," as well as saying they seemed "pretty well-intentioned."

[Narrative intro]
1:34 – [Title card: "The Resurrection Of Chris Chan", then "March 2024" fades in]
[TheGamerFromMars drives his car, then that footage's audio plays over footage of him entering the River Ridge Mall and meeting Chris there]
TheGamerFromMars: It's been four and a half years since I originally met Chris Chan. It's my first time back in Virginia since then as well. It's crazy to think that an entire pandemic came and went. So it's going to be interesting to see what happens. I actually am quite nervous. It just feels like a rollercoaster, like we're- we're reaching the top of the tallest elevation... and, uh, once we meet Christine we're gonna go for a ride.
[TheGamerFromMars and his cameraman are sitting and eating Chick-fil-A with Chris at the mall]
TheGamerFromMars: Well, it's nice to see you again, Chris- Chan, Christine, uhh...
Chris: Yeah.
TheGamerFromMars: What's your current, like, title?
Chris: Yeah, I prefer to go by Christ Chan these days, or Christ-ine.
TheGamerFromMars: Okay, sounds good.
[Chris prepares to gift him a packaged Megastone Medallion, which TheGamerFromMars opens]
TheGamerFromMars: So you have something for me?
Chris: Yeah! Yeah, I gave you one of the special ones that has the, uh- flip it over.
TheGamerFromMars: Is this an eyeball?
Chris: No. [chuckles] Essentially, it's a megastone, but really it's a horosphere quartz. Very, very blessed and definitely so.
TheGamerFromMars: Right- Thank you very much, I appreciate it. This is awesome!
Chris: You know why they call it 'Chicken Soup for the Soul'?
TheGamerFromMars: Why?
Chris: Because chicken soup is neutrally- is a neutral good healing. I'm multi-religious. I mean, physically, I actually am point f- about .01% Ashkenazi Jewish as proven by 23andMe. I- My apologies for, uh, not being specific on the name but my conscious memory—you can only take in so much at a time. Cuz I'm literally connected with the Akashic records and everything that is, and was, and will be. I'm connected with the literal- literal core and matrix of this universe as depicted, [???] universe by that- eye-looking thing with a star- with a star gem in the middle. I, uh, foreknew what was gonna happen, but then it... did happen—I was put into jail, accused of all those of which I was wrongfully false witness for... which obviously not- I mean, shoot. Even when you're conversing with one another, you're Soul Bonding that way. But, if you're feeling any doubt—because demons stem from doubt—if you have any doubt, those demons are gonna come right into you and just affect your mind- your mindset and thinking!
TheGamerFromMars: That was- that was quite the- quite the s- uh, uh, amount of information to comprehend.
Chris: Yeah, it is. But, uh, yeah, I do have a few friends I talk with about that. And, uh, definitely gonna plug this in- So I started doing, uh, me versus AI, in the regards of a "SingStar" competition. [A little bit better?] hey, versus a computer that can replicate singing and voicing in a way- but hey, that AI cannot adjust the pitch all the way from the nose down to the deep, deep base of the throat. [loud siren-like wailing] And they teach you that in- in voice acting and singing classes.
TheGamerFromMars: I don't think I've ever known that before.
4:33 – [Middling narration of events centered around the time of Chris's 2021 arrest commences.]
20:16 – [Middling narration stops at the mention of Randy Stair and WCT.]
[TheGamerFromMars drives his car, then that footage's audio plays over footage of him walking with Chris at the Riverfront Park in Lynchburg, Virginia]
TheGamerFromMars: -st, uh, now we are headed over to a park of some sort, so we're just following the car that says "Sonichu" on it.
Oh, jeez.
Chris: I got two-
TheGamerFromMars: You got two phones!
Chris: I got two phones! One for the trolls, and one for my homes! I got two phones! One for the bullies, and one for my friends. You think I need two phones? I'm so popular! Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring!
TheGamerFromMars: Very good.
Chris: You're feeling this right now. You're gonna feel my energy, and I'm gonna feel your energy.
TheGamerFromMars: Are you able to heal people through touch still?
Chris: Yeah, just like, uh, I was able to do with your cameraman earlier.
[Video cuts to a brief clip of them at the mall]
Chris: I'm gonna just temporarily shift you into the red.
Cameraman: Okay.
Chris: You feel a sting?
Cameraman: A little bit.
[Brief clip ends, video resumes to the park]
Chris: As far as everybody knows, I'm living there by myself. I'm taking care of the bills and everything. Let's just say I do have somebody that handle- that helps me with the tax details, but aside from that, I'm decent. I'm good.
TheGamerFromMars: So how- how was your experience in jail for all that time?
Chris: Very meditative. I was really able to just disconnect from the technology and Internet and whatnot during the time. Really found myself, and that's the thing on developing your personal maturity. You s- you soul search.
TheGamerFromMars: So, a question that I had is, um, you know, you got out on bail. Were you able to get out on bail at any time if someone bailed you out?
Chris: I'm not sure... I don't think that w- I- if I remember correctly, I don't believe that was an option... or, yeah- This is obviously circumstance, didn't really have anybody at the time, yada, yada, yada. Yeah, obviously I'm using a Seinfeld reference! Yada, yada, yada! So here's my paraphrasing from the first Sonic movie: So, as I crash into the cold, dark waters of the Atlantic, I realized a few things. A: I know where I'm going, but I only have some idea of how to get there. B: Salt water stings, but I can swim! And C: I shouldn't even be here right now, but I am. Why? Because they betrayed me! THEY BETRAYED ME! And I still don't know whether or not- who was the better kister- Josh- miss better kisser- Josh Moon or Judas Iscariot?
TheGamerFromMars: You- I know you have said that Josh Moon is a reincarnation of Judas. Do you still stand by that?
Chris: Uh, I think I did not say it was a reincarnation of Judas, I just- I just like, you know, the comparison.
TheGamerFromMars: Okay, sounds good.
Chris: But anyway...
TheGamerFromMars: When- when did you end up getting back in touch with her? Were you allowed to right after you got out of, uh, jail?
Chris: Yeah. Yeah, obviously, uh, yes. After that.
TheGamerFromMars: The charges were dropped.
Chris: Yes. And to make this clear, I never ever wished for Barbara's death. I never ever did that, I was making it on the general preliminary line, on, like, you know, either during the near future or just like years in the future when that would happen with Barbara. But I never ever wished for it, period.
TheGamerFromMars: You say in this timeline, the, you know, what you were arrested for, um, didn't happen. On another timeline, did it happen?
Chris: That would be a remotely distant one, [stuttering] the fact that- it came about from the manifestation from Bella's mind when she came up with that roleplay fanfiction for one thing. And also, that was among the shipping fanfics from among the, uh- among the mixed fans I have. It came out even years before that.
TheGamerFromMars: So there is a timeline but you've never been on that timeline before?
Chris: That's right. We were never on that timeline.
TheGamerFromMars: Okay, just making sure. A lot of people have that question of like, if the timeline ever merged to this during the interdimensional merge, or something along those lines.
Chris: Yeah, obviously, you know, as you can look up online, and ask any psychic, the timeline does shift here around- here and there, sometimes crossing into other timelines, but it did not cross into that. And just- the only way it did- it is- the only way it did that, it was through Bella. At that point.
23:33 – [Middling narration of events centered around Chris's stay in jail and the Goddess Log commences.]
36:15 – [Middling narration stops at the mention of Isabella Janke.]
[TheGamerFromMars talks to the camera in an Airbnb, then that footage's audio plays over footage of him opening the door for Chris to enter]
TheGamerFromMars: So right now, uh, we're going to have Christine over to our Airbnb. We tried to get access to her apartment, but she didn't feel comfortable with us going over there currently. We also tried to see if we could go and do a road trip to see Barb, but, uh, she didn't seem against it, but she didn't want to do it right now. So, I dunno, maybe some other time. But it's clear she still has access to Barb. So, yeah, we'll- we'll hang out here and, uh, I dunno, just do a couple of activities, hang out, maybe cook a bit, maybe draw a bit, and, uh, see where the day takes us.
Hello, Christine! Come right in!
Chris: Yeah. Hey! Hey, viewers at home! [Video cuts to Chris looking out the balcony] That's a great view! [yodeling noises, then the video cuts to Chris and TheGamerFromMars at a table]
TheGamerFromMars: So, let's see what- what do you wanna draw today?
Chris: [sigh] I figured I'd just keep it simple, I'm gonna do a simple Sonichu and Ro- Sonichu and Rosie drawing. [Chris covers his mouth to burp] Pardon me.
TheGamerFromMars: How many drawings of Sonichu do you think you have done at this point?
What Chris ended up drawing. TheGamerFromMars presumably kept it.
Chris: Quite the massive number. You buy something off Etsy, you're not exactly gonna get the same quality twice. There's- there's bound to be an error or two along the way.
TheGamerFromMars: So what percentage of your day is, uh, working on the Etsy store and doing the commissions?
Chris: Decent amount. There's outsourcing, of course. Sheesh, I made Sonichu a little gruff looking, even from the side view.
TheGamerFromMars: What's still at the old house of yours? Do you still have any of the- the old collections?
Chris: Uh, a bunch of the old collections, yes.
TheGamerFromMars: When was the last time you were there visiting Barb?
Chris: Um, actually earlier this month. I'm vi- I visit- I'm visiting- I visit once a month these days.
TheGamerFromMars: So what if someone wanted a Pickle Rick in a picture like this? How much extra would that cost as a commission?
Chris: Can't put Pickle Rick in a drawing like this. It don't work.
TheGamerFromMars: What if someone, like, wanted to pay a lot of money to make it happen though? Is there- is there a price or do you just have the artistic merit? Where you'll- you'll never do it for a million dollars.
Chris: Merit. [Chris gives the drawing to TheGamerFromMars] There you are, with my compliments.
TheGamerFromMars: Thank you very much! So, you talked a bit about Andy Warhol. Do you think you're better than him? Or on the same level? What do you feel?
Chris: I'd say decently on the same level, though more socially outgoing.
TheGamerFromMars: Do you have limits of what you'll draw?
Chris: Yes, I do have my boundaries. Definitely nothing NSFW and no gore. I mean, just rule of thumb, if it cannot be aired on Nickelodeon or Cartoon Network, no.
TheGamerFromMars: What about Adult Swim?
Chris: Uh, Adult Swim don't count in that.
TheGamerFromMars: Okay.
38:27 – [Middling narration of events centered around Chris's final months in jail and his return to the Internet commences.]
1:00:23 – [Middling narration stops at the mention of Geno Samuel selling Chris-themed merchandise against his wishes.]
