[Chris makes some random sound effects while holding the KCWC advertisement from Sonichu 8]
[normal voice] Yes. Yes yes. Yes, what is it?
[starts with a squeaky voice, but quickly returns to normal] A man wants to know what to do for info-mation. Why call us, it's on the dial: information. You heard him. Ba-dum-ba-dum--quiet, we're on the air.
[pause, then a lame imitation of the NBC chimes] Boop!
[creepily] Hello, everyboooody. We just brought the moon over the mountain.
[squeaky and nigh-indiscernible] Hello ma, hello pa. You've brought mature faith. I good like that. Now for a little ice--[interrupting himself] quiet.
[gay voice] Dis broadcast is being brought to you by the courtesy of Brighto, in 6 delicious flavors: chocolate, vanilla, cranberry, strawberry, and raspberry. [Yes, that was only five.] WAKOW! It's still raspberry. Ehhhhh. Oh no! [whooping noise] Now get quiet or I'll sack you again. Are you listening? V-v-v-voom, v-v-v-voom. [drunkenly] Eh, gedatta here.
Now don't go away ladies and gentlemen. We will soon be with you. Zheeem! Boom. Cuckoo! [whispers, barely audibly] Da orrist.
[another lame imitation of the NBC chimes] Boop!
[crappy opening tune, sings] Ba ba ba bum, ba ba ba bum, it's time to open up that radio station. It's that cool radio station. Here it is, station KCWC. And here is your hoooost with the moooost, Jamsta Sonichu! [to the tune of "Shave and a Haircut"] Ba-ba-ba-bum-bum, ba-bum!
Good evening-good orning guys, gals, dudes of all ages. This is your host, Jamsta Sonichu. Everybody he-here everybody heh. Station KCWC, with my co-host Lolisa Rosechu. But for the moment we will be taking you live to Christian Chandler's bedroom. Take it away, Mr. C.
[Jump cut to Chris sitting on his bed]
Thank you Jamsta. Yes, this is [takes off glasses] Christian Weston Chandler, birth name Christopher. Born on February 24, 1982. Ri--coming to you live from the house in Ruckersville, Virginia, that reaches from the beaches to the shore. Everdear on everythang KCWC. And today we will be offering a special dedication. It's our top ten dedications to some of the young, inspiring people out there. Uh, even some that may have passed away unfortunately, God rest in peace for those individuals. But anyway, we will be doing our top 10 dedications.
Originally for #10 we were going to do "Drops of Jupiter" from T-uh, from uh..."Drops of Jupiter" from Train, I think it was, for this individual named Max Molvanîa. [Suddenly angry] But you know what this son of a bitch conned me out of Disgaea 3, Street Fighter 4, and Burnout Paradise full game, DLC, between those first two games and whatnot, from the PlayStation Network, as stored from me in the first place so [raspberry] to him...and also impersonated the woman that I th-d-thought for a long time the person was.
Anyway, so instead, we will be doing th-our-for our #10, as for our first inspirational song, we will be doing this dedication for all upcoming young artists of, uh, hand-drawing speculations [makes gesture in the air] or handcrafting or whatever. [Touches medallion] Handcraft. Anyway. Anyway, we will be doing, this is for, like, you know, for all them, as well as any individuals, within any schools - every single school - who I know gets bullied or tortured nadata, as well as those on the internet who get bullied and tortured by the dang internet bullies and trolls. Dis song is for y'all. It's "Dare" from Stan Bush.
[Jump cut to Optimus Prime toy as "Dare" plays in bad quality. A black wire is lifted past the screen about halfway through for...no discernible reason. Also, we now see where Chris' glasses get thrown to, which is important]
[Jump cut back to Chris. He takes off his glasses]
Ah, yes, Mr. Stan Bush with an inspirational word for us never to let our dreams die. The power's at our command. [Holds up his hand] We hold the future in our hands [points to head] the little voice inside us tellises it's the last round, but we press on anyway.
Anyway, before we move on to song #9, we have to take a brief break...for to let the commercials air. First, the word from our sponsor, the I Love Lucy show. We love you Lucy O'Ball.
[Holds up KCWC advertisement again. Talks in a falsetto] Hello friends, I'm da Vitameatavegimin[1] girl. Hey ta, run down lislis. Do you wayla parties? Are you popular? Get ya all da brothels in this little bottle. Vitameatavegimin. Vitameatavegimin contains vitamins, meat, veg-et-ables and minerals. Yes, with Vitameatavegimin, you can spoon your way to health.

And! Welcome back to station K-C-W-C! We are the main station of the city of Cwcville, Virginia, reachin' da beaches! We are live and raring to keep on trackin' with everything. During dedications, I'd like to take one brief, brief moment to make a dedication to Mr. R.L. Stine, [holds up The Haunted Mask, turning his head briefly to his right as if to read off a cue card] author of Goosebumps, [pauses, then holds up two Fear Street novels, turning his head again briefly to the right] and the Fear Streets. Thank you mister R.L. Stine, you were an [salutes] inspiration to me through high school. Gave me a few frights as well.
And also thanks to Sarah Bevel, my- one of my high school gal-pals, who gave me a couple of S--your Senior books...uh, I have the other one, but I found this one, but, still good to go.
Anyway, coming in at, uh, #9, we are doing a distance dedication...well, not so distant, 'cause he lives near sa- near the city of Ruckersville or Charlottesville... uh, Dyke, I believe it was. Anyway, we are puttin' out a dedication to Joshua Martinez, followed by one for Vanessa Anne Hudgens. Hey, don't believe his pictures, all the ladies he has on his iPhone: they're from people's Mysp- spaces that he dun even know, so he's lyin' through his ass and I bet he was lyin' through his ass when-when he told, when, uh, he told me I was talking to Vanessa Hudgens the whole time, uh, even though i-- even though it would have been nice gal-pal and I should have been talkin' to her for REAL, but, but nonetheless, his screenname was used for it every time I talked to supposedly her, if I was him the whole time, whatta dang dirty liar! I don't care if the trolls troll HIM!
Anyway, our next song is "No Tengo Dinero" from Los Umbrellos and, by the way, another lie he told me: I checked. [pauses] Vanessa Hudgens was never in Los Umbrellos. So anyway, come in #10, "No Tengo Dinero," followed by, number, I mean, #9 was "No Tengo Dinero", followed by #8, "Sneakernight". Thank you, Vanessa, if I had actually been talkin' to you.
["No Tengo Dinero" by Los Umbrellos plays, followed by "Sneakernight" by Vanessa Hudgens. Chris has the cover of the Dreamcast title Samba De Amigo in front of the camera. Video ends just as "Sneakernight" ends. Note that the video linked does not contain these songs due to copyright.]

[Jump cut to Chris sitting on his bed, wearing a blue vest and what is presumably his original Wolf Scout bandanna he has held onto since he was around 7. He turns to face the camera.]
