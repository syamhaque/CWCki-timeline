Chris in November 2015.
The post in question.
November was the 11th month of 2015. It was the first full-month following the start of Chris's probation. This month also marks Chris's full transition back to his old self, as seen in the numerous videos he released in which he can be seen to be visibly angry and passive-aggressive. Aside from that, Chris spent most of the month mostly promoting his Sonichu Amiibos, annoying his half-siblings on social media, and having a back and forth with a troll called Francine.
Events of November
1 November - Chris uploads HelloLadyFans to Youtube, a bizarre video in which he tries to entice boyfriend free girls into a relationship by talking about sex while creepily staring into the camera after taking a shower.
2 November - Chris offers a three-piece set of Amiibo on Etsy: "Pre-2011 Christian Weston Chandler," "Post-2011 Christine Weston Chandler," and Chris-chan Sonichu.
3 November - Chris provides a link to his new video on Facebook, and adds a photo request both there and on YouTube.
10 November
Chris uploads Family Needs to appreciate Family, a video wherein Chris half-heartedly attempts to guilt trip his half-brothers Cole Smithey and David Chandler, and his half-sister Carol Chandler, into contacting Barbara by playing a match of Super Smash Brothers.
Chris announces on Facebook that he has made three custom Jerkop Amiibos that vaguely resemble the three family members above. Chris tags all three of their Facebook accounts.
11 November
Chris uploads Sonichu and Rosechu figure collection toy battle! to YouTube. He films himself playing with his Amiibos while occasionally ranting about his estranged half-siblings. He also provides a link on Facebook, advertising his Amiibos.
A picture of 14 Branchland Court dating back to June 2015 found on Bing Maps is leaked onto the CWCki Forums.
12 November - Donation Options Reviewed. is uploaded to Youtube. Chris spends most of the video talking about the rewards that will be given to anybody who donates money to him.
15 November
Chris makes a tasteless post on Facebook about the at the time recent terrorist attacks in Paris, comparing them to battles between heroes and villains in children's cartoons. The post in question is also a shining example of how no matter what happens, Chris simply can't resist putting Sonichu and Rosechu into everything he does.
Despite having no allegations to the contrary, and the utter obviousness of this being the case, Chris uploads a short Youtube video stating that the CwcvilleGuardian is in fact owned by him.
Chris uploads Black Friday Bonuses from Cwcville Shopping to Youtube, a video where he promotes his Etsy shop by offering Black Friday deals on his Sonichu merchandise.
16 November - Chris makes a Facebook post about Alec Benson Leary stating that Sonichu is, was, and always will be in ownership of Chris.
17 November - Chris uploads a video entitled Doxing Jeff/Francine, wherein he attempts to dox somebody for the first time in years. This time, the target is one "Francine", a troll who was making a fangame about Chris, and selling unofficial Sonichu merchandise, much to Chris's displeasure. It's also worth noting that Chris sneered at Francine multiple times for being transgender in this video.
19 November
Chris uploads a follow-up to his last video, this time imploring gaming companies to pick up his idea for a Sonichu video game. It's also worth noting that Chris inadvertently doxes himself once again by showing his uncensored drivers license as a way to prove he is the real Chris and that Francine is a fraud.
Chris uploads another video reaffirming his identity as the real Chris, and encourages viewers to boycott Francine by attempting to reveal unflattering details about her. Chris once again makes transphobic comments directed towards Francine throughout the entire video.
20 November - Chris uploads a video of himself reading aloud a list of unrealistic demands sent by Francine, completely misinterpreting the sarcastic tone of the list.
24 November - Chris makes a post on Facebook ranting about the trolls on Facebook.
25 November
Chris announces on Facebook that he has gotten a new cat, Pollo.
Chris uploads another gameplay video of Super Smash Bros in order to promote his Etsy shop.
Chris uploads a slightly altered version of his Black Friday Bonuses video from the 15th.
26 November - Thanksgiving Day.
27 November - Black Friday, and the start of the Christmas retail season in America. Chris promised on the 15th that he would provide some deals on his products for this date.
29 November - Chris releases three new videos to Youtube. One about a Sonichu television jingle, one about the Sonichu Amiibos, and the last one being about a supposed "embargo" on several retail chains such as GameStop, Best Buy, and Simon Shopping Malls. The third video was likely created because of Chris being banned from multiple local retailers for attempting to shoplift and illegally macing a GameStop employee.
30 November - A photo of a piece of paper lying on Chris's bed is uploaded to Facebook. Chris compares its resemblance to a stray cat as "a fun[ny] visual" and a "fun laugh".
