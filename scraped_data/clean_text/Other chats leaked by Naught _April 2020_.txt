Chris (as Sonichu)
This song was in my Senpai's movie while he was in his Speed Force.
Yes, Sonic was not only my friend, but also my teacher.
It's on Digital now; go for it in a Stream or Download.
Ditto.
Especially since even thought it is downloaded onto Mama's laptop now, it gives off a video lag for some reason.
Something in the video quality settings that I've tried to troubleshoot, but remain unable to remedy.
Blu-Ray/DVD Combo Pack, please.
Senpai is Soo Awesome!
Remember with who you are talking.
This may be the body of Chris Chan, but the soul inside is Sonichu (Prime).
Anyway...
I'll answer for both of us.
Mama's earliest memory of Sonic was when she used to play Sonic 1 on the demo Genesis in Sears at Fashion Square, a Lot, in 1990.
As for me, I still remember that collision with me at Station Square back in 2003, and that I helped him then.
And, it was not until about months later, about October of 2003, after Kel, Rosey and I returned to Cwcville for Rosey and I to stay, after Kel ventured Johto and beat their Elite Four, and Rosey was further trained and found better practice with her new electrical powers.
When I met Sonic after Blake had kidnapped Rosey from me for Giovanni, Eggman and Skysoar. After Sonic and I rescued her that day, I asked him if he could help me better refine my skills.
He stuck around and showed me parkour, break dancing and some of his other Mach-Speed tricks and skills.
And, of course, the times when he and I took on Eggman together.
Also, Senpai did actually hit on me a few times.
He is bisexual.
I did not let the awkwardness ruin our ship as Senpai/Student and friends.
Good times, to say the least. I do not like to be called Prime; Optimus is a Prime.
I'm just the very first Sonichu; the Prime of all of them in existence.
I prefer to be called Sonichu, please. I only note that I am a Prime, in parenthesis, just to differentiate me from the other ones. I did consider choosing a nickname for myself, but I realized that would be a hassle for me to readjust.
Even tried it for a while.
That was the Short Story of the one and only Sonichu (Prime) and his "Zappy" trial back in August, 2004.
Even I ended up getting sick and tired of being called "Zappy".
So, I stick with "Sonichu", because I did end up dubbing myself after taking down Chaos, after hearing Sonic being cheered on, and kind of a literal fated and subconscious(?) thing as well. Yeah, and yet my Clone that Giovanni has successfully created within the past year is named Zappy.
Rosey helped me with that phrase.
