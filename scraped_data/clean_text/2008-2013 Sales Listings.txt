Somebody gave him 30 dollars for this. No, we don't understand either.
Chris has a long, if not terribly successful, career selling things on eBay. This list attempts to catalog as many of his sales as possible from 2008 to 2013, based on data hacked out of his e-mail accounts by Clyde Cash and others.
Most of what Chris sold is the sort of thing you would expect him to sell: old toys, old games, old electronics, Transformers crap and so forth. He also auctioned off a few antiques and knick-knacks, suggesting that his parents had him hock some of the junk cluttering up their house. (Alternatively, Chris might have nicked a couple of items off the top of his folks' enormous piles of garbage and tried to make money off them on his own.)
Chris employs a dogged selling strategy, relisting his items over and over and over, sometimes for as long as several months, regardless of whether they show any signs of selling at the listed price. While some of his items eventually sold this way for fairly decent money, others never did (like the George Bush bobblehead he tried and failed to sell for almost five months) and Chris racked up an impressive tab for listing fees in the process.
It seems as if Chris's items began to sell with greater frequency towards the end of 2008, but it's entirely possible that this is evidence of trolls at work sabotaging his auctions.
Unsurprisingly, Chris is known to exaggerate the quality of his auctions (or to leave out important information unless prompted). A number of Chris's video game and "track pack" auctions were sold in eBay auctions... and Chris conveniently forgot to mention that the codes accompanying each disc were used and therefore useless (rendering the game far less valuable). More of Chris's classic "cleverness" at work.
Interestingly, Chris listed four Xbox games for sale on eBay, suggesting that his hatred for da HEX-Box came later.
