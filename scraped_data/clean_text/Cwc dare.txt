================================================================================

"Cwc dare" is a video that was uploaded on 24 July 2009. The video consists of Chris, having recovered from being forced to sing a tongue-in-cheek gay acceptance anthem a mere hour earlier, singing Stan Bush's "Dare" from the original animated Transformers movie, while sitting on his bed. He appears to not have changed his clothes for a while.
The Gitar of Fail is also present as well as several recycled Sonichu images, proving that he hasn't drawn anything new in quite some time. The most jaw-dropping moment comes at 1:58, when Chris turns into Rosechu. How that got past Chris's bullet-proof efforts to guard his public image, we have no idea. All but one of the times he shouts "Dare!", he punches at the camera; the Claw of Fail also shows up fairly frequently. Chris seemed to have filmed this video as a triumphant "victory" towards surviving having to sing "OK2BGay"; then later in the same day, he spent eight minutes humping a game console.
Description
THE Important Lyrics of the Song on July 25, 2009 and beyond:
"Everybody's trying to break your spirit.
Keeping you down.
Seems like it's been forever.
But there's another voice if you'll just hear it.
Saying it's the Last Round.
Looks like it's Now or Never.
Out of the darkness you stumble into the light.
Fighting for the things you Know Are Right."

Transcript
Sometimes when your hopes have all been shattered, there's nowhere to turn,
You wonder how you keep going
Think of all the things that really mattered, and the chances you burn[??]
The fire in your heart is growing
You can fly if you try leavin' the past behind
Heaven only knows what you might find
Dare!
Dare to believe you can survive
You hold a future in your hands
Dare!
Dare to keep all your dreams alive
Time to take a stand,
And you can win if you dare!
Everybody's tryin' to break your spirit, keepin' you down
Seems like it's been forever
There's another voice and you just hear it sayin' it's the last round[??]
Looks[?] like it's now or never
Out of the darkness, you stumble into the light
Fighting for the things you know are right
Dare!
Dare to believe you can survive
The power is there at your command
Dare!
Dare to keep all your dreams alive
Time to take a stand,
And you win if you dare!
Dare to believe you can survive
You hold the future in your hand
Dare!
Dare to keep all your dreams alive
Time to take a stand,
And you can win if you dare!
Dare!
Dare to keep all your love alive
Dare to be all you can be
Dare!
'Cause there's a place where dreams survive
It's calling you on to victory
Dare!
⇐ It's UGH!
