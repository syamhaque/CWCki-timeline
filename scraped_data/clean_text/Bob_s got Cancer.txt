================================================================================

NOTE: Chris was not directly involved in this conversation.
Bob's got Cancer is a YouTube video posted by user ThePCAssassins on 9 September 2013. The video is perhaps the first public release that Bob was diagnosed with cancer.
Strangely the video's upload date is 2 years after Bob had actually passed away, it appears that the video was uploaded or otherwise recorded on 24 March 2011. It can be noted as well that the two trolls calling Bob have spoken to him before, although he doesn't seem to remember it, probably because he had much bigger things to worry about at the time.

Craig: I bet you he'll all be like "HOW DARE YOU LAUGH AT MY SHOW OF GREATNESS!!" [It's unclear what the caller is talking about here but it is likely something to do with Chris and Sonichu]
Amfermee: He'd probably get fucking confrontational and have to have security escort him out... much like the Denny's debacle.
Craig: But I think it's time for us to call an old friend up [inaudible]
Amfermee: Yep!
Amfermee: Indeed...
Craig: The head of NAMBLA!
Bob: Hello?
Craig: Hello!?
Bob: Hello?
Craig: Bob!
Amfermee: Bob!
Craig: You old bastard! How's it going?
Bob: Well I got cancer how are you doing?
Craig: Uh well we're healthy, we're young but...
Amfermee: Holy shit! No way!
Craig: Oh my god, seriously? This is Craig and Amfermee!
Bob: [Bob attempts to say something but you cannot hear him over the other two callers, and he is cut off]
Amfermee: Are you going to be okay?
Craig: Bob are you going to be okay?
Bob: I don't know they're gonna operate in about a week and find out I guess.
Craig: Hey Bob do you remember Craig and Amfermee?
Bob: No...
Craig: Th- The- I- I- I'm Craig and -uh... Amfermee, we were talking I'm the -uh engineering student who -uh is becoming a civil -uh a civil engineer.
Bob: Well that's great.
Craig: Yeah! Like I'm following in your footsteps Bob
Amfermee: [Says something but it is inaudible over Bob and Craig]
Bob: But I got- I got more problems tonight because I- I've had other problems with the police.
Craig: What- What kinda problems?
Bob: People that are terrorizing us again through the police in Indiana somewhere
Craig: Are you serious!?
Bob: I'm serious.
Craig: Oh man I just-
Amfermee: Wait...
Bob: ...and plus I got 400 pounds of magazines on my front door they delivered by UPS... That we didn't order [Likely some sort of trolling attempt against Chris]
Craig: Are you serious? Oh my God!
Bob: So I got other problems so I can't talk tonight I'm sorry.
Craig: Oh, -uh Bob!
Bob: See you later.
Craig: Man...
Amfermee: Get well.
Craig: Get well Bob!
[Phoneline goes dead, Bob has hung up the phone]
Craig: [Begins to laugh]
Amfermee: Hey, you should put- you should actually upload that to PCAssasin's he just- Check the Cwcki to see if it says Bob has cancer.
[The recording stops here, there is a few seconds of dead air before the video ends.]
Analysis
In the video it appears that neither of the trolls intended to insult, belittle or aggravate Chris or Bob. Instead it appears they have spoken before, with the caller "Craig" previously having told Bob that he was an engineering student, similar to Bob. Even though the callers may have not intended to insult or annoy Bob they didn't exactly handle the revelation of Bob's cancer diagnosis with grace.
