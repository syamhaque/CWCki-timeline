================================================================================

YOUR TAX DOLLARS AT WORK!The contents of this page have been bought with taxpayer money!
Movies, TV episodes, and other PSN video downloads have made up a significant portion of Chris's PlayStation Network expenses. Data extracted from his PSN account show that he bought hundreds of dollars worth of videos, a partial accounting of which follows below.
Almost all of his downloads are animated TV shows and movies, mainly predictable favorites like Family Guy and various Adult Swim series. A couple of selections stick out in odd ways, though, particularly Richard Linklater's rotoscoped indie feature A Scanner Darkly, based on the Philip K. Dick novel of the same name. Chris might be a fan of complex postmodern science-fiction stories, but then he also might just download anything and everything that was advertised on G4. It's also possible he thought there would be sexy women in it, as most of the feature films he's purchased that aren't aimed at children are aimed at desperate virgins.
Although Chris's PSN account consists almost entirely of one wasteful impulse buy after another, his video download collection includes some especially obvious examples. He bought every episode (24 in all) of the harem anime series Shuffle! at a price of $2 an episode, or nearly $50 altogether, when he could have as easily bought the same episodes on DVD from any number of online discount retailers for less. In addition, some of the shows on Chris's list are available for free online; for example, Lucy, the Daughter of the Devil could be viewed at the time of his purchase on the Adult Swim website.
Add it all up and the tab for Chris's PSN video collection comes to more than $550.
