sheesh there's practically no end to the
SAS fees and punish slaves and tractors
sometimes yeah I know but this one is
just another drop in the bucket and you
know what I'm going to do yeah I think
so go for
it yeah we're electric hedgehogs you bag
of boats oh
myos yeah right your
rats there you go there's your
reference hey what's up YouTubers jesus
Christi Prime here once again with
another light power review and today
we're going to be looking at the next
figure in the Transformers Legacy Night
Burst N Deceptic Clone Scandal as
Vessel so here we are and there it is
and first and foremost as always we'll
take a quick look at the packaging so
right up front right here we got pretty
much a simplistic type of artwork of the
uh more common
savv but then you got to really
appreciate all the shape work that went
into that art look at it this is fun
anyway trust bird it is a deluxe class
delet classic
class and here we go decepticone ass I
scoundre vessel to fuzz on this side of
the box you got some rather simple yet
uh decent artwork kind of reminiscent of
a see as a scene from within the uh
comic book pages i believe um book
number nine was uh that featured that
bunch of them yeah this essentially is a
closeup and once again SAV scandalous
vessel and subronian writing on this
side of the box you got half of the uh
lovely poster artwork and that guy I did
mention last video but I mention it now
but just this art is a lot better than
the previous one the background is
really intense and good anyway there's
the top of the bots and uh there's the
bot with the words dates barcodes and on
the back of the box you got your
obligatory product this that the other
and uh you got your little bio if you uh
can read that but yeah once again this
will be on the quick light blog the low
wow if it's not already on there by the
time this video is uploaded and that's
basically it
for the
packaging and moving right along here we
have the more common type of SAV the
Decepticone and uh you can tell it's uh
yeah it's obviously a Jeep it's a Jeep
just like the uh first SUV it's a Jeep
are you shocked it's a Blake Jeep and I
just noticed when I put this back in the
vehicle mount that thing feet let me
just get let's get closer look at the
details so yeah I think very much uh
same as what you saw on the first day
but yeah here you go as opposed to what
they had there's the actual Decepticon
symbol right there on the hood and it's
a I believe you'll be able to see in a
moment when we do the comparisons
there's a it's a liar shade green as
opposed to the first but then yeah just
uh yeah pretty much a copy paste but
they can always fit it's an SAV and they
were so common they just pretty much was
running around everywhere but at this
point only one has that really big gun
but yeah there is the top there is the
bottom it does roll as well hooray for
rolling crabbing slashing scoundrelized
vesseling
things and now for
comparison here it is with uh
CC82
with Prime right
there that more in the
shot with the optimist his name is
Optimus
with Sonu right there
and now here is this common savv with
the quick veil combiner team wave
armorats fire shot chapper and of course
Mr roll out we'll do a closer comparison
between those two in a little
bit but yeah pretty much we're going to
get this triple jeep comparison out of
the way really quick so once again
that's the comore combo Decepticon SAV
with Mr rolet and now with uh the first
SAV with its with his big gun right
there what are you doing firing with the
enemy i'm not firing at the enemy i'll
just take her out right here get this
review done like you did anyway we'll do
some uh comparisons so give you the
who's who what's where's how i mean uh
here it's kind of like uh you got the
differences but the roll with the roll
out more clear you got lots of silvers
going on this one's definitely uh basic
and um yeah the first AV is a darker
shade of green i feel like it can't be
more clear than that of course you guys
big gun right there but we'll give you
all they give you the full turn around
let you see who's who what's what's r
where's how and of course there's the uh
better Decepticon symbol right there on
the back so that's how you can tell them
apart and there's the Allboard on Roll's
chest hanging out right there
so I kind of feel like uh between the
three you could definitely tell one
apart from the other oh I'll tell you
what let me give you this closeup
between the between the first and the
common did you see that as well so yeah
there's the uh promote there's the
promoted Decepticon symbol right there
on the the first one and the uh BBCC
Sizen like uh symbol and of course
there's the one Decepticon symbol on the
clone oh yeah and the Decepticone right
there on the big gun so yeah there's
that and now for the main comparisons
we'll start with the one other
Decepticone that we have so far reviewed
so here it is with the Deceptic Clone
Cracktor right there looking all fine
and dandy and that was his superior so
here he is with the Well we already did
it first but yeah here's Punlab the
first what are you doing you young
ripper snapper go back in your ranks
your group your low life me
yeah
with Megatron right
there
with
Crasher and yep they didn't try to take
a liking to Crasher's little leadership
of course with uh the boss lady Gwen
Makoto
me
with combine the wars
window and now for the obvious big
comparison that you've been long waiting
for so here it is with animates window
because it's
precious
also used to have the big gun but don't
precious so there you
go all right so now with this
decepticone you only get two accessories
so you get this uh I'm dropping it you
get this little gun right here just you
know it's a little trip barrel shooter
type of gun you got the more details
going on all over in uh the black color
on the gray plastic looks like and you
got the you got combiner mode hand right
here you got to uh hand it to someone or
another and um yeah so you got a few
options of course in regards to uh
storage for these two you got uh two
ports on top and that one peg right
there and this one's got the uh right
hole in it so you can just easily put
that right there and uh we can just uh
pop this out like that put the thumb out
pop the fingers in put the thumb in and
there you go
now more common Decepticone has a few
little
guns and just go ahead and state this
none of them are compatible so no all
right so yeah that's basically it for
the vehicle boat so let's get down to
transmission shall we let's There you go
there's a single decent th spin so once
again we're just going to go straight
into combine mode first and uh as you
see between the row out and the first AV
that's simple you just uh rotate out the
combiner limb and you uh pop the feet
forward and up
and simple as it gets good as it gets
there's your jeeping
leg and now it's getting to arm mode
once again so we keep that out and uh we
pull this up raise that up you're gonna
want to lift the arms out a little bit
so we can get the legs unclipped and
separated there you go down and out you
got that we got once again got that
little thing that little groove the
little peg right there is going to go
into the SL right there satisfactory and
uh the same on the other side you clip
the two together then you bring these
back in you tuck that up here oh that's
right i forgot how often do I forget
when I do this it's the head you got to
just pull this out like halfway and then
you pull this up put up there like that
and then rotate and there you go now
it's an arm simple as it gets it's just
an arm and uh you know goes either way
you can uh have it one way or the other
either get your full range of uh elbow
movement or just you know uh up to 90
degrees of bend at that elbow and robot
mode think cop got the second verse just
like or third verse just like the first
and the second ro put the comb peg down
separate the legs pull these
back them forward rotate the uh forearms
and uh bring the head forward rotate the
head and make sure this thing is secure
against the back right here and there
you go there you have the more common
savv in its robot
mode And uh simple is as simple does i
mean after all what else can you do on a
just a little bit of a low budget that
Gibby Makoto has and just having to put
up with whatever whatever Megatron could
afford to give so again close here look
at the detail so you got your simplistic
head right there yeah look at a little
bit spindly maybe a little swindly
whatever pun you want to make there i
don't care but there's your more common
Decepticone Sav head make definitely
separates the first from that you get
the comparisons be more clear anyway so
got all the bolded detail once again all
throughout the body it's just uh a lot
of the lighter shade of green and uh
going up the back pretty much uh common
place which you seen before and yada
yada
yada just that's about just decent
enough now articulation on worries what
we got what we got i'm going to tell you
once again in regards to this mode so
the head is on up joints you got your
wiggly waggly wiggly waggly you can look
up a little bit look down but if you do
that trying to do the transformation
joint you can get to squirrel squirrel
and hit rotate do a full 360 arms can do
a full 360 and they can move in and out
on that ball joint you got uh bicep
rotation and uh you get over 90 degrees
of bend at the elbow and nothing at the
wrist nothing at the waist legs can move
forward that far back about that far
outward to
the well almost to the full splits but
just don't want to stay up there you got
thigh rotation and uh up there at the
knee joint as well 90 degrees of bend at
the knee and uh feet cannot move up they
can move down quite a lot and you have
your ankle tilted
all right so let's run through the uh
two bits of accessories right there so
of course uh you got your hand right
there you know we've seen in the that
configuration before but of course you
know we can do that just uh put that
that's it gun you got 5 mil ports this
on either side of the arm of course
uh you can make this little this more
common SAV to hold both these big guns
and there you go it just a bit more
common bang bang and uh all that good
stuff right there and of course we'll
just go ahead and show this off real
quick so just Yeah side of the arms just
storm right there get out of the way and
yep there you go now take more common
SAV has a bit more beefy
shoulderage and now for comparison here
is the common SAV
with
CC82
with
Prime
with
Optimus
with
Sonu and now in the group shop here is
the SAV with the wave fire shot chapper
armorats and roll
out and now here's kind of a uh creep
party the three jeeps with the common
SAV next to roll out and an SAV the
first Jeepers creepers what a Jeep
party anyway so we'll give you the uh
turn around as opposed to what you see
up front here you got I mean it's
definitely face the budget not as many
decals this guy supposed to sip the
first and the row out but we'll give you
the quick turn around between all three
of them let's see the color differations
and who's who what's when's where why
what's
how yep
and I suppose we'll make this uh cheap
party a bit more cheap by bringing the
host combiner wars
window
yeah yep
with Punislav the
first
with
Megatron
with
Crasher
with
Makoto and of course last but not least
one more time in his Encore debut is
standing next to the old boat here he is
with classic animated window because
it's
precious also classic anime big gun
precious so there you go so there you
have Decepticone SAVV and um yes another
shameless reuse of the jeep mode
combiner but you know what the first ACV
was a Jeep and all of those were rather
Jeepish so of course the trend is going
to continue to the Decepticons
themselves that came out much later but
anyways so yeah just uh overall once
again a little bit of a fan of this mode
because you know good mode thing and uh
just all that good stuff there uh are
good and everything it's so simple
direct to the point as opposed to
they're supposed to roll out than the
first SAV that's got more detail and
going on with them yeah just it's more
like a more budget friendly SAV if you
want to give it if you want to put it
down like that and that doesn't have
that much going on for it and there's
just so many of them they're practically
a dime but a dozen anyway so uh so there
you go now I picked this up from Target
you can there's pop it up in your other
targets as well as Walmart your big bad
big bad toy store Entertainment Earth
Amazon.com and all of that and don't
forget to check out me on my socials
including of course Quicklight i'll put
a link in the description down below and
uh I think that's pretty much it so like
subscribe and all that for the algorithm
and everything so yes this is
Transformers Legacy Diverge Decepticone
SAVV Scoundrel as Vessel and this is
Jesus Christ son your prime say remember
you don't stop play because you grow up
you grow up because you stop play be
geek be
proud all right so Basher that's
essentially just the uh top Mach five
turbo engine for you yeah that's right i
want to go really fast i want to go
faster than all them real rats and uh
hey can I just anything you know if you
buy one give one free I'll give you a
massive discount on the
third h Well me personally I'd like to
get some Voyager class ammo i mean I'm
certainly never going to have a gun
that's going to outmatch SAV the first
yeah and uh me personally I kind of feel
like the gun I got is big enough but I
feel like I can go much bigger so give
me the ultra deluxe model in comparison
to this one shut up you two nothing for
them they're on a
diet oh bossley bossly bam
ma'am
crusher long time no see has it it seems
like just last week I left you here to
actually just mind the business i'm gone
but then I end up being thrusted forward
in time and I find you trying to take
charge to place it over my troops how do
you explain yourself there young Missy
well what else is there to explain i
mean you weren't here so I decided to
take charge and I actually improved a
few things around here
motto I've seen what you've done around
here you essentially made things a lot
worse it looks a lot more ugly than when
I last remembered i mean I've been only
gone for a little while you already
turned my place upside down
Crasher i think I approved it for the
better i disagree you're not that any
better than Starscream how dare you
compare me to Starcream i ought to stop
on your foot for that not if I purchased
psycho first
crusher oh well I think this is a bit
getting a little too uncomfortable here
so I'll just take the order I got here
and uh I'll come back here with the
delivery and I'll set the pave then
bye i think Megatron will be very
pleased with the changes I made around
here and I believe you and Psycho will
give me some applause as well maybe
psycho would have no longer known you
longer than I have but that does not
give you an excuse for this plague
crusher i had just been flown miles and
even a week ahead of time thanks to that
Christian
Prime i think that's a lot worse than
anything you've gone through isn't
it maybe so but my changes are for the
better and I'm going to stand strong and
bite them i'll fight you for it really
well I just unfortunate I wasn't able to
join that last fight and actually help
out we could have won against that
Medatron yeah of course you're right you
you big galoot i be have to roll all you
can do is just fall you know cuz you're
so big yeah whatever p you're just a big
old Oh nothing i just sent you a big old
Uh-oh i think the boss lady and Crasher
are having another fight
here obviously I think we know who's
going to lose it's not going to be the
boss
[Music]
lady it doesn't get done to what floor
again haven't you
yeah well at least I'm big enough to
know that that is just not
funny at least I didn't fall backwards
like the rest of the
characters oh you think that's funny huh
well wait till I step on your feet that
time you know what i think I'll do it
right now
ow ow
ow
oh your feet are too strong as usual
tractor i am going to go stop by crush
traces out on the training grounds
[Music]
