April was the fourth month of 2009. Chris became strongly in love with his sweetheart Ivy. Although previously stating that he would quit YouTube forever, Chris returned to the video-site within ten days of his departure. He uploaded several videos for Ivy, and also drew her a few comics, both of which were typical for showing more and more of Chris's sexually deviant side. As April continued, Chris was suddenly caught up in a scandal, as audio emerged of him having cyber-sex with a troll posing as Vanessa Hudgens. Chris showed great remorse towards Ivy for his behavior, and in the end he even proposed marriage to her. Chris ended the month in a severely disturbed relationship, doing all he can to cling to his latest sweetheart.
