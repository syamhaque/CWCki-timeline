April Fools
1 April 2021[1]
In a discussion on an April Fools joke on Geno's channel, and in response to a user's comment, "I wonder what Chris's reaction to this was.":
Chris Wants To Contact
12 July 2022[2]
Fuck.
Extent of Coverage
18 September 2023[3]
In a discussion about material covered in Chris Chan: A Comprehensive History, and in response to a user's comment, "Completely agree with you. The never ending slog of social media posts messes up the flow of the documentary and is just uninteresting in general. If I were Geno I would be trimming out the fat. Not everything in Chris's life is worth mentioning or bringing up in a documentary that is at it's core entertainment. You can still be comprehensive without mentioning literally everything.":
I'm not padding, and in fact cutting all the irrelevant posts. There is actually so much that you don't see. I only leave in the stuff that I think is relevant and/or interesting.
Names
3 April 2024[4]
In response to a user's comment, "Good God. The lore regarding Chris goes deeper than the history of actual countries. We have Chris Chan, a fool and these army of sociopaths following him for profit and attention. I don't really have a deep respect for geno but if what you say about Geno is true I don't know what the hell to say. All that nigga had to do was read off the shitty fucking wiki in his dead voice instead of actively policking with the random idiot trolls who think they're cool for fucking with Chris Chan.":
I've been in contact with WCT for a while, and the extent of his involvement is that he requests not to be doxxed. I've fulfilled this request for others who are not so impactful to the greater Chris story since they don't want their names to be attached to this. I've already been contacted by others who panicked for having their usernames in the videos and whatever, even one time a guy threatened to call police and/or kill himself because his username was uncensored in the video, and reported my video.
I just don't wanna cause trouble and make these vids in peace, is all.
Money
3 April 2024[4]
In response to a user's comment, "I might be late but could Geno be a long game CCP how the West is degenerate? What surprised me is how Geno lives in China and is putting significant long term effort into his project, and for what actual gain? Unless he's from money how is he funding this?
And why China? Why the fuck would you live there and do what he does? It's so high risk, there must be some state based reason.":
I do make money off this, and living in China with my in-laws allows myself and my wife to work on our own businesses and save up without barely spending anything before we move out and move on with our lives

Azumanga Daioh Commission

Etsy commission piece dated July 18, 2024. Chris was asked to depict herself with the cast of Azumanga Daioh.
Back of the drawing simply reads, "Art Critique and Tutoring"
