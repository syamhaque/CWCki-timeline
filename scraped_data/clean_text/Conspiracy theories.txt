A conspiracy theory is a belief that a secret, powerful, evil organization is responsible for an event. Among the many issues faced by Chris in his perception of reality, his tendency towards conspiracy theories is the one that has caused him the most trouble. Chris views the fact of his own life through the lens of his huge, cloying ego, and as such believes that anyone who prevents him from getting what he wants is only interested in being mean to him for its own sake, something to which neither he nor his parents take kindly.
When no culprit responsible for his unhappiness is visible, Chris prefers to accuse unseen hands of plotting against him – even years after actual conspirators stopped trolling him. By placing the blame at the feet of someone else, be they seen or unseen, this allows Chris to shirk responsibility for his own actions (as usual) and continue on his merry way with the kind of poor behavior that will fail him in the long run and leave him miserable later into his life, presuming that he ever gets that far.

Conspiracies Chris ACTUALLY BELIEVES
Chris believes that he was intentionally infected with autism by his doctor. Anyone who hinders Chris's Love Quest is part of an effort to "make true love illegal", either in Virginia or nationwide.[2][3] This choice of words suggests that Chris thinks he is entitled to a girlfriend, and that people are attempting to take legal action to deprive him of this alleged right.
Chris blamed his inability to find guests to a sporting event on efforts by the Greene County school board to deprive him of friends; including conspiracy with realtors to keep him in Ruckersville and with Michael Snyder to keep him out of his favorite hangout.[4]
When Chris was active on the Tomboys and Tomgirls of Virginia forum, he revealed that his parents believed his former acquaintances from the GAMe PLACe were behind the harassment he had been receiving from trolls. Barbara and Bob may have concluded this from being unfamiliar with the concept of internet trolling, and Chris also held the belief. In addition, he claimed that Michael Snyder was hiding a criminal scandal because the owner of the Place (as well as three other associated hobby stores) is a convicted sex offender. He also tried to argue that the store itself is in violation of the law, simply because it is close to a public school and owned by a sex offender who is never actually there. Ironically enough, acting like a sex offender is one of the many things that got Chris banned from the store in the first place. Chris would eventually accuse Michael Snyder himself of being a child molester, going as far as to baselessly claim that he was molesting his own daughter.[5] In case you've forgotten, Snyder once chased Chris down after he (unintentionally) took candid photographs of the same daughter Chris accused him of molesting.
Three years after being banned from the TooManyGames convention (on very legitimate premises), Chris mentioned his belief that the event coordinator had been with the trolls the entire time, and his ban had been the result of a setup.[6]
In a jail letter sent on 25 June 2022, Chris states that he believes that the jail staff has been tampering with his letters he has been sending to people from jail, and changing up the things said in them.
In Telling It To All of You, and the Hasbro Executives and Staff, as well as in various social media posts from February 2024 onwards, Chris has conjured up a conspiracy surrounding the fifth generation of My Little Pony, namely My Little Pony: Pony Life and My Little Pony: Make Your Mark, being Russian propaganda, misconstruing the fact that MLP is licensed to air and sell merchandise in Russia as being backed by the Russian government (which, given that the Russian government has declared it "gay propaganda" and slapped this children's cartoon with an 18+ age rating over there, it seems unlikely it's Kremlin-backed). Chris also suspects foul play in the 2021 death of former Hasbro CEO Brian Goldner, who in reality died of cancer, entirely unrelated to MLP G5 and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Possible Origins and Reinforcement
Chris's tendencies towards these sorts of thoughts may spiral back to two people: Robert and Barbara Chandler. A phone call between his parents and a GAMe PLACe employee revealed a number of things; most importantly, it illustrated that they believe Chris's entire trolling began as a conspiracy between Michael Snyder, Megan Schroeder, and a number of potential homosexuals to "terrorize", "torment", and "persecute" Chris for being autistic, going so far as to believe they broke into Chris's credit card account and tried to ruin his credit. Considering how readily and fervently these beliefs were held by his parents, it is sadly little wonder that Chris thinks the same way.
