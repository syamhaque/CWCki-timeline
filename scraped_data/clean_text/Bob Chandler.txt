Robert "Bob" Franklin Chandler Jr.[6] (4 September 1927 – 6 September 2011[7]) was the father of Christian Weston Chandler, Carol Chandler and David Alan Chandler, the stepfather of Cole Smithey, and husband of Barbara Weston Chandler. Bob became a firm favorite with trolls due to Chris's antipathy towards him and for his infamous cameo when he walked in on Chris mass debating.[8] His nickname, "The Internet Lumberjack," came from this incident, wherein he promised to cut the internet down.
Despite being estranged from his other children, and despised by his stepson for abusive behavior, Bob was widely viewed as a better parent than his wife Barbara by Christorians, and – as far as Chris's own testimony can be trusted – he treated Chris better than any of his previous children. Bob had serious difficulties working with Chris's autism, a disorder that both he and his wife did not fully understand, but nonetheless, he had high hopes for his child in spite of the difficulties that he faced. Bob hoped to instill Chris with a variety of interests that reflected his own varied tastes, and he created The Dreaming Studio in their backyard in the hopes that they'd create things there (though, sadly, nothing of note was ever created there).
Because of this, Bob's popularity stems from being somewhat concerned with Chris's foolish behavior, and the fact that he occasionally tried to encourage a modicum of responsibility in Chris's life, bringing up the fact that he devoted 29 years to raising his son. Of course, Chris was almost entirely unaffected by Bob's efforts to better him, but unlike Barb, he at least made the effort, even if his attempts were futile or harmful at worst. That being said, he also encouraged Chris to not seek employment in favor of getting welfare, even though Chris could still hold a part-time job and receive those benefits, so he's not entirely blameless for the state that his son is in today, either. Not to mention that many of Chris's more backward social perspectives that he had in the "Classic Era" stem from his influence.
Bob was always eager to chat, and indeed much of the known information about Bob's life comes from conversations he had with trolls. It seems that Chris's passion for Honest Content did not fall too far from that tree, although Bob at least had a filter that his son lacks. Whether in person or over the phone, Bob appeared to relish the opportunity to speak with just about anyone. According to Chris, he was also a strong negotiator.[9]
On 6 September 2011, Bob died of complications from heart failure at Martha Jefferson Hospital ICU, surrounded by his family, his pastor and hospital staff.[10] He was survived by his wife and son, who then had to become the man of the house. Chris occasionally raked in some income through commission work, though he has never looked for a serious career. Chris initially came to terms with his father's death in a conventional, healthy way, but eventually turned to a coping mechanism where he genuinely believed that his father was alive in another dimension as a Sonichu named Robertchu.
Years later in 2021, Chris would disgrace Bob's memory by repeatedly having dubiously-consensual sex with his wife in an incest-based affair, with Chris bragging that he could get Barb off better than "Mr. C" ever could. Following this incident, both were separated from the house that he maintained, with Chris jailed, Barb temporarily hospitalized before eventually returning to the residence, and the Dreaming Studio left abandoned for good.

Biography
Bob was born on 4:15 PM at a medical arts building in Fort Worth, Texas,[11] and raised in Sylacauga, Alabama.[12] He was the only child of Robert "Bob" Franklin Chandler Sr. (8 February 1906[13] – 27 December 1977[14]), an Alabamian insurance agent, and Jean Hollomon (28 March 1906[15] – 10 May 1945[16]), a Texan housewife.[17] Bob has eight younger half-siblings on his father's side.[18] He also mentioned having a cousin and several Cherokee relatives in Oklahoma.[19][20] However, a distant relative disputed his Cherokee heritage,[21] and his son's DNA test results in 2018 belied any American Indian descent. It is common for white Southerners to make dubious claims to Cherokee ancestry, for a variety of historical reasons.[22]

Bob has said that he was, "...interested in the world," around him since he was ten, and began collecting foreign stamps as a child in the 1930s; his first stamp was of Michael I of Romania. He also developed an interest in foreign music, eventually collecting some 15,000–20,000 LPs from various genres and cultures.[23] About 100 or so survived the 2014 house fire.[24]
Bob joined the Boy Scouts, becoming an Eagle Scout and a Scoutmaster for over 20 years.[25]
According to Chris, Bob lost his virginity at the age of 27, which would have been in 1954 or 1955.[26]
Service and education
A 1942 yearbook from Sylacauga High School lists a "Bobby Chandler" in the freshman class and glee club, suggesting that he graduated from this school in spring 1945 before matriculating at Auburn University as an aeronautical engineering major that autumn.
Bob served in Korea, and, thankfully for Chris, who believes that he was a sperm carried in one of his father's testicles during that time, he left before the Korean War broke out.
Bob apparently had knowledge that the Army desired,[27] was conscripted as a special draftee in 1946 and placed in the Signal Corps. There, he learned how to install valve systems, switchboards, and telephones. After basic training and Signal School in Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, Bob was sent to Korea for a year to install infrastructure with the American occupation force. Bob recounted a reckless decision he made during his time in the Army after returning from Korea for the Christmas holiday in 1947. He hitchhiked to New York City, where he stayed for two weeks before running out of money, and then had to figure out how to get back to Fort Monmouth.. Serving until 1948, he was entitled to the WWII Victory Medal: his service number was 44107856.[28]
Figuring he'd get "swallowed up" at a big college, Bob picked a small college, Jacksonville State Teachers College (now Jacksonville State University), after leaving the military. He studied pre-engineering and played French horn for the band and orchestra there for two years before returning to Auburn University, where he studied electrical engineering and graduated in 1952 with a Bachelor of Electrical Engineering degree.[29][12] As an engineer, he never learned to spell properly.[30] While he was at Auburn, he was part of the band once again, was a member of Wesley Foundation, a United Methodist religious group; and Phi Mu Alpha, a social frat dedicated to men who are interested in music.
Career
Article on Bob's 25th anniversary at General Electric.
A 1946 military record included Bob's occupation while he was a student as "tinsmith, coppersmith, and sheet metal worker".
Bob worked for Western Electric as an engineer for four years, where he designed a variety of electrical subsystems, including relays, telephones and valve systems. Initially, he was working with the radar systems in test-planning automatic test equipment. With Western Electric, Bob and his co-worker filed a patent for electrical terminal block in 1955, which was published in 1959.[31] During the 1950s, he lived in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, where his father and half of his half-siblings lived for the rest of their lives.
He was then offered a job by General Electric in Utica, New York. Since New York is too cold (and Yankee) for Bob, he left after three years, returning back to Winston-Salem for a few years before transferring to Roanoke in Southwest Virginia, where he discovered his love for the mountains. In 1975, he moved to Richmond, where he worked until 1980, when he was transferred to Charlottesville.[12] He worked with both Goodrich and Goodyear.[23]
With General Electric, Bob was responsible for at least seven patents. Barbara claimed, in an email to Miyamoto, that without Bob's influence in the computer world, the NES "...might not have arrived so soon,"[32] ignoring the fact that the NES was designed and released in Japan in 1983, without influence from American electronics.

The General Manager at G.E.[33]
Examples of Bob's accomplishments include an automated steel mill for rolling steel for cars, a paper mill for the production of Kleenex, warehousing, railroads and tanker ships. He designed scooters, die casting machines, machines for producing plastic products[12] and a vehicle logging system.[34] Both Chris and Barbara have bragged that Bob designed controls[35] that were used in plastic water container molding machines.[12][32]
Bob retired in 1987 at the age of 59 or 60 after 31 years of service for General Electric.[36] His relatively early retirement may have been provoked by health problems, as he writes in his December 1987 letter to Chris that "I know now that I, at best, haven't much time left to share myself with you".
Bob himself was proud of his, "...natural inclination for logic," although he was, "...inundated," by all his designs and whether he did well for the world. Would plastic water bottles lead to mankind's salvation or utter destruction? Only time would tell.[12]
World consciousness

“
I have been very interested in the world since I was 10 years old, and that was 70 years ago and, the, uh, I'm very fond of and I really truly believe in the United Nations, but you won't find anybody else in my countryside or around here, I think, that does. (laughing) But anyway, I'm very world conscious.
”
Bob
Bob referred to himself as a Republican, and he did not vote for Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election.[11] That said, he had misgivings about Bob McDonnell, the Republican candidate in the 2009 Virginia gubernatorial election and the ultimate winner of the election, possibly because of McDonnell's support for very strict anti-abortion laws, which made no exceptions for cases of rape or incest. Bob and Chris considered writing in Snoopy from Peanuts as a protest vote.[37]
In a potentially damaging moment on 18 February 2009, Bob doubted the existence of Molvanîa, Julie's country of origin,[38] but he continued talking on the grounds that his grasp of post-Soviet geography was shaky. He apparently convinced himself that Molvanîa was the same place as the real country of Moldova, a former Soviet republic located near the Black Sea.[23] However, he rather damningly failed to question why Julie spoke perfect English with an American accent.
Besides Korea, Bob also visited Australia and England at some point in his life.[39]
Relationships
Previous family
Bob was previously married to a woman named Patricia Harley on 29 September 1956 at a United Methodist church in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. They had two children, David Alan Chandler (b. 1961) and Carol Suzanne Chandler (b. 1964).
Bob and Patricia separated on 28 June 1976 before divorcing on 28 January 1980.[40][41] Bob's relationships with David and Carol were strained in his later years.[42] Because of this, Chris did not know he had a niece via David, named Savannah, until she was 8 years old,[43] and Bob's relationship with Carol was even more distant. According to Chris, Bob was always concerned about Carol. None of the Chandlers knew what was going on with her, and the last they had heard was that she was working for the federal government, implying that she did not show up to her father's funeral.[44] David, on the other hand, did attend his father's funeral.[45]
Barbara
With Barb.
Bob and Barbara met in 1979 at "Maddy's Pub" in Richmond[46] (probably Matt's British Pub in Shockoe Slip, where Bob was a sing-along leader in the late 1970s).[47] Barbara was there with a friend and Bob was singing.[48] According to Chris, Bob claimed that Barbara did the pursuing: "She chased him down the hallway," though Barb has disputed this.[49] This version of events may be why Chris figured that he could get away with being passive in terms of courtship. In contrast, Cole's friend Chuck McGuigan, who worked at the pub as a bartender, has a vivid memory of them, "...acting out as a couple of drunken losers."[42]
They got married in 1980,[48] only months after Bob and Patricia had divorced.[50] Barb later told Chris that she ultimately married Bob because, "...he owned a house."[51]
According to Chris, Barb and Bob did not have sex for at least two decades before Bob's passing. They had been sleeping in separate rooms in the years leading up to his death.[52]
Cole
Bob married Barbara when her son Cole was nearly 17, around the time Cole left to lead his own life.
Cole feels that Bob's bitterness ruined the relationship between himself and his mother. Cole said he would celebrate[42] "...when that fuck Bob finally drops,"[53] but it is unknown if he did so. Cole said that he and Bob shared a mutual hatred,[42] though there isn't any proof that Bob hated Cole. At the least, it is certain that Bob knew Cole didn't like him.[30]

Bob Chandler, Internet lumberjack.
Dreaming studio of Mr. C and Little C. Where dreams do come true - 1989.
Bob's relationship with Chris was rather complex. While Bob was considered to be a better parent than his wife Barb, he was by no means the good ol' pop-pop Chandler many thought he was. While Bob at least tried to help Chris, his attempts at doing so were either futile, misguided or even harmful to Chris in the long term.
When Chris was a boy, Bob encouraged him to learn more about the world and tried sharing his interests and hobbies, including engineering, geography and stamp collecting.
When Chris was seven, Bob converted a shed in the backyard of 14 Branchland Court to a workshop where he and Chris could build things together, dubbing it the "dreaming studio." Chris could not recall what they had built together when asked about it in the years following Bob's death;[54] he and Barb had been using the space for hoard storage.
Bob wished that Chris was more interested in the world. He tried to teach Chris about foreign geography such as Europe and Australia, but figured (correctly) that Chris doesn't understand countries and continents beyond what he's seen on television, and can only associate with the places he's physically been to in Virginia.[23]
Bob had difficulties understanding Chris's Autism and vehemently refused to get Chris the help he needed, likely out of fear driven inertia that is typical for people of his age and generation. In fact, he fought tooth and nail for years to keep Chris from getting the special education he needed to cope with the real world. It was the very reason why Bob rented a second home in a Chesterfield County so Chris couldn't attend special classes that Greene County recommended. Bob was most likely under the impression, that Chris would be thrown into a lunatic asylum, lobotomized and that Chris needs to be sheltered all his life because of it, never mind his autistic granddaughter, who lives a relatively normal life.
When Chris entered Manchester High, Bob arranged for a bunch of girls to babysit and pretend to be friends with Chris. He gave Chris money to hand it to at least one gal pal, claiming it was for her Friendship and Attention.
Bob enjoyed collecting stamps as a boy growing up in the 1930s, and he continued to do so for several decades, with a focus on the United Nations and foreign countries,[55] building a collection of stamp albums which filled six boxes.[56] He taught Chris about his hobby, buying him a beginner's stamp album in 1992.[57] Chris seemed to enjoy the hobby as well, since he had many pages of stamps filled in. In letters to Chris (written when Chris was a few years old), Bob gave Chris permission to pass along his various collections onto others after inheriting them. In 2017, Chris began selling pieces of the inherited stamp collection. Bob's pieces were decently priced, generally for $5 per set, though he tried to sell his own personal stamp album for $1,000.[58]
Bob's racist joke that Barack Obama would paint the White House black as soon as he became president influenced Chris to draw it in Sonichu #8.
Chris's phobia of penises was apparently sparked from barging into his parents' room, where Bob had a habit of sleeping nude from the waist down.[59]
Chris has often complained about stressful confrontations with his father:
“
well, my father is a major stressor against me; starts arguements [sic], annoys me, rarely washes his hands after restroom breaks (lord knows I've tried to encourage him to wash numerous time, and rarely succeeded).
”
Chris, IRC (31 December 2008)
However, the many instances of Bob communicating with trolls show that he was generally pleasant and amicable, not at all inclined to start arguments, as Chris asserts. As seen during the lead up to the fateful encounter between Emily, Chris and the Man in the Pickle Suit, Bob seemed to be more than happy to discuss stories with people, even those he hadn't seen or heard that much of - Robert Simmons V, who met Bob during his visit to Chris's church conversed with him extensively, later saying that he was a 'really pleasant guy.' Bob also engaged in friendly and interesting conversation with ThePCAssassins many times through 2010 and 2011, further disproving Chris's belief. The antagonism to which Chris refers was likely Bob attempting to constructively criticize Chris in order to better him, as Chris deeply resents being told what he does not want to hear.
A drawing of Bob by Chris, released in November 2015.
An example of this criticism was Bob telling Chris that, since Bob had looked after Chris for 29 years despite his childish and outrageous behavior, Chris should show more gratitude towards him. Chris was completely dismissive, figuring that his father was obligated to take care of him, and seeing no reason as to why he should demonstrate any foreign concepts like "love," "support," "gratitude," and "willingness to help." Reinforcing Bob's point, Chris still ran for his father's aid when he felt threatened, as in the later parts of the Kacey and Liquid Call.
Despite Bob's occasional frustration over Chris's actions, he seemed to have bought into the theory that Chris is tormented by a complex network of enemies spanning the entire world, due to the success that he has earned from his own Sonichu franchise.[60][61] In the Matthew Noble call, it appeared that Bob was the source of Chris's tendency to bring up unrelated mishaps and debacles to make current incidents and sources of stress seem "petty" in comparison.
Bob and a younger Christian. Note Chris's "Family Bonding" shirt.
Once during a phone call with a troll, Bob stated that Chris was "a hell of a lot nicer" and "has done a lot better than" the troll calling him.[62]
After Chris got his now obsolete CADD degree, instead of telling Chris to get to work like any other parent would, he encouraged Chris to stay home just so he could continue to get his taxpayer-funded tugboat.
He never seemed to get past the notion that Chris could and had already achieved things, given that he continued to have to nursemaid Chris well into his son's late 20s. In the later parts of 2009 and throughout 2010, as chronicled in Chris's emails with Vivian Gee and Jackie, Bob had been forced to take an increasingly active role in controlling Chris's spending and debt, paying off Chris's credit cards with his own money in an attempt to prevent interest charges from spiraling even further out of control. By the fall of 2010, he was monitoring Chris's bank accounts on a daily basis and keeping him on a strict allowance. Upon finding out about Chris's escapades in early 2011, Bob's reaction was to question Chris's sexuality, at one point even calling him a "fag", even though he indirectly contributed to it through his unbalanced approach of socializing Chris.
Chris has said specifically that he doesn't have to love his father, but has to respect him.[63] Confidential details collected after Bob's death, however, suggests Chris was more emotionally attached than he let on, providing rare and precious evidence that Chris doesn't take the presence of others for granted. He also got genuinely emotional while reading a letter that his father had left for him on-camera, again indicating how much he misses his father.[64]
In December 2012, Chris uploaded the soundtrack from the 1990 WTJU Jazz Marathon, in which Bob was a performer and a host. It was notable as one of the few moments where Chris publicly honored his father's memory since his passing in September 2011.
Bob lives on in his son's memory. Chris noted the occasion of his father's passing by attaching angel wings to the Lego minifigure representing him,[65] and displaying two photos of him in front of his TV.[66] He often sees Bob in his dreams.[67][68]
Due to the influence of the Idea Guys, Chris later expressed beliefs that Bob is half-Sonichu and is apparently still alive in the CWCville dimension. These beliefs began around December 2017 and continued even after the Idea Guys had been removed from power, as shown by the below quote from 2018's Father's Day.
#HappyFathersDay to each and every Father in This World and in Every Single Other Dimension Too! My father is alive again! I still love him, even in his checker-patterned glory! ⚡️💙❤️⚡️[69]
In the Incest Call, Chris claimed he was better at pleasuring Barb than his own father. One can only imagine Bob's reaction to this news if he were still alive to bear witness to what his son has become.
Despite his best efforts to the contrary, Chris, his second chance at being a father, was Bob's greatest failure as a parent, even when factoring in his strained relationship with his other children.
Other relationships
In spite of his redneck background, Bob seems to have gotten along better with foreigners than with his own countrymen. His closest friend in Richmond was Reverend Chen of Korean Canaan Presbyterian Church,[70] and he had English friends through his involvement with Matt's British Pub.[47] He also had friends in Australia,[71] and Czechoslovakian friends in late 1970s, who were illegal immigrants escaping Czechoslovakia. Chris said Bob and Barb enjoyed conversing and drinking Slivovitz with them and that Bob would drive to Maryland to buy Slivovitz.[72]
From his father's second marriage, Bob had, "...a large number of half-brothers and sisters in... Salem, North Carolina,"[73] but he does not seem to have been very close with them. Bob's stepmother's obituary confirms that eight of these half-siblings were alive as of 2015.[74]
Contrary to popular beliefs, he did not have friends in the Ku Klux Klan.
Later life, poor health and death
See also: Death of Bob Chandler
Playbill for Mr. C. and his musical pushcart.
Bob lived on Social Security as well as his General Electric pension.[39] He never really had people to chat with at home (he would ramble to total strangers on the phone if he could), so he sat around, listened to music, and took care of the garden inside the greenhouse.[23] With a 1970s stereo system set up in the greenhouse, he went to 'swing with the music' on his swing there.[39]
Bob had two triple bypasses and four heart attacks. The two triple-bypass operations took place first in August 1980 and at last in 1992. He had Coronary artery disease and wore an artificial pacemaker.[75][76] He apparently had several vivid near-death experiences: during Chris's date with Emily, Bob tells her that he has "died" several times, and Chris says that Bob, "...has seen the light, but did not actually go to it." In one prank call, Bob revealed that after surgery for cancer it was discovered that he had a fluid build-up in his legs, which is symptomatic of CHF. This rapid decline in health worried him.[11] He attributed his long life to the Cherokee in him. His uncles and grandfather all lived past 90.[23] Despite his heart troubles he continued to eat at Burger King daily.[77][78]
On 1 March 2010, Chris tweeted that Bob had been taken to the hospital in the early morning for "congested [sic] heart failure". Chris seemed confident that his father was not in for a long stay. Considering Bob's age, lifestyle, and long history of heart disease, Chris did not seem to grasp the seriousness of his heart failure. Bob had been the only thing keeping the Chandler household from imploding, and as such, trolls and white knights alike wished him the very best.
Apart from the dying heart
In the month following Bob's hospitalization, Chris was remarkably quiet on the subject of his father. News about his condition was hard to come by, as information only arose when Chris was inclined to complain about it online. Statistically, congestive heart failure is not as immediately fatal as its name implies,[79] but Bob's age, prior heart attacks and lifestyle made this a very serious situation.
Chris's videos over the month of March made no mention of Bob at all. Staying true to his painfully predictable nature, Chris instead lost a girlfriend he never had, made racial slurs and death threats towards a cartoon character, and raged against abstinence. His silence on the subject of his father was probably because of genuine ignorance of the seriousness of his father's condition.
A poster on /cwc/ contacted Chris via PSN regarding Bob. He posted a screen capture of Chris's response, saying, "He is doing much better, thank you."[80] Another contacted Chris via email and got a response saying, "Yes, my father is healthy and safe." Clearly he was neither, but this was at least proof that Bob hadn't joined the Whites-Only section of Heaven just yet. In late May, Chris finally made a brief mention in a public video that his father was "alive and well". Chris was, at least, half right.
Appearances
In Sonichu

Christian, you are not a girl! Go put your pants back on.

Bob, Sonichu #12
In "Spring Break, 2008", a radio announcement from Jamsta Sonichu mentions that Bob founded CWCville in 1982, presumably after Chris's birth on 24 February given that Bob named the city after his newborn son. Comic Bob presumably served as mayor before Chris took the office at an unknown date. At other points, Bob was mentioned in Chris's tangents about hating men other than himself and his father.
In "Date Ed", there are two dolls for the class to practice talking to, girls received "Robert" dolls, while boys received "Barbara" dolls, an obvious reference/homage to Bob and Barb.
Bob made his first official appearance in Sonichu #11, photoshopped into a "family photo" alongside Chris, Barb and various Electric Hedgehog Pokémon.
In Sonichu #12, Bob appears in a set of pages that combine an autobiographical account of Chris coming out as a tomgirl to his parents, and a tribute to his late father. He is depicted as an elderly man, as the page took place in 2010 (due to Chris's Oedipus complex, Barb is depicted as much more youthful). He attempts to dissuade Chris from continuing his tomgirl lifestyle, although Chris states that Bob later, "...told me he accepts and love [sic] me for who I am," shortly before his passing in 2011.
Chris concludes Bob's appearance in the book with a photo in memoriam of his life, saying that he and Barb continue to miss him every day.

In August 2017, Chris unveiled a drawing of the Chandler family depicted as My Little Pony characters, saying that they will make further appearances in Sonichu #12-9. The ponified Bob, known as "Gallop Crush", appears as Night Star's father, reaffirming the self-insert nature of Chris's ponysona.
In the Idea Guy-written Sonichu #16, Bob's spirit crosses over into CWCville where he meets and strikes up a conversation with serial killer Ted Bundy.

This is a momentous occasion, showing some awareness on the part of the Chandlers that the filth and squalor they live in is a health hazard. This video subsequently off a wave of emails and calls to the Greene County Health Department, masterminded by trolls who hoped to realize Bob's fear of eviction, but the campaign was seemingly unsuccessful.
November 2009: Bob and Snorlax make a brief appearance at the end of the Kacey and Liquid Call.
15 August 2010: In his final outing on the damn Internet, Bob gets a call from the GAMe PLACe and is informed of Chris's actions earlier in the year. He then goes on a tangent about how Chris has been tormented by everyone ever since he was banned, and then demands Michael Snyder's information. Barbara also is audible at the end of the call.
Prank calls: Bob answered several of these. He was usually sincere when talking with prank callers, providing them with true and honest information about himself and Chris, but was occasionally pushed to trolling them back, on one occasion telling a particularly obnoxious pair of trolls that he had ties to the Ku Klux Klan.
