2016 was the eighth year since Chris's discovery.
It is a year that brought us the following things:
The further degeneration of Chris's hair. Due to a mix of neglect and his traditional lack of self-respect, his hair now resembles a dying, green dish rag which only emboldens his rapidly-receding skullet.
Fought with, then eventually made up with... and then fought with again, Jeff Ouzuo on the issue of selling Sonichu merchandise.
Chris apologizing to males with Asperger's.
Chris began and quickly ended his GameStop embargo because it accomplished nothing.
Chris began sending death threats once again, this time to Donald Trump.
Mind-numbing amounts of e-begging.
An entire year consumed by arguably the most unproductive saga in Christory.
