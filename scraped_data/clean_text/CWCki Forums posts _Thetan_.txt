Used Porn
17 December 2013[1]
This rather interesting ad was recently brought to my attention:
I didn't want to post it until I had confirmed that it was indeed Chris. I just received that confirmation, which appears below.
Yep! Definitely Chris!

Catherine
15 December 2014[2]
In response to a user's comment, "The intention wasn't to destroy him from the beginning?":
That's not actually true. The original idea behind "Catherine" was neutral. She was meant as a vehicle by means to obtain information (content) about Chris and his current living situation.
Catherine wasn't all that much different than Renee except that, because he met her on OKCupid and they had a 97% match on those silly personality questions, Chris thought they were soul mates and destined to be together.
Catherine never tried to set herself up as a girlfriend. She met Chris on OKCupid, but she told him that she wanted to use that as a starting point and see where things went from there. Also, the open relationship was Chris's idea, not Catherine's.
Catherine never referred to Chris as her "boyfriend","sweetheart", or told him that she loved him. This part of the relationship is another figment of Chris's imagination. Catherine was very careful to not go there. She was trying to present herself to Chris as another gal pal, but he wasn't having any of it. He wanted a fully devoted and committed girlfriend or nothing at all.
One thing you might find interesting: Catherine had a chance to get her hands on one of the holiest of holy troll artifacts. Chris was so desperate to get her to commit to a relationship that he offered to give her the Amnyfest Ring; she, of course, refused (that would have been way over the line and she couldn't accept it in good conscience).
Apology Letters
Main article: Apology Letters
17 December 2014[3]
Chris wrote these letters very early in his relationship with Catherine (they were his idea). He wanted to be able to shop and his favorite stores and hang out at the Fashion Square Mall with Catherine and believed that by apologizing, he could get the bans that these establishments had placed on him lifted. (This doesn't completely explain the Mary Lee Walsh letter though.)
The censored portions are where I redacted the addresses of the intended letter recipients. I didn't bother blocking out Mary Lee Walsh's information, since that is already well documented.
The Hooker Story
21 December 2014[4]
Consider this an early Christmas present :biggrin:
Chris sent the attached images to Renee (someone he'd barely known a month) in the form of 2 attached text document.
The documents look to have been copy/pasted from a text conversation between Chris and a friend (whose name I've redacted ).
Anyway, enjoy!
Walmart
3 January 2015[5]
I just got this from a very reliable source.
My friend just texted me that Chris is/was at WalMart causing a scene. I texted her that he just got out of jail for macing someone and she said that he was yelling about having pepper spray. So he's threatening people now with it, I'm assuming.
So if he disappears again, he might actually be back in jail.
There are no further details at this point and nothing more substantial than the message above.
I'll provide more info as I get it.
The following day, Thetan posted:[6]
OK, I have confirmation....
Before we start, I realize that I'm going to get a lot of flack for the way I handled this: I had Renee contact Chris. You'll notice from the texts that Renee is trying to reason with Chris regarding his feeling the need to "protect himself". I may continue the conversation with Renee simply to try and convince Chris that he's being unreasonable and paranoid (although I'll try to be a bit more subtle about it.)
Yes, I used the threat of Catherine not wanting to have anything else to do with him because he's become violent. This is actually something she's done. The Game Stop incident gave her the perfect excuse to break off contact with Chris and she's taking it (more about that later).
Rebeckah Persona
26 January 2015[7]
In response to a user's comment, "Was Rebeckah the one who set up the recent OK Cupid account?":
No. I deliberately stayed away from that kind of thing as Rebeckah. Rather than try and act as a matchmaker, I tried to get Chris to work on improving his self-confidence and social skills.
