[Punicrackder-V figure is sitting on the table]
Ahh, this is pretty much just a fi- bit. So before I conclude, I am just [inhales] going to vent a little bit, right on this part. Actually, they may bring up a bit of well, it may spark a bit of controversy, but you know what? [stress sigh] You haters, fakers, darkest deceiving individuals among all of you that make up the minority, that make up the minority of the billions of people on this very earth. Well, [exhales] I realized something in recent times and days. And you know what? There is a really common thing I hate. I can forgive individuals so much for doing so bad. But just in trying not be to come off as a jerk, which [inhales] let's face it, I will admit I was before, but I'm trying to do better in that. And be more kind and compa-considerate and understanding. But, [inhales] still, [inhales] when it comes to the abuse and things I took over the years, I can take only so f-[Fluttershy yay sound effect]-ing much. So yes, Gwenmi Mikoto and this as well being one representative of the trolls, but between the Crackders, the S.A.V.s, and of course the Punislavs, essential embodiments, if you will, or a form of those that had abused me over the years. So, [inhales] you know what? Just [exhales] the abusers, the deceivers, F-[Fluttershy yay sound effect] THEM! Those that fly around spreading hatred everywhere, F-[Fluttershy yay sound effect] THEM! And of course, the JERKOPS THAT WOULD JUST OVER ABUSE THEIR POWER OF AUTHORITY AND EVERYTHING AND SOME OF WHICH AMONG YOU AMONG YOU THAT DO THAT! Well, F-[Fluttershy yay sound effect] ALL OF YOU! THAT'S HOW I FEEL! Not to say entirely f-[Fluttershy yay sound effect] the police, which of course some of them actually do their job okay, well WITHOUT GOING EXCESSIVELY FORCEFUL and everything, but YOU KNOW WHAT?! It's just, [stress sigh] I have all my experiences from the past near a couple of decades on the internet and boy did I receive a F-[Fluttershy yay sound effect]-ED UP reception that was very mixed. I have faith in the good and better of people [chair squeaks], of individuals in general, but [inhales] my faith gets shaken from time to time and it's just within that I can only take so much, but I know in my heart, in my soul that holding grudges is not healthy. Everybody can appreciate this. It's common sense, it's common knowledge. Okay, so, good vibe towards forgiveness. But I can only- I can forgive. But since like when I'm reminded after even after a time it's just like, you know [inhales] I don't think about it for a long time, it's going to come back and haunt me one way or another. So of course then I get fueled at least for a little while [gasps]. I'll take a deep breath, [blows out air] and let it out and calm myself... and just do my best to move forward. So essentially there is that. So, just that's to let you know... I'm just going to leave it be in this video. I will censor the curse words, which that will be made very F-[Fluttershy yay sound effect]-ING obvious. In that one little example I just put for right there. But, [breaths in through nose] all that aside... I'm going to resume and finish this review video before I take you on to the lovely stop-motioning video I had the great pleasure of putting togeder, and it's just really good. I know you all will enjoy it. And soon enough, you might be able to see it individually, but for the time being, you'll see it only within this video. So, maybe on the way over there you might hear my thoughts again just I have just explained them. Just maybe it's something for food for thought, like you know stop hating, stop faking, and just stop being awful, stop abusing EMOTIONALLY AND MENTALLY. YOU SCAR A WHOLE lot of individuals with that. Okay, you scarred me. I'm not- I appreciate that it does shape me to being a stronger, more character driven individual that I am and so forth, but still [inhales] it all F-[Fluttershy yay sound effect]-ING hurts! Okay? [exhales] ... Alright, with that being aside. [inhales, whispers "breath in", then exhales, then whispers "and take a breath out"] Alright, so. [cuts to a black screen with text]
The following is the original, unedited ending of the Punicrackder V Review Video. Now, you have the context as well.
[cuts back to Punicrackder-V figure sitting on the table] And this is Jesus Christ Chan Sonichu Prime saying remember, you don't stop playing because you grow old. You grow old because you stop playing. And don't let any of those haters, fakers, abusers or toxic individuals tell you otherwise or quell your creativity. So yes, I feel more affirmed every time I say because I am a geek as well. So yes, BE GEEK, BE YOU, BE PROUD! [Smashes Punicrackder-V figure on the table repeatedly] F-[Fluttershy yay sound effect] ALL THE ABUSERS! PFFAAAAAAAAALM! [Chris covers the camera lens with his hand ] Was that okay Mr. Director? YEAH THAT'LL WORK! ROLL THE MUSIC VIDEO! YES!
