“
Chris's spazzing off topic was a HUGE challenge filming. Barb is up there in age but more lucid than people think she is, Chris just has her exhausted.
”
Draft's friend CMCW.[1]
“
Megan actually wanted to be reunited with Chris because she thought it was gonna be fun, but the director went against it because it was gonna be too corny and forced
”

The remains of the hard drive containing the film.
Chris Chan VS. The Internet is a cancelled and (presumed) lost documentary film directed by film student Joseph Draft. Footage was filmed March 2019,[3] and included interviews with Chris, Barbara and Megan. The film would've focused on the current condition of Chris and the long-term effects that internet trolling has had on his mental state. The trailer, a leaked minute from the opening, and two brief leaked clips are the only known surviving portions of the film, and the film remains in limbo, if not outright lost.
Draft has not given a public statement on the cancellation. Potential reasons given by insiders include problems with the Kickstarter campaign, possible harassment by Kiwi Farms, and intimidation by Naught.

History
Geno Samuel talks about what could have been.
On 4 April 2019, the project was announced through a Kickstarter page via a tweet from Chris, and having a funding goal of $20,000. The description on the Kickstarter page[4] initially had very little information on the documentary and no breakdown of how the $20,000 of the budget would be used. The page was eventually updated and described that the film had been completed (to a point) and that the purpose of the Kickstarter was to conduct additional interviews, have more special guests, and to finance costs associated with filming.
Kiwi Farms user CMCW claimed to be involved with the film and made multiple posts answering questions on it. He said that Chris wanted to help provide info for the film, providing his master copy of Christian Weston Chandler...Yep, I'm on TV :) and consenting to recordings inside the house, including a new house tour and interviews with him and Barbara.[5] Draft took additional photos of the The Wall of Originals and Chris gifted him a couple of the cards,[6] as well as artwork (including one of Bundychu). Chris, Barbara and Megan were all paid out of Draft's money for their interviews and were promised a cut of any profits made.[7][8] CMCW also said that Geno Samuel (known for Chris-Chan: A Comprehensive History) and Sachumo (known for his 2015 documentary and 2017 interview of Chris), and others would be participating with the film.[9]
According to Geno, Megan actually wanted to reunite with Chris in person; however, Draft vetoed this, feeling it would be "too corny and forced".[2] According to Naught, eventually, Megan changed her mind on being included in the film, and requested her inclusion be cut.[10]
According to Geno, "Joe's buddy who saw the footage said they got lots of footage of Chris belching and screaming in public, and was all giddy about it".[11]
Cancellation
Draft has not made a statement on the film's cancellation.
His friend CMCW said, in response to criticism from Kiwi Farms users over the Kickstarter, that Draft was despondent over flubbing it and was considering shutting it down.[12] The Kickstarter for the film was indeed abruptly cancelled on 6 April 2019, only two days after its creation.
According to CMCW, most of the collaborators who had tentatively signed on were spooked, and he suggested it was due to hostility from Kiwi Farms users.[13]
On 19 July 2019, Draft joined Kiwi Farms under the username Bombsaway, but avoided mentioning Chris Chan VS. The Internet until 19 January 2020.[14] On that date, Draft posted that "some faggot has been threatening to dox me so I thought I'd beat him to it" and included his own dox, his role having directed the film, and that he also white knighted for Chris.[15]
According to Naught, a Kiwi Farms user who had also interacted with Draft over the chat service Discord, he had allegedly gotten Draft to face-dox himself after a 4-hour conversation once his hard drive containing Chris Chan VS. The Internet was destroyed.[16] Naught claimed that the mostly-completed film was destroyed by Draft out of stress over film cuts and infighting with some of his collaborators.[10] Naught also alleged Draft to have had a key role with the Arbitarch CWC Alliance Discord server and that he had been using it to gather content, and that Naught shut the server down.[16]
According to The WCT in a leaked DM years later, allegedly Naught and Draft had once been friends, but that MKRNightVee had manipulated Naught into turning against Draft, and that this was a cause for the cancellation of the film.[17]
As of October 2024, the film has yet to surface online, so it can be presumed that if it isn't sitting in cloud storage or on a hard drive somewhere, then the unused footage has been lost entirely.
Mentions by Chris
“
You all could have had this genuine and heart-felt gem, but you’ve had to shoot yourselves in the freaking feet by spamming hatred like a bunch of beheaded chickens or ”World War Z” Zombies.
”
Chris expressing his disappointment over the cancellation.[18]
On 20 September 2020, Chris, having discovered a mirror of the trailer on The WCT's YouTube channel, left a comment thanking him for archiving it.[19] Chris later posted his thoughts on it to Twitter.[18] In the tweets, he confirmed that the female voice heard near the end belonged to Megan, and accused trolls of "spamming hatred" and thus getting the documentary cancelled. Viewing the trailer also sparked Chris into having an emotional breakdown over Megan, which he chatted about in The Place.[20]
