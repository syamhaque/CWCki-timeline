================================================================================

"Feel Our Love At Play" is Christian and the Hedgehog Boys's version of Berlin's "Take My Breath Away" (a.k.a the romantic theme from Top Gun), from Christian and the Hedgehog Boys COMEBACK!. The song is about how love is no more than a "game" to be "played."
While singing, Chris makes three false starts, indicating that he has no sense of timing. He apparently doesn't care if he messes up and looks like more of an idiot to Ivy.

Lyrics
[sung over Berlin's "Take My Breath Away"]
Watching every motion in our sweetest true love games
On this great long planet
You and me we know no shame
Turning and entering our sacred share of places inside
[starts before original] Feelin' in- Feeling in slow motion as we look into our eyes and
Feel our love at play
[starts before original again] Feel our love - Feel our love at play
Watching I keep foi-eeling our mutual feels
Never hesitating to reveal what's inside
Turning and entering our sacred share of place inside
Feeling in slow motion as we look in our eyes and
Feel our love at play
Forty hours last I saw you
In time you saayyyyaid
I prayed to our God and Lord I thank Him every day
Around and always I'm am unafraid
Feel our love at play
[starts before original AGAIN] Feel our love- Feel our love at play
Watching every motion in our sweetest true love games
Withheld by the notions of our sacred feelings of shame
Turning and entering our sacred share of place inside
Feeling in slow motion as we look in our eyes and
Feel our love at play
[mumble] Our love!
Feel our love at play
[trying to cover up original's humming] Our love at play...
Feel our love at play
Feel our love at play
