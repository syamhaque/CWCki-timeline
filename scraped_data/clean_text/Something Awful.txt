The Post That Started It All
On 26 October 2007, a user on the website (otherwise known as a "goon"), Vikivil, made this post on a thread about fellow lolcow Ulillillia:[1]
There really must be something about Sonic.
This guy used to leave 'business cards' at my school's library where he would hang out for hours looking for a 'boyfriend-free girl.' This is how I first learned of him. From here, I developed something of an obsession, culminating last summer when I made a special trip to a gaming store and local hangout where he had posted he would be. He was every bit as aspergic as I had imagined.
I present to you...Sonichu.

The video on that page. Priceless.
The topic of that thread shifted to Chris and his antics, and provided so much discussion that a new thread devoted to him was created on the following day, mainly to bring the Ulilia thread back on-topic. Some goons expressed skepticism over Chris, believing him and all of his bizarre online and offline activities to be an elaborate trolling scheme. However, others who were also aware of Chris in real life came to bring up their own experiences with him and confirm this was not an act. User DarkPrism stated the following:
I posted in the other thread, but I've seen this guy in real life. This is no prank. He used to go to the college I attended, until he got kicked out. If anyone here is from Charlottesville, VA, you may have seen him also. He hangs around the UVa Alderman Library and the Fashion Square Mall.
I had seen him around campus and just thought he was in an anime club or something, I never saw him with his signs. I learned a lot more about him when he messaged my sister on Myspace and invited her out for a soda. She declined and he became increasingly more harassive towards her until she blocked him.
Yes, he wears that Sonichu necklace around everywhere he goes.
This wasn't the first online discussion of Chris on the Internet (one of the earliest CWC-related discussions occurred on a Sega forum in 2005),[2] but it was the first to really gain broader attention. Discussion of Chris spread to other websites, and the rest is history.

The last episode of Something Awful's “Webcam Ward”, hosted by the team behind Retsupurae, is a commentary on ECV 00002.[3]
Also, the first episode of The Flash Tub's "Gaming Guyz", while not mentioning Chris outright, directly references his medallion, and how Sonic cured his autism in Part 12.[4]
