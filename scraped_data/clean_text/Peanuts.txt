Good grief!
Megan Schroeder as a Peanuts character.
Peanuts is a popular comic strip and accompanying franchise created by Charles M. Schulz, which Chris has referenced a number of times.
Mentions by Chris
Chris has repeatedly described his high school sweetheart Tiffany Gowen as being like a Peppermint Patty, to his Charlie Brown.
During Chris's first date, his father Bob said Emily reminded him of "Margie" (he probably meant Marcie).
Chris owned Snoopy vs. the Red Baron for the PlayStation Portable, as well three episodes of the 2008 Peanuts Motion Comics series on the PlayStation Network.
During a Mumble chat, Chris claimed that his half-brother Cole sometimes called himself "Joe Cool" (the name of one of Snoopy’s many alter-egos).
Chris uploaded RandomHumor1 to his Flipnote Hatena account. Complete with horrendous drawings and obnoxious high-pitched voices, the animation plagiarizes the Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show episode "Sally at School" word for word.
He also mentioned Charlie Brown in Christian Weston Chandler's FUTURE MESSAGE, but only to distinguish what kind of peanuts he was talking about.
Kevin the Jew from Sonichu #11 is for some reason drawn like a Peanuts character.
Chris posted about loving The Peanuts Movie in November 2015.
Chris made a drawing depicting his pony avatar talking to another pony avatar about a kite-eating tree, one of Charlie Brown's foes in the comics.
Barbara's now-deceased dog is named Snoopy.
While incarcerated at Central Virginia Regional Jail, Chris created "The Schulz Collection," a collection of five pieces of jail art all dated 11/26/2022, the 100th anniversary of the birth of Charles Schulz. They depict Sonichus and Rosechus interacting with the Peanuts gang, with one including Mr. Schulz himself. Some depict events of the 1970s, but one shows a Team Rocket base in 2005. These were all sent to Praetor, who listed them for sale on OfficialCWCmart for $175 each.
