Chris: Hey everybody, Jesus Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu Prime with you once again, on this lovely, lovely Saturday the 27th. And today we are going to be takin' on the Ender Dragon in my Minecraft world. [???]- we've prepared all the tools, using the, uh, video of which I r- which I- we watched, and, uh, got tips on how to defeat the Ender Dragon on the basic level without exploding beds. I might leave a description for that in the link down below. Without further ado, jump right in.

Chris: 'Kay, good. So obviously you'll see their names pop up, my three Minecraft buddies. So there'll four guys against on the Ender Dragon. We got the upgrades. I got an overpowered, I got an up- I got an enchanted bow with infinite... and just look at this, now I got gra-netherite armor! Upgraded all my diamond armor. They helped me upgrade my sword, and give me the mm... great-this-bow.
[cut]
Chris: Oh yeah, built that. Star of wonder, star of might... yes. That was good thing to glow about. I say 'glow', not 'gloat'. [blows raspberry]
[cut]
Chris: Yeah- upgrade my diamond- netherite- oh- Ooh, bonus! [shoots arrows and kills pillagers]
[cut]
Chris: Bonus! I'll take a piece of that, for later.
[cut]
Chris: Let's see, probably just as easy as, uh, going to the settings and enabling voice chat. I don't typically do voice chats, cuz I don't have that many opportunities.
[cut]
Chris: Oh, dope- And plus I have my phone nearby for our ability to talk with each other through Discord.
[cut]
Chris: Our one convenient server.
[cut]
Chris: Anyway, yeah, we've been thinking about this for over- for at least a few days, like about a week.
[cut]
Chris: As you seen in, uh, the last video, after looking for Ender Portal, actually went to the portal and earned that achievement. So, there you go, that was a fun... and an easy way of getting out of that situation, if you were to end up in that situation.
[cut]
Chris: He's viewing chests from ab- top of the chest, that's fun. He got a waterfall on his back.
[cut]
Chris: Alright, I guess we're all just chilling. [bloopity bloops and "meatloaf" noises, and Chris drinks some water]
[cut]
[cut]
Chris: Commentary: I've also been made aware of the, uh... Ender castle... or chamber? It's like a big building in the Ender realm. Very difficult, so I hear. Mi- bunch of little mimics and, uh, purple blocks... I learnt- I'll learn more about that, and, uh, that will be another video for another time. Going to find one of those and taking it on. Being very well prepared in that. We're just three individuals, just chilling and waiting. Win the races, win the races, win the, win the race...
[cut]
Chris: Okay, well, here's the intro! We will be soon entering the portal, we're just waiting for all of us to be together. We're wait- we're doing the intro. [trumpet noises] Introducing the Ender Portal!
[cut]
Chris: M'key.
CookSUCKS123: Yo.
Chris: Yo! Yo, yo.
CookSUCKS123: Yo, yo.
Chris: Heh, cool. You're on microphone, with Mike and the crew! I dunno. Alright, so right- we're just waiting on the other two. Fiend- yeah, Grovyle went to go get something- get some things, and, uh, we're just waiting on the Cook.
CookSUCKS123: Yeah, I should be ready. I think I have, uh... Yeah, I have all the bottles, too.
Chris: Yep.
CookSUCKS123: I don't have any scaffolding though.
Chris: Oh-
Other voice: That's fine, we have several... stacks.
CookSUCKS123: Ok, ok.
Chris: Okay, there we go, we got another one. Yeah, check the, uh, crates. It's i- I believe it's in the bottom left one?
CookSUCKS123: Bottom left... ok, ok. I have, uh- I have a few golden apples as well.
Chris: Great, you could- Great, you could pop them in with the, uh, golden carrots in the bottom right.
CookSUCKS123: Yeah.
[cut]
Chris: Oh, upper left. My bad. Hey, you got your, uh, glass bottles for the dragon's breath?
CookSUCKS123: Yup.
Chris: Groovy.
[cut]
Chris: Oh, were you able to upgrade your sword as well with the netherite?
Other voice: Yeah. I have a full armor and tools made out of netherite. Took a while but I got it.
Chris: Hm. Nice. I gotta find those nether ingots, those nether blocks.
[cut]
CookSUCKS123: Alright, I have, uh... eight golden apples in here.
Chris: Nice.
CookSUCKS123: Nine, actually. Just take some. That's at least two for each.
Chris: I just took a pair.
[cut]
Chris: That was a nice rest, now no phantoms will f-haunt us in the following day.
Other voice: We don't need 'em the following day. We can use their membranes to repair the elytras, once we get some.
Chris: Unh, yeah, elytras, alright. Let there be light! [puts the last Ender eye into the portal frame, which opens the portal]
T4ll3n47: First.
Other voice: Let's go. Boom!
Chris: Best for last! Phzew!
In-game chat
CWCSonichu1982: That sounds good; we'll put them in the chest with the golden carrots by the portal.
CookSUCKS123: Alright
PMDGrovyle: I have some swords I'll take down
PMDGrovyle: I'm down
CWCSonichu1982: That's a thing. Okay.
CWCSonichu1982: Let me try that.
T4ll3n47: oh dope
T4ll3n47: lemme go get my eyes
CookSUCKS123: CWC you should do an intro where we all stand by eachother in our netherite armor.
CookSUCKS123: Before we jump into the ned.
CookSUCKS123: end*
