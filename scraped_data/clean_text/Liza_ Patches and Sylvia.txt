Troll disclosure: Some events in this article take place from October through December 2018, when the Teen Troon Squad had access to Chris's CWCSonichu Twitter account and posted several tweets without his knowledge or consent. Tweets covered on this page may or may not be written by Chris.
For more information, see 2018 Twitter account compromise.
This article is still yet to be completed due to stress. We get a lot of stressful torture in our lives that makes us crash into slumber. Given that inspiration is a big variable, and we may have been lacking of it, this article will be completed as soon as possible, at our own pace... HONEST! This article is missing the following:
• info on TTS, SonichuMerch interactions• events surrounding illness of kittens
From left to right: Liza, Patches and Sylvia.
During October 2018, Chris took in three kittens from the feral cats living in the yard of 14 Branchland Court. He named them Liza, Patches and Sylvia.

“
We have two more kittens that snuck in as well, but they’re in hiding. 😸😸😸

Sylvia appeared in the June 2021 video Sylvia’s being comfy and a little bobble-headed, appearing to be overweight. In the 31 July 2021 fallout of the Incest Call leak, which saw Chris banned from the house and Barbara sent to a hospital for an inspection, a neighbor who was given an extra house key by Chris dropped by to look after Sylvia and the other cats.[3][4]
Liza was adopted out to a friend of his from The End Games, after The Captain arranged communication between them.[5] The Captain also revealed that Liza is actually male and was renamed by his new owner as Tingles.
Patches was the first to come out and socialize on 30 October 2018, making him the eighth Chandler cat. Upon discovery, he was taken to a vet for a checkup and be medicated for conjunctivitis on his left eye.[6]
Of all the cats, Patches had the shortest time as Chris's pet. A week later, on 6 November, Patches passed away, apparently from complications from pneumonia,[7] after Chris had taken him to the vet multiple times.[8]
