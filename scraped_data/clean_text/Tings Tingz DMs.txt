Magi-chan & Cryzel chat
25 April 2018
Tings Tingz & Chris chat briefly about polyamory & Cryzel Rosechu.
Tings's commentary is in bold.
Chris
Fortunately, alongside my two sweethearts, we are polyamorous, so you may ship yourself and I together.
Chris
By the way. Strictly Confidential: DO NOT TELL ANYONE! My sweethearts are Magi-Chan Sonichu and Cryzel Rosechu: the three of us have been married since last March 26. I am keeping it on the down-low to avoid the trolls bothering any of us three.
Tings Tingz
You can trust me, like yourself and autism I have bipolar and know all too well how cruel people can be.
Tings Tingz
Is she related to rosechu?
Chris
No, and she is one of the Special 69 Sonichus and Rosechus
Chris
By the way. I had been mistaken in the drawing of breasts on all of the Rosechus: none of them have naturally large breasts.
Chris
But Cryzel here, she has that cute chest fluff. I still love and care about all of them in my species just the same, anyway.

Prostitution post chat
28-29 April 2018
Tings asks Chris about the prostitution message he posted. It would turn out to be an Idea Guys influence.
Tings Tingz
I just have to ask, is that prostitution post serious?
April 28
Chris
It was, yes.
Tings Tingz
How many customers have you had?
Chris
None yet.
Tings Tingz
Did you get any offers?
Chris
A few
April 29
Tings Tingz
Any you would actually consider?
Chris
A little from column "A" and the latter from column "B".
Chris
How are you today?
Gallery
Tings DM'd Chris over Twitter to ask if the prostitution message was serious.
Lunch with customer
29 April 2018
Chris
How are you today?
Tings Tingz
Doing fine, how about you?
Chris
I'm doing good right now.
I have a lot on my plate today.
Tings Tingz
Ah, busy.
Chris
I have a lunch date with Robert Weaver, the dude who bought a few things from me on eBay who I made the personal delivery of the items the other Saturday. I'm selling him an old single autographed "Sonichu" License Plate of mine, and he's buying lunch
I'm putting my good shirt and skirt on.
Tings Tingz
Getting ready for a dinner date. Nice.
How much did you sell the license plate for?
Chris
Lunch Date. And I'm selling it for $200, cash. I have one other newer single plate that I also autographed that I'll probably list on eBay for $200 soon.
Tings Tingz
I think someone wanted me to ask you, do you still have any Sonichu medallions or amiibo left from the etsy days?
Chris
No, none that I had previously-crafted. And that is not in my creative aura right now. I'm more concentrated in the books. I need to find someone who can manufacture the merchandise for me. I am still shopping around.
Tings Tingz
Thats what I figured, I pointed out the numbers on the back.
Which story has your main focus, I think you had 3 on going stories?
THe Count's orgins, Nightstar's story, Sonichu's orgins reboot.
Chris
I will get back to you on that; I have had Too Much happen these past few months.
I'll talk with you later. I must go now.
Tings Tingz
Have a good time!

Tings sharing additional context, as well as cutting off ties permanently.
Asking to draw Cryzel
30 April 2018
Tings Tingz
I was wondering if I could draw a picture of Cryzel Rosechu, wouldbe allowed to show it off to the public?
Tings Tingz
I won't say shes your sweetheart, promise.
Chris
You may draw Cryzel.
Chris
Go ahead and say she is my sweetheart. Draw Magi-Chan in the same picture: let everyone know they're both my sweethearts. :)

Deactivated Twitter
4 May 2018
Tings Tingz & Chris chat briefly about the Kiwi Farms.
Tings Tingz
I think its the fact that I gave you money.
Chris
Do they know that?
Tings Tingz
Yes
Chris
Oh.
Chris
I'm sorry. Maybe you should go there and clear things up?
Chris
If you've done nothing wrong, there is nothing to hide, am I right?<3
Chris
(Heart emoji)
Chris
Well if you have nothing to hide, just lay low and everything will be Okay?
Tings Tingz
Will do.
Chris
I had a friend on discord, was that you by chance?
Tings Tingz
No, I dont use discord
Gallery
Tings posts DMs with Chris about Cryzel and Magi-Chan and explains why the account was deactivated.
Tings Tingz warning Chris about MKR
Unknown date
Tings Tings warns Chris that MKRNightVee may be associated with the Idea Guy.
Tings Tingz
Are you in a Discord server with MKR?
Chris
Yes
Tings Tingz
Is she feeding you idea guy stuff? You should be VERY cautious of people using that cpu concept to manipulate you.
Chris
No.
Chris
She has no connection whatsoever with Idea Guy, Lukas or any of the Haters.
Tings Tingz
No, but she could be using what they tried to force you to do harmful stuff.
Tings Tingz
Kinda like how every troll uses previous methods developed by former troll bike Clyde Cash or Liquad.
Chris
She is not forcing me to do anything.
Tings Tingz
Thats good.
Chris
Especially anything Bad like that.
Chris
promise you.
Tings Tingz
Just remember, if things get dark or uncomfortable, you can always close the window.
Tings Tingz
Don't wanna see you get hurt.
Chris
Thank you ☺
Tings Tingz
Would you be alright if I shared my question and your responses?
Chris
Yes, you may.
Gallery
Tings was highly suspicious of MKR and warned Chris that people claiming to be CPU Goddesses could be trolls, similar to the original idea guys.
Pre-Block Chats
Unknown date
Tings shows Chris a Kiwi Farms thread on MKRNightVee and the chatlogs of MKR recruiting The Sons of the Miscreants to chat with him, pointing out that MKR's behavior in the chatlogs is a red flag. Chris responds that his head hurts. Tings again tries to persuade him to cut contact with MKR, warning him he will be hurt.
Tings Tingz
Is MKR still messaging you?
Chris
Yeah
Tings Tingz
Did you see that thread on kiwifarms?
Chris
What thread?
[Tings Tingz shares https://kiwifarms.net/threads/meghan-k-ringo-mkrnightvee.52454/ ]
Tings Tingz
She is just reassuring a lie to you by two facing a friendly facade and using the CPU to trick you. She was exposed belittling and mocking you to her friends and was part of trolling scheme.
Tings Tingz
There are pictures of minifigs you shared with her.
Tings Tingz
If you don't cut ties with her, well expect a Fake Clyde Cash return at the end after they humiliate you.
Chris
My head hurts.
Tings Tingz
Your still following MKR. Are you choosing the reassuring lie?
Chris
I'm talking to her about the issue; I have not completely processed the details yet!
Tings Tingz
I highlighted some of her chat logs, give this simpler version a read. Behind the scenes someone is coaching MKR, in the end you will wind up getting hurt.
Tings Tingz
You thought Wise and Boyd were your best friends and you are making the same mistake here trusting MKR.
[Tings Tings then blocks Chris, only to unblock and continue trying.]
Gallery
Tings gives up, blocks Chris and shares content. "Are you choosing the reassuring lie?" a line that encapsulates Chris' life.
Tings Tingz Confronts MKR Directly
Unknown date
Tings Tingz confronts MKR about The Sons of the Miscreants chats, as well as allegedly targeting Chris for harassment.
MKRNightVee
What, are you going to make fun of me too?
Tings Tingz
No, I was just warning Chris of the dangers of interacting with people that feed into the delusions.
Tings Tingz
And I thought you were being nice to her, she did trust you.
MKRNightVee
She did, but I don't know if I can handle everybody hating me, miss understanding me.
Tings Tingz
They care about Chris's well being, how far would you have gone it kiwifarms didn't expose you?
MKRNightVee
It was never my intention to "go far". I just saw a fellow human being as broken as I was and wanted to be friends, to help eachother. I never wanted this.
Tings Tingz
So why did you join a discord server with the intent of humiliating Chris, you made alot of mocking comments, mis gendered her, as well as setting up rules and building a team.
Gallery
Tings brings up the kiwifarm's thread on MKR and points at how MKR was making mocking comments,
mis gendered Chris and was building a team.

even your imaginary friends can't stand you for extended periods. Also the ceiling art Chris is talking
In total that's eighty dollars now given to Chris out of pity.
Chris's inner circle discord channel. This was also during the period where Chris was talking to the Teen Troon Squad, smoking weed with Lukas and discussing the alternate dimensions
Chris talks about his Commodore CPU form's lore.
Chris talks about the 69 Sonichus (an Idea Guy retcon which Tings points out sounds dirty but Chris dismisses as irrelevant).
Tings at least tried to actually help Chris get over his delusions.
