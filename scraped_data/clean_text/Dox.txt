“
Nobody deserves to be doxxed, because they were not ready to reveal themselves truthfully to the world.

Chris[1]
Excerpt from a list of people Chris "doxed" for being "backtalkers" (in actuality, the list only contains their online handles). Note YouTuber OneyNG's presence on the list.
Doxing (commonly referred to as Doxxing) is the release of private or identifying information with malicious intent.
Chris believes doxing is a direct ticket to trolling and therefore (tries to) leak information on his enemies, not realizing that he is either being fed false information the entire time or making gigantic leaps to conclusions along the way.

Chris's attempts at doxing trolls
Clyde Cash
Chris was told that a picture of guido Lee Hotti was Clyde's real face by lordsillynipples. Chris, being a naïve idiot, believed this and made an exposé video on Clyde. Additionally, Chris, through some unknown means, had obtained a picture of a man having missionary sex with another man in a Spiderman costume. He would threaten to blackmail Clyde with this picture unless he left him alone, revealing it bit by bit.
Surfshack Tito
Surfshack Tito incurred the wrath of Chris during the Calling Out saga, as he had stolen Chris's gal-pal (read: shown her how horrible Chris is) and used social engineering to access his PSN account.
Chris's demands for Tito were to make apology videos to him, The Wallflower and Sony. He was also told to give $1,000, but Chris later removed this demand, presumably since he realized it would be outright extortion. In response, Tito made an video where he dubbed a voice over of him apologizing to Chris over a video of a fat guy jiggling his belly.
Thorg
Thorg was the next target of Chris's holy war against the trolls. He was convicted of putting up a billboard calling Chris a homo. His tasks were to put up another billboard in New York calling Chris straight and deleting pages from the CWCki.
Thorg didn't give in to these demands, so Chris revealed his information. Thorg was apparently a man named Jeremy Slonwhite from Vancouver, Canada who worked at a GameStop and doesn't believe in a god. Of course, this dox was inaccurate but Chris believed it to be true, making two more videos to rub it in Thorg's face.
Alec Benson Leary
Even after 2 years, Chris couldn't get over the Asperchu comics, all this pent up rage was used for doxing Alec. He demanded Alec make an apology video and leave the internet before 31 August 2011.
When Alec did not give in, Chris claimed his real name was "Christopher Paul Whitney" from San Antonio, Texas, Also known as the YouTuber "Fatman" but unluckily the dox wasn't accurate.
Fatman other than having a totally different voice from Alec's, is from Rutland, Vermont. Fatman later acknowledged this video and called Chris a dumbass.
Jack Thaddeus
Next in line was Jack himself; his criminal record included making Chris hump his PS3, forcing him to sing OK2BGay, and worst of all; adding pro-LGBT ads to his precious CWCipedia.
Chris revealed his real name was Ahuviya and that he was a communist transgender. Chris insults him by calling him a homosexual while wearing women's clothes and makeup. In reality, Ahuviya Harel (also known as ADF or Phillip Haskins-DeLici) is an infamous lolcow in his own right.
BlueSpike
The last person to be threatened before the abrupt end of the saga. Chris wanted to dox BlueSpike for creating the Julaay meme and increasing the percentage of finding clay in Chris's ass to 100%.
Chris revealed his real name was David from California. His demands for David were to apologize to him and leave the internet.
BlueSpike never released a video due to him being busy writing a summary for To Kill a Mockingbird to pass his English class. Chris too never responded after this due to Bob's death marking the end of this saga.
Jeff/Francine Ouzuo
Jeff Ouzuo also known by his tomgirl name Francine, was subject to a round of doxing by Chris in 2015 for impersonating Chris to con lesbians into having sex, selling unauthorised Sonichu merch and creating Christian Weston Chandler's Adult Chronicles.
Jeff apparently was a transgender who wasn't transitioning very well, lived in Seattle, Washington after running away from Pittsburgh[2] due to being scared away by black men asking for directions. He also liked to pour lemon juice into his urethra and was arrested for urinating in a children's playground.[3]
Larry Vaughn
Chris tried to dox the troll Larry Vaughn to the Watchmen and Null, telling them Vaughn's name was Daniel Arias.[4] The Watchman Naught attempted to publicly dox Vaughn using the name and phone number Chris provided[5] but Vaughn was unfazed.[6] Chris had gotten this "intel" from Bella[4] - months later, Vaughn claimed to have been working with Bella to manipulate Chris.[7]
More Doxing
Many who attempt to help, troll, support or befriend Chris have gotten their private information leaked online, either by Chris himself or one of his many weens.
In the Miyamoto emails, Chris provides Shigeru Miyamoto with the home address of his Aunt Harriet and Uncle Tom, asking him to send them a letter establishing his legitimacy. Shortly after doing this he realizes how stupid this idea was and retracts his request.
LittleAmyChan of the CWCProtectsquad had her face revealed by Chris, as he felt she looked like a troll.[8]
Megan's address, phone number and photographs were put up on Chris's Facebook when he suddenly felt she was to blame for all his trolling.
Mr. Smith, an eBay buyer, was also doxed when he complained about not receiving his goods on time.[9]
The Wallflower had a lot of her information leaked on this very CWCki by trolls when Chris mistakenly revealed her pen name on a LittleBigPlanet level.
Chris doxed 23 of his paying customers to Naught after they had bought merchandise from him on CWCville Shopping. He sent screenshots of the orders, including payment information, to Naught. Naught then posted the orders, which included the personal information, in the Second Layer of The Place.[10]
Chris doxed a customer, Justin, to The Place Discord server, posting his correspondence with Justin uncensored in the server, including identifiable information.[11]
In early 2024, Chris announced an art contest and requested that anyone interested email him. In CWC ART CONEST Round 1, Chris reviewed several art pieces while screen-recording his gmail inbox. While Chris switched between images, email messages - which include information such as names and email addresses - are visible. YouTube later removed the video over a privacy claim.
Chris using dox to stalk people
On his Pennsylvania trip in October 2020, Chris attempted to make an unsolicited visit to YouTuber Emgo316 by visiting two of the YouTuber's purported home addresses which he had found online. Chris failed to meet Emgo as he was no longer living at either of the addresses.

Self-doxing
See also: 14 Branchland Court#Chris and his address
Chris has often doxed himself, such as by dropping his address or phone number in posts and videos. His reasons for doxing himself vary; he may dox himself to prove to others that he is the one and only Christian Weston Chandler living in 14 Branchland Court. He has also doxed himself while challenging trolls to come to his house to fight him. He also gives out his address and phone number to any potential gal-pal over the internet without thinking twice.
During his time at the Rental House in 2014, Chris revealed the name of the street on which he and Barb were living in the title of a video panicking about a nearby brushfire. He did not reveal the house number, although trolls were able to get ahold of it by other means.
Jail address book
In his jail communications from 2021 and 2022 Chris has indicated that he keeps a "Goddess Log" describing his experiences in jail which he intends to publish once he is released. He has also revealed that he keeps a log of the addresses of everybody who writes to him while in jail. Many observers jumped to the conclusion that this meant that Chris intended to publish the addresses of everybody who wrote to him. Chris later clarified that his Goddess Log and his address book are two separate documents and that he has no intention of doxing his correspondents.[12] Praetor confirmed to a January 2024 inquiry that the Goddess Log would be censored to remove names and addresses within it.[13]
Nevertheless, it is still a bad idea to trust Chris with your home address.
