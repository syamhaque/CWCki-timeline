“
Hey, Vivian. I'm﻿ going to tell you right now that if you were trying to offend me with this "South Park" Parody; You Failed. This is just SOO FUNNY! You ought to know I like "South Park", especially the less dramatic, more comical episodes. ROFL

"Grade-F destruction"? Really?
South Park is a popular animated comedy program airing on Comedy Central since 1997. Chris was an avowed fan of the series, later dropping off and not keeping up with newer episodes "for a few years" according to Chris himself in Sachumo's interview. His favorite episode is “Hellen Keller! The Musical”.
His collection of PlayStation Network video downloads and Netflix downloads include dozens of South Park episodes, and he's swiped both its content and style on more than one occasion in his comics.

South Park in Sonichu
Beel
Main article: Beel
Beel is the receptionist at the 4-cent_garbage.com building in Sonichu #8. His appearance seems to be somewhat based on the Satan character on South Park, with the exception of his lack of facial hair and cloven hooves as featured on Satan. The Satan character on the show is a homo, and was engaged in love affairs with Saddam Hussein and other male characters. In Sonichu 10, Beel uses the line "where I was going to go, Detroit?"[2] As Chris himself has confirmed, this is a plagiarism from a South Park episode.[3]
CADD Chef
Main article: CADD Chef
CADD Chef is a minor villain. One can easily tell that this character (although based on Kene Meniru, one of Chris's teachers at Piedmont Virginia Community College) is a blatant ripoff of Isaac Hayes's "Chef" character from South Park, not just in appearance but also in one of his quotes.
Sonichu and Rosechu's Luv Shack
The title of Chris's gallery of hideous Rule 34 is copied from the title of the video game South Park: Chef's Luv Shack.
Sonichu #9
Stan, Kenny, Cartman, Tolkien and Wendy make cameo appearances in the "Dating Education" episode.[4]
Chris fails to grasp South Park
After the release of Chris's audio recording of his April 2010 confrontation with Michael Snyder, Vivian Gee used that audio to compose a parody video, setting the recording to a South Park-style animation that featured Chris in the role of a bigoted Cartman-esque character.
Chris commented on the video's YouTube page, having fundamentally missed the point: "I'm going to tell you right now that if you were trying to offend me with this "South Park" Parody; You﻿ Failed. This is just SOO FUNNY!"
It appears that Chris doesn't understand the show's presentation of characters like Cartman. While Cartman (and to a lesser extent his friends, when they're in their more sociopathic modes) is meant to come across as a selfish little snot devoid of any redeeming qualities, Chris apparently views him as some kind of role model or example of appropriately entertaining behavior, hence his obvious pleasure at the comparison Vivian's video created. Further evidence of Chris having a positive view of Cartman appears in Mailbag 35, where Chris seems to see Cartman as a good Christian looking to save the souls of rest of the children on the show[5], though in some cases, perhaps not.
Chris rarely understands any moral dispensed by television. When he does take one, it's because he's decided that it can be used to justify whatever tomfoolery he's been up to. Unsurprisingly, Chris often misses the original point completely. For example, while attempting to justify his attempt to pretend to be Liquid in an attempt to steal his girlfriend, he claimed that he was "Wrong, but for the right reasons." This comes from another episode of South Park called "Best Friends Forever", where, after a satire of the Terri Schiavo controversy, it is stated that Cartman was "Right, but for the wrong reasons". In context, it meant that his goal of shutting down the vegetative Kenny's life support was the right thing to do (for reasons involving the fate of the universe that are too complex to explain here), but his motivation was completely off mark: he only did it because he knew that Kenny's death would cause him to inherit his PSP. Meanwhile, Stan and Kyle were "Wrong, but for the right reasons", as they wanted to keep Kenny alive in a perpetual vegetative state even though they should just let him die, but they were doing so because they actually cared about Kenny, rather than exploiting the situation for their own benefit like Cartman was. Chris seems to have interpreted this as "If you do a bunch of bad things, like pretending to be someone else in order to steal their girlfriend, you are completely justified in doing so if your dishonest actions lead to a positive outcome, like proving that you are the TRUE and HONEST Christian Weston Chandler and getting laid".
His fear of homosexuals destroying the future, incidentally, emerged from an episode of South Park called "Goobacks", which was a satire on the controversy of illegal immigration. In the episode, a group of rednecks who had lost their jobs to the illegal immigrants from the future decided that the best way to get their jobs back was to destroy the future by making everyone gay so there wouldn't be anybody in the future. It should be noted that although Chris undoubtedly believes South Park is anti gay, the show itself actually preached tolerance towards homosexuals in the episode "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride", which was only the fourth episode of the show's run and introduced the recurring character Big Gay Al, who has been portrayed positively in each of his appearances. In addition, the show openly supported gay marriage in the 2005 episode "Follow That Egg". Show creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone are members of the Libertarian Party, which is known for their support of gay marriage, and would probably be none too pleased with Chris's interpretation of the show's stance on homosexuality.
Chris believes that every fictional character in existence, including his own, inhabits some alternate plane of reality where they can interact with one another. This belief may have partially stemmed from the episode "Imaginationland", which depicted such a locale.
The episode "Guitar Queer-O" parodied the Guitar Hero series by depicting the rise-and-fall narrative of many musician stories through the lens of the game, and had characters treating genuine guitar skill dismissively. At one point, a character is stated to be able to play the game "acoustically", shown by having him play an unplugged Guitar Hero controller and produce an indecipherable clicking of buttons. This episode could well have influenced Chris's belief that playing Guitar Hero is just as impressive as the real thing, and a few videos show similar acoustic performances.
Other mentions
Chris left IRC (16 October 2008) because "Breast Cancer Show Ever" was coming on. He used a quote from this episode ("I am going to shove your ass down your throat and make you eat your underwear!") in his threat to ED.
During a chat, Panda suggested to Chris to put a butt plug inside his ass in order to prevent himself from releasing flatulence. Chris declined, saying that "constriction of the gas-release can result in spontaneous combustion",[6] a belief he most likely picked from the episode Spontaneous Combustion.
Chris bought South Park: Chef's Luv Shack and the "When Technology Attacks!" UMD.[7]
Chris liked the World of Warcraft[6] and Guitar Hero[8] episodes.
Chris imitated Towelie and criticized Kenny in CWCFlyingElephants.
Chris told Clyde and Surfshack Tito, "You both want me to even Beg, you can go point at your own damn snouts and Oink like Eric Cartman, and then Rape yourselves with your own Damn Darth Maul Dual LightSabre."[9]; Cartman's oinking is in reference to "Scott Tenorman Must Die".
Scott Tenorman Must Die was also referenced by Chris while talking to BlueSpike. BlueSpike (posing as Max) wanted to get Chris to burn down his house. Chris did not want to do that, so he began to sing "I'm a Little Piggy", hoping that this would satisfy BlueSpike.[10] In the aforementioned episode, Scott makes Cartman sing the the same song for his own amusement.
Chris referred to Randy Marsh's "naggers" controversy ("With Apologies to Jesse Jackson").[11]
He created a Guitar Hero South Park quiz.
He used Cartman's catchphrase "You’re breaking my balls here" in SHOWDOWN: The TRUE CWC Confronts The FAKE.
He got Panda a musical card where Cartman/Jennifer Lopez sing the "Taco Flavored Kisses" song from "Fat Butt and Pancake Head."[12]
On 30 October 2013, Chris wrote that one of the reasons he doesn't commit suicide is because "premature death leaves one in Limbo".[13] This belief does not cohere with the protestant theology of his Church, according to which salvation is achieved by faith alone. However, it is in line with the episode "Death", in which it is revealed that the grandfather of a minor character is spending eternity in limbo for having his grandson euthanize him.
In Chris Calls Clyde Out, Chris mocks Clyde's Asian ancestry by impersonating him as Tuong Lu Kim, a character who speaks English with a heavy Chinese accent.
In June 2015, Chris replied to a Facebook post mentioning the Swedish Chef with a reference to one of fictitious Rob Schneider film trailers from "The Biggest Douche in the Universe" (which, incidentally, brought popular awareness to the term "Derp").
Chris sang "I'm a Little Piggy" again in a begging video from July 2016.[14]
In an October 2017 interview with CopperCab, Chris mentioned he had not seen South Park in a long time but had heard about a joke the show had done about Trump on a top-ten list video by WatchMojo.
On 4 December 2020, when asked what his favorite episode of the show was in Discord Q&A 11, Chris stated that it was "Helen Keller! The Musical", the thirteenth episode of the fourth season.
On 19 September 2023, Chris gave an imitation of Eric Cartman's "Respect My Authority!" line to a couple who had a Cartman plush with them.[15]
