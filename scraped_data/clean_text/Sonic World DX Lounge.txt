Chris's Introduction
19 October 2020
Hey. Sonichu, here. Rosey, Cryzel and I have been sampling the gameplay from a few videos on YouTube; thinking about downloading it onto Mama's laptop. But, I noticed y'all have Mewtwo as a Mod, yet you don't have Magi-Chan Sonichu, or even me, Rosey or even Mama Chris Chan (herself) in her Sonichu form. Please, include us. Thank you.
Sonichu Mod
16 November 2020
Hey, World Modders and Players; I've been giving Sonic World a play, and it is very good; my only gripe is the occasional glitches, but that's to be expected. Yet I would appreciate such bugs be remedied, still.
I found myself, or rather the mod of me, Sonichu, and I simply loved it. I wanna get in touch with the people who made it, as cited on their uploaded YouTube video, Cirrusfire and Sack Tree, and personally express my gratitude

Also, I've personally updated the Bio the file set; I share it with all of you, so you all may update as you will.

And I offer it to Cirrusfire and Sack Tree to update their uploaded file as well. And I would like to offer my voice for the voice clips to make the mod more authentic.
Gotta Zap it Up. Check y'all later.
Voice Clip
17 November 2020
Hey. I'll need to figure out the full list of situations for each voice clip after counting the files in a voice folder and write up my own script in the near future.
Meanwhile, here is a demo audio track of our voices for the Sonic World Mod.

Thanks a bunch, dudes.
Wanting a ProjectSNT Mod
17 November 2020
Also, side thought: is there a Mod of SNT? If there is, let me know, and someone, please, let Courtney know; she'll no doubt Retweet that all over the place. If not, I feel there should be a playable Mod of SNT for Sonic World. But, again, let Courtney know it will be a thing on that instance of needing to create it. Maybe Courtney would personally lend her voice for the SNT Mod.
Added Voice to Sonichu Mod
27 November 2020
Got my voice personally added to the Mod; still gave Cirrusfire and Sack Tree good credit. Voice files are included with the mod file on Gamebanana.

Expanding on Sonichu Mods
12 December 2020
Hey, everyone. Sonichu, here. And yes, this account that I am typing through belongs to the one and only Chris Chan, herself. Speaking of which, we've been working on expanding on the Sonichu Mods (still figuring out and learning about Fragmotion), but on a simpler method, we managed to get a prototypical Chris Chan and Magi-Chan Mod made, with fresh voice clips and dialogue direct and personal from them. This is not the final product, but we felt everyone should hear them, feel them, and so on at this time.
