A Merchandise Update
Chris continued his sale for the Sonichu medallions. Meanwhile, according to him, he's expected to move back to his renovated house within the next few weeks.
3 December 2014
Medallion Update: I have a few orders to create and ship by Friday now.
Now, my mother and I are expecting to be moving back into our renovated house within the next couple of weeks. And the available count on the medals is apparently low, and eBay won't let me up the quantity at this time. And I am unable to relist the B&W Commission and Autographed Photo listings either.
So, now here is the current deal: I will take more orders until Friday the 5th, and have them rushed and shipped by Wednesday
Now, if you still want to buy medals to share as gifts, I will offer Four Medals for the $100 price under the matching prices Coloured Commission.
And if you pay me $120 through the Works Commission, I will do Six medals.
The basic Sonichu medals are the easiest and quickest for me to make, but I will still take requests for the other characters or customs.
Either way: I will also draw the commissions appropriately, but you Have to choose on the multi deal there: Multiple Medallions, Or a Coloured/Framed Coloured drawing. You WILL NEED TO SPECIFY in the message option when checking out, or after in an eBay PM.
Every Purchase at this time is Also Eligible for a Free Autographed Photograph (optional); You MUST SPECIFY if you want the Free Photo.
Again: Any Orders made AFTER the 5th will NOT be able to be made or filled until AFTER December 25th. So you Have to Order Now, Before the 5th, to Guarantee Your Order to be shipped Before next Wednesday.
Thank you for your understanding, patience and understanding.
Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!
The Hatred of Sonic's Arms: The Backstory
Chris continued his rant over Sonic Boom, revealing that his hatred for Sonic's blue arms started in February.
He later ended his Facebook post with a YouTube link to the Sonic Boom TV Trailer.
3 December 2014
I have just received a question from one of my girl friends: "So, I'm curious, where did you hear about this blue-armed Sonic Issue? Is it something you discovered on your own, or is it a bigger issue in the Sonic community?"
To best answer this question, and to VERY MUCH my visual dismay and further recollection: I HAVE been feeling this SINCE Last February. I needed to search for the ONE Announcement Trailer Video of the DAMN TV Show. I Remember finding it for myself on either Facebook through SEGA's feed, or on YouTube through the video recommendations, on my laptop, as we were moving into the temporary house. I felt UTTER Shock at the sight of the Blue Arms on Sonic immediately as I watched it for the first time that day in Early February, 2014; This Year.
I was too busy and stressed from collecting as much as possible from the burnt house, and bringing them either to our Storage Unit, and this house's basement
I had not thought about the issue much, UNTIL Last June or July with the E3 Trailers being presented on the SEGA and Sonic Facebook Pages! Since Then, I have continuously protested the Blue Arms by commenting and messaging them that "Sonic's Arms are NOT Blue!!!" And among which, I have Warned Them that this sort of thing would NOT end well for them, and it was, and still is, a Very Bad Idea!!!
So, in short: I watched the damn trailer last February, I felt Pissed Off Then, I relearned about it last June or July: I Still felt Very Pissed Off, and NOW I am continually Growing and GROWING More Angry and PISSED OFF AT SEGA, NINTENDO AND CARTOON NETWORK AND EVERYONE ELSE INVOLVED THERE!!!
I have Contacted SEGA and Commented NUMEROUSLY with MONTHS worth of time. They ignored me, Not Responded or Done Anything about it at all, and therefore the time for Talk IS LONG DONE AND OVERWITH!!! AND WE NEED ACTION UPON SEGA AND SONIC BOOM NOW MORE THAN EVER!!!
Thank you.

Protesting Sonic Boom on Miiverse
Chris continued his protest for Sonic's blue arms, this time on Miiverse. He posted these photos and linked to a related article on his blarms page.

Is Meme Run Refundable?
After playing "Meme Run" on the Wii U, Chris posted this on Facebook:
18 December 2014
**The following is an open opinion**
I Hate the Internet Trolls, and I know very well to just ignore them and continue living my life, while they hack into whatever to get whatever emails, text and crap they want, purely for content.
I also am aware of some of the
number of their related, typical icons and whatnot, including "Awesome Smile", "4Chan" Clover, "ANON" green head with question
mark, "PedoBear", Anything from within the Rage Comics, Internet Memes (whatever the hell those are), and whatnot.
I have just downloaded "Meme Run" from the eShop on the Wii U. The details from its listing intrigued me a couple of weeks ago. I figured I might learn more of what the trolls think about all of the time from it, more or less. All "Meme Run" is, essentially, is a LOT of their popular and favorited icons(?) and sounds popping up all over the place, while the Rage Face on a stick body runs, jumps and "slides". It is Chaotic, Sensory Overloading, Loud and Annoying.
I can seriously say that IF this is what the Damn Internet Trolls and Cyber Bullies think of, at random, ALL of the time, for the most screwed up humor of theirs: they all are Seriously Stressed, Weird, Offensive and Mentally Demented and Screwed Up. They must LIVE with Sensory Overloading crap to the point of blending in and being used to it. I would certainly NOT want to go to someone's house with that Loudest Amount of Visual Noise and Distortion. Headaches and Eye Pain! Stress!!!
To be frank and short, about Internet Trolls, CyberBullies, and "Meme Run": Holy F***ing S***!!! You Lot already have your damn HeXBox; stay the Hell Away from SEGA, Nintendo and Sony!!!
Have a good day.
Later that day he added the link:
18 December 2014
Here's the sensory overloading, stress-inducing game I was talking about.
Whatever You Do, Don't Send Me the Blue-Arm Bandit!
21 December 2014
Christmas is going to end up being neutral here this year. The house will not be ready for moving back in before the holiday. So, it'll be just a day at home with the family.
If anyone wishes to send a present or gift card, please consult my Wish List and Gift Card photo albums here. I Really still Require the big Grand Emporium Lego Set.
And, if you're going to be sending a joke gift: a lump of coal, or a copy of the blue arm bandit Sonic Boom games would be the most offensive to me.
Merry Christmas, Happy Haunakah, Happy Kwanzaa, and Happy Other Holidays too. And have a good and safe day.
For some reason he later deleted the last line.
Buy the Car Already
21 December 2014
1996 BMW Z3 1.9
Please, someone Serious with All Cash On Hand: Buy This Car From Us, or you might not be able to own it Today! Call Barbara Chandler at [REDACTED] to talk about the car and seriously buy it now.
Kim replied:
FYI, the market value for that car is only like $3k. You're gonna have to lower the price to sell it.
Good luck! :)
Chris countered:
Call My Mother and Tell HER That! She is dead set on the Ten Grand.
Don't Call Anybody

It's been a fair year. Thanks for being a part of it.

Attention Everyone!!!
To preface what has happened recently, I simply remind everyone that Sonic The Hedgehog's Arms Are Not Freaking Blue!!!
If ‪#‎SEGA‬ had Never changed them, or reversed the change between February and November of this year in the new Sonic Boom video games AND Cartoon Series on Cartoon Network, as well as the Toys and whatever else, I would Never Have Had to Protest and Rebel the way I have, including the creation of my group, FIX SONIC'S ARMS IMMEDIATELY, SEGA!!!
Within my groups, I have lead by example to push forward to the path of Waking SEGA Up and Forcing Them to Change Sonic's Arm Colour Back Immediately. And to confess, I HAVE DONE MY PART FOR REAL! I had personally gone into three of the four local GameStops (EXCLUDING the Fashion Square one) THREE TIMES to Personally Protest in my Silent Way. First Attack: I printed, as seen on the Facebook Group, the Fronts of the Sonic Boom Game Inserts, affixed double-sided tape onto the backs, and affixed them onto the fronts of their respective display game boxes on the shelves. Second Attack, about a week later: I checked the success of my first attack: damaged a few original inserts pretty well to full removal. And of what were still there, I made attempts to transfer the inserts from the original cases into Behind the inserts of different games. I've had to briefly explain my reasons and the Protest, and told them that they should NOT BE SELLING THE BLUE_ARM_BANDIT GAMES IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND THAT THEY SHOULD SEND ALL OF THEIR REMAINING STOCK OF SONIC BOOM GAMES AND STUFF BACK TO SEGA, TO MAKE THEM CHANGE SONIC'S ARM COLOUR BACK IMMEDIATELY!!! They did nothing. And one last week later, the Third and Final Attack, and the ONE and ONLY time that the Fashion Square Location had been involved as well. I made up and printed faux price tag decals, with the short note to discourage purchase of the Blue Arm Bandit games, and promote the Protesting Boycott. And with the Five Wii U software cases that each melted a bit from the MY House Fire Last January, as well as Five Smoke Damaged 3DS Game Cases (no melting), I had printed a full front, side and back insert with the boycott encouragements, and the notes on the back to make the stores send their remaining stock Back To SEGA!
I Have ran into individuals giving me Bad Grief for my Protest and Actions, OUTSIDE from the Fashion Square Location, but I HAVE done my duty in full to the best of my abilities at the individual moments and circumstances.
I also HAD Hidden ALL of the Blue Armed Sonic Toys at Toys R Us here, concealed hidden amongst their metal cupboards, so they ALL would NOT be SOLD, and Best Boycotted for The Protest! They remained hidden for the longest time of over a Month; found and reshelved near the 20th of December to my personal dismay and crestfall. And at Best Buy, ALL Copies of THEIR Sonic Boom Games are STILL SUCCESSFULLY CONCEALED AND HIDDEN from View AND Purchase!
Anyhow, AFTER the Final Attack for the Protest, near a week later, on December 8, I had typed, signed, addressed and US Mailed apology letters, with the promise to have been done with my In Person Protest Deeds with No Further Action therein, to ALL but the Fashion Square GameStop, and I had sent one to Toys R Us as well. I had thought the FS GS would overlook the ONE attack of Protest on them, but obviously, I was mistaken.
Which brings us up to now.
Last Friday, the 26th, my mother and I were at the mall, getting pizza and spaghetti for lunch. She had informed me of a good Mini Refrigerator deal at Sears, so after eating, I made my way to check it out. NOTHING ELSE HAPPENED AT SEARS, and I went NOWHERE NEAR JCPENNY that day. There was a good 3.1 Cubic Foot Fridge for $129.99 that caught my eye, but that is to be purchased later.
On the way to Sears, I peeked into the GameStop, and I spotted a New Skylander Figure: Blastermind. I was set to buy it, and I was going to consider checking out their Wii U Preowned Software selection in their 3 for 2 deal. Innocent; I was NOT Looking for Trouble. But then this MALE Loomed out in front of me, frightened the crap out of me, and he said in a BOOMING VOICE that ONLY scared me worse, "YOU ARE BANNED FROM HERE. YOU NEED TO LEAVE NOW." But still determined to continue my shopping, I veered into the Wii U direction, when his female accomplice startled me and boomed in as well. Still feeling frightened and mentally overloaded, I made a grab for my pepper spray to use In Defense. I offered a few Peaceful solutions, but she ended up sending him to go get security. So, I shouted, "Fine! I'm Leaving", and I dropped the figure. And on my way out, I told the MALE to Not Get Anyone, and we both stopped near simultaneous. I still felt my own worse from wear with the fear, startle, paranoia, and I did NOT want him following me and causing more trouble upon me. And then in my defense and to make my escape, I spritzed a miniscule amount of the pepper spray Downward; NOT into his face. And then I left.
I did not learn until much later that the spritz had done a lot worse than I had imagined it would, as well as learning that they were the so-called "Manager" and "Ass Manager" of that particular store.
I had No Idea of the contents of the Pepper Spray, OR that it was Illegal for use in certain situations in the state of Virginia at all.
And, I HAD tried the stuff on myself days before in the upstairs bathroom. A Two Second Spray onto my left wrist, some of it got onto the bath tub wall as well. Like sampling a perfume or deodorant. It Took Me Out damn well. I had to open the windows, turn on the bathroom fan AND aim the box fan into the bathroom to air the place out, and I wiped the wall off as well, and OF COURSE I washed my hands. It took fifteen to thirty minutes to make it bearable in there again.
In the end, Yes, I went along peacefully when the "Police" arrived to collect me, and I had to spend a miserable weekend in Jail. And I just got out on a bond and bail; yada, yada, yada.
In the END, I WAS the Victim; I did not cause the original provoking; The "Assistant Manager" Made the First Attack ONTO ME and Provoked my defensive response. I was Minding My Own Business; NOT Looking for Trouble, and then HE Startled Me, similar to a potential Rapist in a Dark Alley in a big city. ANY of you would have done the same as I Have in Defense AND Escape!
And we can SUE SEGA for Changing Sonic's Arm Colour and Ultimately, this MALE getting Pepper Sprayed! Think About It Seriously!
And my Protest Actions are NOT acts of "Vandalism", regardless of your individual perceptions. It was NOT Vandalism, but Good Protest when in around 2004, At Fashion Square, I tried their NEW Soda machines with a credit-debit card slot, and then I learned of the FIVE DOLLAR SURCHARGE that brought my bank account into the Freaking Red! I subtly Posted Sticky Note Signs onto each machine shortly after, "This Machine Charges You Five Dollars per Card Use". A few days later, the Original Machines returned! Nobody gave ME Any Freaking Grief or Complaints at all about that!
AND if you REALLY want to see the Whole Mess Happen, go find the Security Tape of the time of Point A, my finding Blastermind to Point B of my departure from the store.
Now, if you will excuse me, I have a LOT of much required Packing to Take Care Of.
Good Day.

Still Halloween for Chris
On 6 December, Chris continued his protest against Sonic Boom after discovering that the show was renewed for the second season. He later on posted a link again to the Gamnesia article.
BOO!!! I would only permit this happening ONLY IF THEY HAVE CHANGED THE ARM COLOUR BACK FOR THE ENTIRE SERIES!!!
And furthermore, this notion and News is most Utterly Repulsive and Inexcusible!!!
Chris Could Use This Advice
On 21 December 2014, Chris shared the following post by "Hotdiggedydemon":
Never take your friends for granted. Video games and the internet are not a substitute for genuine human interaction. Without real friends, you will always be unhappy.
