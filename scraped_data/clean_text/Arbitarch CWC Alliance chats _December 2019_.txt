This article is still yet to be completed due to stress. We get a lot of stressful torture in our lives that makes us crash into slumber. Given that inspiration is a big variable, and we may have been lacking of it, this article will be completed as soon as possible, at our own pace... HONEST! This article is missing the following:

Tri Sonichu - Good Morning, @everyone.
I see you all have read as well.
Jacob DM'd Christine on Twitter similar threats and messages.
What he's saying is that he would not as much merge the dimensions, but bring in demons and evil upon the Earth.
We had foreseen this possibility.
Adjudiarch/Kylechu
Everybody lies
Chris
For the moment, we continue on as we will; our efforts will win the days; this possessed Jacob will never win.
And we shall win over Jakoba and the Rokat.
Adjudiarch/Kylechu
I'm saying it might be worth considering he lies about even more
Chris
Obviously there are a number of fabrications in his statements.
He is even more scared
And so are the demons he talks with, including Jakoba.
They're trying to scare and inhibit us, but it is not going to work.
I'll check back later.
I see Aqua's phone is disabled for the time being.
helper
I think Jacob has less power than he claims to have. Nevertheless we should still be on guard. (edited)
Cpu aqua
Evening Tri sorry i missed you, yes my phones refuses to turn on so im not sure if its the battery or the phone finally giving or something else. But i think with Jacob we shouldnt take these threats lightly. christine must put her foot down with him cause this attatude is very unsettling
Chris
I will be sure to relay that suggestion to her, although her body was one step ahead of her.
Adjudiarch/Kylechu
I'm worried he might not understand what it means when you say "never abandon"
Chris
I concur; he's still blind-sighted by the BREAKUP.
Cpu aqua
I sense that christine wishes to be "just friends" but jacob refuses to accept that
Chris
Very perceptive
Cpu aqua
Ive had relationships like this and they usually never end well
Chris
Eventually, she will have to give him a hug, in person, to completely heal him, but that is still a long while ahead, and before the fated battle against Jakoba.
Cpu aqua
Jacob will say and do anything to manipulate christine into getting what he wants. Thats toxic and not tollerated. Val sense Jacob has no power and this is all just a game to him, he never senses any "spectors" in those photos hes posted, and pictures and be edited to make thing there that werent
Chris
At least you're mind is on the battle techniques and improv.
I gotta get back to Colouring Christine's drawings
Chris
And I'm listening to KimPossible on Disney+.
It motivates Christine's mind to have the classic and familiar background noise.
Chris
I'll check back later for Aqua's drawings.
Cpu aqua
Im still working on them. Im still worried is all
Chris
Hey.
I have some cards of the other CPUs, and Kylechu, to share for their view and consideration.
[Posts a cropped version of this image.]
I'm tired.
I'll check back later.
I pray you can replace your 3DS, soon, Aqua.
p!catch Weedle
Cpu aqua
Very nice cards and thank you ill try QAQ
CPU bismuth ♡
Nice!
helper
Awesome!
Adjudiarch/Kylechu
Great stuff.
Chris
The pack now has 28 cards.
Pending Onix Heart, there's room for up to 12 more cards in this pack.
Adjudiarch/Kylechu
This is the Andromeda set?
Cpu aqua
what kind do you need
Chris
Yes
And I just impulsively felt like making the package front and back.
Chris
It's the Packaging.
Adjudiarch/Kylechu
Ya
Chris
and it show y'all together as a group.
2 December
Chris
Christine - Hey, @everyone.
I am back in my body again.
The work was very hard in the reharsals for getting my hubby through the glitch I had made through the Rokat's VR app.
Meanwhile, earlier tonight, the replica gazebo and our setup (very well-hidden as it was) was discovered and almost compromised.
We had to stop the Rokat soldiers from taking it down and removing our tools.
We've recovered Everything.
I managed to use Chaos Control to sway the troops into confusion and attacking each other, while during the Faster Than Time moment, we collected all of the items and relocated them all to the actual gazebo, right here.
And in the end, the fail-safe went off on the glitch, and the replica gazebo had to go as well.
We've got the setup about the same as before, but here now, and I'll have to personally go out to the Gazebo tomorrow and add more power into it, personally, with my rainbow aura and all.
So much for that Temp Job and sparing a couple of individuals from being the Rokat's slaves.
Aside from that.
Chris
@Cpu aqua, your earlier question: the type of cards needed for the remainder of the N&TWFA Expansion will all be either Ship or Goal cards, so the situational drawings of what you see on between Kidasuna, within the Rokat's Empire, and in the Andromeda galaxy that you will be, and/or are, drawing and their respective content stories will be more than sufficient.
Thank you.
Speaking of the temp VR job.
May as well share the flavour text and short story.
Cpu aqua
yes, that may...take some time, without the ds, i could try in a base but i cant promise anything good 😩
Chris
Have you considered going with a less-expensive 2DS?
they have them available in the New format, like the 3DS, and it closes.
Adjudiarch/Kylechu
I never really got why people try to use slavery when writing about advanced economies, makes little sense
CPU bismuth ♡
If it wasn't for you no one would even know of the Rokat empire or jacob. Glad to have you back!
I've missed you! I hope magi - chan relayed the info that I've gathered the oracles and mages asked for.
Chris
He did, thank you.
🙂
I'm checking gamestop.com for 2DS options
Chris
https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/more-platforms/nintendo-3ds/consoles/products/nintendo-3ds-xl-system---super-mario-bros-2-edition/10129119.html
They have a Cyber Deal on pre-owned 3DS for as low as $79.99.
Adjudiarch/Kylechu
They must get the hardware pretty cheap, neat
Chris
It's good Online until December 3, 2:00 AM, Central Standard Time.
oof!
a couple of hours left.
Chris
Meanwhile, I'm chillin' with some choice classic Simpsons episodes on Disney+ until when this body is ready to crash again.
Tri had to deal with my body crashing at about 5 PM today, and napped for a few hours.
Chris
@everyone, as foreseen, now was, indeed the time; I have personally created and enchanted the Light Powered Celestial Mojo with my set of stones.
This will nullify any negative effects Jacob may use tonight and in the future, even upon using his dark Celestial Mojo.
Cpu aqua
Thats great, im very relieved
Chris
I am glad I was able to get the intel a few days ago while in Tri'a body from the confidential Rokat files.
It is very helpful to be digitally-linked and able from within the software and hardware.
Put a finger into a USB slot to access the computer files.
Or, rather, my soul was directly-linked through Tri's mind and through the VR helmet.
Adjudiarch/Kylechu
Well, that wasn't in the IEC 7816, still, cool
As for Jacob, who is he going off on, been yelling at some guy on twitter for a while now
Chris
So I have heard through the phone Notifications.
At least I can dismiss them easily, but I still needed the motivation to do this now, as it was the proper timing.
Adjudiarch/Kylechu
But why involve you in it?
Keeps on ating you and someone else
Chris
When one is deity-level and able, protocols tend to be overridden.
Because I remain a central conduit for the Dimension Merge, among other things, and I am the one who will work with everyone to be most able to counter the greater threats and so forth.
I must stand with everyone and lead the charge.
Adjudiarch/Kylechu
I know you gave some statistics of fatalities in the past, right?
Chris
?
Adjudiarch/Kylechu
Thats where I'm hung up on
Chris
Ah
I remember
Adjudiarch/Kylechu
The ones on the napkin
Chris
It is conflicting, but the numbers are relevant in making sure the Earth is not too overpopulated when bringing in the main and involved individuals who are slated to lead onward and forward, and to merge the number of which with their self-counterparts on either side, as appropriate.
I am bringing to ware down in the mind right now.
I'll likely be crashing for a rest soon.
Adjudiarch/Kylechu
Hm, intersting, still a bit disconcerting
Chris
I realize and understand.
It is best not to dwell on it.
Goodnight
Adjudiarch/Kylechu
My moral code suggests I do
I don't wanna be at fault
And the living half might resent this
Actually, given the sample size, kind of impossible otherwise
3 December
helper
I agree Kylechu, the fatalities caused by the merge are concerning.
6 December
Chris
Hey y'all.
I'm working on the pack based off of Helena's images featuring Magi-Chan.
I ended up making a couple more Promo cards.
@Cpu aqua, congratulations.
Chris
Also, how is the progress on your work on imagery of Kidasuna and Rokat?
Cpu aqua
I love it Christine! Also im still working on it, saddly i have a bad habit of getting distracted im so sorry
Chris
Yep.
ADD is not a good joke at all.
But when one can remain focused, despite it, that is a very good moment.
Slightly off-topic, from "She-Ra", I like Entrapta, but she has SOO much Attention Defecit Disorder, it is not funny.
Believe me, I know from personal experience.
Cpu aqua
Of course and thats what ive been distracted with, ive gotten sucked into the show
Chris
Irony
Chris
I like listening and binging to shows or tunes in the background while I work, but it works easier if the show is one that I have seen and enjoyed before.
Fortunately, I've watched a lot of Disney animation growing up.
So, KimPossible in the background is real Boo-Yah.
Chris
My favorite "Come On, Ron" line from Kim, from the episode with the underground robot combat, was when she says "Come on, Casa-No-Duh."
It's on Disney+
Chris
Worth the subscription, especially if you get it bundled with Hulu and ESPN.
Adjudiarch/Kylechu
ESPN? Like, sportball?
Chris
The only things Proud Family on Disney+ at the moment are the movie and the Crossover episode on Lilo & Stitch.
Cpu aqua
I wanna get it to finally see how gargoyles ends
Chris
There's more info on Disney+'s website.
Do it.
helper
Have you guys seen that live action Kim Possible movie? I heard it wasn't good.
Chris
Gargoyles are on there.
haven't seen that, and I have heard the same from KP (ILoveKimPossibleALot)
She didn't like that LA movie either.
Chris
Wanna watch "Darkwing Duck" and both past and present "Duck Tales"?
That, and Rescue Rangers, Tale Spin, Goof Troop and Gummi Bears are all on Disney+
Chill the hate with reliving Disney Afternoon.
Chris
I was addressing @helper on the hate part of my note.
Not yet, but they have RECESS
and Doug
Chris
I hear the Mandaloran series is good.
Chris
I still need to catch up.
Farthest I still am is Part VI, and watched "Clone Wars" when it was on Cartoon Network and Netflix.
Adjudiarch/Kylechu
Its all committee designed stuff.
Chris
I agree, partly, on the no soul aspect.
at least in the more modern features.
Chris
I agree, partly, on the no soul aspect.
at least in the more modern features.
Adjudiarch/Kylechu
I appreciate George Lucas' awful dialog
"I hate sand"
Chris
Live Action Lion King or Aladdan, anyone?
Adjudiarch/Kylechu
Is it live action? Theres a lot of CGI.
Chris
CGI, LA; it's pretty much the same 1218-"Realistic"-Detail up or downgrade.
helper
I guess it's CGI
Adjudiarch/Kylechu
Penguins of Madagascar, thats the best series.
Chris
depending on how you look at it.
Chris
I'm going back to work; I wanted to share the Promo card and check in.
Be safe; I love you all.
