Anna Elizabeth McLerran is a gal pal and white knight who met Chris through her job at the Pac Sun in the Charlottesville Fashion Square. Chris was brought to her attention when, during the Love Quest era, he started advertising himself in front of the store. This inspired her short story The Tale Of The Crazy Pacer, published early in 2005 on her blog.[1]
Soon after publishing the story she befriended Chris. Chris made romantic advances towards her until she told him she was a Mormon and a lesbian, even before coming out to family, in order to rebuff his advances.[2][3] Chris refers to her as proof that he can be friends with homosexuals.[4]
In summer 2005, Chris helped to throw Anna a surprise party for her 20th birthday along with her other friends. Soon after this Anna moved to Salt Lake City, Utah with her family.[5][6] Since then her relationship with Chris has been mostly long-distance, although a picture of her with Barbara from August 2016 shows that she has visited the Chandlers on at least one occasion since then.[7] Apparently Chris did not learn that Anna was a lesbian until after her move, indicating that he still saw her as a potential girlfriend even when she was living across the country from him.[8]
According to Anna, she has a form of autism.[9] In a letter dated 22 October 2021, Chris also claimed she is autistic.[10]

Protection of Chris
After Christian discovered The Crazy Pacer story on Encyclopedia Dramatica, Anna felt a need to defend Chris against the internet at large. In a textbook case of white knighting, she edited Chris's ED page. Anna added a new section to the article:
“
I wrote that blog back when I didn't know Chris personally. I got to know him soon after that, and we became real friends. He's a really nice guy, with a great sense of humor. Yes, to the outsider he is quirky, and some of his actions and the things he says can be funny, but at the same time he cares deeply about his friends, and all the other good stuff nobody looking at this page wants to hear about. I just wanted to put that out there, though, since I obviously can't permanently delete the blog inclusion. I'll just have to wait until this whole website is shut down for good.
”
Note from Anniebannany[11]
This passage was so masturbatory that ED users assumed Chris himself wrote it, and it was credited accordingly. However, in December 2009, Anna admitted to writing the article section herself.[12] It is unknown why she had actually befriended him, but according to her, her intentions were pure.[13]
“
C-Chan continues to crack me up with his antics. I know he's straight, but LAWD. If that boy would just heed even a few of my warnings, I flatter myself to think he'd go far.
”
Anna (clearly delusional)[14]
On the night of 5 December 2009, socialite Nicole Richie tweeted an infamous leaked picture of Christian in his mother's underwear to troll faux-punk guitarist Benji Madden. Anna replied asking that the picture be taken down, "nooo!! that's my friend christian!! you should take this down...he's autistic and does whatever the internet tells him to do :(".[15] Anna went on to criticize the CWCki and other sources about Chris, claiming that "there is very little truth to anything those websites say about him. trust me on this one. he is an awesome guy in real life. super nice."[citation needed] This is all very amusing when you consider her initial reaction to seeing the picture: "WHAT THE FUCK hahahahahhahahahaaha he's getting so famous!!"[16]
Chris dons the armor
On 5 May 2012 Chris and Anna reversed roles when he posted a Facebook note in which he played the part of the white knight:
“
She does NOT deserve to be bothered by you doofy trolls at all. It has always been ME you want. [...] Yes, she is cute, and it is possible that she may look like my mom at a younger age, but I do not see my mom in her, and she is who she is, and I respect Anna as a friend.
Aim your shit towards me alone, and Leave All of My Friends and Family alone.
”
Chris
Chris has stood up for Anna in the past as well. On 14 March 2010 he wrote a blog post on the CWCipedia asking the CWCki's webmaster to remove from her website all mentions of Anna's name (and of the names of several other acquaintances of his) in the same way all mentions of The Wallflower's real name were removed from the CWCki.
Anti-troll plea to Catie
Anna attempted to stop the troll sweetheart Catie from further influencing Chris. Unfortunately, Chris had met Catie at that point and was completely infatuated - Anna was fighting a losing battle. Her last‐ditch attempt to dislodge Catie was an attempted appeal to Catie's humanity:[17]
You really need to leave Christian alone. It's so painfully obvious to anyone on the outside that you have a fake profile specifically designed to troll him. Just about every paragraph holds a clue against you. The fake license was a pathetic effort, but one you knew would work well enough on someone naive. Too bad you used the wrong font, didn't match the background color, made your fake signature longer than the signature box would allow, and forgot to put the second signature over the picture.
I don't care what you're hoping to get out of this--whether you want to troll him to do something funny, or simply get him to trust you to ultimately help him. You are doing far more damage than you think. You're messing with an autistic man who simply won't see the truth because he wants the lie so badly. And that's sick. You're not just messing with him, though--you're messing with his mom, and you're messing with me.
Whatever your opinion of his mom is, it doesn't give you the right to break her heart either. She doesn't deserve to be given false hope that maybe her son HAS found a soul mate and WILL be taken care of after she's gone. Because that's her greatest fear, and you're playing on it like a predator.
So just stop. I know you're probably pretending to be upset with him right now so that you'll get him desperate enough to do whatever you tell him. It's obscene. Let it go, walk away. Delete the fake accounts, and never do anything like this again.
Opposing the Idea Guys
The Idea Guys are trolls who allegedly conned Chris out of $6,000 by threatening his imaginary city CWCville if he didn't give them money, often in the form of gift cards. Anna found out that Chris was buying up gift cards and asked The Captain if he could help intervene.[18] In April 2018, The Captain was able to do so by purchasing the Amnyfest Ring from Chris, who had sold it to raise funds to pay the Idea Guys, then claiming to Chris that the ring was sending him messages and that the personas used by the Idea Guys should not be trusted, which successfully severed their contact with Chris.[19]
Anna had previously vouched for The Captain months prior to the Idea Guys saga, and The Captain believed that buying the ring on its own probably wouldn't have gotten Chris to trust him, but that and Anna's vouching got him there.
A group later dubbed by the CWC community as the Guard Dogs began to form. Their initial goals were to distract the Idea Guys while the chatlogs between them and Chris could be exported, and to attempt to use the chatlogs to report the Idea Guys to law enforcement. Anna helped, but a dispute occurred over her wanting time to focus on her college finals before trying to report the Idea Guys, and The Captain was unwilling to wait. Anna left the group after Null was brought onboard, who she didn't trust.[18]
Advice to Chris
On Chris's threat of violence
On 12 May 2012, Chris posted on his private Facebook a threat of violence directed at Mimms and his girlfriend. Anna warned him:
Threats of violence are a really bad thing to have up on your Facebook when you have a trial pending...I would remove or edit this status if I were you
Chris then backtracked and claimed the post to have been a ruse.[20]
On homosexuals
On 28 March 2013, Chris posted the following to his Facebook account, complaining about media coverage of the historic Hollingsworth v. Perry Supreme Court deliberations:
“
Another thing that really Grinds My Gears:
I mean no personal offense, and I am For Lesbians being together and their marriage. But I am really offended with the damn homosexual males altogether. So I am like 50/50 on the current topic in the newspapers, but I am 100% sick, tired and disgusted of having to read at least the headlines in the Post. Talk about something else already!
”
Chris on Facebook[21]
Anna criticized Chris's logic:
“
it isn't right for you to be okay with lesbians and not be okay with gays
”
Anna
The next day, Chris responded:
“
Like it is not right for me to prefer women over men for attraction and companionship? Or a number of women not liking women over men for their catty attitudes?
”
Chris, not making any sense whatsoever
As seen above, Chris's reply was nothing but an incoherent red herring, completely side-stepping the original question of why it was right for lesbians to marry and not right for gay men to. The real answer, of course, is because, to Chris, gay men are disgusting and lesbians are hot.
Other mentions
On 5 August 2018, Chris and Anna both watched Rekieta Law's video on the Idea Guys. The video included a recap of a thread written by Null, The Chris-Chan Extortionists, which had included a vulgar tirade against Anna and Rocky Shoemaker. Anna complained to Chris about her portrayal. In response, Chris tweeted in defense of Anna and Rocky, stating that the accusations against Anna and Rocky were false, that both did not refuse to help report the Idea Guys to law enforcement, and that they had both been unable to do much with the police. Chris also took offense at Null's vulgarity, writing that "to tell them to “F” themselves is Simply Just Wrong." Chris asked for an apology to the two. Throughout his tweets, Chris avoided referencing Null by name, instead referring to him as the post-writer.[22] In response, both Null and The Captain pressured Chris into backing down by threatening to pull their support. Chris deleted the portions of the tweets about Anna and Rocky.[23]
In his September 2019 fantasy role-play scenario Psychic California Trip, Chris mentioned Anna. In it, he wrote that he (possessing Magi-Chan's body) had run to California from Virginia, and detoured to Utah to see Anna at her home. In the scenario, Chris does not inform Anna in advance of the visit, instead showing up in her living room and using Magi-Chan's powers on her mind to make her see his spiritual form.
On 1 May 2024, Kiwi Farms user BeatboxBill made a post claiming to have contacted Anna after the revelation of Chris's affair with his own mother. The user also claimed that Chris attempted to contact her while in jail, but she adamantly cut all ties with him:[24]
Anna deleted her old account and made a new one after she found out about Chris.
I messaged Anna after Chris was arrested asking her what she thought about the situation and from what I can remember she said something amongst the lines of "It made me sick to my stomach! I knew Chris was somewhat of a creep, but I never would have thought he’d be capable of doing something like this…"
Anna has since then cut all ties with Chris, she’s blocked his number as well as his email.
Chris did wrote Anna a letter from jail, but she did not bother to open it, let alone read it.
She tore the whole thing in half and threw it in the trash so it’s safe to say the two of them will never ever speak again.
I would share screenshots of the conversation we had, but it would be pointless because Anna has since deleted her old account so it doesn’t show her profile picture which makes it look like anybody could have sent those messages.
Also, I forgot my Facebook password to the account we talked on and the email address registered to account has been deactivated so I wouldn’t be able to get the screenshots in general.
Despite this, Chris still follows her account on Duolingo, a language learning platform that he joined in October 2023.

"I picked out and bought the cake for her. It was a nice party."
A seemingly innocent party…
…with cards…
…the close company of friends…
…cake…
…(too hard to tell)…
…aaaaaaaaaand here's Chris.
One of these people is more awkward than the others.
Yes, she was smiling, but you can see that on the inside she was dying.
