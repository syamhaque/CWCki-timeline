Kamala Harris served as the 49th vice president of the United States, part of president Joe Biden's administration. Following Biden's decision to suspend his 2024 presidential campaign, he endorsed Harris, passing the torch and giving her the momentum to become the Democratic nominee. Harris subsequently ran against Donald Trump for the presidency.
Unlike 2020, when Harris was part of the Biden-Harris ticket, Chris has expressed a greater support for her candidacy, creating multiple campaign signs for her. However, despite this critical political endorsement (or possibly because of it), the Harris-Walz campaign was defeated by Trump-Vance.

Chris's art supporting Harris
2020
For the 2020 election, Harris ran a campaign for the presidency, but dropped out and endorsed Biden. Biden later returned the favor by selecting Harris as his candidate for vice president, with the Biden-Harris ticket being solidified at the Democratic National Convention.
Chris acknowledged the duo in October 2020, hoping they would defeat then-incumbent president Donald Trump.[2] However, he ultimately voted for fictional character Lisa Simpson for reasons tied to the Dimensional Merge, a topic that had captivated his interest over politics, despite his vocal opposition to Donald Trump and Mike Pence. Biden and Harris would go on to win Virginia regardless of Chris's write-in vote, along with the election as a whole.
2024
In the 2024 election, Harris ran for the presidency starting in July, opposing Trump, as Biden had dropped out mid-run and endorsed her instead. Following this event, Chris seemed to take more interest in Harris. In August 2024, Chris stated that he planned to vote for Harris that November, and he did a tarot reading on her.[1]
The following month, he posted photos of a hand-drawn sign supporting Harris's run for president, displayed at the yard of his former residence 14 Branchland Court,[3] and he also recorded a livestream reacting to a debate between Harris and Trump.[4] Chris watched an interview of Harris and Oprah Winfrey which took place on 20 September, and tweeted in agreement with Harris's pro-abortion access stance.[5] On 2 November, Chris shared more yard artwork in support of Harris and said he would be voting for her that Tuesday, on the official Election Day.[6] Two days later, he implied that his yard art had either been defaced or stolen.[7]
