Chris
Also, I'm worried about Anna. She hasn't texted me back in twenty days. I sent her texts from time to time, and I just tried calling her: a few rings then
went to voicemail. I also messaged her mother on Facebook letting her know of my concern.
The Captain
She only talks with you when it's convenient for her. She's fine she just has no interest
I'm sorry about that
What do you think about her. That's not how friends act.
Am I right? She's most definitely ignoring you.
Chris
That's a mean thing to say about anyone. I do not believe she is ignoring me. She's going through her own things there, I am sure. I mean, when I, myself,
was feeling super sad during that hiatus, I, pretty much, closed myself off from just about everyone.
Yes, one would probably put me down as a bad friend during that time I was out, as well.
The Captain
Well it's not appropriate considering how long you've known each other. A simple reply of "Sorry Chris I'm dealing with some stuff right now." Isn't hard to do. It's the least she could do and takes 10 seconds of effort.
Chris
I was not able to spare even that courtesy, myself, then as well.
Shit!
My brain was worse off back then.

Hawaii Trip
4 October 2018[2]
The Captain
Are you trying to go to Hawaii to meet Sky?

Chris
when I saw the Tweet pop up on my Notifications, but my hubby confirmed it was his doing. Monetary gain, aside, I know he has his, and future-knowing, reasons
behind making the Tweet.
Good Morning, Captain. I don't have initial intention on going to Hawaii; that Tweet was made by Magi-Chan towards monetary gain on my behalf. I was shocked
That's nothing, compared to body-guarding me, being my Guardian Angel, and being my loving and devoted hubby.
Not to mention being one of the guardians and diplomats of Cwcville and whatnot.
Still a current target of quite a few villains, I am. And he and I just learned in confirmation of a pair of more recent baddies that have been hanging out in
Alcatraz for a few months now, from the months of Wise and Boyd, Dark Idea Guy (AKA DIGMAN) and Shadow Elijah are attempting to crack a dimensional hole from
the showers of Alcatraz into my shower. Fortunately, Shadow Elijah needs a host to be a shadow of in order to fully get through a dimensional hole, so he's
stuck with DIGMAN. We are preparing for any foreseen developments on this end.
The Captain
Who is giving you these ideas? It sounds like Joshua Wise is talking to you again. Please be honest with me.. Who are you talking to?
Chris
Hell No! I have been talking with my hubby, Magi-Chan, right next to me, face-to-face on Everything, especially since I reset C-197 of Wise's shit.
DIGMAN, I did end up drawing and creating of Wise's suggestion, BUT, because I drew DIGMAN, none the less, he still Exists after the reset matter. And Shadow
Elijah, I have a young friend at Pokémon TCG League, Elijah, who asked me to draw him in a Shadow form, inspired by the Shadow Pokemon of the Colusseum games,
and I did draw Shadow Elijah, yet also linked S.E. with DIGMAN in the chain of events of Australatina, which is located south-east of Cwcville, next to the
Nation Borderline. So, yes, because I did draw the two of them in existence, they remain in existence in C-197. Fortunately, they went to heavy prison, like
Johnson Wiles did. But DIGMAN ended up in Alcatraz, while S.E. was sent to a separate penetary. S.E. was able to escape, though, hitchhiking from shadows to
up that dimensional crack in my shower, personally, last night by the Pokémon, Hoopa. And after Hoopa left, Magi-Chan and I talked, connected with the Cosmos,
and suspects to make a final call yet, until last night.
and put the remaining pieces together. Magi-Chan had been investigating the opening-closing crack in my shower, but came up with too many foreseen outcomes shadows to make his way to Alcatraz and meet up with DIGMAN. S.E. is the magic and the brains of the duo. Magi-Chan and I got the confirmation of them opening
I am not talking with anyone through the phone, text or damn internet about any and all of this.
This has all been happening in our visions, here and in C-197, and I had personally SEEN a lot of all this between there And Here, in this world and dimension.
Especially that dimensional crack in my shower.

CPU Red Heart, Megan
17 October 2018[3]
Chris
Thanks, [REDACTED] [blushing emote]
[REDACTED] Just another two cents about the CPU, Red Heart, in regards to
Megan, here.
She Will have to wake up and realize the Red Heart CPU in her soon
enough anyway, especially when the dimensions merge. Also, that console Red Heart represented IS an obscure console of Nintendo that was limited to Germany
distribution; it was never released in the US. When I heard of it, and every time it was mentioned when I was talking during those six months, and EVEN when
trying to Google or Internet Search the console, the results do find articles of it, BUT the name of the console was ALWAYS force-censored. Anyway, just my two
cents on that.
If Megan somehow KNEW the name of that obscure and distant Nintendo brand console and actually thought, spoke it aloud, or even type it, she'd
likely wake up then. "How the hell do I know that Console name?!", she'd might shout.
The Captain
Maybe it's the Virtual Boy?
Chris
No; THAT released in the US; this obscure console was ONLY in Germany.
The Captain
Please just leave Megan to her own devices. As you know I did tell her you were interested in talking to her but she declined. If she's ever ready to talk to you she'll do so herself. I don't want to see you get in trouble, or worse, hurt.
