WHY ME?!!!

I’ve just download Go Puzzle for my PS3, and on the ONLINE MULTIPLAYER function, while my opponent is able to play on their half, my game CURSOR is unable to move. No matter how much I press my D-Pad or push my Analog Stick, IT WILL NOT MOVE. WHY IS THIS HAPPENING TO ME?!! Also, in the “Lobby”, when I am prompted to “X” the “Ready?” icon, I can’t seem to be able to, no matter how much I press my “X” button.
WHAT IS THE DEAL?!!! WHY ME?!!!

I wanted to mention a small concern… there is a link to the True Real Winner of the Chop Chop Master Onion Contest at
http://groups.myspace.com/CWCandFriendsCustoms.
Yet, when I click the link on us.playstation.com, I get a different “Winner”.
I Do Not Know Who To Believe! Do I believe the Official-Rule-Violating adamstackhouse, or do I believe the Honest, Autistic CWCSonichu?

It’s good to know you’re fixing 2.40; I have a complaint to register. I’ve had no trouble installing it, but after installing the Update, I look up the video files I have saved on my external hard drive and not only does it TAKE LONGER for the PS3 to read the files to list them, but it digs deep into each one and adds a “Title” to the file’s information, which is its ORIGINAL BIRTH-CREATED Filename; not the name I dubbed the file. Originally, it would Sort via the latest filename; it now sorts via ORIGINAL Filename; IT REALLY GRINDS MY GEARS.
As long as you’re fixing the Update; Fix the Video File Reading capability back to the way it was.

P.S.
After fixing 2.40, you may want to rename it to 2.41, so those of us who did receive the Update, our PS3s can pick up on the patch.

If the problem is really bricking PS3′s (lol sorry), then it should be named 2.45, its worthy of the jump don’t ya think? :P

Why? Is it so problematic to go and install it yourself?
I can give a few reasons why it’s a bad idea
1. Time restraints I download them in the morning before work I don’t want to have to wait till they install before I can leave to turn it off and I don’t want it on all day. (Minority agreement probably)
2. I like the download in background feature and I don’t want that taken away. Installs can not be performed in the background and if it downloads the installs automatically we can’t have that feature anymore plus we could only be able to download one at a time because there would be conflicts. (Majority probably agree)
3. I don’t like bloated code which would just add needless lines of code which means more code more chance of bugs, which is never good even if you could toggle it off. Plus I don’t know how much space they have in flash but I don’t want that to take up room so they don’t have room for important usefull things.
I WANT THEM

In my humble opinion, about the Video on the PSN Store, I would like…
-Shows from BBC America, such as “Keeping Up Appearances”, “Are You Being Served”, “Open All Hours”, “As Time Goes By”, “Last of the Summer Wine”, “My Family”, “Barbara”, “Sorry”, “Thin Blue Line”, “Of Fools and Horses”, and of course, “Monty Python’s Flying Circus”.
-ALL the “Family Guy” episodes (Fill In the Blanks for EVERY SEASON), Stewie’s “Untold Story” Movie, “Blue Harvest”, and future “Family Guy” movies/specials.
-Complete “American Dad” and “Futurama” Seasons and movies.
-All Rentals staying playable for a WEEK after First Playback (two weeks max with no playback is fine).
-More Disney shows and movies (“Brandy & Mr. Whiskers”, “The Buzz on Maggie”, “Lizzie McGuire” and Classic Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy and Minnie Mouse shorts in B/W and Color).
Also, for the PSN Store Game area; I’ve noticed in other countries, there are 3 or 4 Additional Add-On Content for Sonic the Hedgehog; why didn’t they make the U.S.? I WANT THEM.
Sincerely

I’m not sure, but I think it true from my Point of View, but did the Update Increase Memory Capacity, because usually when I update my LBC1 Level, I CONSTANTLY receive a “Your Profile Can’t Be Saved” Message, usually due to LARGE-Capacity Level or HUGE amounts of downloaded objects and stickers, and now I’m not getting that message as much?
Sonichu | December 22nd, 2008 at 11:50 am
never mind; I’ve learned the hard way that was not the case.
BUT IT SHOULD BE A PRIORITY in a future Patch; UPGRADE MEMORY CAPACITY for a Profile to fit the Greatest Size and number of Custom Levels, as well as the Infinite Number of Downloadable Objects and Stickers.

Hey, the Street Fighter Tourney is good news, but I have a concern about the person who left the message.
His Avitar…
If that icon is WHAT I THINK IT IS, I AM OFFENDED; please change your Avitar, dude.

I have one complaint; I just got the U.E. of G.O.W. III, and I had reserved it at Gamestop, so I got a code for the Phantom of Chaos Skin as well. And I got acode from 7-Eleven for the Morpheus Skin.
The codes Worked for Morpheus Skin, Challenge of Exile Arenas/Dominus Skin and Unearthing the Legend.
But I am still getting the Error Message for the Phantom of Chaos Skin, ad the G.O.W. Trilogy and Blood and Metal Soundtracks.
When will tose two items be up, so my Two Codes for them can finally Function and I can have them?
Please let it be TODAY!
