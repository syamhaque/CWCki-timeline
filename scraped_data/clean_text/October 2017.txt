Chris, 5 October, posting on Kiwi Farms about Jessica Quinn breaking up with him.
October is the tenth month of 2017. This month proves to be yet another low point in Chris' life, with the Jessica Quinn saga coming to a spectacular close. Just twenty days later, one of his most challenging troll encounters of all time begins with the dawn of the Idea Guys saga, just in time for the tenth anniversary of his discovery by the world wide web.
