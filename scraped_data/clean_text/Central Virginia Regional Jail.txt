“
Well, I've had a hell of an evening: since Christine was needed extensively in Cwcville and in Both all of 1C-211987 and 1218 Earths, she left me; took all of her self, lock, stock, and barrel. I ended up on the floor and unconscious/comatose for over an hour, literally, and the Jerkops, present, Mocked and Jested my serious plight.

Central Virginia Regional Jail (or as Chris once called it, "this Jail of Fail")[3] serves five largely rural counties in central Virginia, including Greene County. It houses both male and female inmates.[4] Chris was sent to the jail following incestuous acts on his mother[5] where he was held without bond from 2 August 2021 through 28 February 2022 - when he was transferred to Western State Hospital - and again from 3 May 2022 until he was released from custody on 27 March 2023.[6][7] It is located about 21 miles (33 km) away from 14 Branchland Court.

Accommodations
In an October 2021 letter to a fan, Chris rated the jail accommodations two out of five stars, praising the "mostly good" food, good selection of items in the commissary, and the rec room, and criticizing attitudes from jail jerkops and "really noisy neighbours"[1] In another letter, Chris claimed to have a bidet in his jail cell, possibly referring to the sink/toilet combo common in jails.[8] Chris once overheard a woman giving birth at 5:00 AM, noting how loud it had been.[9] In the Goddess Log, he remarked about a fellow inmate named Charlie Sprouse who was banging on the cell door, yelling, and making rooster noises.
Chris was evidently in protective custody as of November 2021, noting in a jail letter that "I do not interact with other inmates often, especially since they've opted to keep me separated from them for my safety."[10] Chris was housed either in the medical or, for a few months, in the booking facilities of the jail.[9]
For activities, Chris mentioned playing solo basketball, listening to the radio, reading, writing, drawing,[11] and placed heavy emphasis on meditation.[10] On 30 November, Chris said in a letter that he had been restricted from the rec room and could no longer play basketball.[12]
For his day-to-day hygiene, Chris described it as, "a Daily Shower with Bob Barker Soap or Irish Spring Soap, water washcloth and Shampoo and towel, I also Brush my Teeth with Colgate Toothpaste And every other day apply Lady’s Speed deodorant."[8]
Behavioral issues
Chris had multiple behavioral issues with staff.
He threatened suicide in an attempt to have phone and Internet privileges, equipment which he had deemed necessary for his plans. The move resulted in him being placed on restriction, during which he was forbidden from using razors.[2] Consequently, he grew out a beard, which he disliked.[13]
He pretended that his soul had retreated into CWCville, and laid on the floor for an hour while acting unconscious. Chris claimed the guards mocked him over it.[2]
He had drawn a portal on the wall in pen, which was in the shape of an arch and big enough that he could've gone through it. Chris claimed in response to fan inquiries that he had drawn it to enlighten a stage and that manifestations had occurred with the portal.[8][14]
