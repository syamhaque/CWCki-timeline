The shop's description
Redbubble is a company which offers custom-printed items for sale, based on sellers' images. In yet another demonstration of how big his ego is, Chris joined the site in October 2017, selling various pieces of merchandise with iconic pre-Tomgirl photographs of him and illustrations of his Sonichu self-insert emblazoned on them.
