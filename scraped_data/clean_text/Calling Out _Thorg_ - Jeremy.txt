"I have never ever been in a damned gay bar ever."
Calling Out "Thorg" - Jeremy is a video uploaded by Chris on 6 August 2011, and the second video in the Calling Out series. In this video, Chris calls out Thorg (aka "Jeremy") and again sets out his demands to prevent the release of a full photograph and revealing documents. Despite his interest in appearing and acting like a woman, Chris demands that Thorg let the people of New York City know that he likes China.
Ironically, one of the points that Chris punctuates in this video is that he has never been in a gay bar, "ever". In October 2014, Chris would, in fact, begin visiting a local gay bar.

Photoshopped image in question.
Hello, once again, the Internet! I have returned with another troll, cyberbull-y, that I am ware- aware of who he is in real life. I br- I called to your attention Master Thorg, T-H-O-R-G, or as he [is] known in real life, Jeremy, within Canada.
He is a pizza-faced atheist. You can find him possibly in a video game store. I leave the specifics disclosed at this time. And, here is a sample of his pho-to-graph.
[Chris points the camera to the television showing half the face of a man. He then returns the camera to him.]
Now, Jeremy, let's you and I talk business now. My demands are as follows:
Because I know and well awa- and I [am] well aware that you have Photoshopped me into that damned gay bar and uploaded it- have it- you had it uploaded upon the billboards in New York City within some time ago. I would like you to make a public apology with your face, you may blur your face out as well, but I would like the statement to follow it:
"That you are- that it is a correction that I, Christian Weston Chandler, am STRAIGHT, and I have never ever been in a damned gay bar ever."
And I want that uploaded among the New York City billboards, and I want them left up there for one whole week, from one Sunday to the following Saturday. One, whole, week. Seven. days.
And that I- and also within the statements I would like you to know that I, Christian Weston Chandler, am an all-around good-natured person, and that I am to be treated and respected as a normal person. I am not a bad person; I do not like to be treated or thought of as a bad person, as I have been made out to be within the trolls, including yourself, Jeremy, within your smearing and hate campaigns of my name.
My next demand: I would like you to remove all of your pages as well from the CWCki, including every last page and image that you have put up there talking about the Tomboy/Tomgirl forum of Virginia. Remove them all, as well as your contributions to any pages. And then beyond that after having completed all that, I would like you as well to leave me, my life, my family, and my friends, alone, and at peace, to live our lives respectively as well. I'll leave you all with that. Stay tuned for another revealed troll... or slightly revealed, as I am ON THE PAYBACK! [laughs maniacally]
I win.
