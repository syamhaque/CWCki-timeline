The Wailing Wall
Three cards that survived the fire
The Wall of Originals (a.k.a. "The Failing Wall") was a large Relic of Fail showing Christian Weston Chandler's customized Pokémon cards, which hung from one of the walls in Chris's room. The lighting in several of his videos suggested that the sheet was covering a window, but the Tomgirl Pictures, released on 29 April 2011, showed that this was probably not the case.
Some trolls speculate that the absence of the Wall in the Tomgirl Pictures indicated that it had been removed. Whether this was meant to be permanent or temporary is unclear. In a July 2017 tweet, he revealed that at least three cards survived the 2014 house fire. In June 2018, more cards surfaced, when he sold nine of them on eBay for $100. In March 2019, Joseph Draft took additional photos of the cards which he had planned to use in his film, since cancelled, and Chris gifted him a couple of cards.[1]
Whether or not Chris has created a "new Wall" in his post-jail home remains to be seen.

Things to Note
An early version of the Wall, circa 2000.
Close-up
There are several interesting trends which emerge when one takes in all of Chris's cards. They provide some insight into his game design process which further support the traits of Chris featured on the CWCki. Some interesting notes about the cards include:
The earlier cards that feature Christian depict him as a disgusting mutant with a wide, flat nose and thick lips. This eventually branches out to include terrifying photoshops where an expressionless Chris is jammed into crude MSPaint backdrops.
Note the first appearance of a female alternative for Pikachu, tastefully dubbed Chicachu, who can only deal damage when accompanied by a boyfriend.
Plautistic. It is a plant that is autistic. It is extremely likely Chris seems to think autism and psychic powers are linked.
Chris shows up as a trainer, a gym leader, as well as a Pokémon. In each of these identities, Chris has multiple forms/personas. This trend is totally in line with Christian's theme of acquiring a plethora of powers with little to no effort or explanation. He has created himself as a normal type in which he is depicted as an autistic Pokémon. This reinforces the conclusion that he considers autism a superpower in some respects.
Many of his handmade cards have devastatingly synergistic effects or several complimentary effects at once. This allows Chris to pull off combos with only one or two cards. According to field reports about his card game technique, Chris would need these hugely-layered card effects because his deck-building skills were rather poor.[2]
Despite spending considerable time on them, Chris did not try to use these cards in official games at The GAMe PLACe.[3]
Some of the cards that are based on pre-existing Pokémon (such as Blue, Donphan, Togepi) were most likely made in a response to early Generation II Pokémon revealings.
The Yoshi and Luigi cards were based on an obviously fake Nintendo Power April Fool's Day Joke.
Chris produced at least three holographic cards using aluminum foil for the shiny component.[4]

↑ "Chris was pretty awful at all the games he played. he had rediculous themed decks that never worked in pokemon and he never used any trategy at all in yugi-oh."
↑ "He had about a 20 different custom cards, but never played any of them."
↑ "I have tried my hand at making Holographic trading cards from my homemade set of Pokémon cards; I printed onto aluminum foil. Not perfect. I attached the foil between contact paper and the printed card."
