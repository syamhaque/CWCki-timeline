JuggaloShoutOut is a video Chris uploaded on 30 October 2010. In this video, Chris keeps on the facepaint from his earlier video while giving a "shout out" to fellow Insane Clown Posse fans, who refer to themselves as Juggalos. They are known for having many idiotic douchebags among their fanbase, which more or less fits Chris's description.
Chris also recites a lyric from Coolio's "Gangsta's Paradise".

They don't.

We will do this gangsta's paradise! Da da da da, da, da da da. Da da da da da, da da da.
[Chris leans into the camera.]
Always be a member of the Juggalo family! We Juggalos roll.
