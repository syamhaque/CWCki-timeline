================================================================================

"Punchy and Layla's Dance In The Dark" is the penultimate song on Christian and the Hedgehog Boys COMEBACK!. It is Chris's tribute for Punchy Sonichu and Layla Flaaffy, to the tune of Bruce Springsteen's "Dancing in the Dark". Towards the end, Chris reveals that Punchy and Layla apparently like either S&M, the donkey punch, or fisting. It's hard to tell, really.

Lyrics
[sung over Bruce Springsteen's "Dancing in the Dark"]
Punchy gets up in the evening
And Punchy ain't got no-nothing to say
He comes home in the morning
He goes to bed in the same way
He ain't nothing but tired
And Punchy's just tired and bored with himself
[yawning on this line] It's a bad day off
He could use just a little help
Can't start a fire
Can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Punchy's dancing in the dark
Messages to leave her
Radio's on and Punchy's moving around the place
He checks his look in the mirror
He wants to change his clothes and hair and face
And he ain't getting nowhere
He's just living a dull life like this
But something happened from somewhere
Layla I just know we're there
Can't start a fire
Can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
They sit around getting older
There's a joke here somewhere and it's on me
[unintelligible]
Staying on the streets of CWCVille
And they'll be carving them up all night
Then they got hungry
Hey Layla I'm just about starving tonight
I'm dying for some action
I'm sick of sitting around here trying to write
I need a love reaction
Come on Layla give me just one look
Can't start a fire
Sitting around crying of a broken heart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Can't start a fire
Worrying about your new world falling apart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
(Repeat x2)
Hey, baby!
Uuueeerrra, Layla!
Yo Layla, Punchy's in and he's checking you out, girl!
Come on let's go hit the bed. (!?)
I'll throw my best punches!
Hwah! Hwah!
