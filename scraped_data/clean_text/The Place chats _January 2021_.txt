MKRNightVee
I don't think they have good intentions, its pretty obvious this is a cheap ploy to bait you into giving your trust so they can troll and humiliate you.
People like this are the worst...
Kyle
I must agree, but can explain more if you want to work through it.
The names are most relevant.
Chris (as Sonichu)
I will see what else I can gather from them in light chat, as well as psychic investigation with our family and allies.
Thank you all.
Also, Meghan, I am glad to see you on.
I have something special that I found and thought you’d might like.
Kyle
The fact that I recognize some of these names is highly disconcerting...
Chris (as Sonichu)
MKRNightVee
Awww
So cute!
X3
Great find~
Chris (as Sonichu)
Wanting to confirm you’re still at your address.
MKRNightVee
I'll get it and send it to you via text
Kyle
Ben is ironically another commie terrorist, as per the legal definition.
If I had to guess, we can discount almost all of these.
In what context did they mention these?
Chris (as Sonichu)
I’ll check y’all later.
Goodnight.

@Sonichu982 who is your favorite care bear?
Chris (as Sonichu)
Chris loves Swift Heart Rabbit.
Kyle
That, I didn't expect...
Chris (as Sonichu)
She even has the original plush.
KND
good choice
Kyle
The Angry Birds movie was distressingly good.
Chris (as Sonichu)
And, yeah, next to SH, there’s the plush of Leonard Bearnstein; the “God Bear”.
MKRNightVee
Aww I had that one too!
Chris (as Sonichu)
Official plush from Regency Square shopping center.

Conjuring Movies
10 January 2021
Chris tells the server that for their Movie Night, they should watch the Annabelle set of movies from the Conjuring horror franchise. He further says that he won't be joining them, as he had a dream that he must binge-watch all six of the Conjuring movies on his own (and with his imaginary friends), implying that watching the movies is a possible way to unlock the Dimensional Merge.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Hey, y’all.
Make your movie night tonight a Conjuring one with the three Annabelle movies; I am afraid I shan’t be in your company, but I must binge the sextuplet of Conjuring flicks on my own with Mewtwo and Rosey.
The referencing dream I had this morning, and Mewtwo’s confirmation afterwards, told me so.
Our ally souls are very diligent at work in helping me get this body, safely, alive and well into C-197.

Chris (as Sonichu)
Hey, y’all.
Feeling really good today.
Gonna get things done today, no problem.
Naught
nice
Kyle
Keep at it.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Also found this yesterday at Sheetz; had to get one.
Naught
nice, the classic design
Kyle
Kind of, strange branding...
Chris (as Sonichu)
Yeah, well, find it strange the chosen flavour is Peach?
As it can also be associated with Princess Peach.
I’d say that was strange as well, but I know better.
Still yummy, though.

Quartz, Transformers, Trump
17 January 2021
Continued from above conversation.
Chris shifts the topic to magic stones and shows off the herkimer diamond mounted to his wrist.
He again changes the topic to Transformers and discusses his new Gigawatt figure, which is part of the Transformers/Back to the Future crossover. Chris mentions reading the crossover's comic.
While playing with the NotSoBot chatbot, it brings up a photo of Donald Trump alongside Back to the Future's Biff. Chris finds it funny.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Again, it is mainly for deviation away from Vaughn, and it is also a gesture of goodwill in part, and I got to talk about a precious stone in our collection.
KND
i love stones too
don't have any though
Chris (as Sonichu)
Well, you can look online for rock and mineral stores, as well as on Etsy.
And I’m certain there’s a valid store in your local area you can visit and check out.
KND
i'm willing to do that
can i substitute diamond for quarts?
diamonds are pretty expensive
Chris (as Sonichu)
I believe so.
Quartz, simply put, is a central stone that can be spiritually programmed for most any benefit or magic.
There’s also the Herkimer Diamond that is even more pure than quartz, with greater benefits in comparison.
H.D.s are a lot less expensive, obviously.
KND
wow these Herkimer Diamonds are huge
Chris (as Sonichu)
Some smaller, yet sizable.
They also activate and empower the Eighth chakra point: the Soul Star chakra.
It’s located above the Crown chakra, but linked with the subconscious and heavy cosmic and dimensional links.
Highly recommended.
KND
thanks for this
Chris (as Sonichu)
No problem.
Now you know, and knowing is half the battle.
MKRNightVee
Gi-joe!🎶
Naught
Ok
Chris (as Sonichu)
The other half is Doing. (edited)
Change in topic: got a Gigawatt.
Added the faction decals; cut in half, with Autobot on the outside, since he was formerly a Con, but disagreed with Megs and bailed and switched.
Naught
Is that the object they're searching for in all the movies?
What's it called
Chris (as Sonichu)
Also read the crossover comic books so far.
Book 3 still has yet to be released.
A Gigawatt is a measurement in electricity.
In the movies, the ol’ DeLorian needed to generate 1.21 gigawatts to time-travel.
In the crossover comic, instead of Biff, Starscream gets dunked in Manure!

Depression Over Reality
17-18 January 2021
Chris (as Sonichu)
Sorry to miss the chance, but this time was not good for a movie night.
Naught
[posts an emote]
Hope your doing well
Chris (as Sonichu)
I will be in C-197 soon and shortly enough, with this body, alive and well; I have no doubt at all about that.
But, in all seriousness, with the timing, fate and destiny:
Kyle
So, there's a probable timespan?
Chris (as Sonichu)
Why am I still in this dimension/universe?
Naught
Reality is a constant
Kyle
What reason is there for anything else?
The burden of proof isn't on reality, it never is.
Chris (as Sonichu)
[quotes Kyle's "So, there's a probable timespan?" remark]
Yes, but it is meant to either be figured out, or a total instantaneous moment of surprise.
Which is why I told you time and again, @Nova, to meditate and consult with the Cosmos.
Kyle
So, still leaves certain indefinites.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Kyle
I prefer not being forced into things.
Chris (as Sonichu)
I came on to vent a little bit about the fact that I am still not in Cwcville with this body yet.
It continues to be very frustrating. (edited)
Kyle
It isn't apathy, its a viable alternative.
Naught
what does the Cosmo say to you in response?
Kyle
The drawbacks seem, far too severe to consider.
Naught
Not to sound like a hippy,
but nature knows best
Chris (as Sonichu)
There is no apathy with me, that is for positive.
Kyle
In considering which options?
Naught
Reality can only be moved so far until it snaps back
Chris (as Sonichu)
I get many various inputs and visions out of all of the remaining infinite possibilities and outcomes; it is difficult to specifically pinpoint a detail most of the time at this time.
Kyle
We have 2 basic outcomes.
Naught
ok, that's good
Chris (as Sonichu)
The merge is happening: no question about it.
Kyle
Active or passive.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Oh
Kyle
The idea of a passive version means that only here and now matters.
Chris (as Sonichu)
I feel frustrated in the passive aspect of things; it gets really boring at times.
Kyle
So effort should be focused on reality.
Chris (as Sonichu)
By the way, Both of our universes Are realities.
Kyle
Attempting to affect outside of that would be deleterious.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Gah!
Why am I still in this dimension right now?!
Please, let me be in Cwcville right freaking now!
Ugh.
Naught
it'll be ok, try not to force it
Kyle
So, which goals can be set permitting either?
Chris (as Sonichu)
And you all know one thing that is also bugging me right now?
Some time recently, Chris felt like prettying my body’s bit for her own identity.
I could not pull off
wearing a white jacket on my body while I was in it.
But the whopper; she put mascara on my face; extending my short eyelashes.
It really bothered me.
Kyle
Would be an interesting goal.
Learning to use some of that stuff.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Kyle
A passive approach isn't mutually exclusive to an active one.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Kyle, if you suddenly body-swapped with a woman, would you want her to put makeup on your face?
Naught
I tend to try to focus on an ideal or an earlier event, and before I know it, it's all good
Kyle
I've never had this problem.
Naught
well,
it works for mua
Chris (as Sonichu)
You, Bis, I can actually see that.
Especially since...
Kyle
In the here and now you want what you want, practical small goals, security is a healthy focus.
Chris (as Sonichu)

Praetor Money
18 January 2021
MKRNightVee
Praetor, when are you going to pay most of that $$$ to cwc?
Because that's what you should be doing, morally and because you don't want to be pegged as jerks like the idea guys. Its really the nicest thing to do, so I ask you please do it. Christine could really use the money, especially right now.

Cash from Praetor
20 January 2021
Chris (as Sonichu)
[quotes MKRNightVee's remark, "Praetor, when are you going to pay most of that $$$ to cwc?"]
He actually did; he paid me nearly $400 in cash, as shown in that photo on his Instagram.
And I have personally counted all of the fives and ones to result not only in that total, but also so I can deposit it all about 40 bills at a time at the ATM that day.

Mental State
24 January 2021
[Past midnight on 24 January]
Chris (as Sonichu)
I will tell you all one thing, @everyone.
Every day, when this body and I wake up, and we’re still not in C-197 alongside Rosey, but in 1218, I end up again and again feeling that frustration of “Why am I still in this dimension?!”
Yet, I also notice something else each day.
Not only the continued events and everything else I’ve been sensing and experience, but it would appear to me that each time this body wakes up, it is in a slightly different variation of 1218.
And for example
Sega announcing the Re-Release of the Dreamcast; I kinda feel like we went back in time a couple of decades after hearing that, or something, not literally, though.
I mean, if not a Dreamcast Mini, but the original console, upgraded, re-released; that feels really out from a different field (not to knock it).
Do you all see what I am getting at?
Or at least understand?
Naught
Metaphysical change?
Kyle
"upgraded" really isn't how hardware engineering works.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Regardless, Kyle, the point is still valid.
Kyle
In terms of hardware engineering, it merits more detail.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Not that
Kyle
I can explain pipelining and engine design if you want.
Chris (as Sonichu)
The dimension details and changes here.
It is all coming together each and every millisecond.

Transformers Talk with MKR
31 January 2021
[Shortly after midnight on 31 January]
Chris (as Sonichu)
Also, just to reiterate for @MKR: Between the Transformers G1 Micromaster (and its Seige remake), Swindler, being reminiscent of not only the DeLorian, but also the Gadgetmobile in its car mode, and now we have Gigawatt the actual DeLorian, has it crossed anyone minds that Gigawatt could be considered an upscaled version of Swindler?
MKRNightVee
Yes, I see the resemblance, I wonder if they're related.
It's like his little brother
Chris (as Sonichu)
I know, right?
MKRNightVee
Although being small isn't always an indicator of age with transformers lol
Chris (as Sonichu)
Also, an upscaled version of what fun alt-mode Chris had made of the G1 Micromaster back in the late ‘80s.
MKRNightVee
I love Cybertronians X3
Chris (as Sonichu)
How are you feeling, Meghan?
MKRNightVee
I'm alright, its been a very loud day, we had some construction guys as well as my sister's kids so its been a little rough.
But things have quieted down a bit
Chris (as Sonichu)
Must have been rough on Nightvee and the crew.
I take it you got the POP figure I sent you?
MKRNightVee
Yes, I @ed you when it came but you must have been busy. He's adorable X3 I love him! Thank you so much.
Chris (as Sonichu)
I also thought it was really neat that it was also holding Megatron in his gun mode.
But, yes, we have been very busy with the events coming further into fruition and completion as the dimension merge completes.
Especially during the 2:00 PM, Eastern Time, hour with the heavier meditation.
I had encouraged everyone on Twitter to meditate during that hour on any day they are free to have a link with this noggin.
Which, your time, would be 11:00 am.
MKRNightVee
I'll try it
Chris (as Sonichu)
Movie night was cool.
We watched Napoleon Dynamite and Small Apartments.
MKRNightVee
I've seen Napoleon Dynamite, the other is new to me? I'll look it up.

Chris (as Sonichu)
Hey, Josh.
Yes, I did in a voluntary mistake did send those messages out.
I did this in order to confirm the trolling antics of one who has been in contact with us recently, with initial good and pleasant tidings of complimentary unopened candy, wine, and pickles in a jar.
This event was meant to be carried out as far as needed to confirm the foreseen trolling intentions of the individual in question.
Christine (still in my Sonichu body) and Magi-Chan will deal with the individuals involved, personally.
And I am working with our trusted friend and business partner, Caden, on another counter plan against the bad troll as well.
I am awaiting the explanation of his plan to arrive later this afternoon.
I will brief you further, Josh, only should we definitely need your involvement as well.
I am taking responsibility and dealing with the matter as best and appropriately as possible in this dimension.
Thank you, Josh.

Okay, I asked because it's going to cause problems. I warned you after the time you got kicked out of the convention to be careful of sexual harassment. If people think you're a sex predator, they will not financially support or help you. These messages are already being shared around by the people you sent them to.

MKR's Tantrum Over The WCT
17 January 2021
MKRNightVee throws a tantrum directed at The WCT over his presence in The Place.
During MKR's tantrum, WCT questions why he had been banned from The Place the prior month, saying he had been given multiple versions for the reason. MKR tells him to guess, and he lists three guesses - his relationship with Crimson, acknowledging The Place outside of the server, and his sperging over politics. MKR agrees with his guesses and makes further accusations over them. The WCT gives his explanations and apologizes, to which MKR continues to accuse him. WCT then promises to learn from his mistakes. MKR snipes at him some more, then ends her tantrum.

That’s harsh.

But true and honest
The WCT
Well, after hearing what you just said, I appreciate the honesty. But I’m pretty disappointed nevertheless. I can tell I haven’t been too well received here since I was allowed to come back, but I have no plans on leaving anytime soon.
MKRNightVee
You just go run and cry to Chris?
That's not very manly of you
[posts an emote]
The WCT
Do you want to know the truth?
MKRNightVee
That your a faggot? Sure.
The WCT
<sighs> On December 23rd, I decided that I wanted to have a chat with CWC just to check on him and wish him a Merry Christmas. And I did affirm him that I was kicked.
MKRNightVee
[posts an emote]
And you wanked off and cried about how mean and unfair we were to your traitorous little asshole?
The WCT
Okay, first off. What did I do that got me canned in the first place? People have been telling me multiple versions of why I was kicked.
Whatever I did, I want to know so I won’t do it again. (edited)
MKRNightVee
Why do you think you were kicked? Tell me first?
The WCT
I can take a few guesses...
MKRNightVee
Then guess
The WCT
1. Was it because of my relationship with Crimson?
2. Was it due to acknowledging the server outside? (on accident)
3. Politisperging?
Those are the three that come to my mind.
MKRNightVee
1. Crimson is a known member of a group that has caused us a lot of trouble and has actively tried to fuck me and anon over personally. When we tried to explain this to you, you laughed it off as if it didn't matter and you continued to talk to/ leak info willingly or because you're too retarded to know better to Crimson.
2. It was not on accident, you were bragging.
3. Yes this was annoying and we all put up with it as a quirk, but no one wanted to hear it. This is why I hated voice calls with you aside from your pompous attitude and constantly talking over everyone else as if you were the only voice that matters. No one wants you here.
You are only here because you whined like a little pussy bitch ass nigger faggot and got cwc to feel sorry for your retarded ass.
No.
Shut up cat.
We are done here.
The WCT
To address the three: 1. I’ve told and warned Crimson time and time again that he’s not welcome at all and that he should leave all of you alone so he has.
2 and 3. I apologize if I was trying to make myself look better than others.
MKRNightVee
Cat...
Are you unaware people can say one thing and then do another behind your back?
The WCT
Yes.
MKRNightVee
What exactly did you think he would do with the information you told him
Are you honestly this stupid?
The WCT
Maybe. If what you’re telling me is true, lll block him.
can you share me some screenshots?
MKRNightVee
I'm not in the sperg group
The WCT
I’m not there myself. Me and Smoky haven’t spoke to each other in a long time.
MKRNightVee
Why would I be? But they wouldn't have this information if a certain faggot didn't feed it to them.
The WCT
well now I know what I shouldn’t say from here on out.
I mean fuck, I barely go to Chris’s section of the Farms as my main.
My actions though at the end of the day will speak louder than words. (edited)
Naught
Good boi, scrappy lil cat, don't upset the goddess though,
I did mention it though
The WCT
I’ll say this and I’m going to say it again:
MKRNightVee
Sean.
No.
The WCT
I’m not perfect, I can be stupid at times, and i gotta learn things the hard way to be better.
MKRNightVee
Or just stop talking when I fucking tell you to. We have important things to take care of and we dont need you in the way, Sean.
Planning our next move is more important than all this
The WCT
I’m not trying to meddle in any operations. I want to help Chris just like all of you, but a little help is needed if I’m going to be better at this.
Remember, we’re on the same team (like Chris said) and we shouldn’t fight amongst ourselves, it’s not healthy.
I’ll learn from my mistakes and we can move on even if we don’t like each other? Okay?
MKRNightVee
We do not need your assistance at this time and we sure as hell don't want your input.
Stop talking
The WCT
and if I fuck up again, I’ll leave for good. That’s a promise.

Cool, then your first mission is to stay back and shut the fuck up.

MKR's Conspiracy Theory About Praetor & The CWCki Server
17 January 2021[1]
NOTE: Chris was not directly involved in this conversation.
Kyle 06:50 PM
I don't see many options with Praetor.
Naught 06:50 PM
🤔
Kyle 06:51 PM
Josh is kind of the nuclear option, but could at least confirm the money and tell them to stop pissing around, they seem to have stopped making videos at least.
[1 tewi[2] reaction]
That would leave them with a 500 dollar hole in the ground and like zero options to continue fucking with Chris.
Naught 06:55 PM
What do you think of gibis calculation?
Kyle 06:56 PM
At 25 bucks each, 250 sales, that's 6250 in revenue.
Naught 06:56 PM
Smdh
Kyle 06:56 PM
They work on a percentage of gross...
So, maybe that's 6250 less 33%
4125, assuming Chris is at the lowest bracket of payment. They'd owe him about 412.50
One of their brackets listed was 50 fucking percent...
So that's, a red flag there...
Lainchu (Anaxis) 07:11 PM
I mean, as long as Chris is getting some payment?
Kyle 07:12 PM
That's one factor, but their influencing is pretty retarded too...
Lainchu (Anaxis) 07:12 PM
Well besides the sermon video, what else have they done?
Kyle 07:20 PM
The stun gun and pikachu mask picture.
Remember the militia video that one guy did, thinking they wanted something similar.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 08:53 PM
Militia video?
And if they haven't done any weenish stuff lately, maybe they're just focusing on the business. I still think it's possible that they're not so much malicious as they are naive.
If Josh or one of us just calmly asked if they could stop with the ween stuff, their response would be a good gauge for how willing they are to be cooperative.
If we come at them with hostility right off the bat, that won't come off very well, especially if Chris is actually making money from them (plus he likes them)
If they're talked down and just continue the business while giving chris a fair share, then I see no reason we can't coexist with Praetor.
Of course, if they continue weening anyway, that's a different story, but we won't know unless we try.
MKR 09:13 PM
@Lainchu Are you a part of Praetor? (edited)
Lainchu (Anaxis) 09:13 PM
No...
MKR 09:13 PM
You sound pretty defensive of them.
Why is that?
Lainchu (Anaxis) 09:14 PM
I'm only saying that we shouldn't assume the worst of them if they haven't done anything that bad, and if chris can financially benefit from them.
MKR 09:14 PM
But they have been doing bad things
And we've been at this long enough to know red flags when we see them.
More than red flags actually.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 09:15 PM
Has anyone tried just asking them if they could stop with the ween stuff?
MKR 09:15 PM
Lel yes
Lainchu (Anaxis) 09:16 PM
Like, politely, without aggression?
MKR 09:16 PM
Yes
In the beginning
That's why alternative options are being used now.
Naught 09:16 PM
ive been trying to speak to them at all, and no response
MKR 09:18 PM
Your server has been buying up the medallions, is it possible the cwcki server has a sort of business partnership with them?
Or that they originated from there.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 09:18 PM
Lol, you're really getting conspiratorial here?
MKR 09:18 PM
I'm not asking to be rude or funny.
I'm serious.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 09:19 PM
I said that we had a couple of users who had bought the medallions and shared pictures of them.
MKR 09:19 PM
Yes but those are the only known purchases.
So far.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 09:20 PM
Nobody's been advertising for Praetor in the cwcki server
MKR 09:20 PM
Their business practices are shady so...
Ok
It might still help if you could keep your eyes open for any talk about them there.
It's just a hunch but I think they're lower tier members
Again, let me make it clear, I'm not saying the cwcki server is behind this.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 09:22 PM
Well, what you said really did sound like an accusation...
And I always keep my eyes open
MKR 09:23 PM
What I'm hypothesizing is that they are hiding in there. The way they reacted to getting on the cwcki was pure joy so it would be stupid to think they wouldn't want to pe part of the server itself.
Get over it already.
Our dumb playtime feud isn't what this is about
But I appreciate it
As a group they act strong, but if I've learned anything from experience. Find a weak link, or any link, separate it from the others and it will squeal.
They immediately start pointing fingers at eachother.

Asking About Censoring Names For The Journey to the Merge

Lainchu (Anaxis) 10:17 PM
Alright, I've finished compiling a group of Chris's merge statements and conversations, and I'm gonna post them soon. I'm gonna cut out as much extraneous info as I can, but I wanted to know: who wants their information censored? And how much of it? Just icon, just name, or both, or neither? I'm going to be doing neither, myself, as I've got nothing to hide as Lainchu.
Kyle 10:18 PM
I guess if its at all relevant, I don't mind.
Chris ok this?
Lainchu (Anaxis) 10:18 PM
Yes
He told me to "use my discretion" and that's what I did

That part should be taken out probably 🤷‍♀️ For safety cx
Lainchu (Anaxis) 10:23 PM

Kyle 10:23 PM
Not really a lot, just merge stuff, so it should be easy to comb through.

Chris also makes mention of @ภคยﻮђՇ and @Neko Onyx (Kat) living in California

No personal info is revealed, just Discord names and icons, but I know some people can be sensitive to that too

The only consequence of leaving their name uncovered is revealing the fact that they're in the same Discord server as us.

If he's not getting at least half of the 6000, we got a problem.

Their agreements work in 10,20,40 and 50% of gross after tax.
I figured about 33% off revenue is a reasonable gross, ergo, Chris is in the 10%.

We're going to get an influx of doppelgangers with the nov 22, maybe?

Like alt Sonichu/Magi-Chan/Rosechu, etc

He says that a lot but I've yet to see any from him, he doesn't respect me or anyone else so I treat him accordingly.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 11:57 PM
Lmao, is that so?
Why, because I won't let you on the cwcki server modstaff?
MKR 11:57 PM

Notes
↑ According to Anaxis: "For context, in my DMs with Naught, after he dismissed my concerns about Val and MKR's behavior in this conversation, I mentioned that I could sweep the incident under the rug this time, but that everyone has their limits. Naught apparently shared our DMs with Val and MKR behind my back, considering their unprompted messages reading "sweep sweep" that began ten minutes after the conversation had already ended."
