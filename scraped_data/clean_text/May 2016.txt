Chris in May 2016, displaying his lovemaking skills.
May was the fifth month of 2016. The month started out rather uneventfully, although it did see Chris getting a new body pillow as a substitute for a sweetheart. Things picked up towards the latter half of the month, when Chris revealed that he was competing with a former gay porn star for the privilege of supposedly impregnating a lesbian couple. The two competitors released sex tapes for viewers to vote on, reminiscent of the Liquid Chris saga.
