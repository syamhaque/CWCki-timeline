================================================================================

"CWC Update 18 March 2009 More Updated" (officially "CWC Update 03182009 More Updated") is a video in which Chris explains a few recent happenings, or the lack thereof. He expresses his hope that he'll win some Eye of Judgment tournament cards. He goes on to make excuses for his predictable delays in turning out any new comic pages, and he makes a brief shout-out to his new soon-to-be-sweetheart Ivy.
On 19 March 2009, Chris deleted and re-uploaded this video with new footage seamlessly spliced in. This director's cut features a reworded shout-out to Ivy, to fulfill her request to correct the flubbing of her name in the first take. It also adds a statement regarding the incident with The Man in the Pickle Suit in the mall which had occurred earlier that day.

Captain's Log, Stardate: uh, March 18, 2009.
Uh...I am still working on the recovery of, uh, the webs—, of the sonichuandrosechu.com website. But yeah, also I a—, on the side, I am, on the side, I am working on the, warming up for the Eye of Judgment, uh, tournament which, uh, hopefully, I'll be in the top 100, where, if I am, I’ll be, uh, one of the 100 winners to, uh, get set of free promo cards including the more lo—, uh, more lovely version of, uh, Edin the Prosecuted, Persecuted, uh, which is, wh—, I forget one of those. Uh, anyway, uh...
Anyway, I have, uh, been delaying on the drawing of new comic pages since the website fell down, but, uh, I will, like I said, I will continue to try to get it back up, and if I do not get the website back up by the end of the tournament, uh, I will upload the co—, pages to this, uh, comic page hosting site that I have been made aware of. I have been made aware of that on a previous Internet chat even though, during the past couple of weeks, at least, I have not been on any Internet chats. Because of the trolls.
And also, I would like to give a shout-out to, uh...Ummivvy! And her friend Rachel across the hall from each other at a college here in these United States Vamerica. So, uh, yeah, ho—, so, if, uh, so if by the tournament then, I do not have the website back up, I will, uh, upload the pages to the comic hosting page as I have previously mentioned and, and, uh, I will upload a video onto the YouTube informing of y'all where those pages will be on that point.
Okay. So, uh, thank you for your patience and loyalty my, uh, loyal Sonichu fans. And, uh, y'all have a pleasant day. Take care.
