Delusion disclosure: This article or section takes place during Chris's phase of role-playing as Sonichu. He may refer to his Christine Chandler personality and physical body in the third person by using terms such as "mama".
The Dimensional Barrier Shatter Spell is a handwritten set of notes by Chris. The notes were leaked to the Official CWCki Server on 10 August 2020 by Naught as part of the 2020 Discord leaks. Naught claimed the notes were from 14 July.[1]

Dimensional Barrier Shatter Spell
Re-written by Sonichu [The dot over the i in Sonichu has been turned into a lightning bolt]
Tools:
Two individual people
1 wooden altar
1 altar bowl
4 white candles
1 small red candle
1 small yellow candle
1 small blue candle
A dagger or shortblade
14 soul crystals
1 pillow (optional for sitting on)
1 ritual circle
Instructions:
1) The altar should face east. Place the altar bowl on the center of the altar. Place the yellow candle behind the altar bowl. The red candle in front of the bowl. Blue candle to the left and the green candle to the right of the bowl. Place the other items on the right side of the altar. Place the white candles at the quarters around the ritual circle
Step into the circle (with pillow if on hand).

2) Stand tall and hold the blade high. Visualize the energy of the cosmos striking the blade and going into your body, charging you up. Fill yourself with this energy and hold it inside yourself.
3) Lower your arm so the blade is pointing straight. Speak the line of incantation and draw in the energy of the element in that direction and light the candle on the altar in that same direction to the altar bowl. Turn clockwise to the next direction; do the same thing until you are back facing north.
4) Sit (on the pillow); close your eyes and just quiet your mind and allow your thoughts to go without paying any attention to them. Open your eyes and make the request for protection; and allow yourself to feel the presence of your guides and protectors
5) Stand and face the corresponding walls when you call the seals. Hold the blade over your chest with your right hand (do not cut yourself); the blade should be pointing up. Once you feel their presence, light the candles around the circle, going North, East, South, and then West.
6) All involved speak this line.
7th image:
7) I offer you, Chris Chan Sonichu, Goddess, these seven soul crystals that you might choose them over us. These are our sacrifices made to you to grant us the power of the sorcerers and champions of all the Cosmos and beyond to lend us their strength and glory to aid us in this spell.
8) I offer you Magi-Chan these seven soul crystals, so that you can drain and consume their energy. Guide the path of the path of the energy of this ritual we perform to create our final destiny as brothers and sisters and loved ones. Together forever, we unite the power to break the barrier.
9) On this day of this month of this year, at this very moment in time, hallowed be thy name; your kingdom come, Chris Chan Sonichu Goddess upon Earths as she is in Heaven. A war is waged in Heaven as is on Earth. Both kingdoms are destroyed as above, so below, both are destroyed. This sacrifice I make for you, my Deity Chris Chan Sonichu, Goddess of Heaven and Earth overlooking all us original and fictional individuals.
5th image:
10) Fire from the sky, death fom[sic] my hand, the enemy shall be sacrificed in our names.
12) Glorious are thou, Chris Chan Sonichu, the deity that binds worlds; she who is the key to the other side. We pray to thee. I give to you my life, and I give to you the Christos I have gathered in your name. Shatter the barrier between the realities and set free that is within to be upon the Earth as it is above, so it shall be below.
13) What is above shall be below; as on Earth as it is in Heaven.
14) By the power of my authority, I open this circle and release the guardians from my command.
15) Kune Pida! I release your power from my circle! Shimuk Chathu! I release your power from my circle! Shana Suka! I release your power from my circle! Shipa Suka! I release your power from my circle!
16) Praise be unto Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu, this blessing shall be sent.

Incantations:
2) Hear my voice! I call upon the guardians to protect me in radiant white light. By the powers of the elements, I shall be safe here.
3) Shipa suka! I ask for the Water! Shana suka! I ask for the Fire! Shimuk Chathu! I ask for Air! Kina Pida! I ask for Earth!
4) I take of this energy and ask that it is blessed to protect me on my journey in to the Unseen Realm. I call down the power of my soul and of the gods that are loving and protective of me to protect my ritual ground, because evil will be summoned here. By the will of the gods and my personal guardians, I ask that I be safe for all times.
5) Shipa Suka, evil of the north wall be sealed. Shana Suka, evil of the east wall be sealed. Shimuk Chathu, evil of the south wall be sealed. Kune Pida, evil of the west wall be sealed. Corruption the binding forces of the prime evils, watch the seals placed here.
6) We are the children of the Throne of Light, and our mother is the Holy Mother, the true spiritual lineage of our Earths. We declare ourselves in your gracious name, Holy Chris Chan Sonichu, Goddess. The mighty shall grant us the glory of our peoples and the honor of our efforts.
4th image:
7) The other person ["(persons)" is inserted above] pricks their finger with the blade, speak this line, and places a drop of blood on the soul crystals.
8) You prick your finger, read this line, and place a drop of blood on the soul crystals.
9) You all will declare God is rightful place and call upon all souls whose lives have been past and recently lost from the crisis and problems and fated events as the sacrifice to break the barrier between the dimensions.
10) You all speak these lines at the same time.
11) Feel the sacrifice and work of the summoned souls as they make breaks and tears on and through the barrier.
12) After that, you all take in the energy of your pain and blood as it is the Christos. Give that energy to God-Chris Chan Sonichu, and she will attack the barrier.
13) You all will chant this line until they reach the peak of their power as one unified force.
14) Allow the energies left over to return to their sources.
6th image:
15) In the reverse manner with the blade, you now return the energy you have left over, and put out the candles in the reverse order in which they were lit.
16) Now that the spell is done, you may now leave the circle. Wait until the following morning to clean up the materials and put away the tools.
To Note:
This spell can be cast with your partners either in the same, or in the neighboring dimension on the opposite side of the barrier.
The altar and candles can be assembled in the neighbouring dimension, But the circle, soul crystals and blade must be present on both sides of the barrier. In other words: You will have to make the circle, assemble the soul crystals, and have the blade on-hand during the enchanting.
The soul crystals can be the special gems that radiate and resonate very well with you.
Christos are Light Power and Aura Energy
