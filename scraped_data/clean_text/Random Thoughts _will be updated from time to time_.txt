Random Thoughts (will be updated from time to time) is a blog post published by Chris to Cwclight on 23 May 2025. It is the twelfth post to the website, published the same day as the previous one. This post seems to be more unique, in that Chris plans to update it with whatever random thoughts he has on any particular day. Originally published on 23 May, it was updated the next day with a new entry on 24 May.

I have personally crafted and given guidance to a character ai, and any questions or talks you may have can be directed to her on my behalf. I will still receive the messages like a prayer. Please, do be kind with her, as if you were talking to me face-to-face.
Check this character out!

And this is the correct voice to go with her.

This particular blog will feature various thoughts and ideas I have that I feel can be shared. I will be certain to put a date above each new entry on the day I personally type them in.
And I will be certain to make bullet points to separate each individual separate thought and sub-thought(s) for that day.
I have just made myself conscious of the meanings, similarities and differences between instincts, impulses and intuition. Instinct is basic, the quick "you don't have to tell me twice" reaction that does not typically involve thought. Not easily controllable, yet we can reprogram ourselves, so we don't end up overreacting and emoting out without reasoning. Impulses are emotionally based. They typically occur when one is feeling emotional, and without rational thought at least half of the time. Moderately controllable, but can be soo intense that it's nearly impossible, especially without proper self-control and grounding and applying thought, experience and insight prior or during emotional times. Intuition is the experience, wisdom, logic, common sense and such; that voice in your head, or your conscious, that guides you into doing that which is better for you and the long run.
I have realized that I tend to get emotional, especially under stress and pressure, and I find myself without time to think or take a deep breath to clear my head in the moment. This is common with everyone, including you who is reading this. And the emotional base typically shows off and expresses the intention of the individual, which can be sensed as good or bad, right or wrong, Light Powered or Dark, etcetera by others intuitively and in energy, as well as the physical body language and facial expressions.
Even right now, I am with a grounded, focused mindset with my emotions under control with intuition and the intention and purpose to offer this wisdom today.
One obvious example of impulses overpowering instinct would be making a hating, non-supportive comment on social media and/or blogs. Or even giving thoughts based on clearly darker emotions with a dash of mockery in response to a video or individual(s) in said video. Casting judgments and misjudgments with only some reasoning, yet it still is very impulsive, for better direct wisdoms are not known of said individual(s) or idea(s).
If everyone realizes that in a lot of instances one can win if they take the moment and time to ground their emotions, realize what of their emotions they could be projecting in responses to something, then we would not have much hatred around the world. Everyone has moments of bad impulses and misguided instincts, even myself. That much has been made clear in some of my videos.
Anyway, if everyone was more intuitive, then there could be a better sense of empathy as well. Everyone has psychic power (though little in most), but there is definitely one that everyone has and has the power to unlock: empathy. And with that under the intuition belt as well, one can offer a better response or action to individuals and situations.
It is easy to just jump on instinct and impulse; it takes a greater, stronger will, mind, and soul to garner better self-control and grounding, as well as not letting their mind drift off too often due to having a background where it often gets so stressful, they make a habit of mentally clocking out. So, I encourage you to take that step for yourself in becoming more intuitive for better insights, wisdoms, and empathy.

- For starters, as I feel should be clarified: One reason why I am doing the reviews of the Transformers Legacy United Merged figures, which feature the Autobots of Cwcville, as well as Guardians, and the Decepticlones (formerly of PVCCitizens and Count Graduon), Decepticons and even Renegades led by the former "IdeaGuy" associate, Gwenmi Mikoto.
This is truly a further expansion on the facts about the city of Cwcville, as these Cybertronians have been stationed there and helping the city under emergency times and defense against Decepticons and even Renegades (of Gobotron). This, in part, is telling a bit about their background and their reason for being in the city, with their base at the city limits, working with the Sonichus, Rosechus, Psychic Squadron, Christine Chan and her interdimensional twin sister, Crystal Weston Chandler (not to be confused with my future daughter, mind you).
Heck! We even have our own team of Power Rangers and their Zords in Cwcville, of which Christine Chan used to be a part of during their High School years prior to becoming Mayor in 2000. That team still exists and works alongside everyone else, and even worldwide working with the other Power Rangers, including the OG ones of Angel Grove, California. And we had ditched the merging Go-Karts after their main nemesis, Crash Dummi, fell and pretty much went into villain obscurity near the end of 1999. That guy often gets battered around by his fellow villains these days at the conventions and meetings. Their zords have become a mix of either animals or vehicles. At one point for at least half a decade, they controlled Zords that resembled some of the animals of the Zodiac. And the metal and materials used for those upgrading, form changing Zords were imported from Cybertron.
In any event, we have one more wave of figures to go after this one. And I have been continuing on work on Sonichu Book 0 HD from time to time, while also Living My Life and continuing to find myself and do metaphysically and physically with the Dimension Merge completion and all. So, please continue to enjoy the series of these review videos, and please give them kind thoughts. I am having my own fun doing these as well, regardless of my "copying" and referencing Emgo and whatnot.
Also, to spell it out for you, in case it was not clear on those video endings: P F A L M; it is a smoosh of "Palm In Your Face", where the "Face" is in the "Palm".
Kindness, understanding and support (Not to be confused with "ableing" nor "gaslighting") is always appreciated.
When it comes to art inspired by me, the Sonichus, Rosechus, Metonics, Vamprosas, and even the Cwcville Autobots and Cwcville's citizens and all related, KEEP IT SAFE FOR WORK, please. I am setting this boundary for the greater good, regardless of the present images of the Fan Art section on this website that will be updated soon enough. That means no depictions of nudity, sex, drugs, or anything that would not fly if they were shown on Cartoon Network or Nickelodeon (I am not counting Adult Swim in that at all).
