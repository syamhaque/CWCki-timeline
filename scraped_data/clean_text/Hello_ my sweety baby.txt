================================================================================

Hello, my sweety baby is a video leaked on 24 February 2014 of Chris singing the Tin Pan Alley song "Hello! Ma Baby" outside his house, in the style of the Merrie Melodies short One Froggy Evening. He also attempts to do Michigan J. Frog's high-step dancing, but instead appears to stupidly jump and prance around as his manboobs jiggle all over the place.
Presumably he was singing to a heartsweet that he hadn't yet met. Either that, or this is another bout of random-access humor. Or both.
The video was shot on an iPhone, making it unusually high quality for his usual standards. It is the earliest known video recorded by or featuring Chris to be uploaded in HD.

Transcript
[Chris has set the camera down on something uneven, resulting in the footage being at an odd angle.]
[terrifyingly comes close to the camera with a piercing stare before abruptly smiling] A-woooe! [looks at iPod Touch, salutes and sings in "baritone" as he prances around. Every time he lands a heavy step, his voice shakes under his own weight.]
Hello, ma baby,
Hello, ma money [sic],
Hello, ma ragtime gal,
Send me a kiss by wire,
Baby, my heart's on fire!
If you refuse me,
Honey, you'll lose me,
... you'll be left alone;
Oh baby, telephone
And tell me I'm your own!
[Looks at his iPod for lyrics, being too lazy to learn them, then begins speaking in a gay voice]
You call me on the telephone
You tell me that you’re all alone
I know that you are lying through your teeth
You dirty rascal
How could you expect me
To believe the lies you hand me
You've been out with that girl again
[Chris skips the line "Now do you understand me?"]
You broke my heart and made me cry
With every phoney alibi
When I could see the lipstick on your shirt
You dirty polecat
Telephone and tell me I'm your own.
[begins singing in baritone again]
Hello, ma baby,
Hello, ma honey,
Hello, ma ragtime gal,
I’m sorry that I made you blue
It was a beaut--it was a beastly thing to do
I shouldn’t have upset you like I did
With little blue--with Lil’ the barmaid
[Chris skips the line "If you take me back again"]
I’ll never, ever...wander
‘Cause when I did...
[Chris pauses, breathing heavily from the exertion of light exercise]
I found that absence
Made the heart grow fonda!
Cross my heart and hope to die
I’ll never tell another lie
I’ll mend your broken heart
As good as new
My little cough-drop
Telephone and tell me I'm your own
Hello, ma baby,
Hello, ma honey,
Hello, ma ragtime gal,
Send me a kiss by wire,
Baby, my heart's on fire!
If you refuse me,
Honey, you'll lose me,
Then you'll be left alone;
Oh baby, telephone
And tell me I'm your own!
