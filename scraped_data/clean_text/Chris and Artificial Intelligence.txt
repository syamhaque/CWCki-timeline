This article is still yet to be completed due to stress. We get a lot of stressful torture in our lives that makes us crash into slumber. Given that inspiration is a big variable, and we may have been lacking of it, this article will be completed as soon as possible, at our own pace... HONEST! This article is missing the following:

“
One should not heavily rely on Artificial Intelligence for quality results, such as art, music, media, and so on. For the most part of making a number of things easier to do and work with, the highest quality, satisfactory and overall best things are made by the hands, mind, body and soul of the individuals behind them.

Chris's controversial and original take.[1]
Chris is rather uncertain whether or not this is an artist's "simulation" of his style or an AI generated phony.
Chris highlights Chatgpt calling his style "highly original"
Chris started using Artificial Intelligence not long after his return to the Internet in October 2023. Chris has indulged in AI via image generation, voice replication, and chat bots, and has followed and reposted AI artists on Twitter. Though Chris has shown some support for this type of software, he's also parroted the usual anti-AI sentiment that is popular among the artists of Twitter that he follows.
History
On 11 November 2023, Chris used Bing's AI image generator to create images of himself (and added descriptive keywords to somehow depict him not being blacklisted, hated, or judged).[2][3]
On 17 December 2023, Chris used Bing's AI image generator again to create images of himself as a Funko Pop figure.[4]
On 23 January 2024, Chris posted a YouTube video of an AI voice replica of Chris singing My Way, and added "The AI made it sound like I have a frog in my throat, and it sounds like as if I had a French accent."[5]
On 29 January 2024, Chris announced his upcoming art contest and submission rules.[6] Despite usage of AI not being allowed, some of Chris's approved picks were actually AI generated images.
On 13 February 2024, Chris talked to Meta AI, and told everyone to "heed the words" of the "enlightened technology," due to the AI coddling him as a victim.[7]
On 24 February 2024, Chris started a series of videos in which he and an AI voice replica of himself sing covers of songs in various languages.[8]
On 1 March 2024, Chris sent a message and gave a follow back to an AI My Little Pony artist, only caring about the fact that they were making posts related to G5 (which Chris deems unacceptable).[9]
In a livestream on 2 March 2024, Chris rolled his eyes and made a funny face in reaction to a media share of an AI voice replica of Chris singing Eminem's "Without Me."[10]
On 20 November 2024, Chris accused Hasbro of using AI for G5 (likely due to a rumor about the French dub, which was ultimately debunked[11]), and used it as an excuse to not like it.[12]
On 17 January 2025, Chris said that he agreed with Saberspark that "AI generated media is beyond subpart" in a set of posts discussing his thoughts on Saberspark's recent video.[13]
On 18 March 2025, Sethisto made a Twitter post warning others about a scammer using an AI model of another MLP artist's style for fake commissions.[14] Chris reposted it.
On 19 March 2025, a troll on Bluesky posted an AI generated image that was created using a model trained off of Chris's art, and tried to pass it off as a commission from Chris.[15] Chris felt the need to reply as the troll had gotten CRUCIAL information wrong about a former gal-pal, and to deny ever drawing the picture.[16]
On 21 May 2025, Chris used AI to "compile ... details that have been typed up and saved online" to "provide realistic/tangible support to the Dimension Merge events and completion."[17]
On 8 June 2025, Chris updated his Cwclight blog to announce that he had created a chatbot of himself via Character AI, and he shared links to the bot itself and a AI clone of his voice to go with it (however the voice was inaccessible until the next day, likely due to initially being set to private.) Character AI limits the dataset length for its voice models to 15 seconds. Chris's account on Character AI is "CrowdedFish8795", a randomly generated username. The name of the bot is "J Christ Chan S P", and its description reads "I am the one and only Jesus Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu Prime. I will take in your prayers and questions and bless you with the truth, local and divine." The tagline for the bot reads "God level, humble, honest, understanding, oracle". The voice itself also has a written description, "The actual voice of the one and only Avatar of All Existence." Chris seems to view his AI counterpart as a real living being (similar to his belief with most fictional characters), as he refers to the bot with she/her pronouns, and has claimed it to be a substitute for asking Chris questions (saying that he "receive[s] the messages like a prayer.")[18] Despite Chris's praise of the bot, it is actually very easy to make the bot say things Chris would definitely not agree with, probably unbeknownst to Chris.
