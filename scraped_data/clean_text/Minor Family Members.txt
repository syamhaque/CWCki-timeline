“
mom and dad's relatives gave us constant cold shoulders, thinking they're royalty, when really they're no better off.
”
Chris, 2011[1]
It's a Chandler family reunion! From bottom left, clockwise: Uncle Raymond, Cousin Jon Carey, Christian, Bob, and everyone's favorite, Yawning Squirtle.
Chris has many family members whom he or his parents have mentioned but who are not important enough to constitute their own articles. Those who do not reside at 14 Branchland Court generally lead relatively normal lives. Few of these relatives are still on speaking terms with Chris or Barb, but many of them were a presence in Chris's earlier life. This article aims to chronicle all such relatives mentioned by Chris and his parents directly or indirectly.
Chris had little to no contact with his family members as of late and it's unlikely they want anything to do with him ever since his affair with his own mother.
Family members who died prior to the birth of Chris can be found on the Chandler Family Tree.

Chandler Side
Patricia Chandler
Patricia Harley, 1954
Patricia Faye Harley (born 20 November 1935), is Bob Chandler's first wife, a native Floridian and the mother of Drs. Carol and Alan.[2] She and Bob married at the respective ages of 20 and 29 on 29 September 1956 at a Methodist church in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and divorced on 28 January 1980 after a year-long separation. She was still alive at the time of Bob's death.
Alan Chandler
Dr. David Alan Chandler.
Alan as a Jerkop, in Amiibo form.
Dr. David Alan Chandler (born 28 November 1961 in Roanoke, Virginia)[3][4] is an ophthalmologist in Richmond, Glen Allen and Mechanicsville, Virginia, son of Bob Chandler and Bob's ex-wife Patricia, and older half-brother to Chris. Both Bob and Chris call him by his middle name. Alan's wife's name is Kimberly.[2]
Alan went to high school in Chesterfield County,[5] earned a B.A. degree in biology from University of Virginia in 1984 and earned Doctor of Medicine degree in medicine at Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine in 1988. He later completed internship in Internal Medicine from Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk and was also trained at Washington Hospital Center.[6][7][8] He donated $1,000 to the Republican Party between May 2007 and September 2008,[9] showing that he agrees with his father on politics if nothing else. He specializes in small incision cataract extraction with lens implant, medical and surgical management of glaucoma, and the diagnosis and treatment of diabetic eye disease.[5]
Chris had an eye exam with him on 6 January 2004 and learned then that Alan had a daughter by the name of Savannah, making Chris a (half-)uncle and Bob a grandfather. Chris also falsely claimed it made Barb a grandmother.
Diary entry:
“
January 6: Today, I had an appointment with my optometrist [sic], and big half-brother, Dr. David Alan Chandler, for an Eye-Exam. I needed new lenses, but I can keep my current frames. But apparently, he has an 8-year-old daughter, Savannah. So for about 8 years, I’ve been an uncle and didn’t know it. Of course, this also makes my parents into grandparents as well. Needless to say, we were happy to know about that.
”
Christian Weston Chandler
One weekend Chris and Bob traveled to Alan's house to visit his family. The family was not at home, so Chris and Bob left gifts with the next-door neighbors to give to them; an angel for Savannah from Bob and Squinkies toys with a "display" from Chris.[10]
Unlike Carol, Alan attended Bob's funeral. At the funeral Chris presented him with further gifts to give to Savannah.[11]
In Family Needs to appreciate Family, Chris called Alan out on not visiting Barb, seemingly unaware that Alan probably barely knows her and is not related to her by blood.
Carol Chandler
Carol Amiibo.
Dr. Carol Suzanne Chandler (born 9 July 1964 in Roanoke, Virginia)[3] is Chris's half-sister and daughter of the late Bob Chandler and his first wife Patricia.
According to Chris, Carol is a Math "Geinus" [sic] and "wiz."[12] She is known to have won the 1988 Mathematics Department McShane Prize at the University of Virginia.[13] Carol attended Providence Middle School.[14] Later, in 1988, she graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a B.A. degree in Mathematics from University of Virginia. She had been accepted for advanced studies by 4 universities in northeastern US and another university in Toronto; she chose to study at Stony Brook University from Long Island, New York.[15] She later earned a Ph.D. and is or was working for the federal government in Washington, D.C.[16]
According to Chris, Bob was always concerned about Carol. She and Bob seemed to have a negative or distant relationship, as it was implied in the Savannah messages that she did not attend his funeral.[17] In November 2015, Chris made a YouTube video in which he and his allies beat up Carol and other family members in Super Smash Bros. "Alan and Carol, you two have never really appreciated our Father", he wrote in the video description. "There WAS Time for you two to share time with him before his passing, but NO, you all have been selfish and caught up in your own lives that HE gave to us". He posted an image of a Carol Amiibo on Facebook, depicting her as a heartless Janekop.
Wayne Chandler
A copy of Chris's DVD that was sent to a troll included a list of people whom Chris wanted to include in the slideshow but could not due to not having photos of them. One of those people was an uncle on Bob's side called Wayne.[18] Wayne's full name is apparently
William Wayne Chandler (born 18 January 1955), and he is in fact a half-uncle of Chris's rather than a full uncle. Little is known about him, but the fact that Chris mentioned him alone among Bob's eight half-siblings suggests that they had some kind of relationship. According to his mother Dorothy's obituary, Wayne was living in Florida at the time of her death in 2015.[19]
Relatives in North Carolina
In his letter to Chris from 1987, Bob mentioned that his father, Robert Franklin Chandler, Sr. (1906-77), like himself and Barb, had children through a second marriage, who at the time resided near Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Robert Sr.'s second wife was Dorothy Julie Chandler (née Wolfe, 1924-2015). The couple had eight surviving children, including Wayne Chandler, as well as many grandchildren and great-grandchildren. As of 2023, six of the children are still living.[20][21] Five of the children still lived in North Carolina, while one lives in Florida.[22]
Relatives in Oklahoma
Over the course of two prank calls Bob mentioned that he had a cousin in Tulsa, Oklahoma and "a lot of Cherokee relatives" living in the state as well.[23][24]. The cousin is most likely
John James Hood, Sr. (1923-2021).
Virtually nothing is known about them, and there is no indication that any of these relatives ever interacted with Chris.

Acrostic invented by Chris to remember the birth order of the Weston kids: Edna, Stanley, Corina, Leroy, Barbara, Harriet, Madeline, Wayne.[25]
Jonathan Carey
Chris's cousin?
Jonathan Bailey Carey[26] (born 21 September 1987) is Chris's first cousin once removed and Aunt Corrina's grandson. Chris attended his wedding in Red Oak, Virginia on the weekend of 27-28 June 2009, the same weekend on which BILLY MAYS tragically died. According to Chris, his presence at the wedding is proof that he did not murder Billy.[27]
Raymond Inge
Raymond Boyd Inge
Raymond Boyd Inge (31 July 1935 – 12 April 2025) was Chris's step-uncle, the second husband and widower of Aunt Corrina, and the step-grandfather of Jonathan Carey.[28] According to Chris, Uncle Raymond can be contacted as a witness to Chris at Jonathan's wedding. Raymond is the stepbrother-in-law of Snorlax, making Jonathan her great-nephew.
Wayne Weston
Curtis Wayne Weston (born 1 April 1950)[29] is Barbara's youngest brother and Chris's uncle. He is mentioned in Chris's 27 November 2021 letter to Kenneth Engelhardt as one of Barb's relatives who offered her assistance after her car accident. He is mentioned again in Jail Letter - 29 July 2022, where Chris reveals that he, like Harriet and Tom, lives in the Richmond suburbs. As of Corrina's death, Harriet and Wayne are Barb's only surviving siblings.[30]
Wayne Weston, 1969
Other aunts and uncles
In addition to Corrina, Harriet and Wayne, Barbara has four other siblings, all deceased: Edna (1927–1995), Stanley (1932–1983), Leroy (1937–1998) and Madeline (1944–1982).[25][31] Little is known about their relationships with Chris, although Chris does seem to have been acquainted with Leroy's wife and son (see below).
Other Careys and Westons
A copy of Chris's DVD that was sent to a troll included a list of people whom Chris wanted to present in the DVD but could not
due to not having pictures of them. Along with Jonathan Carey and Wayne Chandler, the list included Joseph Carey, Beverly Carey, Joey Carey, Matthew Carey, Leroy and Ruby Weston and somebody just called "Van".[32] Joseph Edward Carey, Sr. (1956–2022)[33] was Corrina's son and Jonathan Carey's father. Beverly Carey (née Bailey) (1963-2024)[34] is Joseph's wife and Jonathan's mother. Joey is probably Joseph Edward Carey, Jr., the son of Joseph Sr. and Beverly. Matthew may be Daniel Matthew Carey, another son of Joseph and Beverly. Van Wade Carey is Joseph's brother. Leroy is probably Leroy Lewis Weston, Jr., the son of Barbara's deceased older brother Leroy (see above). Ruby Weston (née Puryear) (1939-2018)[35] is Leroy Jr.'s mother and Leroy Sr.'s widow.[36]
Chris's Facebook profile lists Beverly and Joe as cousins. Van Carey is an amateur genealogist who has provided the world with information on his and Chris's ancestors.[37][38] Joey, Matthew and Jonathan are also mentioned in Chris's 2002 Letter to Santa Claus.
Cousin Madeline and her sister
For Christmas 2001, Chris burned a CD for his cousin Madeline entitled Sing-A-Longs For Madeline. He also kept a copy of the CD for himself, which he put up for sale on Cwclight in September 2024 for $100. In the description of the CD, Chris reveals that Madeline was younger than him and that the last he had heard of her she was still living at home with her family in either Red Oak or Chesterfield.
Madeline is also mentioned in Chris's 2002 Letter to Santa Claus, along with her sister, who is not named.
Unnamed autistic cousin
According to the autism papers, Chris has a severely autistic cousin on his mother's side. Nothing more is known about this cousin.
Unnamed genealogist cousin
In the Rental House Tour Barb mentions that she has a cousin who shares her delusions about the Weston family history and "put together a pilgrimage" related to it. Catherine and Al cut her off before she could tell them where they went.
