I have an idea. Why not do Sonichu as a novel or a series of short stories? I think that might work out better for you.
Begging for money
July 10 at 12:46pm
Can Anyone lend me 20 or $50 immediately via PayPal?
Replies:
Are you okay or stuck somewhere?
You never accept proper help when offered 😏
What's it for? PM me - I may be able to help if it's serious.
Christine, I don't think these videos asking for donations is the way to go about this. Have you considered getting a consult about consolidating your debts into one monthly payment? You will come out a lot better compared to what you're forking over to these credit card companies. Believe me you will sleep easier at night.
Sonic Boom Binge
July 12 at 3:32am
I've been binging on Sonic Boom through Hulu. Knuckles was Never that dumb before. Even his grammar and Common Sense used to be more normal. What the hell did SEGA let happen to him; did the "Y" chromosomes take over his and their brains or something? Ugh.

Sonic Boom Review
July 12 at 10:23am
I have just finished watching the whole first season of ‪#‎SonicBoom‬ on ‪#‎hulu‬, so I am all caught up there. Regardless of the outdated blue arms protest, and how I felt about the blue arms on Sonic, I feel this animated series has really Dumbed on the main male characters, which is quite an obvious mistake, as well as just plain Stupid to do. The Good quality I liked about it was it promoting the intelligence on Amy Rose, and putting positive light onto the female characters, including a few who were in the background; that was a smart move.
The highlights that offer satisfaction to the series, I feel, would have to be amongst the first third to half of the total 52 quarter-hour episodes, and moreover the serious tones brought in by Metal Sonic and Shadow the Hedgehog. And lastly, the most comical highlight, Knuckles dancing in the conga line in the hot dog costume on New Years Eve. I feel the people should Not dumbed down anything, as not only children watch the shows on ‪#‎CartoonNetwork‬, but the adults and adult fans of the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise as well.
Also, I find the best room for improvement in the show is to promote Common Sense, Learning from past actions for the better, and all that sort. Maybe conk Knuckles on the head with a coconut or something, so for the Entire Remaining of the series, he could actually be smarter like he used to be.
Anyhow, that is all for now. Thank you, and have a good and safe day.
Too Stressed to Play Pokemon Go
July 13 at 12:22am
Hey. JWitzz has posted his review about the new popular app, putting the Cons first in his video. Personally, I have downloaded the app, but I have not opened or played it at all yet. A lot of the cons do give me a spook. And, frankly, I am not certain I am going to even start on this; NOT to put the game or anyone who has played it down at all. But, I have had Soo many stresses and anxieties in my life, not to mention fickle finances that send my noggin spinning. Lately, I Have been feeling super down and out, that my sleep schedule has become a mess, and when I Had the day schedule going in a fair routine for myself. I am feeling mentally out of it, and I have not been able to afford going out much. But that's just my bunch of emotions and Pluto-size anxiety pile-ups over, on and in my head and life. Too Much. I'm feeling old.

"I'm not on drugs!"
July 15 at 5:28am
That's how I am feeling right now. PLEASE, At Least Help Me with Buying one or Both of my Pokemon Cards Right Now!
P.S., I am NOT on any drugs, nor have I ever smoked, you accusing, Prevaricating, Internet Trolls and Cyber-Bullies.
And, I supposed my mother and I and our two dogs can Starve, since Nobody Wants to Donate to actually Help Us Here at home, anymore. Ugh!
Chris quickly edited the message to add this:
Actual Fans and Good People who have donated do not count in that statement. Thank you all Good People for helping us. Please, help us more.

Ohhh! Well, I have no use for pokemon cards. Are you selling your PS4 at all? That'll prob be a big help for your mama.
Kim Wilson
You haven't smoked any drugs. That much is true.
But you're on lipitor, among other drugs. And you've tried marijuana.
Kim Wilson
Just to clarify, I'm talking about the cannabis you got from Bobby Marley at omegacon. Not the stuff you were offered at Impulse.
Jessica Quinn
Cheer up, things could be worse... But things could be better - if you gain the confidence and attitude to shake things up and turn your life around. You're the only one who can make yourself happy!
Kim Wilson
Also be careful of using words like "prevaricate". It make you look really, really dumb. Think "reeeeeeeeee short bus" level dumb. It's a signal of education you don't have. Just a style tip. ;)
A general suggestion: if a word seems complicated, don't use it. It reflects really, really badly on you.
Kenneth Engelhardt (deleted)
Christine you are going to have to make some tough decisions. Judging from that video, your mother is already showing signs of dementia. Sell that hoard in your room. If you have to sell it for 50 cents or even 25 cents on the dollar that's what has to be done. It's going to be up to you to take the bull by the horns.

Also, Thanks to a Paid Request video full of the "F" word, YouTube not only removed it, but issued a strike against me. Second Strike. I am left unable to upload Any videos right now, maybe even for a Long While.
Therefore, this window is for Donations Only. No video requests until further notice. Ugh.
Thanks a Lot, Dumb Person!
Donations still requested.
Please send donations directly to us via PayPal to my email address: ChrisChanSonichu@aol.com. Thank you.

Christine you were set up. This smells like Kiwifarms if ask me.
Just some helpful advice: Maybe you should think twice before going into these "gray areas".
Or stick to more pleasant material. I still think you should tap into your creativity and go back to doing what you love to do. Making inane request video where you KNOW people are going to make you do/say/read awful things for money is degrading to yourself.
You're better than this. You know it.
I have grown a labia!
24 July 2016 at 11:40 am
**Announcement**
As a number of online people may be aware, I have been grooving with the subliminal frequencies and binaural beats towards my transition from male to female body. The source being the Subliminal Frequency Hypnosis Wizards Binaural Beats channel on YouTube. Last March, I've started simple with growing my breasts out with their Breast Growth Hormone track; it worked to my amazement at a full inch outward per week in about two months. I've also listened to change my nipples to teats, as well as begin producing breast milk. Also, related, from a separate track on another channel, I have eased and cured the worst of my autism too. But since last May, I decided to take it a step further and begin my transition from male to female with the penis to vagina tracks, including the individual organ changing tracks, and for a while the Intersex track. And two Fridays ago, July 15, while I slept that night, my labia started splitting open, and I found the initial hole and blood the next morning. And over the few days that followed, the labia opened to its full length, and I've been dealing with the blood that came out. I have been keeping it clean, daily monitoring it, and treating it with rubbing alcohol. I have started the wheels in motion for the full HRT and SRS by Seeing My Doctor last Friday, because I felt like I didn't want to wait much longer to fully become the woman that I should have been born as.
With that, I have uploaded a photo of my labia onto imgur, http://m.imgur.com/gallery/pb1ovpJ, for all 18+ year old individuals to see. BUT, I do not want to be overrun with tabloid and paparazzi attention over this, or have a total big deal made.
As for my own statement to quote, I will state the following: Have belief and faith in what your body can do, and with such binaural beats and frequencies, as well as persistence and patience, what you'd like can happen for you.
And if you'd like to offer your support in my transition as well, I accept financial donations via PayPal to my email address, ChrisChanSonichu@aol.com.
Thank you, and have a good and safe day.

...fuck it. I'm out. I don't even know what one can say about this. Why would you post something this messed up?
Good luck with whatever it is you're trying to do with your life. I tried.
I just don't get it, WHY would you post this kind of stuff?
You were JUST complaining about how people invade every aspect of your life and that you wouldn't share anything so personal and now you do... THIS!
I don't even know what to think right now. My mind is blown.
Kenneth Engelhardt
I would advise most strongly against any nude photos of yourself on the internet. It is prime trolling stuff and it comes across as exercising extremely poor judgment. Jessica is absolutely 100% correct in this. Your nude photos of your "equipment" have absolutely no place on the internet.
Quinn
Ken, it's a little more serious than that. This could be a major health problem brewing.
Quinn
What's more important is his health.
Whomever is putting Christine up to this, please stop. This could lead to a serious life threatening health problem.
I know many people follow what goes on on this page - whomever is pulling the strings needs to stop. It's sick and twisted and a life could very well be at stake here.
Please Christine Weston Chandler, go and get looked at. I support your right to be who you want, but this is a very serious matter.
Engelhardt
Christine this could be a sign of an infection setting in? Do you understand that if this gets into your bloodstream you could very well end up in the ICU at the hospital. This isn't transitioning, this is endangering your health for nothing. This is bullshit. You have a family member who is dependent on your well-being.

Labia exam

Please get a second opinion then. This is a serious matter.
If you weren't afraid to share this whole ordeal earlier, it shouldn't be a problem to prove you've gone to the doctor's to get checked out. Paperwork, a receipt, hell a parking ticket to prove you actually went.
You could be putting yourself at serious risk Christine. People are truly worried about you. Please don't brush it off!
Engelhardt
Christine, I saw that picture of your "labia". That is not a vagina, that's a fistula with a possible perineal abscess developing. This won't be visible from the surface. I don't who has been fucking with your head in this manner but a number of us are upset not only for your sake but for Barbara's sake as well.
Jennifer Marie
I wouldn't necessarily call it a fistula, the initial piercing would be considered a fistula; however, that certainly is not a labia. Chris, this cannot be comfortable. I'm glad it's not infected, but that is a very deep wound, and you need to take care of it properly, or else it will get infected very quickly, and very badly (think of when your mom had wounds on her butt infected...). I would not want to see you end up in the hospital with a systemic infection.

Hey, Trolls. Gotcha! That photo was a fake. I have no wound down there. And, by the way, "abcess" implies presence of Pus; there is NO pus in the photo. Crazy people. To clarify: the photo was a hoax.

I get the gist of this article, but I thought it was going to be more focused on body image issues and dealing with them. Basically two women were being catty and didn't like her shorts so she made a Facebook post saying "k thx, love your hair and makeup."
...I think there are far more news stories to cover apart from a couple girls' critique of shorts.
Chris likes Steven Universe
‪28 July at 3:24 pm
#‎StevenUniverse‬ is a good show. My favorite of the lead gems is Pearl, because I can relate to her. But what is awesome is Garnet being a fusion of Ruby and Sapphire, and not only that, but they are a lesbian love that is super strong to be able to remain together for such a long time. It is really sweet.

Reading: A Girl Who Brought Down the World
30 July at 8:14 pm
First Chapter response: Even back in 2008, I never ever had garbage for furniture, I was not fat, and I was Never an "Evil Santa Clause". Regardless, I would relate with Kid and Vivian on Not wanting to reside next door to anyone with hoards of garbage cluttering about. I don't and I would not want to.
