This article is still yet to be completed due to stress. We get a lot of stressful torture in our lives that makes us crash into slumber. Given that inspiration is a big variable, and we may have been lacking of it, this article will be completed as soon as possible, at our own pace... HONEST!
Troll disclosure: This persona was created, appropriated, or otherwise used by trolls to manipulate Chris. In spite of his testimony to the contrary, Alec created Asperchu as a parody of Sonichu and all the lore associated with Chris-Chan. He also played Jackie and Lars.Though this identity is contrived, the CWCki may treat it as if it were a real identity because it was to Chris. (It's also funnier that way.)
This article discusses Alec Benson Leary and his interactions with Chris. For information about his award-winning comic Asperchu, see Asperchu.

Alec advertised his comic to Chris multiple times through email, however none of these interactions have been made public. Alec's first public interaction with Chris was through the CWCipedia Mailbag, in Mailbag 10.
From: Alec-chan Asperchu <albasperchu@live.com>
Chris,
This is Alec. Why have you not responded to the truly amazing comic I sent you?
I am referring of course to my one TRUE and HONEST creation, the original ASPERCHU, the electric/aspergers type hedgehog pokemon, which I recently showed to you as a token of my esteem for you. I think you are perhaps scared and confused by my rise to greatness. If I knew you were to ever be worried by my meteoric rise to fame, I would NEVER have written to you with such uncareful regard for your feelings. I wanted you to know that you have inspired me to GREATNESS, NOT to take anything away.
You have recently written your feelings on the ASPERGERS, which shows me that you are indeed worried that one such as I wants to take away your fame and glory, and I assure you this is simply the furthest from the TRUTH. Allow me to enlighten you on the real nature of the aspergers, which as you say is not like the autism. For one, we aspergers folks have the troubles with communicating to other people, we are very shy and have trouble making others to understand us. We also, secondly, have trouble with focusing too much on one thing at a time. I think that is where the confusion lies, for people see your utter DEVOTION to only Sonichu and your Playstation 3 and NOTHING ELSE as perhaps connected to aspergers; they do not realize that the fact you do not have time for the lesser things like work and friends as a sign of a TRUE and HONEST artist.
On a second note, I think you were scared of my speaking to you because I compared myself to you. You see, I did not mean to compare my ASPERGERS to your AUTISM, for as you say the two are totally and completely different and are never and have never been the SAME. The only way I wanted to compare myself to you is that as you are an artist, I aspire to be an amazing artist as well. I hope you will accept my peace offering of ASPERCHU and SONICHU meeting as friends that I have attached.
Your friend and protege,
Alec Benson Leary
Chris did not take kindly to this.
Firstly, YOU WISH YOU WERE ME, and second, I apologize for putting your letter into the Reject page, but I felt it necessary, because 1), you are obviously a Troll from what you've typed. And 2), your drawing infers homosexuality, and I DO NOT CARE FOR THAT GOD DAMN LIFESTYLE OR WHATEVER WORD IS USED TO DESCRIBE IT!!! --ChrisChanSonichu 04:00, 7 December 2009 (CET)
Alec tried again to get the approval of Chris in Mailbag 17
Good, godly, STRAIGHT fun!
From: Alec Benson Leary
Christian,
First of all, I wish to say how sorry I am. I have nothing but the greatist respect for you and your artistic talent, I only meant to show you how awesome I think Sonichu is. I NEVER meant to suggest that Sonichu was a despicable HOMOGAY.
I only wanted to show ASPERCHU and his brother Sonichu having good, godly, STRAIGHT fun together as friends and brothers. So to make up for my previous error, I have created a completely NEW image to show how they are both manly men enjoying the joys of brotherhood.
Your friend and protege,
Alec Benson Leary
Chris, yet again, did not respond kindly to this.
YOU HAVE DONE WRONG with this drawing; it only depicts the OPPOSITE OF STRAIGHT, you D.A. There may be a HUMAN character coming into the books with aspergers, but there will certainly NEVER BE A SONICHU or ROSECHU WITH THAT AILMENT.
The Calls
Main article: Alec Benson Leary calls
The Alec Benson Leary calls are a series of calls between Chris and Alec. Throughout the calls, Alec argues with Chris about Asperchu and Sonichu and the war between them. Along with this, he chastises Chris for stealing Evan's character Simonchu and turning him into a much worse character, Simonla
Despite the calls starting out as discussions about Asperchu, they cover a wide range of topics regarding Chris's lifestyle, such as his laziness, gaming addiction and so on. The calls are similar to the Kacey calls in the fact that Alec is trying to give Chris a reality check, but instead of how Kacey acted as a potentional heartsweet, Alec acts more like a father figure to Chris, simplifying his sentences to try and get through to Chris.
Alec's main objective in these calls is to get Chris to make a sincere apology towards him and the other members of the Asperpedia Four, something that Chris fails at three whole times. Despite Alec being possibly the least antagonistic troll Chris has dealt with, he still hates him an absurd amount, shown best in Sonichu 10, where he is electrocuted to death by all of Chris's characters.
These calls were all leaked by Mao
Calling Out
See also: Calling Out "Alec Benson Leary" - Christopher and Christopher Paul Whitney reveal
After attempting to ignore Alec for well over a year and a half, Chris suddenly turned around and revealed a possible dox on Alec. He proclaimed that he's a "fatty-fat-fat" named Christopher who makes donations to The GAMe PLACe and doesn't have Asperger's. Like Surfshack Tito and Thorg, he demanded reparations – namely that he make a video apologizing for infringing on his Sonichu "copyright" and then leave the Internet.
On 30 August 2011, the day before Alec's deadline, Chris revealed the true identity of Alec as 36-year-old "Christopher Paul Whitney", of San Antonio, Texas, better known as YouTube sensation "Fatman". Fatman later made a video response, where he called Chris a "dumb ass" for thinking he was Alec. Chris never replied to the video and presumably never saw it due to the death of his father a week after he "revealed" Fatman.
