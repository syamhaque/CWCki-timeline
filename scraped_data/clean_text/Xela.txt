“
Why did we become what we are today? Christian Weston Chandler and his delusions. But we are something more, we are investigators of people dangerous to society. Our methods are never as bad as those we use them against.
If people are afraid of us, this means we pose a threat. And, as we have shown many times, we are. Maybe not Anonymous level, but we can get people doxxed/arrested/killed. We are, in many ways, better than many official agencies.

Xela[note 3] (born circa 2000s),[note 4] also known as Zeus Blue Thunder, is a ween and attention seeker with delusions of grandeur. Xela, who lives in Poland, has made multiple attempts to exert influence over Chris, such as by reporting him, attempting to break into his email, and pushing a rumor about him. Xela is also known for having obsessions with Chris's associates Caden and Flutter and tried to influence others to act in regards to them.

Weening
Xela has had many ambitious trolling schemes that have ultimately led to no big developments. Most of these revolved around reporting Chris's works, attempts at socially engineering the CWCsphere, as well as getting information on some of his associates.
Attempts at Social Engineering
On 24 November 2023, Xela posted on Kiwi Farms about wanting to "really expose Chris" by attempting to gain access to his emails or uncover his current phone number. Xela stated that he himself was unable to social engineer people, but suggested that others try to do so by calling Chris's email provider,[6] which would be a criminal offense. Xela also remarked that he had paid $20 to WhitePages in his attempt to gather information on Chris's accounts. On 11 October 2024, Xela again posted to claim that he had been attempting to access Chris's email account, and that he had contacted what he believed to be a hacker to attempt to access info on some of Chris's profiles.[7]
Reporting Campaigns
Xela had also tried many times to get Chris's work deleted, or to have him banned from the platforms he uses.
On 15 August 2024, Xela claimed in a Kiwi Farms post to have been reporting Chris's Twitter for "violent extremism" when Chris would post #RussiaisMLPG5 tweets. This resulted in his post being given a warning by forum moderation which read: "nobody cares".[8]
On 10 September 2024, Xela claimed that Etsy reports "do not work" and that he had considered but ruled out attempting to organize a campaign on Kiwi Farms and Reddit.[9]
The same day, Xela claimed that he reported Chris to Nintendo for copyright infringement, but got no reply back. He further said he was unable to find contact info for Sega.[10] This resulted in him being given a temporary ban from Kiwi Farms.[3]
Stalking of Associates
Xela attempting to ask Geno Samuel for information on Flutter. Geno did not respond.
A large part of Xela's attempt at trolling was trying to figure out information on Chris's recent associates, but most especially Flutter and Caden Peck.
On 11 August 2024, in response to a Kiwi Farms user who sarcastically joked Xela could go to Big Island, VA to rescue Chris, Xela commented that he would if he lived in the area. He then claimed to have a "plan" for Chris's associate Flutter, to acquire high quality pics of her "plus extra". Xela's posts on the matter were then derided by Kiwi Farms owner Null, who called him a "retard" and told him to keep the matter to himself.[11]
On 29 September 2024, Xela sent a DM to Geno Samuel, who had released a video sent to him showing Chris and Flutter in Finland. In the DM, Xela asked Geno for more information and claimed about Flutter that:[3]
I wouldn't doxx her, however. My goal was simply to find who she is, contact her and ask her about her involvement in Christory,
Xela later complained on a Finnish imageboard that Geno did not respond to him.[12]
In October 2024, after the news of Chris and Flutter being in Finland, Xela mentioned he had been contacting a few Finnish people but that none were willing to be arrested to find proof of where Chris was staying.[13]
In addition to targeting Chris and Flutter, Xela has complained about a perceived lack of action by other Kiwi Farms users on Chris's associate and Praetor leader Caden, suggesting that either users are incompetent or that they are protecting Caden.[14] Xela believes that for Chris to be considered a lolcow again, Caden must be "cut out".[15]
Baby Rumor
On 24 November 2024, Xela spread a rumor on Kiwi Farms that Chris and Flutter were planning to have a baby in summer 2025. Xela based this both on an erroneous summary on the CWCki, as well as a misheard clip of Chris speaking on a livestream.[16] The rumor quickly spread. It was promoted by Kiwi Farms owner Null, several Christubers such as Geno Samuel, and tabloid media such as Daily Mail. Later, when the veracity of the rumor was in question, Xela posted in Geno Samuel's Discord server:[1]
One good thing, and the main reason why I am still going with this and pushing it, is because this is gonna have serious repercussions for Chris by itself.
Hell, it could even self destruct Praetor.
Maybe even get us Flutter.
Again, this is one of the biggest Chris Chan related controversies ever, probably on the same level or above the prison rumor.
Even if the info itself is false, the consequences of it being everywhere of the net might be insane for Chris.

Notes
↑ Xela considers his attempts at uncovering recent events as his "research", though he has yet to have made any major breakthroughs. He sometimes claims research done by other people as his own. He also always attempts to recruit people to do the work for him when he announces such plans. He also treated pushing the pregnancy rumor as an "accomplishment".
↑ Has accused people on Kiwi Farms of protecting Caden Peck when they supposedly showed no interest in keeping tabs on him.
↑ His first name spelled backwards.
↑ Xela mentioned preparing for final high school exams as of 2024.
