The Life and Times of Jesus Christ
Back in 2022, Praetor released "The Life and Times of Jesus Christ", a play Chris wrote in jail, which was sold on OfficialCWCmart as a part of the Praetor Jail Art. Chris would reuse this for the Christmas Play.
OfficialCWCmart listings
To pass the time in jail, Chris has been writing a lot. In addition to many other pieces, he has written an incredibly extensive play titled "The Life and Times of Jesus Christ." Chris has directed it to be narrated and made cohesive via video, with us going so far as to hire a voice actor. (Albeit from Fiver.)
The play itself will be released shortly. Chris drew pictures to illustrate and accompany the narration. This is one of those pictures.

This ended up being an all Sonichu and Rosechu play, not because of segregation, but due to the volunteers who signed up for the auditions being literally 85% local Sonichu and Rosechu. This would become the very first stage performance of an all Sonichu and Rosechu cast ever; a landmark and massive undertaking.
[Text roll ends. Screen fades to black. Chris-Chan is revealed sitting in front of a green screen displaying a photo of a snowy forest. From here on out, Chris is speaking.]
The Life and Times of Jesus Christ, a Christmas play by Angelica Rosechu, read by me, Mrs. Jesus Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu Prime. Since August 2005, after Angelica had her past visions confirmed about I, as Jesus Christ of Nazareth reincarnated and Magi-Chan Sonichu Prime, shortly after I had taken Angelica Rosechu back in time to meet and talk with Jesus himself before his death on the cross and resurrection. Angelica was inspired after returning to August 2005 to write an updated, more accurate play of the life and times of Jesus to be debuted in December 2005. This ended up being an all Sonichu and Rosechu play, not because of segregation, but due to the volunteers who signed up for the auditions being literally around 85% being of the Sonichus and Rosechus, including Sonichu Prime and Rosey Rosechu Prime themselves. And around 10 out of 15% of the volunteering humans auditioned for the role of Jesus. Also the rounding down physical height allowed for bare eye contact between the actors, this would become the very first stage performance of an all Sonichu and Rosechu cast ever, a landmark and massive undertaking.
After all the auditions in late October 2005 in Angelica's church, and without typecasting, for they all portrayed the auditions respe- Magi-Chan himself went for and earned the role of Jesus's psychic Sonichu partner, [unintelligible] Sonichu. Various regular and special Sonichus and Rosechus made up the secondary and background individuals. Inuyasha Sonichu and even Nightstar Sonichu Prime got word and auditioned as well, then they stayed in Cwcville for throughout November and December to be in the play after earning their roles. Angelica was the narrator and the Holy Ghost angel. Some of the actors got multiple roles in the play, but the secondary parts are with less lines anyway. Nightstar, Inuyasha, and Perceptor played the three wise individuals who brought the gold, frankincense, and myrrh. A regular male Sonichu who had a family with a female Sonichu and had a [unintelligible] male son, as well as their trainer partner and his family, Constanople Sonichu played ho- played Joseph. Constanople and Lain Sonichu's son, Danny Sonee, played- played... Danny played young Jesus. Another trainer with a female Rosey, Rasenla Rosey, she played young Mary Magdalene with a few other Sonees playing as Jesus's childhood friends. Crystalina Rosechu played the virgin Mary. A plush Sonichu filled the role of baby Jesus. Danny also played the little drummer boy.
[A hand-drawn image of DJ Jamsta Sonichu fills half of the screen, covering Chris.]
Jamsta Sonichu played Herod the king, the Devil that tempts Jesus, as well as Satan.
[The drawing disappears, and Chris is back on screen.]
Cardboard cutouts took the role of demons in the hell realm where Jesus slayed Satan and freed and forgiven the former sinners. The imprisoned sinners were played by various regular Sonichus and Rosechus. Punchy Sonichu played Peter; Wild Sonichu played Lazarus, John the Baptist, and... [Chris checks his script] ...John.
[A hand-drawn image of Bubbles Rosechu appears on the screen, Covering Chris.]
Bubbles Rosechu played Elizabeth, Anna, and the Pharisee woman.
[The drawing disappears, and Chris is back on screen.]
Cal Sonichu of the psychic squadron played Judas. Perceptor also played the Pilate. Nightstar played Barabas. Inuyasha also played James; Rosey played adult- young adul- young adult Mary Magdalene and adult Mary Magdalene, and Sonichu Prime himself played as Jesus Christ. Oh and also Lolisa Rosechu, she played Lazarus's sister Martha. And also, Christian Chandler Sonichu, you know my self-counterpart [unintelligible], he, back in that day, before the transition to womanhood, he had a role at the end of the play as Jesus Christ in present day life as I, Jesus Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu Prime.
I've written out the play as it was... leaving some scenes out, but I've written up to eleven pages on this, so there won't be much left out from Angelica's play. As it was on Saturday, December 17th, 2005 - and this was the Saturday before the third Sunday of December that year - the show went on! In addition to Jamsta promoting the show with Rosey and everyone at station KCWC, the reporters of the Cwcville press and local news media got a good taste of the play from the rehearsals. The reviews were more or positive, giving the play as it stood a four out of five star rating. Ticket sales sold out as the play was held at the spacious George Lewis Hal theatre in the northwest section of the metropolis of Cwcville. Psychic squadron Sonichus and Rosechus and security guards were hired to ensure nothing went wrong. Even Team Rocket and all hating, really dark types with hate-filled violent intentions, were all barred from entering. Liquidchu and Blake, as they were in disguise at the time with their fur color changed and all to blend in, they were taking a break for themselves and were able to get in and watch the show. Blake was looking forward to watching Bubbles perform.
Mary Lee Walsh and Silvana Rosechu also bought tickets to simply enjoy the rarity- this rarity of a show.
[The same image of Angelica Sonichu appears on screen, covering Chris.]
[unintelligible], who was Jamsta Sonichu's best friend and partner and former DJ at KCWC. [?], Jareth, Raven [?], Kathy [?], these individuals are gonna be talked about in the [?] pages, they'll be brought up at a later point once we get- once I get everything sorted out. And Robert and Barbara Chandler [unintelligible], and the other good and supportive citizens of Cwcville, and even some kind individuals from Charlottesville, Richmond, and D.C., and other cities of Virginia, they all came out to enjoy this landmark, all-Sonichu-and-Rosechu performance.
Perhaps we're ready to change the scenes between acts. Chris had volunteered to grip as well. The grips were composed of humans and psychic squadron Sonichus and Rosechus and Pokemon. Video cameras were recording the entire play. The printed programs also had the note at the bottom, quote, "Aside from the scriptures that are holy, as well as further confirmations from divine guidances and visions that permit a personal experience, and enlightenments." End quote... Angelica Rosechu put that in. The show started at 8:00 PM. Angelica in her long white gown stepped into the spotlight at the stage's center from behind the curtains. She takes a deep breath as the audience is silent. Angelica starts...
Angelica: Welcome everyone.
[A hand drawn image of Angelica flying over top of the stage in front of a packed audience appears on the screen, covering Chris.]
Chris: And she says that loud and well for everyone to hear.
Angelica: Welcome everyone to this humble re-enactment of the life of Jesus Christ, who was our Lord, and still is. But Jesus was also the One Avatar, and when life on Earth began he appeared as a large turtle, then transformed into a human who had been around even before God was known to a lot of people. The avatar lived long and guided all in the name of God as the God of Gods, with insights and wisdoms and the holy light power spanning from the heavens and the very core of our universe. Then through God and Manuel, the Avatar...
[The drawing disappears.]
Angelica: ...had their very first reincarnation ever and was born in Bethlehem by the virgin Mary. So now we take you all to the sixth month of when Mary was with child.
Chris: Angelica bows, and spans her wings as the curtain opens and she flies above the stages- the stage to the audience applause, and the reveal of Crystalina as Mary Magdalene, sitting in a chair. As- I'm s- I'm sorry, as the vir- the virgin Mary. [Chris points a finger gun to his head.] [unintelligible] my mind for a moment! ...Angelica as the angel Gabriel descends and startles Mary a bit. The angel said to Mary...
Gabriel: Hark! For you are highly favored, the Lord is with you, you are blessed among women.
[A hand drawn image of Gabriel approaching Mary appears on screen, covering Chris.]
Mary: What is going on here?
Gabriel: Fear not, Mary. Behold from your womb you shall conceive and bring birth to a son, and he shall be named Jesus. He shall be great and called the Son of the Highest, and God shall give him his father David's throne. He shall reign forever over the house of Jacob with no end to his kingdom.
Mary: How shall this be so?
Gabriel: The Holy Ghost shall come to you and the power of the Highest shall overwhelm you, therefore he that shall be born of you be called Son of God. Your cousin Elizabeth is also with child, in her sixth month, when she was barren. With God, nothing shall be impossible.
Mary: Hmm, I see. Hmm.
[The drawing disappears.]
Mary: I am the maiden of the Lord, I shall do my best by your word.
Chris: Angelica flew up into the rafters above the stage. Mary knocks on a nearby door with Bubbles - [Chris knocks on the table] - in a dress, and with pillow above her belt under the dress as Elizabeth on the other side of the door. Mary entered and saw Elizabeth with child and holy light in her aura, and Mary said...
Mary: You are blessed with child, dear cousin!
Chris: Elizabeth responded with a smile.
Elizabeth: Yes Mary, I have been blessed by the Holy Ghost. His name shall be John!
Mary: I too have been visited by the Holy Ghost, and have a son, and he shall be the Lord.
Elizabeth: This is indeed great news Mary!
Chris: The scene quickly changes as the grips remove the chairs and the door. A red rug and a throne is quickly placed as a piano plays the tune of Psalm 140. Jamsta Sonichu, in kingly attire, sits on the throne. Angelica narrates as the scene transitions.
Angelica: As Mary is conceived, word of her child and the coming of prophecy of the Lord reached ears far and wide. When King Herod heard of this coming of the Almighty, he was distressed. With the chief priests and scribes having told Herod the Lord would be born in Bethlehem as prophesised, Herod made his choice.
Chris: The spotlight shines on Jamsta as Herod, and a nearby regular Sonichu playing the messenger. Herod tells the messenger...
Herod: Summon the wise men! [unintelligible]
Chris: The messenger runs off the stage, then announces...
Messenger: Announcing the wise men, sire!
Chris: And then Nightstar Sonichu, Inuyasha Sonichu, and Perceptor Sonichu, dressed in royal long robes as the three wise women, to pretty much get this accurate.
[A hand drawn picture of a 2-panel comic appears on screen, covering Chris. The first panel shows Jamsta Sonichu sitting on a throne addressing the three wise women, and the second panel shows the three wise women deliberating amongst themselves.]
Chris: The three of them bow, then rise. Inuyasha says...
Inuyasha: You summoned us, sire?
Herod: Yes, I heard the king of Jes- of the Jews is to be born in the East. Go to Bethlehem and find the child. After you've found him, let me know, so I may come and worship him also.
Chris: The wise women look amongst each other as they hear the intent in Herod's words. Inuyasha responds...
Inuyasha: As you wish, sire. We shall make delight in our search.
Chris: The three wise men re- leave and relocate to another part of the stage to recieve a bag each. The spotlight is removed from Jamsta and lit upon Nightstar, Inuyasha, and Perceptor. They speak as they walk in place at the throne as the throne and rug are removed the stage. Nightstar Sonichu starts.
Nightstar: Did you see the glint in the King's eye as he spoke?
Chris: Perceptor speaks.
Perceptor: Surely, I perceive the King has other intentions with the child.
Inuyasha: Oh, no doubt!
Chris: Inuyasha speaks.
Inuyasha: Eh, but we have to do as the King wants. At least we will be worshipful with the child.
Chris: The other two nod. [Chris mutters to himself or someone offscreen.] Okay... Alright. Inuyasha...
Inuyasha: Well, I brought frankincense for the family. What did you two get?
Chris: Perceptor responds...
Perceptor: I have some myrrh. Its scent is fervent.
[The drawing disappears.]
Chris: And then Nightstar says...
Nightstar: I got a bag of gold.
Inuyasha: Gold?!
Chris: Inuyasha asks. [Chris makes a pffft sound.]
Inuyasha: What a way to outdo us, Nightstar.
Nightstar: If it's any consolation, this was my recent bonus. Ehhhh...
Chris: Perceptor points up.
Perceptor: I see the star of our Lord shining more bright. Come gentlemen, let's make haste.
Chris: The other two nod.

"The Life and Times of Jesus Christ"
a Christmas Play by Angelica Rosechu
Part 2
[The music abruptly cuts out and Chris appears over top of a winter stock photo.]
Chris: The spotlight turns off as the manger scene is brought out. Angelica descends onto the stage and addresses the audience as the spotlight shines upon her.
Angelica: And they were in the same country shepherds abiding in the fields, keeping watch over their flock at night, and lo! The angel of the Lord came unto them and the glory of the Lord shone around and about them, and they were so afraid, and the angel said unto them:
[A hand drawn image of the angel on stage addressing the shepherds appears onscreen.]
Angel: Fear not! For behold, I bring you tidings of great joy which shall be to all people, for unto you is born this day in the city of David, a savior, which is Christ, the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you! He shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.
[The image disappears.]
Angelica: And suddenly there with the angel of multitude, the heavenly host praising God and say: "Glory to God in the highest, and on Earth, peace, goodwill towards men."
Chris: The stage became fully lit, revealing Crystalina as Mary and Constanople as Joseph in the manger-
[A hand drawn image of Joseph and Mary surrounded by Pokemon appears. They all look into the basket with a plush Sonichu in it.]
Chris: -with a calm, trained Mudbray, Mareep, and Tauros right by them, looking into the basket with the plush Sonichu wrapped in cloth in the basket. Wild, Punchy, and Magi-Chan dressed in shepherds' clothes approached the manger and praised the baby as Angelica flies back above the stage. The three wise men approach as the piano started playing Little Drummer Boy, and they sing. Danny Sonee approaches as well and plays the drum upon him.
[The image disappears. Chris sings a short line of "Little Drummer Boy."]
Chris: At the end of the song, the lights are cut and the spotlight is shown upon Joseph, and Angelica tells Joseph:
Angelica: Wake Joseph, for Herod the King seeks to slay the young child! Flee to Egypt until when I tell you it is safe to return! Go, now!
Chris: Joseph picks up the basket with the babe, grabs Mary by the hand, and they exit stage left. The lights cut off as the pianist plays a tremor of notes expressing fright as Herod's shadow looms on the stage's curtain. As it closes over the empty manger, Herod shouts loudly:
Herod: Eh he he he he! The wise men have mocked me! It doesn't matter as I shall slay all the children of Bethlehem myself!
Chris: Sounds of screams and weeping come from the female actors offstage as the piano tune chimes out. Then trans is- Then the trans is- transitions to a jaunty tune of Psalm 87. Angelica narrates as the curtain opens to reveal a painted backdrop of the houses and streets of Egypt with youthful Sonees and Roseys laughing and playing. Danny Sonee as young Jesus sits on the barrel's top and powde- ponders. Rasenla Rosey as young Mary Magdalene is playing with the children.
Mary Magdalene: And so Joseph, Mary, and Jesus fled to Egypt where Jesus had spent his formative years growing up while Joseph and Mary were aware of what was to become of Jesus. Jesus had been young and naive, and lived his life unaware of his destiny. Jesus felt he was not like the other children, but he could not put his finger on why consciously, at least yet, and he didn't know what to make of himself quite yet.
Chris: Young Mary approaches Jesus.
Mary: Hi!
Chris: Jesus looks down towards Mary but doesn't make eye contact.
'Jesus: Euhhh... Hi.
Mary: What are you doing up on the barrel?
Jesus: Oh. Well, I don't know. I was looking up at the sky and counted numbers in the clouds.
[A hand drawn image of young Jesus sitting on a barrel talking to Mary appears.]
Jesus: It's kinda interesting cause when you add what you see within the lights around the clouds against the blue sky they tell stories of the wonders beyond the sky, and what number guides you to next.
Chris: Mary is bewildered with what Jesus said as she looks up at the clouds and sees the aura light around the cloud edges, yet unsure what to make of it.
Mary: Yeah, the clouds are shining pretty. I'm Mary! What's your name?
[The drawing disappears.]
Jesus: Ehhh... Jesus.
Mary: Oh, that's a cute name! Hey, you want to play with us? We can always use another creative kid to play Eye Spy with.
Jesus: You... want me... to play with you?
Chris: He asked with an uncertain expression on his face.
Mary: Sure! Come on, Jesus!
Jesus: ...Okay!
Chris: Jesus hops down and follows Mary into a crowd of kids and they wander off stage right. Angelica narrates as Sonichu Prime and Rosey Rosechu Prime as Jesus and Mary Magdalene go on stage from stage right together.
Angelica: Jesus and Mary became friends and liked each other and Jesus had been accepted by Mary's friends as well. Mary had brought something good out of Jesus.
Chris: Mary and Jesus sit side by side on the same barrel. Mary and Jesus sit side by side on the barrel, and she asked him once again:
Mary: What are your dreams, Jesus?
Jesus: Again, Mary? You're always asking me that, and the answer's always the same.
Mary: Yeah! They're all ve- [Chris clears his throat.] very unique and interesting and I can't get enough of them!
Jesus: Well, alright. In my dreams I see various stone carvings and statues I had never seen before, yet somehow they are familiar to me. The words in the carvings glow like gold and have sounds of ancient sand script [Sanskrit?], yet I can understand them. Then I see fields of stars amidst the cosmos and then the brightest star in the center of the universe, and the center within that star, and the center of that star, and so on and so on. Until I see this vision from far into the future, where I'm flying through a rainbow of immense energy and power and bringing order to a chaos-filled Earth with a bunch of arguing and fighting nations amidst fallen apartment buildings and an explosion on a dragon over some place that's not Babylon.
[A hand drawn image of a slightly older Mary and Jesus sitting on a barrel appears.]
Mary: So COOL, Jesus!
Jesus: Mary, how is it that you do not find such a dream weird like the other kids our age do?
Chris: Mary smiles and nodded.
Mary: Hmm... I don't know? Call it intuition or something. Crazy, or whatever, but hearing the details of your dream makes me wish I could see into the cosmos and future like you can.
Jesus: Mary, if I was anyone else, I'd call you weird.
Mary: Oh? Well then, maybe I out-weird YOU.
Chris: And they both laugh as they look into each other's eyes like two kids who get each other.
[The drawing disappears.]
Chris: Then from stage left, Joseph walks on stage and addresses Jesus.
Joseph: My son!
Jesus: Yes, father?
Joseph: I just got the all clear from the angels. You, your mother, and I are heading back to Nazareth. Come on, son.
Jesus: What?!
Chris: Jesus and Mary shout!
Jesus and Mary: No, no, no, no!
Jesus: Dad, I don't want f- I don't wanna leave! I- I've got friends, and I'm appreciated here! You pull me away from that, I'll be really upset!
Joseph: I'm sorry son, but your destiny is not here in Egypt.
Chris: Joseph grabs Jesus's hand and pulls him stage left.
Jesus: No, no! Mary! I'll really miss you!
Mary: Jesus, don't go!
Chris: She shouts to him as they leave stage. The stage lights cut off as the scene changes and Angelica to the next part.
Angelica: Jesus, Joseph, and Mary returned to Nazareth as Herod was dead and his throne taken by archangels in reign. Jesus had brough- become upset after having to leave his friends and more positive life in Egypt. Jesus found resonance as the family to Nazareth and he started listening and hearing of the Gospel of John the Baptist as he preached to the multitude about repentance.
[A hand drawn image of John the Baptist petting Jesus's head appears on screen.]
Angelica: Jesus was baptized by John, and Jesus fasted for 40 days and 40 nights and was tested by the Devil.
[The drawing disappears.]
Chris: The scene was changed to a jungle clearing on stage left. A backdrop with a scene of all the kingdoms around the world. The spotlight shone over the left half with Jesus collapsed on the grass within a few- with a few rocks in front of him. Jamsta, dressed as the Devil, approached Jesus and said to him:
Jamsta: Hey, Jesus, you're looking real hungry. If you are the son of God, command these stones to become bread, and enjoy.
Chris: Jesus stands and looks to the Devil in the eyes.
Jesus: One shall not live by bread alone but by the word of GOD.
Chris: The Devil frowns and growls.
Jamsta: Ehhhh...
Chris: Then he pulls Jesus to stage right and shows him the images of all the kingdoms and the lovely throne. Then the Devil tells Jesus:
Jamsta: I shall give you total power and rule of all the kingdoms of the world and the adoration of everyone if you bow down and worship me.
Chris: Jesus said:
Jesus: Get behind me Satan, for it is written: one shall worship the Lord and God and serve him.
Chris: The Devil pushes Jesus to the front edge of the stage and tells him:
Jamsta: Well, if you're so almighty, then you know as it is written that the angels will always save you no matter what. So JUMP, Jesus.
Chris: Jesus frowns as he looks the Devil in the eye again and tells him:
Jesus: You shall never tempt the Lord and God!
Chris: The devil vanishes as the lights go off and a lone spotlight on Jesus remains on Jesus with the scene change. Jesus looks up at the angels as the angel speaks to him.
Angel: Very good, Jesus. Know from your meditations that you are Lord and you are present to heal the distressed and brokenhearted. Preach to the poor, and deliverance to the captives, restore sight to the blind, and bring liberty and justice to all that have been hurt. The spirit of the Lord is upon you. Go forth and restore order to the chaos.
Jesus: Yes! I shall!
Chris: The audience applauds. The light turns back on and reveals a bedroom with a table and two chairs on it. Jesus sits in one of the two chairs as he walks- as he wakes from his visions once again. Jesus muses aloud.
Jesus: Wow. So I am the Lord and God? It kinda makes sense - the clues and signs have been all around me all my life, with my unique perspective and feeling advantage. My eyes, the seer eyes, the visions, mom and dad going on about my destiny as Lord, the message of the angels, and ALL THIS? Well, my intuition's often being on point, the cosmos, the universe core, and matrix...
[A hand drawn image of Jesus and Lavesh Sonichu approaching him appears on screen.]
Jesus: I've lived my life unaware of all this! I pray to the Lord and God... I've been praying to myself? Ehh... What do I do now that I am aware that I am? I can only pray and ask for continued holy light guidance and have faith and know these prophecies, even the not yet written prophecies!
[The drawing disappears.]
Jesus:' And the prophets before me may have foreseen this but may not have yet written these prophecies, and I can only see so deep into my visions and I don't know when specifically when they will and when they will manifest! Is there such a prophet on a God level who can help me keep myself better sorted? If there is, please, Lord and God that I am, send them to me and guide me right now!
Chris: A spotlight lands at the entrance to his bedroom as a knocking sound resonates from the door. [Chris knocks on the table.] Jesus gets up to answer it, a special psychic Sonichu played by Magi-Chan Sonichu Prime surrounded by Heavenly Divine and Universe Core Matrix Light is standing there.
[A hand drawn image of Lavesh Sonichu appears on screen. Lavesh Sonichu is surrounded by waves and mystical imagery.]
Lavesh Sonichu: Greetings, Jesus, o Lord of Lords. I am Lavesh Sonichu, psychic special Sonichu guardian of the Sonichus and Rosechus. I am on high God level and I am here to guide you.
[The drawing disappears.]
Chris: Jesus looks into Lavesh's aura and soul, and links with the heavens and cosmos to confirm this. His faith is assured.
Jesus: Welcome Lavesh, please, come in and talk with me.
Chris: Lavesh enters and takes a seat at the table, across from Jesus.
Jesus: Ehhh... I suppose it takes a God to really help another God.

"The Life and Times of Jesus Christ"
a Christmas Play by Angelica Rosechu
Part 3
[The music abruptly cuts out and the image changes to a stock photo of a wintery forest. Chris Chan appears on screen over top.]
Before resuming the story of Angelica Rosechu's Christmas play in 2005, I'll write a bit about Lavesh Sonichu, one of the earlier Sonichus' and Rosechus' psychic type special guardians.
[A hand drawn image of Lavesh Sonichu surrounded by mystical lines appears on screen.]
Lavesh Sonichu heralded from a Sonichu and Rosechu village near the Ultimate Emerald Shrine. He was born in 324 B.C. and was promoted by the village's elder after connecting with a distant Ultimate Emerald as well as the heavens and the cores and matrices of the universe's timeline and the alpha mega point of all existence, and guiding and protecting many of the Sonichus and Rosechus with a divine guidance and light power.
[The drawing disappears.]
Lavesh had also personally met and worked with Emmanuel herself, and himself back then. There's no- Emmanuel can be one or the other, either gender or whichever, but presently, Emmanuel is woman. So there. At least, in our day here in the 2020's. Back then? Guy. Anyway, where was I? La la la la, ah! And worked with Emmanuel and the other gods and goddesses, and earned his way up to being a god as well in service and appreciation of the gods of the God of Gods and Lord. Lavesh had foreknown he would be the one to help guide Jesus Christ of Nazareth as he became into his godlihood. By the time Jesus had prayed for the direct guidance, Lavesh had made preparations to confirm the leaders and elders would keep the village of the shrine safe as well. When Jesus made his prayer and similar thoughts and wording as Sonichu Prime had spoken during the play, Lavesh had teleported from the village to where Jesus Christ was, after waking from the test and temptations in the midst- his troubled thoughts and questions amidst his transition. Also Lavesh had talked with Magi-Chan Sonichu Prime during his time, when Magi-Chan himself went back in time to visit Jesus and he met Na- and he met Lavesh prior to Jesus's first resurrection. Lavesh Sonichu had visibly teleported his body and mind and soul into the heavens and universe core to emerge into his next iteration long after that. But just to mention all this, this part, cause I'm gonna eventually talk about this, from the- from the moment this gets recorded.
The ultimate emerald is the one emerald, and there are 8 master emeralds, counting the one that Knuckles has been guarding, and then of course after that there are not 7 chaos emeralds, there are 8 chaos emeralds, the orange one. Of course there are 8 chaos crystal balls as well and there's an orange one there also. And the chaos emeralds had been- had come about from the ultimate emerald itself as it was a centerpoint, and long long ago, before- sometime in the- in the BC's, I think it was like 450-something- I forget. 459 BC? I have it written down. But anyway, essentially at one point around there, the ultimate emerald became overwhelmed and shattered and all that was left of it was shards, the core of the ultimate emerald had zoomed in and up, literally within my body, literally. And this- and the chaos- and the 8 chaos emeralds [unintelligible] for now. Before then, the ultimate emerald was in the center, and the 8 master emeralds were surrounding it at that shrine, that very shrine. And also when the ultimate emerald shattered and all that, the master emeralds went into hiding as well and transitioned elsewhere. And eventually Knuckles found his master emerald, and the orange master emerald became the master Sunstone on the- under Flame the Sunbird's guidance and watch. And the other 6 were around the Earth somewhere else.
[The video abruptly jump-cuts. Chris is now narrating the play.]
Chris: -orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet lights beam in a line on the edge of the stage. The scenery is changed and Angelica narrates.
Angelica: So Jesus found-
Chris: Ahem. Take 2.
Angelica: So Jesus found his own guidance from within himself with focus from his visions. He wrote what he saw, then on his next guidance he started his mistreatment locating and taking him and first disciples. The stage is lit with a ship on stage left with Inuyasha as James and Wild as John on board, talking with a male Rosechu who played Zebedee, and on stage right Punchy as Peter with two other male Sonichus who played Simon and Andrew casting a net. Jesus walked towards the center of the stage and called to Peter and his brothers.
Jesus: Come with me, and I shall make you into fishermen.
Chris: Peter, Simon, and Andrew were drawn by the conviction, and left their net to follow Jesus. Jesus called up to the ship.
Jesus (again): Come with me, and I shall MAKE you into fishermen.
Chris: James and John nodded, and cast a torn net left aside and Zebedee... To left the- they left the ship and Zebedee to follow Jesus.
[Chris lightly laughs at himself, and a hand drawn image of Jesus leading the Sonichus and Rosechus off the boat appears on screen.]
Chris: And then Zebedee saw this [unintelligible].
Zebedee: HEY! GET BACK HERE ON THIS BOAT!
Chris: But his words fell on deaf ears. [unintelligible].
Zebedee (again): HEY! GET BACK HERE ON THIS BOAT!
Chris: Jesus and his disciples walk to the center stage and Jesus preaches to the audience.
[The drawing disappears.]
Jesus: Follow the words and light power as you shall be guided and well and saved.
Chris: The crowd of the cast gather around Jesus as he speaks.
Jesus: All of you are the salt and light of the Earth. But if the salt loses it's savor, it is nothing and must be cast underfoot. And if a light loses it's glow, the path grows dark. So I tell all of you, never lose your savor. Never lose your glow. Let your light shine, so all my- so all may see your good and good works and intentions, and they will be inspired to improve on themselves, and shine brighter and healthier and longer. I do not come to destroy, but to fulfill. As all of you fulfill the lives, scribes, prophecies as well.
[A hand drawn image of Jesus addressing the audience on stage appears.]
Jesus: Do not be righteous by ignoring these wise words of prophets and guidance, it is to be denied entry into Neo Life and the kingdom therein.
Chris: Sonichu Prime as Jesus summarizes each teaching over the course of the five minutes, then Angelica narrates as the scene is changed.
Angelica: Jesus's healing ministry had spread famously everywhere as he taught and healed others as well as answered the questions of the doubtful with insight and wisdoms.
Chris: And then a montage of various Sonichus and Rosechus from the cast came forward with their ailments and were healed by Jesus.
[The drawing disappears.]
Chris: Bubbles and Angelica gave thanks to the Lord- Bubbles as Anna gave thanks to the Lord in fulfilling the prophecies. John the Baptist behind the bars asked Jesus his questions and Jesus answers wise and true.
[A hand drawn image of a possessed Sonichu and Jesus speaking appears on screen.]
Chris: Those who were possessed were cleared of the demons and devils.
[The drawing disappears.]
Chris: There was a moment where Jesus had broken bread and fish and satisfied all who ate of his kindness and love from the morsels.
[A hand drawn image of Jesus spreading his arms over a table of food appears.]
Chris: The pianist played the tune of a thunderstorm, as the two on board ran to Jesus and told him to bunker down.
[The drawing disappears.]
Chris: But then Jesus rebuked the wind and the storm, and the two were made to see sunshine and a peaceful tune suddenly playing. Angelica narrates as all this goes on. Wild Sonichu as Lazarus and Lolisa as his sister Martha gave praise and kind words to Jesus. Lazarus was in bed sick as Martha ran to fetch Jesus. Jesus sees Nazareth and told- I mean- as- Je- Jesus sees Lazarus and tells Martha that he was sleeping, and Jesus would return to wake him out of sleep. News of Lazarus in a grave for four days gave Jesus reason to assure Martha of his resurrection. Then Jesus sees the covered Lazarus in the grave and weeps because he loved Lazarus. Then Jesus told Martha to move the stone in faith of God. Then Jesus lifted up his eyes and said:
Jesus: I thank you for hearing me and hearing me always, but-
[A hand drawn image of Lazarus exiting his tomb appears.]
Jesus: In witness of the people I've told with faith and goodness, so they may believe you have sent me... Lazarus, come forth!
[The drawing disappears.]
Chris: Lazarus moans and walks through the grave's entrance and removed the cloths from his eyes. By the way, for the record Wild Sonichu's voice, he sounds similar to Luke Skywalker. Period. He does not have a country accent, despite what some may have mis-portrayed of him. LUKE. SKYWALKER. He has a voice like him. Anyway, he's like:
Lazarus: Uuuunnhhh... Uhh... What has happened?
Chris: Martha hugs Lazarus and thanks Jesus. Another scene, Jesus took Peter, James, and John to center stage. The lights dimmed. Jesus transformed into bright light. Sonichu Prime had used Flash to simulate that. Two psychic squadron Sonichus play Moses and Elliot teleport besides Jesus and talked with him for a moment, in Peter, James, and John's amazement. After the two teleported away, the disciples offered to build tabernacles. A spotlight shone down from Jesus, and Magi-Chan said from off stage, aloud:
Magi-Chan: Jesus is my son. I am pleased with him. Hear him well.
Chris: The disciples were afraid but Jesus told them,
Jesus: Do not be afraid.
Chris: With a touch. Another scene, Jesus enters the temple of God, with the stage laid out with vendors and tables full of merchandise that were being brought- bought, and sold. Jesus cast the vendors away from their tables and FLIPPED THEM OVER! Then he shouted loud:
[A hand drawn image of Jesus flipping over a table and knocking items everywhere appears.]
Jesus: It's written! This is a house of prayer, but with this, it's been made into a den of thieves! I really don't like this.
Chris: The vendors collected the goods and scattered. Jesus stepped into the front and center of the stage and exiting the temple of God. Lavesh meets him there, and as they talk.
[The drawing disappears.]
Jesus: Lavesh! My guided friend! I have done and overdone my work as Lord and God in guidance of light power, and the Lord, my past self, and the Good Gods.
Lavesh: Indeed, you have done, and do very well. All appreciate and praise you in good faith.
Jesus: I am truly humbled and grateful. I truly feel good in soul and fulfilment, and seeing everyone's kind faces, and hearing their kind words, is a real blessing. But wow, I am feeling tired. It's so very tough to be Lord and God on Earth! Every time someone asks me a brain-bender of a question, the only solvance I have is connecting with the heavens and the universe core for a simple answer! Direct enough that I couldn't put it [unintelligible] myself when my brain goes numb! Eaaagghhh... Eeehhh!
Lavesh: I have had to go through similar with the Sonichus and Rosechus of my village. It was overwhelming, even taking it one at a time. But over time, with deep-end breaths, and meditation with breaths, it shall become easier.
Jesus: Ehhh, you're right. And that's nothing compared to what I've foreseen with Judas. Good grief, I do not look forward to that day. If I knew when exactly and if I was able to avert it... Well...
Is as... It is needed to be done, as the prophecy foretells. I don't agree with it, but I gotta get on with it anyway.
Lavesh: Quite right.
Chris: Another thing I forgot to mention, heh, where the ship is asail on the waters on the stage and Jesus walks on the water. Jesus urges his peers to come down with no doubt and with faith. Punchy as Peter steps down and slips and falls into the water. Jesus helps him back up and asks him,
Jesus: Why did you not have faith, Peter?
Peter: I don't know! I saw you walking on it... The water's not frozen...
Chris: Peter shrugged with a puzzled look on his face and asked:
[A hand drawn image of Peter and Jesus standing on water appears.]
Peter: What could be wrong with my footing?
[The drawing disappears, along with Chris at the same time. The credits roll across the screen, still cut off from one side. Typos included.]

"The Life and Times of Jesus Christ"
a Christmas Play by Angelica Rosechu
Part 3 [sic]
[The music abruptly cuts out and the background changes to a wintery forest, with Chris in front of it.]
Chris: And there was the scene where Bubbles as Pharisee Woman cleansed Jesus's feet, and Jesus rebooked her husband, played by a regular male Sonichu, and a scene of the re- of the reenactment of the Last Supper folowed by Cal Sonichu as Judas, bartering for the betrayal of Jesus. And then the scene by Judas facing Jesus surrounded by his soldiers.
Jesus said- I mean Judas said to Jesus I gotta get this down...
[A drawing of Judas kissing Jesus on the lips appears on screen.]
Judas: Praise, rabbi.
Chris: Then Judas kisses Jesus on the lips for a second or two. Judas leaves and Jesus asks:
Jesus: Hey, where are you going?
Chris: As the suporters of J- of Jesus fled off stage, Jesus was apprehended.
[The drawing disappears.]
Chris: Nightstar Sonichu as the High Priest asked for the witnesses, only to find none.
Then the priest sentences Jesus to death.
Jesus was taken to the Pilate for the trial.
Peter says to Jesus:
Peter: I do not know you.
Chris: Ehhhhhhh [unintellibigle].
Perceptor Sonchu as the Pilate stands before Jesus at the trial and asked him... [loses his place] Perceptor Sonichu as the Pilate stands before Jesus at the trial and asks him:
Pilate: Are you just the king of the Jews?
Chris: Jesus replies:
Jesus: You said it, I didn't.
Pilate: Do you know the crimes that have been put against you?
Chris:Jesus does not respond but in the paused moment as the lights cut a light- a spotlight remains on Jesus. Jesus says aloud his thoughts in the moment.
Jesus: As i have foreseen it, even if I testify by destiny and prophecy I will be crucified anyway, so, I converse my- I conserve my energy for the Resurrection of mine from the cross. [sigh] It's a thing I gotta do and I gotta roll with it.
Chris: The lights cut back on teh- he- Pilate require- inquires the witnesses that were false. One of them shouts:
False Witness: He said he would destroy the temple and restore it in three days!
Chris: Everyone shouts out:
Crowd: Crucify him!
Chris: Nightstar Sonichu as Barabbas was brought in and the Pilate asked the witnesses:
Pilate: This man Bara--
[There is an abrupt edit.]
Chris: -and Pilate asked the witnesses:
Pilate: This man Barabbas is convicted of murder and insurrection.
Would you rather I release-
[A drawing abruptly appears, showing Jesus and Barabbas kneeling before Pilate.]
Pilate: -Jesus or Barabbas?
Chris: Witnesses shouted:
Crowd: Release Barabbas, crucify Jesus!
Derrrrrrrrr!
Chris: They continued even as the Pilate asked:
Pilate: Why?
What crime has Jesus committed?
Chris: With a groan the Pilate dipped her hands into the nearby bowl of water.
Pilate: Very well.
Release Barabbas and deliver Jesus.
I wash my hands of this.
Let Jesus'-
[The drawing disappears.]
Pilate: -blood be on your hands.
Chris: The lights cut off as Jesus is relocated off stage right to get the crown of thorns on his head as the crowd of the cast of regular Sonichus and Roseshus line up along the curtain-
[A picture abruptly appears, showing Jesus/Sonichu carrying a cross past a group of onlookers.]
Chris: -and the lights come on as Jesus carries the cross acro- across the stage.
Along the jeering crowd.
Then he is tied to the cross and placed upright.
Jesus shouts:
Jesus: My God, my God!
[The drawing disappears.]
Jesus: Why am I forsaken?
Chris: Then he collapses into death.
[A picture appears, showing Jesus/Sonichu tied to the cross.]
Chris: Angelica narrates as the lights come up and the scenery is changed.
Angelica: Jesus Christ had died on the cross at Golgaltha.
His body had been laid to rest in the tomb.
Jesus was fighting another battle-
[The drawing disappers.]
Angelica: -as the sins he had absorbed saw his soul fall to Hell.
Chris: The lights cut back on to reveal Jesus in the center stage with the Sonichus and Rosechus behind bars, groaning and moaning from their punishments amongst red streamers on the stage floor.
Stage grips moving cardboard-
[The background abruptly shifts to a floating crucifix surrounded by light; religious music begins to play.]
Chris: -cutouts of demons scurrying aobut.
Jamsta Sonichu as Satan approaches Jesus.
Satan: Welcome to the Hell, Son of God... Yes!
[Abrupt edit]
Chris: And Satan falls-
[A drawing appears, showing Jesuschu punching Satanchu.]
Chris: -with a Sky Uppercut.
Bor a- Jesus takes Sa- Satan's keys. Satan rolls away stage right. Jesus breaks the cardboard demons in the middle and Jesus lifts a hand and emits a light and controlled Blue Thundershock symbolizing holy flames. The-
[The drawing disappears.]
Chris: -stage lights go from red to blue.
Jesus frees all the sinners and forgives them.
The freed ones leave stage right.
Jesus returns to center stage and stomps his left foot.
[Chris does this.]
The lights cut off.
Angelica narrrates as the streamers are picked up and the scener- scenery quickly changed.
Angelica: Jesus conquers Hell and death by taking Satan's keys and freeing the lost souls, cleansing Hell into nothing but holy flame and light.
Three days in the tomb Jesus' body had lay, and then as the divine holy light shines upon the body Jesus Christ returns and he is resurrected.
Chris: The lights cut back on revealing Jesus lying in a casket, with the cave entrance blocked by a large stone nearby.
Jesus wakes up and sits up and gets out of casket. Aloud he says:
Jesus: Right.
[A picture appears, showing Jesuschu in the tomb standing outside the casket.]
Jesus: [Snaps fingers.] I freed the sinners, time to announce my return.
Chris: Jesus slams the boulder away and lock- walks right out of the tomb, and off stage.
The Virgin Mary and Mary Magdalene walk to the tomb's entrance and see the stone rolled away with the tomb empty.
[The drawing disappears.]
Mary: What the...? Where's Jesus?
Chris: [unintelligible]
Other Mary: Uh... I don't know.
Who can roll this boulder away?
Chris: Angelica Rosechu comes down and sits against the casket. She tells Mary and... she tells the two Marys:
Angelica: Do not be afraid. Jesus is crucified and Jesus has risen. As you can see, he is not here. Go and tell Peter and the Disciples that Jesus has gone to Galilee. You shall find him safe, alive, healthy and well there.
Chris: The two start off toward stage left as Jesus walks toward them and says:
Jesus: Hey, Mary.
Chris: The two Marys looked up and praise the Lord and they both hugged him. Jesus tell them:
Jesus: Be not afraid. Okay. Go tell my brethren that I shall meet them in Galilee.
Chris: As the lights cut off, the scenery is rolled away.
Angelica walks toward stage right and narrates.
Angelica: And so the two Marys told all Jesus's Disciples and the eleven Disciples went to Galilee to find Jesus.
Chris: [Briefly loses his place.]
Okay the lights cut back on. The Disciples stand before Jesus on stage and praise him. Peter approaches, checks and see the scars, which were essentially makeup at this point cuz we're talkin' about a play here, in his hands and touches his shoulder, and steps back against Jesus and... he's, no I'm sorry. And touches his shoulder then steps back, aghast.
Jesus asks Peter three times:
Jesus: Do you love me?
Peter: Yes.
Chris: [stuttering] Peter answers every time yes, with tears in his eyes... the third time.
Jesus says to his Disiples:
Jesus: I am blessed with the powers of the heavens, cosmos and earth.
Go forth and teach all nations to always be mindful, observant, and follow in the path of light power and good.
Also cues are signs and the angels, cosmos and light.
Do-
[A picture appears, showing Jesuschu with his hand on a portal.]
Jesus: -not ever dismiss them. We Gods and Goddesses are always with all of you. Including I. Even though we're not perfect, either.
Keep faith and have no doubt within. Go forth with blessings and good, all of you.
Chris: Everyone vacates the stage as Angelica approaches the center stage with her last narration of the play.
Angelica: And Jesus walked away from his Disciples into a portal of light.
[The drawing disappears.]
Angelica: Jesus continued on in immortal life, never again dying physically.
Jesus continued his walks of... on earth life, going from one place to another and assuming different identities and forms.
Chris: Sonichu Prime, still as Jesus, walks onstage from stage right as from... as from stage... left a regular Sonichu female brought out a large blue turtle plush and a llama plush and stood between them in a line. Jesus stood beside the llama.
Following Jesus was a Sonichu donned like an African man, followed by one who was a monk, a few others in varying forms followed by... followed one by one dressed in der- in... followed by one dressed in Egyptian garb like one of Cleopatra's advisors. A few others including some female Sonichu and female Rosechu... ending with Punchy dressed up as Aang the Airbender-
[A picture appears, showing all of this.]
Chris: -Bubbles as Korra and Nightstar as Sylvia, Merlin's assistant, now I'm talking Merlin the magician. Angelica continued:
Angelica: So in summary, Jesus Christ is the one Avatar of Existence and God of Gods. He still walks among us today. From a veil separate half of our earth right here, but not like how we all have come to know of his famous past self.
Chris: The next part has some preface so... Christian, you know, Christian Chandler, his counterpart, yeah he had to do some research into my Goddess form.
Even-
[The drawing disappears.]
Chris: -got into talking with Neptune Blonde Noir Invert of Gamindustri to learn of Scarlet Leroux, the original CPU Goddess Blue Heart, Comma and the Commodore consoles.
The outfit of Goddess Blue Heart matched what I was wearing and wear today, in that divine intervention card I gave to Crystallina.
That's another detail that's gonna be revealed when I get to revealing the rest of these parts of the Goddess Log pages, this was written before that, anyway... da da da da, Chris had a specially tailored one-piece suit and shin guard wear, plus the Commodore wings made... and had to wear and fill a D-cup padded bra under the one-piece, and slip a shaped blue colored cover over his Sonichu form's tail and get dolled up in the bless- in this blessed portrayal.

[Static crackles. A soft piano rendition of "Auld Lang Syne" can be heard.
Overtop a drawn image of Angelica Rosechu, text appears across the screen.]
"The Life and Times of Jesus Christ"
a Christmas Play by Angelica Rosechu
Part 5 and Epilogue
["Auld Lang Syne" abruptly changes to religious music as the background is replaced with a floating crucifix surrounded by light, with Chris in front of it.]
Chris: Angelica continues as two cardboard clouds close together hover above the stage by telekinesis from Magi-Chan.
And Chris Chan Sonichu and the Goddess Blue Heart cosplay hovers over the clouds and between the alignment, and over the curtain rods. [Coughs.]
Angelica: Our Lord Messiah and savior has revealed herself recently, and this is fact. In case you haven't yet read the re- watched the news reports last June Jesus Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu Prime herself had appeared here person in Cwcville.
So yes, everyone.
Chris: Angelica spreads her wings as a spotlight shines on the two clouds.
They part sideways and Chris Chan Sonichu, playing as I, descends towards the stage.
Angelica: Jesus Christ has returned!
Yay!
Chris: The audience applauds as Chris touches down onto center stage. Angelica collapses her wings and steps toward stage left. Chris steps forward in an image eye [?].
Chris puts out his hands and the audience goes silent, and Chris starts to speak, and I personally directly speak through him from now to this moment imp- from when I- from when I wrote this particular page of the Goddess Log back on November 22nd, 2002, from when I wrote this I wrote it into that moment in the play back in December 2005.
[A drawing of Chris Chan Sonichu appears.]
Chris Chan Sonichu: Greetings, everyone.
I bless all of you who are good, neutral, light-powered and righteous, and those all redeeming themselves.
I speak well and true that I have indeed returned to guide all of you with the best of my powers, abilities and skills.
As I have observed this blessed and accurate play dawned [?] by none other than our blessed Angelica Rosechu, and all in the cast, and witnessed by all of you, the kind audience and individuals.
[The drawing disappears.]
Chris Chan Sonichu: At present tense in December 2005, our earth halves of 1218 and C-197 are starting to become whole and undivided once again.
It is quite the process.
Nearly 17 years from now in 2022, the 1218 half of our earth shall be cleansed and healed of all toxic evil darkest-seeing individuals, and all demons and devils and hellful doubt shall be cleared off both halves of the earth, and the- as the veil barrier and divisions between the 1218 and C-197 halves and everything and everyone on them... are removed our- all shall be tangible and coexistent with each other as we have been and for- should have been since the division in 1389 AD.
I continue to do my best now in 2022 and onward in forever immortal life.
I keep all of you in my thoughts and prayers.
Support and have faith in all that is good, right-powered and righteous.
Doubt stems demons so keep faith and have no doubt within.
Thank you all with continued safety, health, well-being and livelihood.
[Snaps fingers.]]
Kra-KOW!
Chris: The audience goes into massive applause.
Chris comes back ins- into himself as everyone starts taking their bows and gratitude.
While Chris spoke on my behalf, Inuyasha Son- Inuyasha went up to Angelica and said:
Inuyasha: That's not in the script!
Chris: Angelica responded:
Angelica: I realize that, but I know Jesus Christ herself must be speaking through Chri- through Chris tonight.
Chris: Inuyasha checks Chris- checked Chris's heart and sees the inner veils slash inner timeline connections with- with I.
[Pause and sigh.]
Chris: I- Yes, Inuyasha, I did speak through Chris, I telepathically tell her.
During the play, Walsh and Sylvana had uh, piqued, had watched with piqued interest.
Liquidchu watched with some interest but yawned during Angelica's narrations.
Blake was actually impressed with their acting chops, and he was really favoring Bubbles Rosechu's scene, and seeing Bubbles donned like Korra, the Ava- the Avatar-
[A drawing appears, showing Blake thinking of Bubbles dressed as Korra.]
Chris: -past self of mine, Blake went wild with imagination on how adventurous and cool Bubbles looked.
The video recording-
[The drawing disappears.]
Chris: -of this play was made available on DVD sales a week later.
[A drawing appears, showing a hand holding a DVD copy of the play.]
Chris: It sold very well. Even the President of the United States-
[The drawing disappears.]
Chris: -in 2005... [Chris looks to the side as if the President's name is there.] ...George Bush Jr, he bought a copy and enjoyed watching it with his wife.
Chris and Magi-Chan hosted the one-hour after-show cast party backstage.
Everyone mingled and talked of their feelings of enlightenment from when they had acted out the roles.
Jamsta Sonichu commented to Lolisa and Rallo [?] and a few others:
Jamsta: It was a strange thing, it was a thing playing the Devil. Rehearsing and acting the lines, I actually felt some twinge from within, in the show as if it must go on I felt like I was almost sucked into a darkness. Then I literally saw Jesus Christ Chan herself as Sonichu hit me with that uppercut, pushing that darkness out of me and instilling forgiveness.
Oh man, I will never, ever forget that.
Chris: Jamsata played a little bit of Beethoven's 5th, dun-dun-dun-dunnnn, followed by the sounds of a calm quiet stream on a sunny and rainbow-blessed day.
Lolisa quipped:
[A drawing appears, showing Jamsta and Lolisa sitting on chairs, talking.]
Lolisa: Well, you've had a taste of the Dark Side, but the Jedi light power overwhelmed them in the end with the Force.
Jamsta: Really?
Star Wars notes?
Lolisa: Sure, why not?
Chris: That group laughed, heh.
[The drawing disappears.]
Chris: And Sonichu told Rosie, Wild, Punchy and Bubbles:
Sonichu: Playing the role of Jesus, I felt his energy flowing through me, I was like, "Wow."
When I went into that off-script-
[A drawing appears, showing Sonichu, Rosie, Wild, Punchy and Bubbles.]
Sonichu: -dialogue about numbers in the clouds' aura and that bit of diving into the center star of the universe and seeing the future.
And I do empathize with the internal struggles coming to terms with his revelations. And while Magi-Chan was only acting-
[The drawing disappears.]
Sonichu: -I felt and saw Lavesh Sonichu in the present moment guiding me.
Chris: Rosie commented:
Rosie: I saw and felt that too, all that too.
Chris: Rosie commented:
Rosie: I saw and felt all that too, as you spoke and preached. It was almost as strong and mighty as Angelica when she preaches.
I felt and got chills and goosebumps.
Chris: Punchy also said:
Punchy: Hmm. When I looked into your hands, Sonichu, I saw Jesus Christ Chan and her hands with those scars. It is no coincidence.
Chris: They all nodded in agreement.
Chris had uh, mostly recovered from his connection with me, but he recalled it all very vividly as he told Crystalina, Angelica, Inuyasha, Night Star and Magi-Chan:
2005 Chris: I could swear I saw-
[A drawing appears, showing 2005 Chris with the imaginary friends he just listed.]
2005 Chris: -into the over-extensive mind and soul of my 1218 half-subcounterpart, herself. If I had not met her before then in person, I'd probably call myself crazy, but I'm not crazy, I really do know that. I know that really well.
Chris: Crystallina responded:
Crystallina: I've foreseen you-
[The drawing disappears.]
Crystallina:
-going through a distant mental link.
And I sense you saw more than what you ended up speaking.
2005 Chris: You're right, Sis, I saw some tiny- I saw some time in 2022.
The world recovering from some viral pandemic, Russia terrorizing Ukraine, Donald Trump was as a condemned former President?
And God in jail on irony and prophecy details, with her release from jail needing to happen a lot sooner.
Chris: Magi-Chan and Night Star nodded.
Magi-Chan said:
Magi-Chan: This confirms a lot of foreknown details for our timeline. I shall need to step up my personal interactions with Christine shortly enough.
Chris: Night Star went:
Night Star: I linked up with you in that moment, Chris, and I got confirmations of a rushed premature future in Equestira and on Earth. I'll share these details with Celestia herself and with my friend Twilight.
Chris: [unintelligible]
?????: It was a good grief of a confirmation.
Chris: Inuyasha added:
Inuyasha: I got a telepathic message from Christ-Chan. It was definitely her from the future speaking to Chris tonight.
Chris: Magi-Chan says:
Magi-Chan: On one hand this is very good, for we can prepare better for these future events. But on the other, what was said thru Chris here - recorded and likely to be interpreted directly by certain wrong humans and individuals - it can either be ignored or it can be manifested into quite the year in 2022 in our C-197 half of this Earth as well as the undivided whole Earth of ours.
Night Star: And not to mention the resonance fom Earth to all the other planets, including Equestria.
Chris: Night Star adds.
Inuyasha: Plus...
Chris: ...Inuyasha adds...
Inuyasha: ...the solar maximus and solar flares, that will add more seeds to the chaos unless they actuall- unless they actually seed the chaos.
Chris: [unintelligible] Hmm. Okay. Chris starts to smirk.
2005 Chris: Inuyasha Sonichu, what would we do without Firebenders like you to absorb the heat?
Inuyasha: The way you say it, Christian, that's a- that's such a grass-type take on taking the heat.
2005 Chris: Well, you said it.
[Chris abruptly disappears.
A few seconds later, text scrolls up the screen.
Typos are left intact.]
This Christmas Play was one of the
multitude of other events in the
past of Cwcville
and the Special
Sonichus and Rosechus consciously
revealed to me.
Rest assured, there is much, much
more.
Details on collaboration
opportunity will be revealed soon
and only to the select and well-
trusted vew, and there shall be
more "Sonichu" books, counting and in
versions of the past books.
"Stay
Tuned" is putting it mildly on that
bunch of details.
Present moments, I continue to
encourage all of you to be kind
and good with each other, as well as
following what is Light Powered and
Good as all of the events that have
been divinel prophecised continue
onward.
After all, it's Divine Timing,
not "Political Timing".
I thank all of you for watching and
enjoying this reading and feature.
Stay creative, Be lovely with each
other, and, of course,
Be Safe and Well.
Mrs. Jesus Christ Chan Sonichu Prime.
