March was the third month of 2021. The most notable things that happened this month were the KwaiiSandbag calls, and Chris accidentally smashing the rear window of the Dodge Caravan. Aside from that, Chris continued to post about the Dimensional Merge on social media. He also drew the Workaholics Anonymous comic, in which he alluded to real-life sexual health issues.
