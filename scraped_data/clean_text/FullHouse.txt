FullHouse is a video Chris uploaded on 25 October 2010, in where he sings the full version of "Everywhere You Look", the Full House theme song, with pretend guitar accompaniment. Surprisingly, this song is not about his hoarding habits. Unsurprisingly, he doesn't sing it so much as he slurs it to the point where it's hard to tell whether he even got the lyrics right or not. The plush breasts make a cameo appearance in this video as well.

Whatever happened to predictability? [Chris removes his glasses, then puts them back on.]
The milkman, the paperboy, evenin' TV,
Neninben living here? Somebody, tell me please,
Dis whole world's confusin' meeeeee...
Clouds as mean as you've ever seen,
And a bird who knows your tune,
And that little boy's inside you whisperin',
"Kids, don't sell your dreams so soon."
Everywhere you look,
There's a heart,
A...hand to hold on to.
Everywhere you look,
There's a face
Of somebaaady who needs yooooou
Everywhere you look
When you're lost out there and you're all aloooone
...siwaiting to carry you home
...verywhere you loooook!
Everywhere you look
[hums unintelligibly]
