“
Uh, the quote-unquote lesbian sleepover party. Yeah, that never happened. Um just let's just say that somebody else, whose name will not be mentioned, proposed the idea, and it just never really formed.
”
Chris, refusing to reveal the identity of a lady manager [1]
The Lady Managers were a mysterious group of trolls who gained their influence over Chris in equally mysterious ways. They trolled him from November 2015 to July 2016.
They got Chris to announce a Lesbian Sleepover, launch Sonichu Entertainment of America, among other things.
The inner workings of what they did were never revealed, not by Chris or the Managers themselves. Due to this, they have faded into obscurity as one of the least talked about trolls.
