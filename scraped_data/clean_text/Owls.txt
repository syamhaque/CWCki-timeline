Chris about Owls.[2]
Ryan Winger, more commonly referred to as Owls was an associate of MKRNightVee. He was GhostBird50 on the Kiwi Farms[3] and the CWCki, and as CpuTurquoiseHeart to Chris.[4][5]
According to MKRNightVee, Owls has been a long-time Christorian that knew the rights and wrongs of communicating with Chris.[4]
Though he's scoffed at MKR's attempts at CPU roleplaying with Chris on Kiwi Farms multiple times, he also claims that this was his idea. He claimed that after talking with MKR for about month, he came up with the idea of trying to convince Chris that the Dimensional Merge wasn't going to happen.[6]

Interactions with Chris
The full scope on Owls' involvement with Chris is unknown, but there are some clues based on what little concrete information there is about him.
Motives
“
I want to say while it's great he's being optimistic because watching Chris be depressing or Social justice isn't that fun to watch so I'm kinda glad at that fact he's being somewhat normal and optimistic. but as soon as he mentions the stupid merge shit I immediately think "you were doing so well then you threw it all away for your stupid fantasy bullshit." at this point I will pay money to whoever can get him back to his old self.
”
Owls, wanting Chris's "old self" back.[7]
“
honestly seeing that Chris actively avoids adversity and is stuck firmly in the belief that the merge is a real thing and ever little disaster the happens is part of it so he can use it as an excuse to forgo all responsibilities , we will get nothing from him unless he is faced with something he can't ignore or avoid.
”
Owls' reply to a post complaining about the lack of new content from Chris.[8]
One of Owls' supposed end goals was to try and convince Chris that the Dimensional Merge wasn't going to happen, and for him to live a normal life, while beating away at Idea Guy-like trolls. Owls has claimed that Marvin knew about this, and that there was a liaison between his group and the Guard Dogs, but Marvin has also denied this.[9][10][11] Several posts from Owls on Kiwi Farms seem to indicate that the reason he was doing this was out of wanting Chris to be back to his "old self", and claimed he was willing to "pay" anyone that could bring back the Classic Era.
Owls has also claimed that he was all for trolling Chris, so long as it was just "harmless gaslighting", and also expressed having ideas of his own, but was unable to go through with them due to them requiring him to spend money and the possible flak he'd receive for attempting them.[12]
CPU Roleplaying
His primary means of accomplishing his goals involved recruiting some Chris orbiters such as MKRNightVee, and some associates of hers that she had trusted, to roleplay as CPU Goddesses, the latter of which the Idea Guys were infamous of doing.[13] Owls has also claimed that he was largely responsible for much of the NightVee comic that MKR was working on, as he was the one that wrote for it.[1] The earliest Owls has been known to be in contact with MKRNightVee appears to be somewhere between December 2018 to January 2019, as he was invited into the Sons of the Miscreants server she ran.[4] In the server, MKR claims that Owls was her "manager" and "coach". This is made more apparent given that MKR had told the other members in the group that they had to talk to Owls personally before they could begin roleplaying as CPU Goddesses with Chris.
When he roleplayed with Chris, he was CPU Goddess Turquoise Heart. According to MKR, Chris was seemingly led to believe that both her and Owls were powerful psychics. Owls has claimed that he stopped interacting with Chris sometime in August 2019 but Marvin, who Owls was also in contact with, states that Owls was still talking to Chris.
NightVee Comic
Owls had written for the NightVee comics.
Rowlette OC
Owls' avatar was a Rowlette, often depicted wearing a general's hat and smoking a cigar. In MKR's canon, the avatar was depicted as a pet of hers.
In one of the TSSSF, Chris made it a part of his lore that said Rowlette had killed Hariet from Super Mario Odyssey, who in his canon is an agent of Giovanni.
A-Logging
Despite his supposed goals in "helping" Chris, Owls has shown multiple cases of A-logging, both towards Chris and some of his own associates.
On Kiwi Farms, many of the comments he made involved him chastising MKR's attempts in roleplaying CPU Magenta Heart, essentially calling her attempts at it pointless by saying she's as "mental as Chris", attributing that to why she's unable to get Chris to change.[13] Owls has also once suggested that Chris might be put in a mental hospital after Barb died for his fantasies about OCs and CPU Goddesses, fantasies that he encourages his associates to engage with Chris about.[14]
On Twitter, Owls went under the alias birdlovingandrd, which he also used to A-log Chris with, replying to many of his tweets and those of some of his other orbiters.[15]
Owls has also commentated on Chris's reaction to getting mass blocked on Twitter over on Kiwi Farms.
Exposure
The CWCki user Hurtful Truth Level had made a post on the Kiwi Farms regarding the gathering of info of Owls, which he had received from another user via a DM, where Owls is acussed of being a 40-year-old man who wanted to create a "harem" of its female members.[16] Owls posted on the Kiwi Farms to try and defend himself.[3]
Conclusion
“
im not even able to claim to not be retarded. like in all honesty I was autistic enough to believe when I started that somehow I could help Chris out and by the end of it I literally questioned if I should see a doctor to find out if im autistic
”
Owls, after being called out on Kiwi Farms.[17]
Owls' end goal, whatever it may have been, ultimately never came through. Whether it was "helping" Chris, bringing back the good old days of Christory, or creating a "harem" out of his female orbiters, Owls left no long-lasting impact on Chris. In the midst of his retardation, however, it all inadvertently lead to a whole slew of new misadventures that would come across our hero's way, thanks in part to his influence on MKRNightVee.

Notes
↑ Claims to have befriended MKR in the summer of 2019 in the CWCVille Rebellion server, when he was in conflicts with various Arbitarch members, despite the fact he was invited into The Sons of the Miscreants server, which predated that by at least several months.
↑ Claims that his main role with MKR was to keep her at bay, despite all of the drama that revolved around her.
↑ He has claimed to stop talking to Chris since August 2019, but Marvin said in 29 August 2019 that Owls was still talking to Chris.
↑ Despite MKR stating that Owls is her "coach", and clearly being an associate of hers otherwise, Owls has scoffed at MKR multiple times on Kiwi Farms, even calling her a "cheap Chinese bootleg of Chris" in one instance.
