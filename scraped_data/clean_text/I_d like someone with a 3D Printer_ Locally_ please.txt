I'd like someone with a 3D Printer, Locally, please is a video Chris uploaded on 24 August 2016.
A ween named Lil E contacted Chris and offered the use of a 3D printer in exchange for an interview.[1] Chris held his end of the bargain with CHRIS CHAN INTERVIEW, but Lil E failed to honor his deal.[2]
“
And I also am paranoid of people I don't know just wanting to get one over on me. Even recently, the person who offered their 3D printer to help me print a few figures, ultimately did not help me there; he made excuses and I feel like the interviews he had me do for him was what he really wanted and pulled one over on me there.
”
Chris, November 2016, reflecting on his fanbase.
