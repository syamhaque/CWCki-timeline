Troll disclosure: This persona was created, appropriated, or otherwise used by trolls to manipulate Chris. Though this identity is contrived, the CWCki may treat it as if it were a real identity because it was to Chris. (It's also funnier that way.)

Jimmy Hill
James William Thomas "Jimmy" Hill (22 July 1928 – 19 December 2015[2]) was a British soccer presenter known for hosting the BBC series Match of the Day from 1973 to 1988.
A Something Awful Sycophant Squad (SASS) user going by the name of the aforementioned presenter used the alias of Jimmy to troll Chris[3], claiming to be the true original creator of Sonichu and Rosechu, selling counterfeit Sonichu merchandise, and aiming to launch the comic in Europe around September—December 2008.

Jimmy Hill's work
Jimmy Hill's version of Sonichu was a homo, with Blake as his boyfriend and Rosechu his gal-pal. He revered Mary Lee Walsh as his mother and Jimmy Hill as his father, and battled Chris-Chu's giant jerk-bot. Hill also sold OFFICIAL merch, including a muscle bra "suitable for geriatric females and overweight men who are uncertain about their sexuality".

"Sonichu, as your TRUE ORIGINAL CREATOR I command you to ZAP that wanker!"
Sonichu, the first openly gay children's cartoon character who is truly an inspiration to us all.
Oh no! It's the evil Chris-Chu!
The ad that started it all.
AND LOOK, IT'S IN A REAL MAGAZINE SO THEREFORE IT MUST BE REAL. TOTALLY NOT PRINTED OUT AND INSERTED ON TOP OF AN EXISTING PAGE.
Only in today's Europe can a man who was guilty of copyright infringement create such a brilliant and lovable gay children's character!
Even the Daily Mail can't help but cover Sonichumania in Europe.
Boxes of the #1 best selling DVD in the UK Yep, I'm on TV! - Jimmy Hill's Life Story
Within seconds, all of the Jimmy Hill DVDs were sold out.
Unlike Chris, Jimmy Hill was definitely on the honor roll.
Look familiar? That's because Chris STOLE Mr. Hill's brilliant cover for his own use
The video game!
Chris responds
A page from Sonichu #10.
In September 2008, Chris first responded to the unauthorized merch sales, referring to him as "Jerry Hill."[4][5]
The next month, Chris raged more openly against Jimmy Hill, pointing out that Hill's work was an obvious ripoff of his, and ignoring that he's not one to talk regarding ripoffs.[6]
He and PandaHalo planned to sue Jimmy,[7] and when she said "i hope somebody cuts off his penis" in IRC, Chris made the statement, "I hope he loses his duck."[8]
His fans at ED left a sign reading "ENCYCLOPEDIA DRAMATICA ♥ JIMMY HILL" on Chris's lawn on Halloween 2008. A year later, he tore up the sign on YouTube[9].
During the Miyamoto Saga, Chris grandiosely stated, "I declare another step forward in the Sonichu Game project, and the downfall of that Impostor, Jimmy Hill. I have also informed them of Sarah Mitchel's message of Sega of Japan leaning to pay the impostor, but Takashi will most certainly step in and avert the mistake from being made. Then hopefully, with their help, I'll be able to claim the copyrights in the UK that should have been mine in the first place. I already had them from the Virginia Library of Congress."
By February 2009, the S.A.S.S. board collapsed and Jimmy's site had gone quiet. Chris wised up and decided that he was no longer a threat, despite trolls insisting that Jimmy had successfully launched his cartoon in the U.K.[10] But when amending the Chris-chan ED page, Chris was enraged at the idea of Jimmy becoming Mayor of CWCville.[11] Chris would "exact" his revenge on Jimmy in Sonichu #10, where Jimmy is struck by a Hyper Beam launched by Chris, knocking his front teeth out in the process.
