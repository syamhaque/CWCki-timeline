Proposition to Sega

This is Not a joke; I have heard the company's subtle interest blurbs, and I, personally, and my close friends/associates, are ready to make a deal with ‪#‎SEGA‬.

That's great! Good luck 👍

Y'know what would make Sonichu great again though? New material. You can't keep a series fresh without new episodes.
McDonalds pancakes

"If you're a bear, and haven't got much, marmalade chunks are very valuable." -‪#‎PaddingtonBear‬
So, take some ‪#‎Smuckers‬ ‪#‎Marmalade‬ with you and try it on ‪#‎McDonalds‬ hotcakes (without syrup and butter), or English Muffin, for something really satisfying and yummy. 😊

Genuine maple syrup is still the best.
Jessica Quinn then replied to the post, starting a chain between Quinn and Engelhardt.

I've had pancakes with jam before. My personal favorite is having pie filling on them ❤️
Can't say I've ever had pancakes from McDonald's before though. I always assumed they'd be a rubbery mess compared to homemade ones.

From my viewpoint pancakes are kind of tricky to get just right if you try to cook them at home, so yes, I've had them at McDonalds. They are kind of small but I don't think they are all that bad. Genuine maple syrup (not the imitation crap) supposedly has stuff like antioxidants that are good for you. I can't say whether that really applies to Marmalade though. But if you want the benefts of antioxidants, I would crush fresh fruit such as strawberries over them as the topping.

That sounds amazing right about now ❤️
Transgender bathrooms
16 May 2016 at 15:59
Right on! And I do not like California's law against freedom of restroom choice for the Soul Identified.

This whole bathroom thing is silly, I can't believe how bent out of shape people are over it.
Just an observation and thought

**Just an observation and thought for now.**
With parents and children for Decades or so now, the parents tend to keep the boys and girls separated, regardless of age, when it comes to fun things like simple parties and sleepovers. In view of potential, but Very unlikely, sexual possibilities, I would generally agree with this old adage. But nowadays, we are finding gay and lesbian children; no judgment or anything wrong with that. But, I tend to wonder how today's parents are considering this when allowing their children out with their friends and field trip groups and summer camps. Do they get paranoid of the possibilities of their boy getting sexually explored by another boy, and vice versa, with possible varying mentalities and so forth?
In my humble opinion, nowadays adults tend to worry too much from exaggerations on the news, Internet, and even potentially bad-influence and instigating comments from Internet Trolls. I mean, regardless of who or what our new children were in their past lives (on the reincarnation theory), or whatever; the young ones are still young, learning, and are Very unlikely to practice much sexual, because most children are not likely to possess such knowledge, even the most basic of intercourse details. Encouraging privacy and closeness and trust between friends and family are still Good and Viable. And I feel when it comes to the play times, camps, sleepovers and so forth, children are still capable of choosing who they feel make good and trustworthy friends, regardless of gender, and as long as the age range is equal or under ten, or whatever is that rule.
As for the old adage, it is okay for restroom breaks at the least.
The best practice to keep in mind when parenting is being the leading guidance of our children; teaching them right from wrong; and Keeping Plain Common Sense in mind, as well as Teaching our children to Use their common sense as well in remembering everything they individually learn from life and us all.
It is true: nobody can totally protect their children forever, but we can each and all lead them in the right directions towards being happy, self-confident, and finding themselves and fully enjoying their individual lives the way they each choose.

My daughters door has to stay open at all times no matter who's in there and supervised

The brain of a teenager is different from the brain of an adult. Your brain isn't fully developed until you are well into your 20s. Your personality will generally stop changing at around the age of 30. You mentioned a10 year range. There's a big difference between an immature teenager at 14 who says she wants to get married and a college graduate at 24 who has made an adult decision about who she wants to build a life with.
