CWC[1]
China (simplified Chinese: 中国; traditional Chinese: 中國; pinyin: Zhōngguó) is a sovereign state in East Asia. To Chris, however, it's a word he once used in place of "vagina", as he was uncomfortable saying that word and thus felt the need to resort to using childish similar-sounding or slightly-altered versions of the offending term. It's likely Chris based this term off of a term for porcelain, "china" (ironically, the word porcelain is inspired by a pig’s vagina). Although Chris has not used this euphemism (except ironically) since 2008, it has become one of his most famous CWC-isms.

Uses
In Captain's Log, Stardate August 3rd, 2008, Chris memorably states the quote above.
In Hello, Juffalo, Chris gives a shoutout to all of the, "homos," and, "chinas," who keep him, "started." Given how uncharacteristic of him that line is, it's likely that it was written by the same gal-pal who encouraged him to make the video.
As JenkinsJinkies, Chris used "china" on the Coffee Place page and on his talk page as part of his attempt to imitate troll slang.
Tom-tom
Tom-tom is an alternative CWC-ism for "vagina", which appeared first in March 2008 when Chris edited ED by replacing ShecameforCWC.JPG with an image entitled "TomTomCloseup.jpg" which featured a closeup of Megan's genitalia from ShecameforCWC. It later appeared in Captain's Log, Stardate July 26, 2009 in an unintentionally hilarious annotation that read "MY DUCK HUNGERS FOR TOM-TOM TO POUND!!!!!"
Chris got this name from "Pound My Tom-Tom",[2] a short music video that debuted during the credits of the Adult Swim show Lucy, the Daughter of the Devil. Humorously, the gag in the episode was that this is a particularly bad euphemism for vagina, and one of the characters embarrassed themselves by using it in public.
