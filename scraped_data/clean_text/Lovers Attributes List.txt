Among the attributes Chris listed for his imaginary wife Cryzel, foreshadowing what was to come.
On 12 March 2021, shortly after mentioning his Affirmations List, Chris posted his Lovers Attributes LIst to the Watchmen Discord server The Place. It is a list of attributes for his imaginary spouses.
He then tagged MKR and asked her to review the list to see if she would match up with any attributes. A month prior, he mentioned in the server to have been considering MKR for a relationship.[1]

Chris
I also in the interest of love and relationships in this universe, composed a multi-column list of the attributes of my loves.
[Chris posted the Lovers Attributes List]
Chris
It can be certain that should I attract and meet anyone on that in this universe, they will take on the common attributes between them.
Hey, @MKR, how many of these do you feel you match up with?
But of an exercise for you to read, and look into yourself as well. (edited)
