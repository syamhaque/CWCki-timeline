Title: Knights Chats - Bella and Fiona

Categories: Category, Chats without Chris
================================================================================

NOTE: At this point, Fiona posed as "Fifi Vixenhart".
After warnings towards Chris about Jacob Sockness attending Everfree Northwest in disguise, Chris chose the gal-pals Bella and Fiona as his bodyguards. He decided to have a conversation about both gal-pals with the WCT before inviting them in.[1] After their invitation, Bella and Fiona would meet and befriend each other, with the former inviting the latter into her own server.

Fiona's Arrival
19 July 2021
Fiona, referred to by Chris as "Fifi", arrives in the server's first layer, where the WCT, the Fool, and Anaxis introduce themselves. Chris vouches for her and states that she will also be attending Everfree Northwest with him. WCT chats with Fiona, bringing up the Watchmen and how they "would have never given [her] a chance" and that they "had to go." Fiona asks a few questions about them, and WCT brings up his gripes with Naught and how he "overthrew" him. After they discuss this for a little while, Chris returns to the chat and writes an extremely long rambling textwall about past convention experiences, mixed with some of his delusional beliefs.
Fiona 01:17 PM
Joined the server.
The WCT 01:17 PM
Welcome! @ScootalooSister

The Fool 01:18 PM

Fiona 01:18 PM
Hello!
The WCT 01:19 PM
My name is Kat, I also go by as Neko.
Fiona 01:20 PM
There's only a few people here
This is nice and exclusive
The WCT 01:20 PM
I modeled this server after the one that Me and Chris used to be in a while back.
The Fool 01:21 PM
yeah we're not here to turn chris into a zoo exhibit lol
just a small friend chat
Chris 01:25 PM
Hey, @everyone.
I trust you all to be kind and guiding to @ScootalooSister; she and her convention buddy are part of my convention weekend posse, at least for Friday afternoon and the Saturday.
[2 sonichuhappy[emote 1] reactions]
And I personally vouch for her.
Lainchu (Anaxis) 01:25 PM
Hello there, and welcome!
The WCT 01:26 PM
[Replying to "Hey, @everyone. I trust you all to be kind and guiding to @ScootalooSister; she and her convention buddy are part of my convention weekend posse, at least for Friday afternoon and the Saturday."]
bringing them in here is a good thing.
Fiona 01:26 PM
[Replying to "Hey, @everyone. I trust you all to be kind and guiding to @ScootalooSister; she and her convention buddy are part of my convention weekend posse, at least for Friday afternoon and the Saturday."]
Thank you, Christine
The WCT 01:26 PM
[Replying to "Thank you, Christine"]
hopefully we can become good friends on the way while you're here.
The old group would have never given you a chance. 😅
Fiona 01:27 PM
[Replying to "The old group would have never given you a chance. 😅"]
There was an old group?
The WCT 01:27 PM
[Replying to "There was an old group?"]
its a long story.
I used to be a part of it until I decided that it had to go. (it was bad)
The Fool 01:28 PM
it was run by some jokers with the mentality of middleschool bullies
Fiona 01:28 PM
Was it irl?
The WCT 01:28 PM
no
The Fool 01:28 PM
it was the watchmen, they have a cwcki article
Fiona 01:28 PM
I heard of them
Didn't they get busted?
The WCT 01:29 PM
[Replying to "I used to be a part of it until I decided that it had to go. (it was bad)"]
I overthrew its leader (his name was Naught) who recently decided for no reason whatsoever to dox me.
Fiona 01:29 PM
I'm sure he couldn't dig up much dirt
The WCT 01:29 PM
I knew the guy for 2 years and he just does that out of the blue.
The Fool 01:29 PM
he had a reason it was just really petty and stupid, he was just seeking validation from his peers because, again, he's a middleschool bully in a grown man's body
The WCT 01:30 PM
[Replying to "I'm sure he couldn't dig up much dirt"]
again, its a long story. But he's long gone now and so are his disciples that were there.
Fiona 01:30 PM
Oh ok
Chris 01:37 PM
I will offer a nugget of wisdom that @ScootalooSister brought up with me earlier when were talking of past convention first impressions.
Like me, hers was an anime convention.
I’ll let her share the rest of that store should she wish.
Anyway
The differences are in the vibes and energy of the convention that does make or break it, and I know this from experiences.
Now, with the Brony/Pegasister conventions, their mindset is more focused on the values of Friendship, Kindness, and even Compassion.
So, when people are gathered together in such the heavily secured convention with the visual inspirations and cues from MLP, it does inspire that same vibe.
When it comes to other conventions that focuses on one genre (albeit video games and anime, to name a couple), it still is a larger umbrella category for all of the various media and chroniclings within.
And when you have such a cacophony of media and OC personality inspiration, the vibe and intention can become Really Mixed, to the point of confusion to a few to some. (edited)
I am not saying that those are bad things, necessarily.
But when you have OCs that can inspire a warrior mindset, a violent mindset, or even a narcissistic mindset from the few within those chronicled media, and they have a clash with the genuine kind and spiritual and even youthful individuals within, it can potentially cause an unsure or insecure feeling within them, if they are not yet strong enough or accustomed to it.
As I have mentioned in my tweet set on the subject, it is on the vibrations of the collective within that one building that can make or break the experience.
At the Anime Mid-Atlantic, the very first convention I sampled that one Saturday; my main focus was meeting and spending a bit of time with Monica Rial.
In that day, everything else, to me, was rather passé, to say the least.
I still observed and enjoyed the arts and fun as best as I could then, but that was among the years I was not yet totally conscious of everything, and I was still subconsciously soul-searching for myself.
But I attended more various anime and game conventions since then, and I was able to become more accustomed to the great mixture of vibrations.
And when I attended BronyCon in 2017, with its central focus being on the values of friendship and kindness, to also include the other mixed and various mindsets and emotions within, I felt at a better home and place during that time.
Hell, had it been a Care Bear convention, in the alternate universe and timeline where Care Bears did a turn around like MLP did in story context and variety of individuals, I likely would have felt a similar friendship and kind vibe that would have been welcoming.
And that’s my two bolts and a heart on the vibes in conventions from my perspective.

Bella's Arrival
NOTE: Chris was not directly involved in this conversation.
19 July 2021
Right after Fiona joined, Bella (@an0nym0us) joins the server, and the Knights all introduce themselves to her. WCT brings up that he is an ex-Watchman and that the group had been replaced by the Knights. The Fool tries to confirm that Bella is a member of Praetor, and WCT asks her to reach out to other members of the group so they can join the Knights server and he can apologize to them. However, she insists that Praetor's members are just acquaintances and that she had only done the animation on their behalf, and that they weren't the nicest people.
WCT and Bella talk about summer classes, then they quiz each other on their respective histories with Chris, with WCT continuing to demonize the Watchmen leaders for doxing him. Bella claims to have ensured her own online anonymity by citing something nonsensical about "wired logs and audits" and "reverse address engineering," and requests to be kept anonymous by us, terms that WCT agrees to. They talk briefly about the troll Larry Vaughn, and WCT reiterates the importance of security for Chris, especially given Jacob Sockness's intent to attend the convention as well.
WCT eventually introduces several members of the server to Bella, including Marvin, who Bella seems enthusiastic about meeting. She then invites us to a server of hers that she intends for Chris to join as well, and WCT accepts the invite.
Bella 02:23 PM
Joined the server.
The WCT 02:36 PM

The WCT 04:00 PM

Bella 04:00 PM

[Screenshot of the Watchmen page on the CWCki, with a red arrow pointing to "The WCT" in the table of contents.]
Bella 04:01 PM
[Replying to "oh yes that's right, @an0nym0us I used to be one of the Old Watchmen."]

The WCT 04:01 PM
[Replying to "i'm this guy."]
I was Bismuth's heir.
Bella 04:01 PM

yeah i heard of them i beleive i think they told me about them
The Fool 04:02 PM
yeah we're just trying to get them to know they're welcome here and we'd like to keep steady contact with them so we all know what each other are doing and stuff, you know, being open and everything
The WCT 04:02 PM
[Replying to "yeah i heard of them i beleive i think they told me about them"]
well, that group no longer exists.
most of the good people from the old group have been brought over here.
Bella 04:03 PM
[Replying to "yeah we're just trying to get them to know they're welcome here and we'd like to keep steady contact with them so we all know what each other are doing and stuff, you know, being open and everything"]
i can reply to their texts and dms and tell them if youd like
Bella 04:04 PM
[Replying to "most of the good people from the old group have been brought over here."]
oh i see. ive been out of the loop for a while lol
The Fool 04:04 PM
it'd probably be easier if we had some of their core members in here
Bella 04:08 PM
ok i can invite after i finish this test
The WCT 04:10 PM
[Replying to "ok i can invite after i finish this test"]
do you know anybody that's a part of Praetor that's also on Discord?
and sure, invite more of the group. We should get acquainted with each other.
Bella 04:10 PM
yeah i had them in my old discord before i delted it but i still have the discord invite in my chat logs somehwere
sure ill get on that once i buckle up and do this stupid test
The WCT 04:11 PM

Bella 04:12 PM
college class yeah
The WCT 04:12 PM
god damn.
I hate Summer Classes.
Bella 04:13 PM
r u in college too?
it wouldnt be so bad if i didnt have work as well le sigh
The WCT 04:14 PM
not at the moment, but I did summer classes last year. Wasn't a fan. 👎
I'd rather get everything done in either Spring or Fall semester and be done with it.
Bella 04:14 PM
i see what u mean but at least the classes are only a month
The WCT 04:15 PM
the big problem is that you get more homework, like a shit ton.
Bella 04:16 PM
oh fs thats why all my pals in the class share them togther lmaoo
the teacher doesnt even question it
The WCT 04:26 PM
so question for you:
how long have you known Christine?
how did you meet her?
Bella 04:27 PM
oh i made the animation for her
i met her through praector
The WCT 04:27 PM
*praetor
sorry. lol
Bella 04:27 PM
quite a while ago, nearly a year
lol my grammar is awful i dont bother correcting it
The WCT 04:28 PM
was it before or after COVID put us all under house arrest? (edited)
Bella 04:28 PM
i think it was last fall?
i was still doing in person classes and working in person
The WCT 04:28 PM
so 2019?
Bella 04:28 PM
no 2020
The WCT 04:29 PM
oh, so between September and November 2020. (edited)
Bella 04:29 PM
yeah about that
hbu?
The WCT 04:29 PM
I've known Christine since 2019.
The Watchmen at the time had just came under Bismuth's control after he ousted Ryan.
MKRNightVee, NovaKyle, Silvia, Aqua, Lainchu and etc had all joined thanks to him.
There were like 3-4 variants of the Watchmen. (edited)
Bella 04:31 PM
you were a big part of history then wow
The Fool 04:31 PM
I lost it when chris said "fuck bismuth"
The WCT 04:31 PM
[Replying to "you were a big part of history then wow"]
so around September 2019, I was recruited by Bismuth.
Bella 04:32 PM
[Replying to "I lost it when chris said "fuck bismuth""]
hbu?
The WCT 04:32 PM
Kyle and Meghan didn't really like me, but we worked together for 2 years up until last month when they refused to recognize the reality that Bismuth had doxed me despite the overwhelming evidence against him. (edited)
Bella 04:32 PM
oh what kind of person was meghan im curious
was she actually as intolerable as i hear?
The WCT 04:33 PM
MKRNightVee (or Meghan) was very troublesome.
she was a bully.
Many of her followers (who are LGBT or politically Left-Wing) would be shocked to know who'd she actually is.
The Fool 04:33 PM
she was really just using chris to "feel better about herself in comparison", she never said that but it was really obvious behavior.
all of them were like that
Bella 04:34 PM
yeah alot of people take advantage of her
sadly alot of praector did and i had to try and get christine to not participate in certain things
The WCT 04:34 PM
oh, and I owe you and the rest of your friends an apology. @an0nym0us
Bella 04:34 PM
why?
The WCT 04:35 PM
Rather it be you, Caden, Owen, or Anni. I sincerely apologize for taking part in anything we've done against you guys.
Bella 04:35 PM
oh no dont apologize lol!
theyre aquaintences
i didnt particpate much but they involved me in everything i just wouldnt engage
a few of them werent the nicest
The WCT 04:36 PM
The Watchmen (mainly Kyle and Meghan) thought you guys were like some fail trolls trying to murder Christine with a taser. lol
Bella 04:36 PM
oh yeah i remember someone saying that
The WCT 04:37 PM
I was there. They were on the full assault against you guys. Like using whatever means possible to get you away from Christine. (doxing was mostly what they did)
Bella 04:37 PM
they wouldnt invite me to the watchman server bc they said i would be targeted despite being anonymous online lol i didnt beleive it but i disnt really care
The Fool 04:37 PM
they're pretty vicious, they tried doxxing kat for no good reason
Bella 04:37 PM
[Replying to "I was there. They were on the full assault against you guys. Like using whatever means possible to get you away from Christine. (doxing was mostly what they did)"]
oh wow really? i was MIA when i lost my phone for a little bit so im very out of the loop
[Replying to "they're pretty vicious, they tried doxxing kat for no good reason"
what dicks (edited)
but then again, preactor had some dicks too
The WCT 04:38 PM
[Replying to "they're pretty vicious, they tried doxxing kat for no good reason"]
they did succeed in knowing my real name, but the problem is that nobody cares who I am.
The Fool 04:38 PM
yeah, naught was a member of kiwifarms and lolcow.org until that, that was the final straw and what made us soft-ban him from there
Bella 04:38 PM
some were nice and some were manipulative
The WCT 04:39 PM
If Meghan and Kyle have anybody to blame for the Watchmen's fall, its Bismuth. He destroyed the group by turning against me. lol (edited)
The Fool 04:39 PM
the admin of lcorg was even like "naught unironically makes me angry" and he isn't even invested in chris/watchmen
he's just that shitty
Bella 04:39 PM
i made 100% sure im anonymous online and have wired logs and audits if anyone ries to access any account or even refrences it, it also does reverse adress engineering so i would work in my favor if tehy did
The Fool 04:40 PM
damn, nice
I need to be that prepared
Bella 04:40 PM
if anyone tries to doxx u i can find whoever attempted it and give u their number
The Fool 04:40 PM
I'm semi-doxxable if you know where to look
The WCT 04:40 PM
[Replying to "i made 100% sure im anonymous online and have wired logs and audits if anyone ries to access any account or even refrences it, it also does reverse adress engineering so i would work in my favor if tehy did"]
no wonder why we couldn't find you. lol
Bella 04:40 PM
good haha
The WCT 04:40 PM
Caden and Annabelle were not so lucky.
but nobody on the Farms seemed to have cared about them.
Bella 04:41 PM
keep my name private please, i trust u guys but if u refer to me outside just call me anonymous or 10anon or whatever
The WCT 04:41 PM
[Replying to "keep my name private please, i trust u guys but if u refer to me outside just call me anonymous or 10anon or whatever"]
ofc.
The Fool 04:41 PM
(I got here like a month ago so I wasn't here for any of this doxxing shit)
Bella 04:41 PM
[Replying to "Caden and Annabelle were not so lucky."]
even annabelle? she harldy participated
she never repsonded at all
thanks guys
The WCT 04:41 PM
You should've seen the shit amount of conspiracy theories they came up with regarding me, her, and Caden.
Bella 04:41 PM
caden makes sense
do u remember that one guy tried to doxx christine and i found his name and number and such? that "cult organization"
The WCT 04:42 PM
Are you talking about Jacob Sockness? (I hope not)
Bella 04:43 PM
so i was involved in that heavily, a few members from preactor were trying to work with him to fuck with christine and i had to stop it
[Replying to "Are you talking about Jacob Sockness? (I hope not)"]
no
it was on his twitter alot, i forgot his name, Christine can proboly tell you
The WCT 04:43 PM
[Replying to "thanks guys"]
as long as your intentions are good, you'll be fine. I'm willing to give anybody a chance as long as they don't have malicious intentions.
Bella 04:44 PM
it was like some fake organization who did really creepy things and tried to doxx christine and send her to disneyland and such
The WCT 04:44 PM
Larry Vaughn?
Bella 04:44 PM
by send to disneyland i mean planned a kidnapping
[Replying to "Larry Vaughn?"]
thats him
[1 sonichuthink[emote 2] reaction]
The Fool 04:44 PM
uh, I think chris is already thoroughly doxxed 🤔
Bella 04:44 PM
[Replying to "as long as your intentions are good, you'll be fine. I'm willing to give anybody a chance as long as they don't have malicious intentions."]
thanks! i promise they are
The WCT 04:44 PM
So tell me, are you going with CWC to Seattle? @an0nym0us
Bella 04:44 PM
[Replying to "uh, I think chris is already thoroughly doxxed 🤔"]
yeah ik lol thats y this guy had a negative iq
yeah ill do my best too
trying to coordinate
but i think i can
The Fool 04:45 PM
"14 branchland court ruckersville virginia" is basically a meme at this point
The WCT 04:45 PM
If you go, that would be great. I'll be in Indiana at that time so I can't really do too much.
Bella 04:45 PM
ill take photos for u and keep u updated if i go
The WCT 04:46 PM
Christine needs to be safe from a man who lives not far from me. (I'm talking about Jacob Sockness)
Bella 04:46 PM
ill be her bodyguard
The WCT 04:46 PM
if you see him trying to do anything, don't hesitate to call security at the convention.
The Fool 04:46 PM
nice
The WCT 04:46 PM
and if things get really hairy, call the Seattle Police.
The Fool 04:47 PM
sockness said he would be in a disguise, like a full-suited costume, so keep your eyes out
Bella 04:47 PM
ofc, ill be very paranoid at all times
The WCT 04:47 PM
Sockness is mostly probably trying to seek attention, but he's also a real threat physically. So don't let your guard down.
[Replying to "ofc, ill be very paranoid at all times"]
be in the middle, try having a good time.
The Fool 04:48 PM
just make sure chris doesn't get near anyone in a full suit costume or anything I guess
Bella 04:48 PM
yeah it will be fun as long as nobody tries to do anything crazy
[Replying to "just make sure chris doesn't get near anyone in a full suit costume or anything I guess"]
stay away from furries got it lol
The WCT 04:48 PM
knowing what I know atm, things are looking good for Chris security wise.
at this point, Jacob will only try to mess with Chris for e-fame. (which is dumb)
Para 04:50 PM
i doubt sockness is brave enough to try anything
but he wants his clout
[1 💯 reaction]
hes just a leech
The WCT 04:50 PM
Sockness hasn't been really relevant since September 2019 when I helped stopped him.
Bella 04:50 PM
theyre proboly bs what happens like usual
The WCT 04:51 PM
if you end up enjoying this convention, you should come down to BABScon next year. (if COVID is gone that is)
The WCT 04:52 PM
[Replying to "theyre proboly bs what happens like usual"]
we'll just have to wait and see, but I'm confident that Christine will head home knowing she had fun.
Bella 04:56 PM
[Replying to "if you end up enjoying this convention, you should come down to BABScon next year. (if COVID is gone that is)"]
sure! if i have the time i would
[Replying to "we'll just have to wait and see, but I'm confident that Christine will head home knowing she had fun."]
ill make sure of it, ill bring games we can play in the hotel
The WCT 04:56 PM
now if you're not familiar with the other members in this server. I'll introduce you to them:
Lainchu (also known as Anaxis) is an editor for the CWCki and like me was a part of the Watchmen.
Marvin (aka the Man in the Pickle Suit) is the owner of the CWCki and a member of Kiwi Farms
Hedgehog is also a CWCki editor and Kiwi Farms member
And Silvia is another former Watchmen member that brought in because she was of the nicest people from the group while I was there.
Bella 04:58 PM
[Replying to "Marvin (aka the Man in the Pickle Suit) is the owner of the CWCki and a member of Kiwi Farms"]
damn what a legend!
thanks, im excited to meet them
The WCT 04:59 PM
don't expect Marvin to really be active in this server though, he's just here to lurk and that's it.
Bella 04:59 PM
btw, i wanted to invite christine into a server with some of my friends who dont know who she is and are evry nice but just want to play, if you would like to join please go ahead

The WCT 05:00 PM
[Replying to "don't expect Marvin to really be active in this server though, he's just here to lurk and that's it."]
and like Marvin and Hedgehog, I'm also a member of the Kiwi Farms. The Fool used to be a Kiwi until Joshua Moon (Null) banned him. He's now a member of lolcow.org where him and I hang out.
Bella 05:00 PM
[Replying to "don't expect Marvin to really be active in this server though, he's just here to lurk and that's it."]
