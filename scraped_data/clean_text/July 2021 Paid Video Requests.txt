This article lists the video requests that Chris was paid to do (and likely the final he will ever do) in July 2021. On 9 July, in a video entitled Help send Chris-Chan to Everfree NW, Chris announced that he would be doing paid video requests for those who donated to a GoFundMe campaign dedicated to funding Chris's trip to Everfree Northwest, a My Little Pony convention in Seattle Washington.
