Troll disclosure: This persona was created, appropriated, or otherwise used by trolls to manipulate Chris. Though this identity is contrived, the CWCki may treat it as if it were a real identity because it was to Chris. (It's also funnier that way.)
“
We were unable to contact his parents and legally we can not force Christian to do anything as long as he is able to speak on his own. We are concerned that he may be a danger to himself and others so we would like to let that be known.

Lori's message to the CWCki.
The actual Autism Awareness ad...
...and Chris's bastardized version. You can tell it was him more or less instantly due to the footnote and its capitalization.
On 16 May 2010 the CWCki was forwarded a bunch of e-mails from a real (read: not a troll) volunteer worker for Autism Awareness. They were wondering if he was faking his illness or if he was misdiagnosed.
These messages began in April 2010 when the powers that be purchased an ad for autism awareness on the CWCipedia. Chris, as expected, was deeply offended by the advertisement's assertion that Aspergers was a form of autism, and quickly made his own version of the ad. While a normal censor would have simply removed the offending phrase, Chris went on to make it blindingly obvious that he was tampering with the ad by adding a hate-fueled mini rant about how the two are completely different.
This tampering prompted Lori, a volunteer worker, to send Chris a few e-mails, in a well-meaning attempt to correct him. When it became clear to her that Chris is completely insane, she began inquiring about Chris's ability to take care of himself. Chris, being unable to deal with reality, quit responding when Lori got around to the fact that Chris lives with his parents and has never held a stable job.
The letters
Just to correct you on some misinformation however. Asperger's and Autism are actually in the same neurotypical spectrum set of disorders. Aspergers and High-Functioning Autism are very similar and in the new upcoming DSM-V, the classification between separating the two will actually be gone. The two will become known as mild forms of autism. Thank you for your time!

Firstly, it was my pleasure to help. Second, I DISAGREE, and I personally DO NOT CARE FOR "Aspergers" AT ALL. People think Aspergers should STEAL the Reputation that Autism has earned over the number of years; I THINK NOT. Do not get me started with Aspergers; it is my 2nd Least Favorite Word Ever (the First being Naive).
And I do not give a c*** about what "Scientists" may or may not have found there either. IN MY VIEW, Aspergers IS NOT Autism.
Christian W. Chandler.
No one thinks that that people with Asperger's is trying to steal the reputation from Autism, where did hear this information? Both disorders are in the same spectrum and people with both Asperger's and Autism should be joined together to look for the cure and to make people more aware of both disorders. In fact, Hans Asperger, the discoverer of Asperger's, did not know about High-Functioning Autism when he coined that term. This is why the DSM-V is going to correct this decades old mistake.
Again, I want to thank you for your help, but we would like to change your information to reflect what is actually happening in the world of Autism.
- Lori
For your information, the Fact of Aspergers being different from Autism and of it trying to steal the light is of MY Own Idea. I will NEVER conform to such a blasphemous link of any kind between the two. And I am certainly not going to change the image's text.
Those with Aspergers are welcome to find their own cure; just denounce any so-called links between it and Autism, or NEVER bring it up around me ever again.
Christian.
You are going about this all wrong, Christian. Where did you get the idea that people with Asperger's are trying to "steal the light" from Autistics? I have never heard of this before.
- Lori
We are a little concerned about you Christian. May we have the e-mail of your caretaker? We would like to talk to them.
- Lori
Caretaker? ROFL Obviously you have not read my Bio page on the CWCipedia; I NEVER had a caretaker, unless you count my mother and father. I have been Mainstreamed; GREW UP within NORMAL SOCIETY during my School Days.
And I think I NEED TO REPEAT MYSELF HERE, the opinions that I have shared of the Aspergers are MY OWN ONLY; I WAS NOT INFLUENCED BY ANYONE ELSE TO HAVE THAT OPINION. It Is and Was MY Opinion From The Start There.
And if you want to speak to my parents, you'll have to CALL them; they do not have e-mail. And also, I AM Twenty-Eight Years Old.
Sincerely,
Christian W. Chandler.
We are wondering why you formed this opinion. It is very concerning to us that you have such a negative view of Asperger's and Autism. We are also very concerned that you do not have a caretaker. We are currently reading your biography and it states that you lost the ability to speak for many years. We think you may have been misdiagnosed. You may have Landau-Kleffner syndrome which is commonly mistaken for Autism. You may read more about it here:
Landau Kleffner syndrome
We will attempt to speak to your parents about attaining a caretaker.
- Lori
I have a negative view only on Aspergers. I have a positive view on Autism. I do NOT need a caretaker; I am capable of taking care of myself. I am 28 years old with a High School Diploma, a Degree and a Certificate in Computer Aided Drafting and Design (CADD), and my grades were on Honor Roll throughout, and I made the Dean's List at Piedmont Virginia Community College.
Are you currently self-sufficient? Do you have a job? Are you living on your own?
We highly implore you to get a caretaker if you answered no to any of these questions. We can assist you in finding one.
Asperger's and Autism are in the same spectrum of disorders, the severity of Autism is the only difference. You say you have high-functioning Autism which is the same as Asperger's, there is no reason to hate a name.
