June was the sixth month of 2014. The month saw Chris's increasingly desperate attempts to sell a new piece of Sonichu artwork. Chris appeared to be in dire need of $1,000, so that he and his mother could "make a living." He made seven attempts to sell it on eBay, only for it to get removed each time for TOS violations; he earned two temporary bans for this reason. The GAMe PLACe also went out of business during the month. Chris would also begin posting about his anger towards Sonic the Hedgehog's arm color being changed from tan to blue in the Sonic Boom video games and TV show.
Events of June
1 June - Chris puts up an auction on Ebay for an Original Sonichu and Rosechu Drawing. He announces this on Facebook. The auction is soon taken down after receiving over $10,000 in troll bids.
2 June
The Original Sonichu and Rosechu Drawing is put back up on Ebay. He adds some information, including a different black-and-white picture of the drawing, a closeup of his signature, a closeup of Rosechu's crotch, and an alleged copyright page. Bidding reaches $15,000.
On Facebook, it is revealed that Chris is confused about why the auction had been taken down.
3 June - Chris takes down the listing yet again, only to replace it with an identical one. He also makes a Facebook post asserting its authenticity.
4 June
A scant four days after the creation of the Original Sonichu and Rosechu Drawing, Chris accepts the "Best Offer" for his artwork. The dollar amount he agrees to receive is $1,000, lower than the $2,500 he was initially requesting. He rages about the stress this is causing him on Facebook.
Chris completes a commissioned drawing of Rosechu and some recolor.
5 June - Chris puts up yet another eBay listing for the Original Sonichu and Rosechu Drawing, because the person who agreed to buy it backed out. He complains again on Facebook.
8 June - Chris relists the drawing on eBay and appears to be getting even more desperate to sell it. Later that day, it is again taken down, and Chris has his selling privileges revoked for three days.

10 June - Chris thanks a friend for a Lego gift.
12 June - Chris relists the drawing again.
13 June - It gets taken down again, and Chris gets another three day ban. He makes a Facebook post saying that he'll sell it to the first person who sends him $1,000, and that if no one sends that to him, he will relist it after his ban expires.
