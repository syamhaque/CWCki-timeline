================================================================================

Vanessa AIM Chat 8 is the eighth (incomplete) chat between Chris and Joshua Martinez, an old acquaintance pretending to be Vanessa Hudgens. It took place on 27 April 2009.
Summary
Chris and Vanessa talk about their failed meeting. Chris thinks he saw Vanessa but didn't approach, just shouted her name from afar. He had to sneak out so that Snorlax didn't know where he was going; apparently she doesn't like Josh, and she wouldn't let him take the car. Chris tries to persuade Vanessa to report Clyde Cash to the police.

ChrisChanSonichu (11:08:25 PM): I noticed your pink/white backpack.
ChrisChanSonichu (11:08:41 PM): I was dumb for not getting up and approaching you; I thought shouting "Vanessa" would be enough to strike up attention.

ChrisChanSonichu (12:11:08 AM): actually, I can't, because of my mother's recent emotions, she doesn't want me to take the car today.
ChrisChanSonichu (12:11:28 AM): I have to respect her wishes.
Joshua (12:11:43 AM): ok

[text missing]
