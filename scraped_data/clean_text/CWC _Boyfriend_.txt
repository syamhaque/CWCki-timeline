================================================================================

He's the motherfucking Prince, man.
CWC "Boyfriend" is a music video "addressed to the WOMEN ONLY" and uploaded by Chris on 25 July 2009. While he was forced to make the video by Jack Thaddeus, he used the opportunity to push his own homophobic agenda. This video features a little bit of everything when it comes to Chris's bizarre behavior, including dancing like a retard, playing the Gitar of Fail and other such devices, and a side order of gay bashing. He even goes as far to condemn the lifestyle of lesbians (let that sink in a little). Paper cut-outs are used to display Chris's delusions, as well as several recycled drawings.
The video description and annotations reveal that Chris believed that Ivy killed herself as a result of the cessation in their communications. He blames Bob for breaking up their relationship — apparently, despite the best efforts of his father and others to reason with him, Chris chose to cling to the delusion that Ivy was not a troll. At that point in the video description Chris also states that "Ivy killed herself on July 2008", months before Chris ever met her, although this is more than likely just a mistake. At around 2:05, astute video game fans may notice that Chris-Chan purchased the universally panned, all-around shitty Rock Band ripoff Rock Revolution (though considering his spending habits, this shouldn't be a shock).
On 29 July 2009, The CWCville Library uploaded an alternate version of the video, with Chris just dancing and different lyrics.
This video is notable for introducing the world to Jessie Ruddy, who is never mentioned by Chris outside of this video.
In March 2010 Chris would also use an extract from this video as part of a desperate plea to the Wallflower to relieve him of his terrible burden.

Description
Not only a fulfillment to a blackmail, but Also a Memorial Music Video.
Miss. Ivy O'Niel died July, 2008 in suicide from being restricted from Communication, as well as coming to visit me. She was a honest, sweet woman.
May this video always be a commerative memorial for her always. And to Mr. O'Niel, I salute your bravery on the Police, although my Detective could not find you on any Precint records, and I offer my deepest condolences for your loss, as I feel it terribly myself.
I had to listen to my Meatheaded Father's Scooby-Doo Detective jargon, as well as the Real Detective's jazz.
Ivy, I'm sorry for believing my father's crackpot theory and letting it baffle me and my heart. Please forgive me, and rest in peace.
I will always have the place for you in my heart.
**Also, to clearify:
Woman #1 is Megan Schroeder.
Then Ivy's Memorial
Woman #2 is Blanca Wiess; Blanca is with a friend in the Lesbian Pic; do not who that girl was.
Woman #3 is Jessie Ruddy
Woman #4, or B&W Picture Woman is Mary Lee Walsh.
**Spiney Norman; Go after Howard and his Pickle-Suited Cult.**
"Dinsdale!"
Woman #5 is PICTURE ONLY of WHO was supposed to be Julie Milvana.

A preview
A preview for CWC "Boyfriend" was uploaded by Chris on 20 July 2009. Chris then deleted the video in a matter of hours, leading to serious doubts about the probability of the promised video appearing. Yet, true to his word, the video did arrive five days later, much to everybody's surprise.
