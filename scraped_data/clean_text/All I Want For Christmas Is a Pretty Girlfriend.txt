Hello. My name is, uh, Christian Chandler. Age 22 at this time. I will be 23 on February 24, 2005. Anyway, for, uh, over a year now I've, uh, being trying to attract an 18 to 22-year-old boyfriend-free girl, 18 to 21 before February 24, 2004, which is this year. Anyhoo, been trying for over a year to attract a girl, boyfriend-free girl, and I have failed.
[sits down]
And, you know, when you get -- when you have so much -- so many failures in this time... you can't help but feel sad, you know? [begins to pet a stuffed cat sitting on the pillow] And depressed... and here it is about Christmastime, and... well, all I want for Christmas is a boyfriend-free girl. And of course, uh, during the time, I have uh, been, uh, trying... I have written a few songs about my, uh, love quest. And so, for now -- for now, I'd like to sing to you my, uh -- two of my, two of my songs. First one I'm gonna sing is one I've uh, made up first -- written my own lyrics to and t-- turned it into a song.
By the way, this here is Sonichu. You can look him up on the web. It's my website. Just put in S-O-N-I-C-H-U as your web search term.
Anyway, here's my first song called "So Need a Cute Girl."
[sung over The Backstreet Boys' "I Want It That Way"]
Hey, look at me!
I'm standing here sad and lonely!
Without a fire,
But a desire
To not hear you say,
"I have a boyfriend!"
As I see da ladies walking
Along one by one,
I never wanna hear,
"I have a boyfriend!"
Tell me why
I'm stuck in a sad lonely cage!
Tell me why
I so need a cute girl my age!
Tell me why
I ain't ever wanna hear you say,
"I have a boyfriend!"
And I'm not too happy
And I am lonely
So that's why
I need a girlfriend!
Tell me why
I'm stuck in a sad lonely cage!
(Tell me why)
I so need a cute girl my age!
(Tell me why)
I really mean it when I say,
"I need a girlfriend!"
Why do all of the jerks
Take all the pretty women?
You may not notice,
But you should know
That I am a lonesome heart!
And I have no fire,
But a desire
To not, to not, to not
Heeeaaar…
Stuck as a virgin with rage!
So need a cute girl my age!
I never wanna hear you say,
"I have a boyfriend!"
Tell me why
I'm stuck in a sad lonely cage!
(Tell me why)
I so need a cute girl my age!
(Tell me why)
I ain't ever wanna hear you say,
"I have a boyfriend!"
Tell me why
I'm stuck in a sad lonely cage!
I so need a cute girl my age!
Tell me why
I ain’t ever wanna hear you say,
"I have a boyfriend!"
Cuz I need a girlfriend!
The next song..."All I Want for Christmas is a Pretty Girlfriend".
[sung over "All I Want For Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth"]
All I want for Christmas is a pretty girlfriend!
A pretty girlfriend! A pretty girlfriend!
All I want for Christmas is a pretty girlfriend,
So that I can be much happier!
All I want for… [pauses to wipe brow] is a girlfriend,
But she has to be 18 to 22!
And she must be boyfriend-freeee, too!
Uh, for all the qualities, check out my profile on match.com!
All I want for Christmas is a pretty girlfriend!
A pretty girlfriend! A pretty girlfriend!
All I want for Christmas is a pretty girlfriend,
So that I won't be so lonely!
Oh, the boyfriend-free factor is so high!
How many boyfriends are paired up with a girl?
You can't tell how many—what the girlfriends are paired up or not,
Which is the reason why I cannot approach women!
All I want for Christmas is a pretty girlfriend!
A pretty girlfriend! A pretty girlfriend!
All I want for Christmas is a pretty girlfriend,
Now and forever-mooorrre!
[after completing his own lyrics, turns it off] Well, at this time of year, all I can say right now is, that I hope Santa will comply with my request and bring me a pretty girlfriend. And so, happy holidays, from me, Christian Chandler--by the way, you can call me Chris...in public--and, thank you.
