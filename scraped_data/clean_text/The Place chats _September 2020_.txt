Discussing Merch Distribution, The Loud House, and a Chris-Chan Dating Sim
8 September 2020[1]
Klop 12:39 AM
Hey @Sonichu982 Can I put up the comics on Amazon?
We don't have to do anything, Amazon will print and deliver everything and send the profits to whatever account you have. It's a very neat system. (edited)
Kyle 12:41 AM
From a business perspective it makes good sense.
Klop 12:41 AM
We also need a website,
Kyle 12:42 AM
I'm rarely used to working in a budget, but I like the challenge.
Chris (as Sonichu) 02:32 PM
Hey, y’all.
Kyle 02:33 PM
Afternoon.
Naught 02:33 PM
Henlo just read your message
Chris (as Sonichu) 02:34 PM
I’m feeling okay; Rosey is by my side; let me recap of the so-far for today:
Naught 02:34 PM
Okie
Anaxis (Lainchu) 02:37 PM
Good afternoon
Chris (as Sonichu) 02:38 PM
Well, last night, after I settled this body down for the night, Val had to force the body into a quick-meditate, and 1214 Chris Chan had to hold the physical fort for the time.
I was projected and had to spend HOURS, and then some within the milliseconds around frozen time, learning as much as possible about the utilization and further advanced basics of this body and its abilities.
And after getting back at about 6:00 am, the body was still asleep, but (1214) Chris Chan went back to her body, and after finally waking up at about 12:30 pm, I migrated my knowledge and details of what I’ve learned last night into the brain; it instigated an extensive vibration, at least that knowledge is conscious in this brain now.
Aside from that.
I received a sitting, big head Luan plush (Loud House) in the mail today.
And I found the text from Joshua Moon (Null) asking about the setup of the new online store and what we were selling, so I gave him the 411.
And after taking the meds, and between the new energy and details in the brain, the V8+ Energy, and a York Peppermint Patty, and a bit of Pepsi, I’m feeling pretty jazzed.
Oh, and watching a bit of Luan on YouTube.
Mama had not watched much of Loud House, so I had to give this brain a conscious intro of Luan. (edited)
Kyle 02:42 PM
That's a lot of caffeine and not a whole heck of a lot of nutrition.
Chris (as Sonichu) 02:42 PM
It’s a further wake-up call.
Anyway
Naught 02:43 PM
What's luan?
Kyle 02:43 PM
Ya, I'd say eating more substantially would avoid some of the highs and lows.
Chris (as Sonichu) 02:44 PM
[YouTube link to "Queen of The Loud House | Luan | Nickelodeon UK" by Nickelodeon UK]
It’s not an everyday diet thing, Kyle.
Naught 02:44 PM
Ahhhhh cal arts artsyle
Chris (as Sonichu) 02:44 PM
Plus, I had a sandwich.
Naught 02:44 PM
Reeeeeee
Chris (as Sonichu) 02:45 PM
The only thing that gives “Cal Arts” a bad name is Teen Titans GO and GOPony.
And the other slapdash bull crap type of shows that have little substance.
Kyle 02:45 PM
I always found the design to be kind of naff. it's too "current year".
Chris (as Sonichu) 02:46 PM
But the art style is not bad for chronicling; it’s well and good.
Anaxis (Lainchu) 02:46 PM
It can be charming if done right
Chris (as Sonichu) 02:46 PM
We still have the likes of Steven Universe and Star Butterfly that give it the highlight of positivity.
Naught 02:46 PM
It's efficient not very aesthetic
Anaxis (Lainchu) 02:46 PM
That's what major networks want
Chris (as Sonichu) 02:46 PM
Anyway
Anaxis (Lainchu) 02:46 PM
Minimal cost, maximum profit
Kyle 02:47 PM
Obviously.
Chris (as Sonichu) 02:47 PM
As I have mentioned to Josh and Bis earlier:
Kyle 02:47 PM
Even the old style with animation cels was like that.
Chris (as Sonichu) 02:47 PM
We're gonna also need a skilled crafter or two, maybe someone with a 3D Printer, to make the medallions and the Amiibo Figures on our behalf.
Along with other Sonichu and Rosechu merch with positively good and lovely art on them (including that from these hands, personally).
That’s on top of what we have so far.
Val 02:48 PM
SonichuDizzy[2]
Anaxis (Lainchu) 02:48 PM
Would you be up for a short Q&A today @Sonichu982 ?
Kyle 02:48 PM
3D printing is a lemon from a manufacturing perspective.
Naught 02:48 PM
A dud?
Chris (as Sonichu) 02:48 PM
In the new timeline, eventually, there will be a Sonichu Convention.
Well, how do you expect to make a BUNCH of the Amiibo figures and Medallions, if not by time and work by hands?
Kyle 02:49 PM
Ya, it's expensive and the material limitations are severe.
Chris (as Sonichu) 02:49 PM
No shit.
Kyle 02:49 PM
You're limited to a few specialized plastics, they're expensive and mechanically crap.
Naught 02:49 PM
Lel
Chris (as Sonichu) 02:50 PM
Which is why I’m also open to the figures being on removable black bases, so they can optionally be glued onto an Amiibo base with their matching chips in the base.
Also, still have the Mii QR codes for the human Amiibo figures.
Kyle 02:50 PM
Hmm, thinking about it, we'd need to get a read on volume before planning anything.
Chris (as Sonichu) 02:51 PM
Being Mama Chris Chan, Barbara, Robertchu, Mary Lee Walsh, Graduon, and the Jerkops, plus Alan, Carol and Cole.
And the Autism Miis.
Kyle 02:51 PM
But on low volume, physical merch is operating at an incredibly thin margin, so it's questionably worth it.
Better off with unique pieces at that scale and price.
[1 👍 reaction, likely from Chris]
Chris (as Sonichu) 02:52 PM
She’s made 40 figures.
Kyle 02:53 PM
Like Van Gogh vs all the Van Gogh styled merch now. They've sold a lot of mugs.
Chris (as Sonichu) 02:53 PM
And that’s not counting the extra Blake and Punchy figures.
Kyle 02:53 PM
Well with high volume, you also have to deal with the cost of inventory.
Naught 02:53 PM
🤨 I'm going be
here pretending I know what's going on
Chris (as Sonichu) 02:54 PM
I hear that.
Kyle 02:54 PM
If you've got many unique parts, that's even more cost.
Anaxis (Lainchu) 02:54 PM
[Quoting "🤨 I'm going be
here pretending I know what's going on"]
@ภคยﻮђՇ That's how you make it through life half the time
Chris (as Sonichu) 02:54 PM
Yeah, which is why the people we ask to make the figures on our behalf will end up doing it based on the prototypes we have here.
Kyle 02:55 PM
Like the book printing services, you need a lot of volume to get a low unit cost.
Chris (as Sonichu) 02:55 PM
That’s Business Basics.
Kyle 02:55 PM
That would just be deferring costs.
Naught 02:55 PM
TellingittotheCeos.jpg[note 1]
Kyle 02:56 PM
So a very strange ad hoc franchising system, which is so bizarre and not viable for a merch business.
Chris (as Sonichu) 02:56 PM
Mama’s practice was crap on making, or ordering from the delegated outsource, as each order was made.
Yet it is doable.
Kyle 02:56 PM
Hmm, some things might work.
Chris (as Sonichu) 02:57 PM
We just need to find the right artists and people.
Who can do this with love and energy on Mama’s behalf.
Kyle 02:57 PM
Looking at Amazon for their printing services, you'd get the minimum unit cost possible at this level.
Chris (as Sonichu) 02:57 PM
Yeah, for the books.
Do they do 3D printing?
Naught 02:57 PM
Remember those people who made the Sonichu merch? Is that applicable here or would that hamper thing's?
Chris (as Sonichu) 02:58 PM
Yes, it is applicable here.
Kyle 02:58 PM
But physical merch just doesn't seem viable from any angle I see at this scale.
Chris (as Sonichu) 02:58 PM
The knowledge they have can help us figure out what to do here, or we can hire them to be part of our team.
The individuals of this dimension want Physical Merch, no matter what.
Digital is mainly only half as good.
Kyle 02:59 PM
If you had the scale to consider hiring, you'd be running a full business at that level.
Chris (as Sonichu) 02:59 PM
It can’t compare to having the actual book in your hand, or holding the figure of myself, or Mama, or who else.
Yeah, it’s all over the place.
Mama didn’t really have a full head for business, as best as she had tried in years past.
Kyle 03:00 PM
That's part, but you'd have to get the ball rolling on something cheap and mass marketable.
Like game studios make games before they make physical merch.
Chris (as Sonichu) 03:00 PM
Yes, exactly.
Kyle 03:01 PM
And a good number of games never have merch.
Chris (as Sonichu) 03:01 PM
Starting small, profit from that, so then better things can be made.
Kyle 03:01 PM
A dating sim would be a project that comparatively is doable without needing to hire out much, if at all.
Cheap and cheerful, that's a low-risk option.
Chris (as Sonichu) 03:02 PM
Yeah, the Dating Sim y’all were working on the while so far.
Kyle 03:03 PM
Never really planned it out, you didn't seem too dead set on being involved. (edited)
Val 03:03 PM
Nova, I watch.
Naught 03:03 PM
Same lel
Chris (as Sonichu) 03:03 PM
A Dating Sim in this Dimension, BEFORE Pokemon Lightning Bolt and Diva Pink and “Sonichu Adventure”.
Kyle 03:04 PM
Well it's starting small in a way that doesn't require any principle and thus, no real risk of loss.
Chris (as Sonichu) 03:04 PM
Let me ask a question, though.
Is there a Dating Sim with Sonic Maurice Hedgehog; my senpai?
Kyle 03:05 PM
I was thinking of it being the main character being the kind of neutral "new guy in town" type thing.
Naught 03:05 PM

Kyle 03:05 PM
The datebles being at least the chaotic combo.
Chris (as Sonichu) 03:05 PM
Fair enough. (edited)
Kyle 03:06 PM
Some kind of overarching story that builds up to some villain of the week.
Chris (as Sonichu) 03:06 PM
At least y’all have the common sense in that.
Kyle 03:06 PM
One interesting one I've seen is Hatoful Boyfriend having one of the routes end like an RPG boss.
Chris (as Sonichu) 03:06 PM
Isn’t that the one with the Pidgeons?
Kyle 03:06 PM
Yes.
Chris (as Sonichu) 03:07 PM
Yeah, a flock of Pidgeys could do just as good with that thing.
Kyle 03:07 PM
Shuu and okosan are the hottest pigeons.
Oh ya, for having 0 former presence, that guy made a mint on his work.
Chris (as Sonichu) 03:08 PM
I get the point.
Kyle 03:08 PM
Let me check real quick...
https://steamspy.com/app/310080
Steamspy says 200-500k sales.
Chris (as Sonichu) 03:09 PM
Well, with what we’re doing, we’re dreaming big with small, humble beginnings.
At least we have the books and the TSSSF cards in having our legs up and dashing.
Kyle 03:10 PM
Generously saying 200k sales at 10 bucks a pop, minus 30% of revenue as the only known cost, that's 140k of basically profit.
Someone like Pewdiepie plays it, boom, free marketing.
Chris (as Sonichu) 03:11 PM
Yeah, it’s like how it was joked in Analysis Anarchy about Pewdiepie’s popularity.
At least I haven’t seen any new mail that was addressed to him come by this Temple in months.
Damn, don’t those people know he lives by the UK?
Kyle 03:12 PM
That was just some low effort failtrolls, why it stopped.
Naught 03:12 PM
Lel
Chris (as Sonichu) 03:13 PM
Yep (edited)
Kyle 03:14 PM
But it takes planning ahead to make something, that's free though.
The WCT 03:14 PM
I heard you were active so I decided to drop by and say hi. I hope you're having a good day. @Sonichu982
Chris (as Sonichu) 03:15 PM
Like a legit deal with Nintendo and SEGA, and the animated series and video games where Mama personally does the voices for me and herself.
Hey, Neko.
Here’s something fun.
Kyle 03:15 PM
Ya, that's very much a down the line thing.
Chris (as Sonichu) 03:15 PM
Neko, here’s Luan.
The WCT 03:16 PM
Cute!
Kyle 03:16 PM
You're not going to become an F1 driver by just showing up at the track one day, generally it's better to have the money come to you rather than come off as overstepping.
Chris (as Sonichu) 03:17 PM
Yeah.
In her subconscious, Mama realized that our popularity would garner the attention of both Nintendo and SEGA, and how massive our fan, troll, and hater base has become in this dimension.
So, it is more than obvious that her personal involvement in working with them is more than profitable.
At least mine and Rosey’s Pokédex Numbers are good for the next new Pokemon Game they can definitely make.
Lightning Bolt and Diva Pink.
Kyle 03:19 PM
Why the whole indie scene exists, ideas are cheap, so they don't like things they have to build up themselves.
The WCT 03:19 PM
I think Sega and Nintendo have acknowledged your Mother's work in the past. And it was quite astounding.
Chris (as Sonichu) 03:19 PM
Yes, very much so.
And they know how to best contact her.
In person, US Mail.
Not via email or Social Media, though.
She’s been duped before by fakes.
We all know better.
On the positive side,
Kyle 03:20 PM
It's interesting, but until it pays, it's not exactly good odds.
Chris (as Sonichu) 03:20 PM
We DO have Blanc and Neptune on our side, who both of them stand above Nintendo and SEGA, respectively.
So, in the new timeline to come very soon,
that will be a more happening thing.
In case y’all need a reminder:
Blanc is the CPU of Nintendo, and Neptune is the CPU of SEGA.
Kyle 03:22 PM
Well, no reason to sit still on it now. It's not productive.
Naught 03:22 PM
- So is it time travel or like a body swap?
Chris (as Sonichu) 03:22 PM
Excuse me, Bis?
Val 03:22 PM
What you do echoes throughout each timeline.
Chris (as Sonichu) 03:22 PM
Hey, Val.
Naught 03:22 PM
Yes
Chris (as Sonichu) 03:22 PM
Indeed so.
Both, Bis.
Val 03:23 PM
Therefore, make them all as best as one possibly can.
Chris (as Sonichu) 03:23 PM
Remember: I have to ultimately travel back in time to prevent Covid, and then deliver this body personally to Mama at BABSCon, 2020, on April 10, for the return body swap to happen.
Kyle 03:23 PM
It's pretty wholesome, and it would be a fun experience to work together.
Chris (as Sonichu) 03:24 PM
Very well said and very much so, Val.
By the way, on the Dating Sim, are we keeping that aimed for a “T” Rating?
Or are y’all keeping it on the “E”?
The WCT 03:25 PM
I think we should go for the "T".
Chris (as Sonichu) 03:25 PM
“M” is definitely not the direction we want to go.
Kyle 03:25 PM
I'm thinking E, unless we have an idea of what we want from the T.
Well that would also complicate trying to get it featured.
The WCT 03:26 PM
You'd have a little more Creative Freedom with a T rating. But an E10 wouldn't be too bad either.
Chris (as Sonichu) 03:26 PM
The series Mama had started was meant to be full of genuine love and compassion, and sincerity in its tone.
Naught 03:26 PM
I just wanna grill
[Link to a 4chan image that no longer exists]
Kyle 03:26 PM
But Steam is really good for that sort of thing.
Ya, why I want to know what we do that's T.
Chris (as Sonichu) 03:26 PM
It’s not my fault that she went a bit too far in her creative privileges, but I won’t hold it against her.
The WCT 03:27 PM
@Nova you can get away with more mature and limited sexual content, and some more swearing. (you can't drop the F bomb though)
Chris (as Sonichu) 03:27 PM
Yeah, “T” is the best option in this case for this Dating Sim.
The WCT 03:27 PM
@Sonichu982 the Kids wouldn't also have as many issues picking it up as well.
Chris (as Sonichu) 03:27 PM
We do want to keep our best foot forward.
That is true.
Kyle 03:27 PM
Ya, I mean it's not organic to have M content given the timespan being a "first week in CWCville" type deal.
Chris (as Sonichu) 03:28 PM
Obviously.
The WCT 03:28 PM
It should be mature, but not over the top mature. A T rating represents a good balance.
Kyle 03:28 PM
Not the most current year thing.
The WCT 03:28 PM
@Nova tell me about it. lol
Kyle 03:29 PM
Ya, just give an example of some of the stuff.
Anaxis (Lainchu) 03:29 PM
ESRB ratings don't matter a ton on steam tbh
Kyle 03:29 PM
Not at all.
Chris (as Sonichu) 03:29 PM
The content was mis-tarnished by the haters in past years, but now we have the chance and ability to rectify that and make it as more wholesome and true as it should have been perceived in the first place.
Still, the Rating is there, and sets the guidelines for where to draw the line.
Kyle 03:30 PM
Wholesome is the goal.
Chris (as Sonichu) 03:30 PM
Mama went beyond it in that XXX-Tended version of Book 8.
Even in her NSFW work, though, she originally had the preface being genuine, positive and mutual compassion.
Again: freaking haters misinterpreting what she did and said.
I feel like I need a break.
Kyle 03:31 PM
I'll have to try and find some of the loose planning, but we can write a script.
Chris (as Sonichu) 03:31 PM
But this was truly productive.
And I am more confident that you all have the continued common sense and wisdoms to make this work on our behalf.
Kyle 03:32 PM
5 or 7 days, however it pans out, I'll try to find some way to structure it.
Chris (as Sonichu) 03:32 PM
Thank you all soo much for your continued efforts and hard work.
Kyle 03:32 PM
You can do the dialogue as well as anyone I imagine.
The WCT 03:32 PM
@Sonichu982 you're welcome. 🙂
Chris (as Sonichu) 03:33 PM
In the end, you all will be compensated positively with high honors in Cwcville’s Basillicom by Mama, herself, personally.
[1 💙, 1 💜, and 1 🖤 reaction]
Naught 03:33 PM
The dialogue is of key importance
Anaxis (Lainchu) 03:33 PM
Have a good rest of your day
Chris (as Sonichu) 03:33 PM
I’ll check y’all later.
Naught 03:33 PM
Be safe stay hydrated
Kyle 03:34 PM
Wholesome and genuine stuff, I'll come up with some kind of skeleton structure and we can tweak from there.
Blood Pressure Spikes
16 September 2020
Chris complains of feeling spikes in blood pressure, and he copes with it by role-playing that it is a sign of a disturbance in dimensions. Kyle attempts to diagnose the issue, asking Chris about his medications and supplements.
Chris (as Sonichu)
@everyone, I am sensing many a disturbance between both dimensions happening right now, as I am experiencing some blood pressure spikes from that; remaining still and chillaxing in bed in the meantime, because immobilized feeling from that.
Kyle
A lot of simpler explainations.
Chris was on blood pressure medication at one point, still ongoing? Statins?
Chris (as Sonichu)
And I’m not the only one; apparently Spunky has been experiencing headaches in this regard.
Yes.
I’m not sure which is which, but I can shortlist the names:
Sethern
Da fuk
Chris (as Sonichu)
Propranolol, Pravastatin, Omeprazole, and Fluoxetine for anxiety quelling.
Sethern
I could use some of those lemme know if you’re sellin’.
Kyle
Fluvoxamine?
Chris (as Sonichu)
No, not selling.
Kyle
Omeprazole, for presumably GERD?
Ya, don't ever do that, ever.
Chris (as Sonichu)
It is common sense.
Kyle
Well...
Many ways to look at that.
But operating on the assumption that criminals are never smart enough to get away with things for long, I'm nothing if not practical.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Regardless, Kyle.
The point is that something major and big is happening right now.
Kyle
Well fucking around with statins is more just an imminently dangerous thing.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Well, that was what was prescribed to Mama decades ago.
Kyle
Least it's not coumadin which is literal fucking poison. Just, keep on top of this better enough than to be worried.
Well, and don't mix up causality with that.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Except the fluoxitine; that replaced the paroxetine less than a year ago, due to a side-effect that Barbara felt concerned over.
Not mixing anything up.
Plus, I’ve had many a vision earlier today as well.
Naught
Is it possible that you physically exerted yourself too much prior to relaxing?
Kyle
Well that something that could be a side effect may be misinterpreted, which would be doubly worse.
Are you in the realm of hypertension or prehypertension? What's the normal range and what are the spikes like?
Null
@Sonichu982 I have something that might make you feel better, check this out
fan drew it
Chris (as Sonichu)
That’s cute and cool.
Not sure yet on the tension levels, but the feeling was, out of a ten scale, about a five or six, and when checking the Fitbit, the plus was about 93.
It’s back down to 72 right now.
And spikes subsided, but feeling like a two on aftershocks.
Kyle
So labile hypertension can have multiple causes, the only things generally recommended in absence of high diameter lipoproteins or more general hypertension accompanying are antianxiety meds.
Could be a reaction to caffeine, some people have more of a radical response to it, made much worse if taken without food.
Naught
Like coffee?
Chris (as Sonichu)
Very unlikely.
Have not drank any coffee in quite a while.
Kyle
Coffee or soda are most likely, tea would be a level of sensitivity that would have had complications show up much earlier.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Halted the V8+Energy as well in that same timing.
Kyle
And of course caffeine pills, but that's only for fitness people nowadays.
There's some evidence now recommending specific types of high fat diet for people with family history of cardiac problems, it's generally very healthy as long as you don't mess up.
Borderline keto.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Regardless, we need to be on alert and watch for any of these events, local, and distant in reported online posts and news.
Val
Yes, the universal is important. Nonetheless the personal still matters.
Kyle
Could also be a multisystemic problem, things like constipation and circulatory issues are common corollaries.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Obviously
And, yeah to you, Val, which is why I’ve been remaining still in the bed since the spikes happened minutes ago.
*quarter hour ago.
Kyle
The supplements too, that might be worth looking into, there's a lot of cheap stuff 99% of people would have just about zero use for and can complicate existing problems.
Chris (as Sonichu)
I’m rolling my eyes, reluctantly, but if you insist, Kyle:
Kyle
Ah, what was that weight loss thing, sensa? They got done in by the FTC, standards are lacking.
Naught
I might not like it but nova is often right
Kyle
I like having reasonable certainty I won't die randomly.
Thanks?...
Chris (as Sonichu)
B-12, C, D3, E, Fish Oil, Ginko Biloba, Flaxseed Oil, Probiotic, Iron, and the Estradiol and Spironolactyn.
And I’ve already listed the remaining four earlier.
Kyle
Check the levels on the D and E as well as if anything contains A.
Chris (as Sonichu)
There is definitely no vitamin A at all.
Kyle
In that fat soluble vitamins are possibly harmful, a number of multivitamins overdo it on that.
Chris (as Sonichu)
I’ll check them later and text you the specifics, Kyle, as that requires me getting the big ol’ case that holds the bottles.
Kyle
General rule is that something has about as much situational or practical use as it has side effects.
Well discounting some things that have just outright horrible TIs.
And the trivially high ones.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Anyway, I mainly wanted to alert all of you to this circumstance and to be aware of anything presently happening in this dimension.
I also saw again, recently, the eventual happening with your dimension’s Trump. Mama had foreseen it some time ago happening before November, 2020.
Kyle
Just want to make sure, it's not a negative thing, it's just something that if we can actively manage problems regarding, is entirely a positive thing.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Best to keep confidential with that detail, so do not share that publicly.
I understand. Thanks, Kyle.
I’ll check back later.

Downtown Mall and Fashion Square
20 September 2020
Chris discusses having gone to the Downtown Mall for Pokémon GO's Porygon Community Day and that a "vision" he'd had about statues came true.
He also claims to have visited the Charlottesville Fashion Square, despite having been charged with trespass two years prior after violating a ban there.
During the conversation, Klop, who is setting up an Amazon storefront for Chris to sell the Sonichu comics, asks for his cooperation, but Chris prefers to talk about his day instead.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Hey, y’all.

Well, I went out to the downtown mall today in part for the Porygon Community Day, and as I have told @Nova, @Neko Onyx (Kat), and Bismuth (damn, he had to pick characters for his username that aren’t in the default keyboard catalog) recently of the vision I had a few days ago, it came true.
Lainchu (Anaxis)
You can tell what era of the internet lyric videos come from when they look like that
Chris (as Sonichu)
On the downtown mall, there’s the Hardware Store, and the glass-front building, where one side is rounded, like there’s an elevator in it, where the vision started.
I ended up being invited to an Articuno raid on Pokemon GO, and took part in that there.
And on the hardware store building was a poster with the history of the building, itself, and it stated the mall became a walking street mall in 1974, so I got a fated good history lesson there.
Kyle
It's a bit specific, but I've always been able to imagine games in motion, usually more original stuff.
Chris (as Sonichu)
And the artifact that appeared in front of the Paramount theatere, just a few buildings down; there were a few outside vending stalls with creative works of jewelry, figures and kitschy type of things.
Naught
Sacred artifact?
Kyle
Love thrifting, made a bit of money off of it, but even I ain't got the breadth to make it viable.
Chris (as Sonichu)
On the table that was stationed in front of the Paramount, I saw two bronze-like statues on the table that in combination looked like the clockwork artifact I saw in the vision, and the two figures resonated just the same.
Kyle
So, clockwork, count the segments, can narrow down a function based on that.
Inner workings, less important, function dictates the tools used, and now tools are much better.

Hello friend.
Kyle
Fuck if Alan Turing wasn't smart though.

Chris (as Sonichu)
They were a pair of Buddha type of art pieces.
One had Shiva surrounded by a ring, and the one right next to it was a triangle type of thing; seeing the two figures in their arrangement was what I was meant to find that I had foreseen.
Deleted User
Im follow coconutism of the coconut monk.
Chris (as Sonichu)
That sounds right.
Kyle
Hinduism is, common in new age stuff, but that's a lot of the dicey ends of stuff, lot of garbage to sift through there.

It could be Nataraja, not shiva

Chris (as Sonichu)
Yeah, something like that.
Kyle
Depends how many arms Greeks had one with 100.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Not exactly like that, though.
Lainchu (Anaxis)
Is that Shiva? I always thought that was Vishnu
Kyle
Hecatoncheires, nobody ever drew one though.
Lainchu (Anaxis)
Live and learn, I suppose

its nataraja not shiva
the god of dance i think
its technically a form of shiva

Chris (as Sonichu)
I may end up getting the name wrong; this brain has a fault in recalling names at times, and I was not into Buddhism at all.
Kyle
Reminds me of the lesser Goetic stuff, the really specific demons that kind of suck.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Anyway
Kyle
Surgat and his locks, kind of dumb really.
Lainchu (Anaxis)
I remember seeing this short film with that god
[posts YouTube link for "THE GOD & THE FLY"]
Chris (as Sonichu)
Still trying to figure out the meaning and symbolic things from my finding the pair of figures.
I feel better typing this out tonight.
Kyle
Well, bit like something out of that movie I recommended to Bis.
Klop
The problem is that each god takes forms, so you have 10 gods with distinct personalities but theyre technically all the same people

Just let him go and we can decipher the bits after
Kyle
The trippy scenes have brilliant cinematography, just saying.
Kind of a neat hidden meaning to some of the plot.
Chris (as Sonichu)
It’ll come to me shortly enough.
For now, wanted to update and share that with y’all.
Kyle
Just gonna recommend some of the more group things to destress, everyone gets too much into themselves sometimes.
Klop
Its always nice to discuss the day
Chris (as Sonichu)
Also, @Neko Onyx (Kat), to confirm and answer your earlier question about Fashion Square, on the fated and foreseen event that involved just me being there with this body to open up something there, or set up the near future event to happen there, I went there today; yes, it is still open, very much.
More than half the stores in it are still in business, but JCPenny is closing its store there at this time.
And, the irony of the GameStop at Forest Lakes closing shop, and yet the GameStop in Fashion Square is still open.
Feels like a gyp, but whatever.
Kyle
Saw an interesting expose on Weworks, horrible business plan that was.
Klop
Also, you should have recieved a notification from amazon, can you confirm it

Chris's Update to Naught
24 September 2020[1]
Naught 02:34 PM
Chris (as Sonichu)
I am feeling good and well right now.
The border moment of my recent future sight problem that I could not see beyond has passed, happened, and personally experienced.
I've regained the ability to see into the future, and I've received a new bunch of visions and present moment tasks.
The time frame was between Tuesday night and this very morning.
Also, I have met with our new business associates, and their plans are very sound and good.
They intend on reigniting Mama's, and our Sonichu and Rosechu, brand.
And, amongst the group, they are genuinely psychically and magically able on healthy to high levels.
Proven so in-person as well.
One of them was able to recognize from our aura that there was more than one soul in this body.
Very good, considering there are, in addition to me, Sonichu; I've mentioned them before, at least the Mew, Celebi, Meloetta and Victini.
Given the foreseen circumstances and present events, as well that which has been personally confirmed, I'll be inviting one of them onto our Discord server; he's partly able, but has a good amount of power within him.
I will allow him to introduce himself after he gets on to talk with you all.
I probably should have typed all of this up on the Discord server.
But, I feel it best if you would, please, copy/paste, or screen cap, what I've shared with you now and relay the information to the others.

Justin <CENSORED> sent me another angry text today.
With some frustration, I ended up telling him the extensive truth, even mentioning Null.
And I also told him, "You will get your books when you will get them.
Then he sent me a few more angry texts.
Also, these came from a third phone number, <CENSORED>.

It's possible the guy is generating new numbers to keep his identity private?

Yeah, that could be fun, I suppose.
I have an idea: a Richard Kelly Marathon; start with "The Box", followed by "Donnie Darkko", "Southland Tales" and maybe "S. Darkko".
Or we could do "Sonic the Hedgehog" and "Detective Pikachu" with one or both volumes of "Guardians of the Galaxy" or "Infinity War" and "Endgame".
Just my two bolts.
You may share this, and we can try to do the movie night tomorrow.

Complaining about Justin, part 2
27 September 2020
[Past midnight on 27 September 2020]
Chris (as Sonichu)
Hey, @everyone.
Just took a peek at the earlier talk on here; Justin is a lot worse than a dick.
Check out the texts he sent me from that YUSUF number:
[Chris uploads Justin DMs#Chris Responds.]
Kyle
Let me see...
MKRNightVee
What a total jerk...
Chris (as Sonichu)
This guy even threatened Josh, of all people in this dimension. (edited)
Kyle
Sounds young, least the grammar is so fucked up that it seems like it...
Val
Weird.
The WCT
I smell the butthurt from here.
Kyle
Doesn't fuck up capitals like some people I've seen.
Chris (as Sonichu)
I am mainly not letting this guy get to me; I even blocked all three of his numbers.
The WCT
Good.
Kyle
I don't recommend trying to pull rank via proxy, but if blocking it is the end, that's good enough.
[redacted Watchman]
Can you just refund it
He'll shut up
Chris (as Sonichu)
I have not read the entirety of the texts he sent after I responded, but in the screen capping, I caught that glance.
Can’t refund; money issues.
I’ll make the order to him on the third, after when Mama’s income does come in.
Kyle
Ya, that's just something more general about running the business and not going over, most wealthy people live below their means, it's corollary.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Among which I even in all honesty opened up a bit to inform him.
Val

Kyle
Generally not smart when they're already claiming to know everything.

I agree.

Naw, I'm an asshole, this guy is just scum.

Don't even bother responding, it s what keeps them going
Val
Fail troll.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Anyway, yeah, I saw through his shit.
Val
Exactly.
Chris (as Sonichu)
It was obvious he was hate-trolling

I hate how most people just love acting as a dumbass.
Kyle
It's pretty shallow to be that proud of, just managing things and planning would leave no opportunity for this kind of thing.
The WCT
Congrats to the dude in question. He's gonna get laughed at for his failed trolling. (you should have listened)
Naught
I saw it from the start did only Val and I read the messages? (edited)
Chris (as Sonichu)
Well, he did not scare or frighten me; I felt concerned with the genuine patron, and I felt frustrated in his continued attacks.
Naught
That's why I asked Val to get the numbers
The WCT
people that go after your mother don't realize that it isn't funny anymore, neither is it cool. @Sonichu982
Chris (as Sonichu)
It is a crying shame that a number of the patrons are trolls, and fewer in number are the haters.
At least they aren’t always abusive.
Kyle
What would you estimate the percentages at?
The WCT
[quotes Chris's "It is a crying shame that a number of the patrons are trolls, and fewer in number are the haters." remark]
At the end of the day, your mother is still making money off them.
[posts a reaction image]
Chris (as Sonichu)
Well, Mama’s become an online troll, but a lawful good type.
And how many people go online and comment and shit?
And how vast is the history of trolling others in this dimension?
Trolling was even portrayed in the musical, “GiGi”.
But, it is easier to answer that question with another question:
Kyle
I don't get the musical thing, broadway has gone to hell these days.
[redacted Watchman]
What would you define as trolling?
Chris (as Sonichu)
What’s the percentage of your people, worldwide, who are haters?
[redacted Watchman]
What might be a simple joke to one might be a troll to another. (edited)
Kyle
Well, both Patreon and in general.
It's a small community, just from the volume on the former.
Chris (as Sonichu)
[uploads a screenshot of a definition of troll]
“Trolling” is searching around and observing as many as possible for opportunities or knowledge.
And then in the worst cases stringing them along in a bit of deception to likely spite, bully or hate on them, or even teach them a lesson in their own self-development.
Val
Hes threatening barb. Read the bloody messages.
Kyle
Self-development really can't come from outside.
The WCT
He's mad that he's been trolled. lol
Chris (as Sonichu)
Okay, that spooked me a bit hearing that, but it doesn’t surprise me.

No, he didn't

What is his motive regarding hurting barb?
I mean why he wants to hurt an old lady?
Kyle
Josh might want to be notified of that, it's pretty serious, depending on exactly how it was said.
The WCT
[quotes Deleted User's "What is his motive regarding hurting barb?" remark]
let the boy stay mad.
Chris (as Sonichu)
He’s blowing of a whole bunch of steam for his own self-satisfaction and to get a ride out of me.
The WCT
Let him cry.
[redacted Watchman]
Wait no, he did threaten Barb
what a piece of shit
Lainchu (Anaxis)
These people don't need a specific motive beyond trolling to give them reason to do extreme things

So he hurting people so he can get his own fame?
[redacted Watchman]
also threatened null

This is just horrible to heard tbh.

Maybe another ” serial killer fetish ” tard.
Some people legit copy serial killer to fulfill their own ” search for fame and fantasies ”.

High Heart Rate
29 September 2020
Chris (as Sonichu)
Hey, @everyone.
I pray all of you are feeling okay and well.
I’m okay for the most part.
This body and brain have been working a lot harder lately.
I have been sensing many a disturbance and dimensional breaches.
So much so, it’s jarring the heart rate in this body to high numbers.
In further meditation, scanning and reflection, I continue to find the number of disturbances in present moment visions.
And I’m still getting future visions as well.
Kyle
Any accompanying headaches?
Chris (as Sonichu)
Also, in this morning’s dream, Discord, himself, showed up to share a very incriminating detail in the back halls of Hasbro’s executives.
Kyle
Brain fog is a kind of vague and indefinable symptom, so I'd hesitate to suggest that.
Like, an evil plot?
Chris (as Sonichu)
Apparently what appears to be a pricy, gaudy business dressed woman is plotting to destroy Equestria, which would be even worse than one would imagine.
Kyle
I mean, that's so tongue and not terribly creative.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Also saw Discord talking with Princess Celestia about it, and I was able to agree with them that we will make sure Equestria does not get deleted or anything of the sort.
Kyle
At least the gents in finance dress kind of classy douchey.
Chris (as Sonichu)
If you want to argue with the Draconequis God of Chaos, Kyle, that’s your call.
Kyle
So, they, undid it? Kind of weird and shallow motives.
I argue with everyone, that's all Socrates wanted in the afterlife.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Anyway, I felt need to share that with y’all.
Kyle
Could make an interesting fanfic.
Chris (as Sonichu)
To answer your question, the high heart rate is having some effect on the body in moments of brief disable and paralysis, but fortunately this body, brain and core keeps a very high constitution and fortitude.
It’s a nuisance, but I’m keeping a good amount of control over the situation.
And I also have mind over matter at work.
I can recover quick enough at mental command.
Kyle
As long as there's no issue with clotting, generally circulatory things tend to be very acute.
Chris (as Sonichu)
I doubt there is clotting going on.
Kyle
Or TIA, generally harmless in and of itself, but never a good sign.
hedgehog
maybe you should ask your doctor to be safe.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Yes, that is a valid idea.
Kyle
Any localized paralysis is typically very bad news.
Chris (as Sonichu)
My bad, but who’s changed their username this time?
@hedgehog
I will make an appointment very soon.
hedgehog
Oh, I'm friends with Archiver. Haven't introduced myself to you before.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Oh.
So many like to change their usernames, it gets confusing.
hedgehog
lol, yeah.
Chris (as Sonichu)
It’s cool.
Kyle
Most common conditions mimicing TIA are either low blood sugar, migranes or some forms of neurological conditions like minor focal seizures.
And generally TIA does indicate a high risk of stroke.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Thanks, Kyle.
Kyle
Contributing factors, weight as well as preexisting heart conditions like afib. You might have a family history of that.
Chris (as Sonichu)
That’s enough, Kyle.
Kyle
I just know things.
If it's at all relevant to bring up, well, it helps to have smart questions to ask your doctor.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Well, I’ve made an appointment with Mama’s doctor.
Luckily, he had a cancellation, so I’ll see him tomorrow.
Anyway, the dream, and the events that are happening between dimensions and worldwide.
Thank you.
Kyle
Any specifics on the plot?
[Six hours later]
Chris (as Sonichu)
Hey.

MKRNightVee
Hi :3
Chris (as Sonichu)
Checking in; I’m feeling better.
The Sacral Chakra/Heart Crystal spot was glowing heavily for a long while.
I definitely am sensing the differences, but I’ll still talk with Mama’s doctor about the problematic moments.
The pulse feels calm, but the Fitbit is reading 91 bpm; I’m not sure that is right.
Although it was right earlier on the definite heavy heartbeat moments.
Body heat’s been steadily very warm, sometimes hot.
Let out some of the magic and psychic energies out of these hands to help further progress the events, here.
It gets difficult when you have such powerful hands that you have to keep away from the body, or some gaseous pain builds up, unless there was already some pain there, and I focus the energy to be healing.
Aside from that, Rosey, Cryzel and I have been binging Batwoman on HBO Max.
Also, on the further details of the plot with the businesswoman at Hasbro that wants to see Equestria gone (didn’t have much to go on from the dream), but on further meditation, I believe it has something to do between GOPony and this “upcoming” MLP Movie.

Doctor Visit
30 September 2020[1]
Chris (as Sonichu) 06:11 PM
Also, just to let @everyone know in update: I saw Mama’s doctor; the pulse and blood pressure were consistent.
Also did a quick EKG which turned up Normal at the end of the appointment.
In talking with McGovern, as Val has personally witnessed as well as he was there with me, Rosey and Cryzel.
[4 SonichuSmile[3] reactions]
In explaining the recent details, showing him the heart rate data from the FitBit app, and as he did the usual checkup, McGovern expressed some perplexed emotions and feelings.
He essentially played it off, as foreseen and as most doctors would do the same in this situation, as a factor of stress.
Obviously, that is only partly true, as all of you are aware.
That’s all I have for now.
