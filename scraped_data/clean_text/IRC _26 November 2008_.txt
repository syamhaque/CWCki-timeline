NOTE: Chris was not directly involved in this conversation.
In this short #sonichu chatlog from 26 November 2008, trolls discuss while PandaHalo pastes some messages from Chris. Not much new information is revealed here, other than Chris wanted to buy chocolate condoms for his first time with PandaHalo, and that just thinking about her was cause for him to mass debate furiously.
Needless to say the trolls were shocked and disgusted.
