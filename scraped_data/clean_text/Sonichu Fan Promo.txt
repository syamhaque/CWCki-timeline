Sonichu as Chris can only ever dream of
The Sonichu Fan Promos are a series of three short fan-made 3D animations about Sonichu, made by timmys1984 (frequently mislabelled as "timmy1984"). The videos were published on 11-14 October 2008. They are notable as one of the few fan works Chris has praised, though as he explains in the Videobooks:
“
In the featured in the uhh... in the episode 20 will be redone version of timmy1984's Sonichu fan promos, which I thought were pretty good but rewording could have been... used greatly. Cause he used the wrong words.
”
Chris, Sonichu 9 Official Videobook
In an earlier IRC chat[1] Chris's primary complaint was Sonichu's use of --among other lines-- "No Darkies, Jerkop!", which he argued is something Sonichu would not say. The Sonichu #9 cover, which was published long before the pages started to appear, proudly advertised that it features "...corrected version of timmys1984's 'Sonichu Fan Promos', presented on YouTube". It took Chris over a year to actually advance the plot far enough to reference to these promos. Unsurprisingly, what eventually resulted sucked.
With the exception of the corrected version of the third clip, the videos are no longer available, making Chris's drawn adaptations the only evidence that they existed at all.

[Camera zooms in on a robed figure. The figure slowly turns to face the camera, revealing himself to be Sonichu]
Cuse-ye-ha-me-HAAAA!!
[On the final syllable, Sonichu casts off the robe, leaps into the air, and is supercharged with lightning from the sky. Once completed, he lands in a kneeling position and grins at the camera.]
No darkies, jerkop!
[Dashes off-camera. Fades to black, the words "Sonichu.net" appear in the center of the screen.]
Chris's version
On 27 October 2009, Chris finally got around to "correcting" the excellent and well-made fan promos by converting them into concentrated fail. Aside from the change from fluid CG animation to horribly drawn, barely sequential art, Chris replaced all of Sonichu's lines from the first fan Promo. The omission of "no darkies, jerkop!" was expected, as Chris had expressed displeasure with the line earlier. The curse-ye-ha-me-ha was removed also, presumably because only Chris-Chan Sonichu uses the attack in canon. Chris also adds a few lame lines about Sonichu saving Rosechu, largely just to shoehorn his other ripoff into the story of the comic.

[The video begins with Sonichu racing down a dark city street, his body crackling with electricity. The camera overtakes him, and focuses on a giant robot, that stomps into the main road from a sidestreet. The sinister machine speaks mechanically.]
Robot: Must destroy yellow mouse.
[The robot then launches two missiles. The camera centers once again on Sonichu, who bravely rushes onward towards his massive mechanical opponent.]
Sonichu: I'm a hedgehog, you pedofork!
[Sonichu then effortlessly dodges the two missiles, and continues towards his wicked enemy. The screen fades to black, and the words "Sonichu.net" appear once again.]
Chris's version
Almost a full month went by before Chris finally posted his version of the second promo on 15 November 2009. Compared to his earlier effort, this issue changed much less from the original video, making it more of a complete ripoff then an actual adaptation. Sonichu's mechanical foe was turned into one of Chris's Decepticon knockoffs, and the robot apparently shot a bunch of bullets instead of the two missiles. Chris also changed "pedofork" to "bag of bolts".

Help me Sonichu! Help!

The Rosechu that sadly, never was
Note that there are actually two versions of this video; the original version is identical to this one, except that Sonichu's tail is missing. This was quickly corrected the same day to prevent an epic heart level shatter.

[Sonichu reaches the villainous automaton from the prior video, and quickly races up his steel body, stopping on its shoulders.]
Sonichu: Oh! So you wanna play Kick the Autistic, eh?
[Sonichu focuses his incredible electrical powers into his hands, giving him the strength he needs to rip the machine's head out of its socket.]
Sonichu: Ahhhh!
[Satisfied with a job well done, Sonichu leaps skyward. The robot remains standing for a moment, before a massive explosion erupts from its damaged neck. Defeated, the robot's headless body crashes to the ground. Its head lands nearby a moment later.]
Robot: OOOWWWWWW!!!! MY AXELS!!!!!.
[Sonichu, smiling gleefully at his victory, walks onscreen from the left]
Sonichu: Heh heh! That one's for you, Seth McFarlane!
[Suddenly Rosechu's voice is heard from far away. It sounds equal amounts desperate and helpless.]
Rosechu: Help me Sonichu! Help!
[The camera zooms in on Sonichu's face, which is now filled with concern, bordering on panic. He glances desperately back and forth, trying to determine where the sound came from. The screen fades to black for the final time. The words "Sonichu.net" appear once again, only this time a note appears underneath the familiar address, saying "NOT Sonichu.110mb.com"
A second note in the bottom right warns us further with "do NOT go here".]
Chris's version
Aside from the obvious drop in quality, the actions Sonichu takes in this comic are largely unchanged from the ones he made in the video. Chris changes the line "kick the autistic" to "kick the quick", possibly his way of indicating that Sonichu is not autistic. "That one's for you, Seth McFarland!" is changed to Sonichu wondering if Seth McFarlane really did use Chris's joke in the beginning of the Family Guy episode "Road to Germany". Instead of Sonichu being helpless and confused after hearing Rosechu at the end, he somehow magically knows exactly where she is and runs off after her, reinforcing his status as a Mary Sue and draining the segment of any tension or drama.
Chris then asks timmys1984 to change the lines in his videos to match the ones in the comic, under the impression that his incredibly bad writing would somehow improve the videos, or that he has the authority to force these kinds of changes in the first place. He is, of course, wrong on both counts.
