Quote of the Now
“
All around the world, everyone prays to their own God, but they are all praying to the same God.
”

Article of the Week
Asperchu is a multiple award-winning comic series created by Alec Benson Leary. His deft artwork, gripping stories, and excellent characterization has resulted in the series gaining hundreds of fans in the few short months since its inception. Many of these fans were discontented followers of the Sonichu comics, who were turned off by the comics becoming exponentially more disturbing.

Improvement Projects of the Now
GO WORK ON IT!
The article in desperate need of improvement at the moment is the Golden Church of Sonichu.

CWC Chronology pages being converted to use references instead of piping.
Many articles are out of date, need updating, or in stub form and could be expanded.
