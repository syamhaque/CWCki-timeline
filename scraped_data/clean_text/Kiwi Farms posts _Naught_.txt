PokeStop

This falls into the toy category, hedgehog likely covered it. Chris submitted the 'Temple" to be a Pokemon stop, it was rejected due to not having enough roaming area.
Chris will submit it again, for some reason he has faith people aren't malicious duplicitous cunts.
Chris looks up the home barb leveraged.
Chris uses the tablet from the corona bucks to the fullest watching anime and mlp.

Chris wants a taser
5 February 2021, as naught[4]
(Im not sure where to post this, although this thread seems fitting especially since in my more paranoid moments ive wondered if Vaughn and praetor LLC are on in the same.)
(An alarming update from cwc, who's still acting as sonichu.)
My bad for not checking in as often as I ought to; I have been really focused and busy.
But the path I am to take in opening the portal/path from 1218 to C-197 is becoming even more opaque and clear.
It does pertain to the piezoelectric capabilities of quartz and lightning strike quartz, in particular the Gate Crystal and the Celestial Key.
Chris has been finding this over the years inadvertently, including when she first struck the quartz on her left arm and the LSQ on her right arm together to make sparks of light back in late '17/early '18.
(This part is alarming, someone in another thread even joked of this when praetor appeared.)
And I will be following to the next event tomorrow when I meet with Caden and the others; gonna take a taser to the Gate Crystal. There is fact that sonar in submarines is generated by flowing electricity through a quart stone in the mech.
So, apply that to a heavily programmed and soulfully overpowered Crystal, with both energies from Chris' soul and mind, as well as this body, it should make a massive resonance to make a break between universes in the dimension divide.
(Rest is modern cwc)
Taser Discussion clip

Caden and cwc as Sonichu prime discuss the tazer and who will be tazed.

Attempt to dox Larry Vaughn
12 February 2021, as naught[6]
CwC said: I confide with you: Vaughn's real name, Daniel Arias, and his real phone number: [CENSORED]
Probably fake Vaughn/LAnon has been faggy as fuck from the start, with the letters the bottle of wine, but who knows.
Editor note: Naught included the above phone number in his Kiwi Farms post - however it is the phone number for the location of a chain restaurant, so has not been transcribed into this page.
