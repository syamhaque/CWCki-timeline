================================================================================

Troll disclosure: Some events in this article take place from October through December 2018, when the Teen Troon Squad had access to Chris's CWCSonichu Twitter account and posted several tweets without his knowledge or consent. Tweets covered on this page may or may not be written by Chris.
For more information, see 2018 Twitter account compromise.
Tour of Chris's House III, or as titled by Chris, IMG_7150.MOV, is a video the Idea Guys had Chris record privately and save to his Google Drive on 9 March 2018.[1]
Compared to previous house tours trolls had Chris record in 2009 and 2013, the house is slightly less cluttered than it used to be, however, Chris has taken on hoarding habits learned from Barbara. Following the events of the 2014 house fire, the parts of Barbara's hoard that weren't completely destroyed are still packed away into boxes set throughout the house; while the hoard still dominates the kitchen and upstairs living room, the oven and sink are actually accessible this time. Chris, on the other hand, has massively expanded his toy hoard, using the downstairs family room as a dumping ground for it, complete with narrow walkways to access parts of the room. On a lighter note, Chris also appears to have salvaged the 'Dreaming Studio' sign from the toolshed outside and brought it into his room, which is relatively less cluttered than the rest of the house.
On 11 December 2018, the Teen Troon Squad leaked a portion of the video onto Chris's Twitter,[2] marking it as the second Idea Guys video to be leaked in such a way. The tweet with the video included a Teen Troon Squad-written description stating that for $500 the full video could be unlocked. The tweet was later deleted by Chris. According to comments by Marvin, the Teen Troon Squad had been able to access the video because Chris had not deleted the video file.[3]
On 11 August 2020, the Watchmen member Klop leaked the full video. In doing so, Klop provided the original Google Drive link to the video file, noting it was over two years old,[4] meaning Chris still had not bothered to delete the file.
The file was eventually deleted off of Chris's Google Drive.[5]
