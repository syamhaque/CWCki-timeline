================================================================================

On 17 March 2008, Chris is forced to start attending the Wesley Foundation Methodist Church after being kicked out from his old church for his sexual deviancy.
March was the third month and the jumping-off point for what would be the rollercoaster of 2008.
This month saw Megan finding out about Chris's sexual drawing of her, and she was not happy.
In an attempt to save their relationship, Chris wages war on ED, trying to remove all references of Megan and to clear his name. The attempts prove unsuccessful, and by the next month she would cut all ties with Chris. Chris reveals Megan was the woman in the infamous fingering picture, and was also banned from his old church.
Events
4 March - Megan asks Chris to remove all references to her from the internet.
8 March - At a GameStop, Chris tries to find out if Lucas was the one who took his picture.
12 March
Megan finds out Chris drew a pornographic image of her. She is angry.
Chris apologizes to Megan for the image he drew.
At 5:52 AM local time, Chris begins a nine-day effort to remove references to Megan (including ShecameforCWC.JPG) from the ED page. He is unsuccessful.

17 March
After his pastor discovers some of the information about him on the internet, Chris gets kicked out of Grace Baptist Church. He turns to the Wesley Foundation Methodist Church.
Again Chris tries to delete the Megan image from ED. He also tries to ban ED's admins from his article using code.
18 March
Chris's edits to the ED page become more focused on showing that it is Megan, not his imaginary sister Crystal, in the infamous fingering picture. He describes Megan as "his lost Sailor Soldier, Megan, who dumped his sorry ass for drawing the pic of him fucking her; she never even had any inkling of interest in him." Of himself he says "What a intolerable sad-sack loser."
Chris tells Megan he's suffering much more than she is.
