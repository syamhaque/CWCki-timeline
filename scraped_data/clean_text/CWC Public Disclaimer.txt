"CWC Public Disclaimer" is a video released by Chris on 14 August 2009, in which he brilliantly announces all his personal information to somehow prove he is the true creator of Sonichu. He also proves he knows nothing about American history, copyright laws, what identity theft is, or what is considered "tall."

Transcript
For anyone and everyone who is watching this YouTube presentation, my name is Christian Weston Chandler. I live at 14 Branchland Court, Ruckersville, Virginia 22968, and my phone home number is area code 434, 990-0198. I live in Greene County in the state of Virginia, U.S.A. In the heart of the blue ridge mountains of Virginia at the hometown area of P—President Thomas Jefferson, President James Madison, and President James Monroe. 15 miles away from my home is Charlottesville, Virginia, better known as Mr. Jefferson's village, and home of Mr. Jefferson's academic village, better known as the University of Virginia. I was born in Mr. Jefferson's village of Charlottesville on February 24th, 1982!
At the hospital named for Martha Jefferson. [wipes flop sweat] I am very proud [places hand on stomach] to be born and live in this area. I consider it the cradle of the Dicklaration of Independence, which President Jefferson wrote; the US Constitution of the United States and the Bill of Rights, which President Madison wrote; and the Monroe Doctor-ine for all of North, Central, and South America which President Monroe wrote.
I originated and invented the character o' Sonichu, Rosechu and all therein on March 17, 2000. As shown originally back on CWC's Pokésite 2 [holds up two fingers], followed by the first original Sonichu website, CWC's Sonichu Site!, and are so noted by copyrights on the symbol of Sonichu's face, like the one and only medallion that I still wear, made from strooong, clast—long-lasting Crayola Model Magic and acrylic paints. [pause] As... well as the title branders, logos, all of the comic pages, and cartoons of Sonichu with his friends, since that date.
I will challenge anybody to a face-to-face, one-on-one public debate meeting in Charlottesville, Virginia to discuss any proprietary claims of anyone else. The place and time within Charlottesville, Virginia will be also agreed on publicly announced and in a publicly attended place. Any impostors claiming to be me, my father Robert Franklin Chandler, Jr., or my mother, Barbara Anne Weston Chandler, are invited to meet me face-to-face, one-on-one in the publicly announced and attended meeting.
Be it known to all that I, THE Christian Weston Chandler, have no Sonichu medallions, towels, printed comics, or any other Sonichu merchandise, for sale previous to or at this time. Any items you might purchase before, now, or in the near future are fakes, and fraudulent copies, that are in violation of the laws of the United States of America. You may buy these items if you wish, at your OWN RISK of receiving stolen merchandise and aiding and abetting a criminal.
[points to camera] You! I'm talkin' to YOU! Instead of purchasing, you should instead turn this criminal over to the police, and not allow him to sell an—at any conventions of any kind in the stores or on the internet. He is just ripping you off!
So far, this individual is falsely hiding under my name, my phone number, and my address. He uses a screen name, and thinks he is safe. He is a coward, and a rotten SNAKE to be afraid to use his own... Gooood-given naaame, address and telephone number, hiding behind the skirts of his own mother.
I stand TALL, at five feet ten inches, and, as you can see, I look or act nothing like the impostor. The impostor criminal which you see on his YouTube screenname of C-C-H-A-N-S-O-N-I-C-H-U-C-W-C. To my fans, will you please help me and alert the police any time you see him in action at a convention, store, internet, or anywhere else. Otherwise, be it known that I ALONE, am THE Christian Weston Chandler, SOLE originator and SOLE owner of any and all Sonichu, Rosechu, or related merchandise, symbols, icons, and comics. Please be advised that anyone offering for sale at any public gathering store, as well as on the internet, will be subject to a severe violation of federal US identity theft and counterfeit laws, and will be prosecuted to the full extent of the United States of America laws for identity theft, counterfeiting, and sale of said type of merchandise.
[sigh]
Stay safe, have a nice day, and enjoy MINE and THE original Sonichu and Rosechu comics, only on CWCipedia. That's C-W-C-I-P-E-D-I-A, at H-T-T-P-colon-slash-slash-cogsdev-dot-one-one-zero-M-B-dot-com-CWCipedia-index-dot-PHP [pause] capital M-main-underscore-capital P-page. One M, one P. [Cub Scout salute] Thank you.
