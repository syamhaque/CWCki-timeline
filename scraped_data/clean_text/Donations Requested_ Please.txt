================================================================================

Donations Requested, Please. is a video Chris made on the 14th of June, 2016. Chris yet again asks for donations in an alternate take of the quickly-deleted previous video. When Barb comes into view, it's easily determined that she is in poor state, and not talking at all. Chris claims he needs $100, even though he gets a tugboat every month. However, this may be one of Chris's "serious" requests because his mother wouldn't let him ask for fake donations to buy worthless junk, right?
It's worth noting that in the background of the video you can see Chris' toys (and from other videos we know the house is packed with them). The fact that his first strategy for urgent monetary needs is to e-beg instead of trying to sell any of his valuable belongings (like his video game consoles) goes to show how little he really cares about the issue, or at least how ill-equipped he is as an adult to handle this and other situations in life. The fact that in the previous video Barb is shown in a near-comatose state only aggravates the entire situation.

Hello, this is Christine Chandler, coming to you live from home! And I definitely have a more urgent and special request.
[Chris begins to pan the camera to Barb] My mother really needs her medication for her asthma. That's her right there, Barbara.
[sigh] Anyway, it's like $100, so I really need the money because we don't have $100. So yeah, just like I said earlier, you can all donations directly to my email address via PayPal. If you don't know how, there's a link to a video underneath this one, so please help us. Have a good day, thank you.
