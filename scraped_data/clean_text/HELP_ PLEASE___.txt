================================================================================

This article is about the series of begs from July 2016. For the begging video from 21 November 2016, see Help, please
HELP, PLEASE!!! is the first of four videos uploaded by Chris on 10 and 11 July 2016. All of the videos are under a minute in length. In the first, Chris appears sick, so he begs for even more money, more specifically "$20" or "$50 American" on the first video. On the second video, he decides to perform a bit of "comedy"
to help entice people to donate, blatantly plagiarised from the South Park episode "Scott Tenorman Must Die". On the third video, he sang "The Brothers Flub" theme song by what seemed to be the request of animation reviewer TheMysteriousMrEnter. However, MrEnter later denied ever talking to Chris when he was asked about this on his Tumblr. [1] On the fourth video, he thanks whoever donated $20, but then requests even MORE DONATIONS for Barb's "teeth problem".

I don't know, hey, maybe a little comedy will help inspiring you to donate. "I'm a little piggy here's my snout, oink oink oink, oink oink oink. I'm a little piggy here's the meme, oink oink oink, here's my snout."
