================================================================================

On 22 January 2010 Chris denies the homosexual implications of giving Asperchu a makeover by including home remodeling, cooking, and "myth busting" as makeovers. It's clear that Chris is grasping at straws here, desperate for anything that would help him discredit his foes at Asperpedia.
The first video cuts off mid-sentence, apparently due to Chris's camera battery dying. Rather than just start from scratch and record a completely new video, as most video bloggers would do, Chris uploaded both the incomplete first part, and then a completely new video, where he hit one last bullet-point and said goodbye.

Captain's Log, Stardate, January 22nd, 2010.
First off, I wanna give a shout-out to the Portland Sonichu Fan Club. [Looks back at TV screen] Er- their president Megan, their vice president Rad, who did this song that's playing on in the background, [holds a CD up to the camera] sent it to me on a CD here. Thank you. And also to Becky, who's doing a paper on me as a modern cartoonist, I appreciate that, thank you.
An- anyway uh, I stand strong, I continue to draw the pages, and, yes, there will be updated- uploaded books. I mean if I can't- if I can't get five in a single day then I'll, still, you know, I'll get them up the next day. But you know at least I'm doing the average of two pages a day. I stand strong.
Anyway, also, uh, the makeover I did, you know. I got- I just received uh, just answered a bunch of new E-mail. New bunch of messages in the mailbag. You know what? I say this. Think about like on Home and Garden, The Learning Channel, even on Discovery and even on MTV. There's such [wildly gestures] home remodeling, cooking cuisine, and mythb- and mythbusting shows.
And even, uh, [sudden voice change] Pimp My Ride! And would you call the people on those shows homosexuals for giving something else or somebody else a makeover? No. No you don't. So that myth [Sailor Moon pose] is busted!

Anyway, uh, I'll leave y'all with that. And, uh, obviously, Asperch- ossibly- obviously, Asperpedia is going down, 'cause Alec and his crew are shooting themselves in the foot. I would never do blood and gore. That's just gross. I mean, if you're not queasy, then come back to Sonichu! Alri-
