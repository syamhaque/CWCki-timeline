NightVee is an OC created by MKRNightVee. Seemingly taking a page out of Chris's conception of Sonichu, MKR created NightVeea hybrid of the dream-dwelling, jester-like protagonist NiGHTS from Sega’s NiGHTS into Dreams and the Pokémon Eevee a small, fox-like creature known for its ability to evolve into multiple elemental forms.

Biography
Around the same time as the events in Sonichu Episode 1, NiGHTS was struck by the same rainbow that was created from Super Sonic and Pikachu colliding, creating a portal into the real world. As Nights was gliding through the atmosphere, they came across an Eevee that was inexplicably tied to a set of balloons. From this collision, the Eevee evolved from the Chaos Energy that NiGHTS had absorbed.
Now able to speak, he reunites with his trainer and takes on the name “NightVee”. Later, NightVee rescues a girl and her Pikachu from Team Rocket and realizes the group is stealing Pokémon. Too weak to fight them alone, NightVee sets out to find an ally.
Abilities and weaknesses
The character, much like Sonichu can adapt different elemental forms, all of which Chris had made TSSSF cards for. MKR was able to successfully convince Chris that this character was canon to Sonichu after roleplaying as a CPU Goddess, CPU Magenta Heart. Meghan wields a pendant for NightVee containing the elemental stones that enable these transformations. NightVee can use it himself when needed or access it remotely, but he generally chooses to remain in a docile, neutral state.
