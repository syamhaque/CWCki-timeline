~ Cwcipedia dA Journal, on why the comments are disabled in all of Chris's pictures.
deviantART is a large online art community where artists can host their artwork, and receive comments and critique from fellow artists and art appreciators. Being one of the most popular amateur art websites in the world, deviantART attracts the best and the worst of us. Especially the worst. In the trolling world, deviantART is notorious as a den for Sonic recolors and poorly drawn porn, so it's no surprise that Chris became a member.

Chris's deviantART accounts
Sonichu
Established 28 December 2005 and banned in early September 2008, presumably for pornographic artwork.
SonichuSite
Established 19 September 2008. Permabanned for a kinda nebulously defined failure, likely the blatant pornography from Sonichu #7. In his next account's Journal, Chris said he has no idea why he was banned. Reading comprehension is apparently not part of the most prestigious reaches of American education.

Greetings, my Loayal Sonichu & Rosechu Fans. Christian Weston Chandler is the Official Owner of this page, and I am here to tell you the news of this page.
The Main Reason I am uploading the Sonichu & Rosechu Fanart, more than my Original and Official stuff, is because this DeviantART account is to be the Official Sonichu & Rosechu FanArt Section for Sonichu.net.
I am thinking of backing up my Comic Book Pages, as well as More Original Art on here in the future. But For Now, this is Basically For FanArt. So enjoy the other people's work I have been mostly delighted to find and have received.
Just a reminder that if you'd like to offer a submission to the FanArt Secion of your own, you may create your own deviantART account and upload it or them, or you may e-mail me your FanArt at ChrisChanSonichu@aol.com.
Peace to all my Loyal Sonichu & Rosechu Fans.
Christian W. Chandler.
CWCipedia
Used while the CWCipedia was down. The account was opened 9 August 2009 and closed on the 28th for evasion of the previous ban and posting erotic artwork featuring underage characters (which is to say, Rosechu's washing machine pic from Episode #20 – it was actually deleted before the account was banned completely).
Chris's greeting for this account (available via WaybackMachine):
I am Christian Weston Chandler; born on February 24, 1982 as Christopher, then changed my first name in 1989.
I am the True, Original Creator of Sonichu and Rosechu, the Electric-Hedgehog Pok'emon (I created him on March 17, 2000 with MY Copyrights on EVERY Image, as well as FULL Comic Books); Accept NO Substitute.
I had an array of CWC Sites before; CWC's Pok'eSite 2, El Pok'eSite de RWC, and MOST IMPORTANTLY, the ORIGNIAL Sonichu Site known as CWC's Sonichu Site, which was a spin-off from CWC's Pok'eSite 2.
I had to take the websites down June, 2009, because my Internet Bullies/Trolls hacked into my Webmaster accounts. But I am Back In The Saddle with Cwcipedia; the NEW, Official CWC's Sonichu & Rosechu Site.

I will put up a sampling of THE Original Sonichu and Rosechu Drawings from myself onto this account, but I have opened this new account up, because...
-My past SonichuSite account was permanently Banned; I forgot why.
-This account will mainly be used to get in touch with choice Fan Artists.
NightStarRosechu2891
Chris used the account to like fanart. In September 2017, Chris announced on Twitter that he wished to find the name of the artist who had drawn a fan comic he had referenced in Sonichu 12, also mentioning that he had been searching DeviantART for it.[1] The Sergeant at Arms sent a DM to the NightStarRosechu2891 account, informing about the comic.[2] Chris then announced on Twitter that he had an answer.

Love how the Galvantaflare was caught in an S-Chu Ball. 😊
Post-jail
PROTIP:
Chris, like previously stated in this article, doesn't consider DeviantArt to be a "social" platform. He will not respond to your comments.
On 23 August 2023, Chris dumped a large amount of artwork, including two new drawings, previously unreleased art drawn during his stay at Central Virginia Regional Jail, many of his old custom Twilight Sparkle's Secret Shipfic Folder cards, and several newly-colored Sonichu 15 (renamed to Sonichu 0 HD) comic pages, onto NightStarRosechu2891, an account he had held for five years without announcement.[4]
Below is a gallery of newly-released artwork. Some versions of the art had been previously released from the Praetor Jail Art. "Sonichu Book 82 Cover" has a date of April 2023, after his release from jail.

Chris also released colorized versions of several Sonichu 15 pages, also retitling the issue to #0 HD.
He also posted some photos of existing comic pages.
These were Chris's first social media posts since his arrest.
In late August, Chris subscribed to the Core program on DeviantART.[5]
Chris's use of deviantART
As in the case of YouTube and Wikipedia, Chris really doesn't understand the point of the website, and all of the finer community aspects of the website flew right over his head. He regarded deviantART as a place to dump his images into, disabled comments, and completely disregarded all comments he received through his userpage. His stated goal was to "get in touch with choice Fan Artists," but with his usual attitude of "I post images, others listen," we have no idea how this would have worked. In other words, Chris operated just like many other Sonic recolorists who ended up on Encyclopedia Dramatica, only that he didn't even allow praising comments to be posted.
True and Honest Fans
In CWCipedia's "Communities" page, Chris listed "SonichuFanclub" as an officially sanctioned Sonichu dA community.
