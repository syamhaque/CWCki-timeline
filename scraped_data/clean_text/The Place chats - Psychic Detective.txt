Between 22-25 March 2021, Chris role-played about being a psychic detective in the Watchmen Discord server The Place.
MKRNightVee also tried to manipulate Chris into speaking to Alexander Gordon Jahans, by claiming that Jahans would be able to assist Chris. MKRNightVee had wanted the two to interact.[1]

Goood Morning, @everyone.
Deleted User
Henlo
Chris
I’m feeling very well and good.
Ah, @Deleted User, perfect timing.
Naught[note 1]
You have a good night's sleep?
Chris
More than that.
I managed to look even deeper within my body to locate the magic within to bring it out to functionality.
I also found a clue that goes along this thread of events.
By the magic source, a Rainbow Chaos Emerald, was a slip of paper, which read “redrum4891”.
Magi-Chan encouraged me to look further into that clue.
Ever heard of Claire Hough?
She was a sweet 14-year old who was visiting San Diego from Rhode Island waay back in ‘84.
Naught
Interdasting
Chris
She was murdered on the beach, with her boom box by her side.
She listened to such popular tracks, including “I’m All Out of Love” by Air Supply.
I was just now talking with her. (edited)
Apparently, somehow, by some twist of fate, Sockness got ahold of a piece of her boom box.
Naught
Good song
Chris
I’m not sure which part, be it the cassette tape from within, a piece broken off of the boom box left behind on the beach, or what.
And I’m still piecing together how my becoming conscious of these details and this curious thought piece is correlating with the present events, but a thing Is happening, Bismuth.
Another murdered girl, from here in Virginia, Morgan, swung by as I was talking with Claire.
I am sensing a theme.
Obviously, Sockness’ sick rituals, and shit. (edited)
But, also, we’re talking about ladies who were feeling lost in their lives at the time, not yet fully finding themselves, fatedly falling into their own respective becoming murdered, and the rippling effects from each of those events.
Chances are someone else may get murdered in the near future; it is likely to be preventable.
Common theme of some young, or young-ish, adult, still finding themselves, on a brink of self-revelation, and then Wham.
Obvious details, including this pandemic having sheltered more than too many, millions of individuals having passed on from this universe at that expense.
I remain immortal, both my body and I, regardless of alternate timelines, so we are safe.
And now things are clearing up on that, and peoples are getting this vaccine.
They are starting mg to get out more again.
Or, otherwise, got a bunch more sheltered-in types out of that.
With social media these days, lots of these sheep-like individuals are taking to sharing their life stories on their walls and threads.
And counting those who are on their own brink of breaking out and finding themselves, if not so already.
Becoming more Woke.
Or, otherwise, subconsciously triggered into falling to their own murders.
That can be determined by how conscious they were and what they may have known prior to their respective demises.
Claire had promised her friend she would not leave the house and being reckless; she could have stayed at home that night.
But something triggered her into doing so; a fated trigger.
Same with Morgan: she could have stayed in that Metallica concert at the JPJ, but something triggered her to just leave.
And you can definitely speak similar of others as well.
The killer and their motives are irrelevant, since they are also on sleep-triggers of their own.
It’s the victims to be that should be encouraged to stay and not go out to their fates, if their presence was really destined to remain in this timeline.
Everyone has these clues to see ahead on Social Media these days.
These Can be utilized to prevent the next one from happening.
Yeah, obviously, I’m pre-meditatively laying and spelling all this out, and all this was triggered of me from deep within.
So, yeah, get sleuthing; keep watch for the signs online and offline within your viewpoints, as will I.
Naught
ok,
Are their any more obvious commonalities ?
Chris
Being a deity, I can’t disclose every single detail to those involved to solving and making sure the next one(s) don’t get killed, but I can still offer guidance.
To find the deeper details of common threads amongst these murders of past days and years, ask the online sleuths and trolls.
And, as John Kramer constantly said,
but not being a murderer, here:
Naught
So do you think it's a serial killer?
Chris
“I want to play a game.”
Possibly
Deleted User
I love saw
MKR
Good morning
Chris
Hey, Meghan.
MKR
Saw was neat
Deleted User

Chris
I was just telling Bismuth about finding the beginning clue within myself to prevent a murder from happening in the near future.
Oh.
Yeah, preventing this particular, specific murder would be most helpful in maintaining the order within these events.
MKR
Tbh I really liked the trial pages of the sonichu comics. I found them to be sort of therapeutic. Lol
Oh really?
Whose murder?
Chris
I’m not sure.
I could list a bunch of names: you, Meghan, Helena, Emily, Annibelle, Bella, and so on.
Even Bismuth, Neko or Anaxis.
But, at this point, if I’m naming them, they are highly likely safe and not on the block. (edited)
So, the solution is to look online at the various walls of young(ish) adults who may be on the verge of becoming massively Woke.
MKR
Wokeness is a big problem
Chris
Deep thinkers, pondering types, well-wishers.
Deleted User
Woke like enlightened not like modern woke
MKR
Ah
Chris
[quotes MKR's "Wokeness is a big problem" line]
Because soo many people are becoming Fashionably Woke?
MKR
I see
Chris
[quotes Deleted User's "Woke like enlightened not like modern woke" line]
But, yeah, that.
MKR
I meant the ones cancelling things
Chris
[quotes MKR's "I meant the ones cancelling things" line]
I feel like you’re taking about me in that statement.
MKR
No
Chris
As I’ve stated, I am immortal, so I am safe and well in this event.
MKR
Dr Seuss, looney toons, etc
Classics
Chris
Protection on me is still valid and well.
MKR
Mlp g5 is a dumpster fire mistake
Chris
Anyway
We can obviously rule out all already-enlightened woke types; they are all safe.
MKR
I do know someone very enlightened whose abilities could help us in this and other things.
The farshnuke
Chris
[quotes MKR's "The farshnuke" line]
That name again.
Deleted User
Oh yeah Jahans
Chris
Sure, you may talk with him as well.
Deleted User
There were some detective stories he wrote similar to this with a mc helping people from being killed
Chris
Anyway,
The game is afoot.
I urge all of you to outsource, spread out, and leave no individual living soul unchecked online or offline.
And then Sockness’ name pops back in again for a reason.
MKR
He seems the killer type...
I'll try my very best! 😊
Chris
Yeah, but then even the Obvious ones aren’t likely the next Triggered Killer.

Hey, @everyone. And @Nova, I just had a look at the following article; take this under consideration in your determining and prevention of our blue-eye brunette we want to keep alive.

Mass shooting isn't serial killing.
Deleted User

Kyle
Pedantic, yes, but that just makes the moral obligation even more indefensible.
Deleted User

Chris
It’s a sign and a clue.
You’re Smart
Figure it out
Kyle
That, what, statistically events happen sometimes?
Deleted User
A clue to the victim or perpetrator?
[posts a reaction image]
Kyle
I can extrapolate some things, I know abnormal psychology, yes, obviously.
But it's still a complete shot in the dark of observing charitably, thousands, in the hopes of what, one being relevant?
From the outset, mass shooters don't target based on demographics like that anyway.
So even on the off chance I was to find one, it would still lead to about a hundred false positives.
Deleted User
Unless the soon-to-be victim is in that very crowd watching

Going all Minority Report on this, it's a crapshoot.

[quotes Chris's "Hey, @everyone. And @Nova, I just had a look at the following article; take this under consideration in your determining and prevention of our blue-eye brunette we want to keep alive." line]
You have to understand that there some very terrible people out there that want to kill people no matter the circumstances.
Kyle
God, I love 2A.
Lainchu (the 4th)
Don't blame the weapons themselves, blame the individual.
MKR
Yep
Chris
There is a Pattern to be found.
This article is a start on that.
Lainchu (the 4th)
And btw, don't let people fool you into thinking that going out there again is "bad". That is a false and defeatist belief.
Kyle
"I want you to figure out based right now, on no instruments, charts or points of reference, how to get to a target, who knows how far away that's barely larger than our own ship."
Chris
Seek guidance on figuring the Pattern from past and looking into future along the line.
Kyle
I think something that omniscient kind of invalidates, basically everything prior.
MKR
Dose there have to be a pattern? People have been killing eachother since the beginning.
Lainchu (the 4th)
exactly.
its human nature. (sadly)
Kyle
It's nature.
Lainchu (the 4th)
in general.
Chris

Someone is in peril guys
The very people complaining about mass shootings in the states are the same people who either own a gun themselves or do nothingers in the end.
There's a madman outthere
Kyle
This is far more complex than solving the human condition, this is random points of reference which we don't have the capacity to search for.
Chris
I gave you a clue towards the Victim to be; I give you a clue about a shooting pattern that leads to the location.
Deleted User
[quotes Deleted User's "There's a madman outthere" line]
I wouldn't be surprised if more than 50 million something Americans are mentally ill.
MKR
Get the farshnuke. I feel he could help.
Kyle
We have a physical description, that's about it.
And no information on the scenario which has now been described 2 separate ways.
Chris
[quotes MKR's "Get the farshnuke. I feel he could help." line]
If you feel it so, call on your Farshnuke.
I am actually encouraging you to do so, Meghan. (edited)
Kyle
And even then, no verification that any of this is actionable through either means.
If someone told me I was going to die via some improbable means, I wouldn't take that seriously.
And there's currently nothing to go on for a police report.
MKR
I'll look into it. Contacting him.
Kyle
False leads would be useless at any level of organizational structure.
Chris
I would feel really pissed if we ended up stuck in a Time Loop, because Kyle doesn’t chill with the overthinking and actually use the available resources and online allies and examine all possibilities within the possible individuals that fit the criteria that are Woke on the verge of becoming Enlightened in the near future, as well as Pay Attention to the Signs presented To and Around you, Kyle.
Kyle
What's the fascination with "overthinking"
I can find someone who qualifies.
Chris
Feeling or sensing any Deja Vu moments at this instance?
Kyle
But how specific do you want?
Deleted User
[quotes Chris's "Feeling or sensing any Deja Vu moments at this instance?" line]

Kyle
I find I'm not really impaired.
As in, everything I say tends to happen.
As it stands, we're better off finding the perp.
Deleted User
Finding one will lead to other
Kyle
Well, perhaps.
But if I took that on, I'd have an ethical obligation to stop it prior.
Leaving it still unknown to some degree.

Chris gives extremely vague hints on the potential victim.
Chris
@everyone, Your Next Clue (and forgive the Vagueness, but, Again, I am not at liberty to be Too Specific in detail (goes similar to how everyone is not to know the exact Hour a specific event will happen):
This individual may or may not be one of my many, many followers, even former or present ally, friend, or nemesis.
They either follow and read my commentaries directly through an account of their own, or indirectly through fake account(s).
They may or may not frequent KiwiFarms, 4Chan, or the like, OR they may be offline recluses, due to feeling overwhelmed by the mixed commentaries of the online populace.
There is a chance they may or may not be directly or indirectly (in)famous by association to myself.
Also, this person may or may not be considering a cross-country trip.
Kyle
"There is a chance they may or may not be directly or indirectly (in)famous by association to myself." (That would be an 100% chance as you seemingly covered all the options.)

Chris brings up Megan, claiming she will need extra defense. Kyle and MKR quickly discourage Chris from considering her further.
Chris then loses interest in the game and stops bringing it up.
Chris
I’m not finalized which of the two, but the victim is either in California or Virginia.
And, Megan Schroeder, in Virginia, here, is one who will (also) need some extra defense on her part during this present time as well.
You may relay this info to Josh Moon as well; I’ve also briefed him the few days ago as I did with you all.
Kyle
Um, I think she's more than fine well enough alone.
MKR
Megan has a gun and knows how to defend herself. I'm sure she'll be alright. Maybe the victim is someone else?
