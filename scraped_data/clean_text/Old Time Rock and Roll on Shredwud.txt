The gitar as it appears in the cartoon...
Old Time Rock and Roll on Shredwud [sic] is a 17 October 2009 video wherein Chris butchers Bob Seger's "Old Time Rock and Roll" on his Guitar Hero game on a large flatscreen TV, both definitely paid with his monthly tugboat.
Chris's guitar is a crappy duplicate of Meatwad's guitar featured in Aqua Teen Hunger Force. An episode of ATHF had the character Meatwad playing with a toy guitar. The toy was deliberately cheap and shitty-looking in the series, which really says something about Chris's art ability since his duplicate of it is just shitty beyond words.
