================================================================================

Announcement 06292016 and Announcement 06292016-2 are two videos uploaded by Chris on 29 June 2016. In the first video, Chris requests even more donations, treating his self-caused monetary troubles as a charity to which his donors are obligated to give more money. He also apologizes to the male gender, likely after realizing that the majority of his donors were men. Alternatively, it may also be another vain attempt to set himself apart from the male population. Notably, Chris omits mention of his ugly growth in his list of commonalities with them. In the second one, he claims that he is cured from autism by simply watching a "subliminal" video three times a day for three months. Ironically, the second video was made because he had forgotten to mention that he was autism-free in the first announcement.

Hello everybody, this is Christine Chandler coming to you live from home once again. And, uh, we will be getting to the, uh, next chapter of the, uh, Unicorns, Rainbows, and Bluebird a' Happiness... in the next video right after this one. But first I hav- I do have a couple of announcements to make. We've received a good number of donations... but we could still do better, and, uh... [fiddles with glasses] yeah, it's fair, we'v- we've... managed, for the most part. Yeah. So. It could still... things could be better. Yeah.
Anyways, uh... keep 'em coming, I'll put a list- I'll put da link underneath this video as well. Well... the instructions, anyway. Um. [unintelligible]
Um. Anyway... [removes glasses] I also have an ass- I have a most sincere, and direct apology to all the... males worldwide, around the world. Of which indeed 'tas come to my attention that we have more than in common. [looks at phone] An I'm gonna- I wrote it down, so... gonna read my apology. Anyway, yes.
[begins reading] Gentlemen of the world: I have learned and realized that y'all, as a male, are OK. All people, female and male, are more alike than we realize. We are all the same inside the womb. Half of us come out changed from that... and half of us gets to remain unchanged. And really, the difference between derringers- genders, is the one mutation created by the chromosome. And the varying levels of mentality and ability, individually. And, for putting y'all down as a group... [performs a halfhearted sitting bow] I deeply apologize. Deeply and sincerely. I respect you each as people and individuals... but I still maintain the respectacle arms-length distance... when being approached in person. [puts down phone, stares blankly into space for a few seconds]
Hmm. Alright, so... coming up shortly, is the uh... is chapter 3 of... Unicorns, Rainbows, Bird Bloober Happiness. [puts palm out] Thank you.

Hey fans, I forgot one thing to mention. I have- I've actually been on a- subliminal project, as a lot of you- or some of you- might have been... aware of, through my history or whatever... That I try to keep private amongst my YouTube settings.
But I have been enjoying for the past 3 months the "Get Rid of Autism" subliminal. The one that actually works in three months so less than [stutters] three times per day. 36 times.
I have been doin' that I've actually found myself more mentally capable. I don't- I do not blank out as much, I feel a little bit faster in mental processing... Aaand I feel a whole lot better so with that [puts out hands] I'm essentially cured of autism. Oh and also I actually have been able to socialize better out in public, so that's another good deal right there.
I'm gonna put the link underneath this video... And those of y'all with autism... Try for yourself. Three- play it three times, per day... for three months. [Points to head] It worked for me. [Thumbs up]
