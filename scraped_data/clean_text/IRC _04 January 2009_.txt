================================================================================

An IRC chat where Chris, Julie and PandaHalo have it out all at once. Chris is revealed as a miserable two-timing bastard.
Summary
Early in January 2009, PandaHalo had been something like Chris's regular sweetheart for some time, ever since Blanca Weiss dumped him at the end of October 2008. However, Chris was distracted for several days prior to this chat by the arrival of a new would-be girlfriend, Julie (who speaks using the handle BlueSpike, a sign of things to come).
Here, Julie "discovers" that Chris has still been leading Panda on while trying to lure her down to visit him in Charlottesville. Likewise, Panda "discovers" that Chris has considered dumping her for a newer model. Hilarity ensues.
Julie pressures Chris to tell her that he loves her above all, but all he can come up with are wishy-washy put-ons- "I love you, Julie, like I love and care for every women who is fond and cares about me." Panda claims that he's strung them both along with the same line about losing their virginity at the Doubletree Inn. Both of them bemoan the absolute shattering of their heart level, a mocking joke that Chris naturally doesn't pick up on.
Eventually, Julie drops the trump card by threatening to kill herself and temporarily leaves the chat. As soon as she's gone, Chris has the gall to tell Panda "I still want you more," and "I still want you here most of all." As soon as Julie returns, Chris backpedals again- "I do love Panda, a lot, but I felt soo appreciated and understood with y'all, and for that I love you all too."
The chat finally collapses into everyone involved trashing Chris for his insensitivity, to which the best response he can come up with is "I was confused." He flees to go work on his comics as the trolls all break down laughing.

20:17 <@BlueSpike> You even told me to go to the Double Tree Hotel...I was happy..
20:17 <@ChrisChanSonichu> Actually, Julie, I have not gone out with Panda yet; we hadn't met IRL yet.
20:17 <@BlueSpike> But even learning my country was too poor for air travel was worse than this!
20:17 <+RebeccaVanDierten> but blue... didn't you tell me you had issues with traveling?
20:17 <@BlueSpike> I can't believe this!!
20:18 <@ChrisChanSonichu> I'm sorry to have led you on like that.

20:19 <@BlueSpike> Do you truly love me?
20:19 <@BlueSpike> Above any other girl?
20:19 <@ChrisChanSonichu> so much was going on, and all you sweet ladies just kinda made me feel a bit overbeared; like y'all were piling up on me at once.
