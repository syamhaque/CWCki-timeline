Hello, everybody! It's Christine Chandler coming in live from home once again, with, another paid video. This time, it's a dedication to a couple who is celebrating their anniversary; Frauncisco and... James. Uh, okay, anyway, so, to Fraun: James wants you to know that he loves you very much and that James will get you to have dinner with him. Heh. He calls that "personal talk", I don't get it, that's between you and him, whatever. Anyway, congratulations very much on your anniversary! Keep it ongoing very well! Anyway, um, so, yeah, here you go, Bubbles and Magi-Chan. [unintelligible gibberish] A little bonus, actually, a, kind of a new song, but based off a regular song. I think it really works, and inspired by Love is Love. Okay:
What is love, love, love? Love is love, love, love! When you have a lot of it, you're a cut above, bove, bove. What is looooove? Love is looooove! When you have a lot of iiiiit, that's a lot of looooove! And when you have iiiiit, you're a cut abooooove! What is love, love, love? Love is love, love, love! When you have a lot of it, it, it, you're a cut above, bove boooove! What is loooooooove?! Love is love. Okie dokie. Happy anniversary, Fraun and James. Take care and be safe.
