Here's a nich-, here's a Cwcville Shopping update for all my dedicated fans and everybody. [Pans camera to show another set of figures] And this of course will be applied to the individual figures as well. Y'all know who they are among which... Hm, sorry it gets a little black in the back there, but anyway. Hm, I have decided to take advantage for, of the uh, Black Friday savings, although I can't really do price discounts, that's... beyond me ri-, at the moment, but I will add bonuses to every offer. And Book No. Two will be made available by the 21st of this week, November 2015. And I'm gonna draw as many, draw and color as many pages as possible. I'm concentrating this whole week after I create the few more figures that I have to, for, that I have started over this weekend, and then I'll concentrate on pages over this week, so that I can time afterwards to take, to make as many, make, as many or all the figures as possible within four weeks and get them ther-, get them to their destinations in that timeframe as well.
Uh, bigger orders will, that will definitely take up to the eight-week mark once again there. But four weeks, that will definitely get you there before Christmas. [Clears throat] Anyway, for every order made on my shop--figure order--of $50 or more, they will get a free book, either be Zero, One, or Number Two coming later this week. $50 or more gets a free book. You don't have to add it in your cart. This offer runs from today, November 15th, 'til Friday the 28th. [Pans camera to show a calendar] Just gonna zoom in on my calendar there, let you get that timeframe there. Yeah, these two weeks, 15th up to the 28th. And uh, also, on, also, we're gonna, I'm want, I'm adding a little bit of a more bonus on the don-, uh, the free book offer, and that's uh, offer actually $50 or more that goes between the figures, as well as the commissions and one uh, your order just has to total $50 or more, but uh, does not count on the donation listings, because uh, but as for the donation listings, um, yeah, they still go as marked, but--and I'm stating this through the video, and I will make an Etsy shop update through my iPod later today, with a photograph--uh, the donations of $100, $500, and $1000 increments, they will get their choice of one extra figure. Any one extra figure that's currently listed on Etsy, and uh, only on the donation increments on $500 and $1000--since they both will be including the Mii three-pack there--they will get a bonus of my parents. Both my par-, both my mom and dad. So in both the fif-, $500 and $1000 increment donations, you get my mom and dad as well.
And also, I'm thinking about, uh, but I'm still trying to figure out a price, the whole, you can bring the whole family to do a whole deal with the whole family, of Sonichu, Rosechu, Cerah, Christine, and Robbie, bring the whole family together for a Christmas, and I would try, I would definitely try to get those done within the four-week timeframe as well, those orders. Anyway, I'll thin-, I'm thinking about the, still thinking about the price, but I'll get a listing later today. I'll make a photograph out of this screencap. Okay, so again, that's a free book with every $50-plus order made between the 15th and 28th, not counting the donation listings, the donation increments of 100, 500, and 1000. Mm. Actually, I think I'm gonna rethink that. Yeah. Ah, no no no, it's all good. Uh, the, the, 100, five, thou-, 500, and 1000 will get one extra figure, and the donation increments of $500 and 1000 get my parents as well. And again, on the fam-, on this family, they're all Mii fig-, they're all Mii Amiibo figures in the base regardless. No Link, Toon Link, or Megaman, or Mario in my mom and dad...at all. It'll be the Mii figures.
So take advantage of these deals today, and definitely today or up to the 21st to definitely guarantee the four-week timeframe of which they will be delivered to you, get there to you by Christmas. Thank you very much, and have a great day.
