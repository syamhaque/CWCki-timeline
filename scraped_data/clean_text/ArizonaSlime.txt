Description
Putting an end to the Endless War with SlimeCo.
The show so far: Nightstar Sonichu got ahold of a sample of the Smooze and accidentally got some in her green eye; she then saw into Dimension C-197's Arizona where the worst kind of warfare was going on. Recognizing Phantom Horn and Strawberry Milk as Trolls with Good Hearts, she sends them both to look into the situation. PhH. and S.M. wandered the streets, as they were forced to go into mining slime that was a result of the company of SlimeCo in the city of New Los Angeles City, a.k.a. New Milwaukee, Arizona. After suffering from the violence, hatred and the worst possible kinds of Trolling, having learning their lessons from the experience, they pray for a solution to these set of problems. I show up, personally, to set these ending wheels into motion. -Chris Chan Sonichu.
Mini-comic strip, "Slime and Punishment", chronicling the events prior to this point was written and drawn by Ben Saint.
TSSSF Sonichu Deck or Core Deck are required for playing with this Expansion Pack.
This pack includes 15 cards.

Analysis of SlimeCo's Slime
Goal
Checkmark
Win this Goal When: A Pony card with the Villain keyword is discarded from the grid.
(6) - Nightstar wasted no time in experimenting the slime with Princess Twilight Sparkle. They've found the slime is partially diludable [sic], but water, alone, can go so far. It turns out the slime is gaseous, and it doesn't like plain sugar. Lightning and electricity can also burn it, but if touch-surrounded by more slime compared to the area that is zapped, the slime can recover, so the larger the slime amount, the more voltage is required to put out the entire blob.

P.H.'s poudrin falls out of his tube/horn. "Woahly, Phantom Horn! Crystalized Slime, and you have a chunk. Crystalized, even a poudrin this size, can either be utilized as a weapon's energy source, or as a healing stone with very mild slime side-effects." -Chris Chan Sonichu.

Please, relay this information to Chris Chan, immediately. You two are doing very well and learning exponentially of what it is like to be trolled and hated. Experience remains the best teacher.

(14) - While recovering, P.H. was feeling more magic in his aura and seeing mild sparks flying off of his forehead. After returning to Equestria, it became more obvious. He removed the paper tube and found in its place a light teal-coloured functional horn. He was simply elated. But old habits die hard as he, for a while, still had the idea others still thought of him as an Earth Pony (Nobody saw him as such after this). When his horn glows, it gets a temporary transparent appearance, but functions normal and well.
