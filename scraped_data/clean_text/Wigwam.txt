Manipulation Disclosure: The views Chris
expresses may or may not be his own. Many of Chris's videos were orchestrated behind the scenes by trolls putting ideas in his head or goading him to act out; the majority of these interactions was never released to the public.
Wigwam is a video Chris uploaded on 25 October 2010. Chris, summoning his Native American heritage, pretends to smoke tobacky, nearly four years after proclaiming that he would shoot every last ounce of it to the Moon.[1]
Note that actual Cherokees did not build wigwams, and their ceremonial pipes do not resemble ballpoint pens, but were usually made from clay or bluestone quartzite. It should also be noted that the phrase "smoke um peace pipe" was lifted directly from Futurama.

Transcript
A five-pack of CWC-brand tobacky.
[Chris makes weird noises, takes a puff from a ballpoint pen attached to what appears to be either a folded Post-It note or a small sack, makes more weird noises, then hands it to the viewer.]
[In a stereotypical Native American accent] Here, smoke um peace pipe, find inner peace.
