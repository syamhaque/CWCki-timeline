Chris's goal is to build a Sweetheart from the Ground-Up, lose his dreaded virginity (which he ultimately accomplished without a sweetheart), and spawn his God-chosen daughter, Crystal Weston Chandler (named after "the illustrious metal" and a name similar to his own). Unfortunately for him, the plan hasn't progressed beyond a handful of troll-engineered dates, a trip to a hooker (two in fact), and having sex with his mother. Thus the sweetheart label finds itself frivolously applied, indicating a status that lies somewhere between "e-girlfriend" and "stalking victim." Contrast this with Chris's Gal-Pals; that is, all of those girls who are still potential sweethearts because they are known to Chris and don't appear to hate him.
Chris's ideal vision for a sweetheart is more or less one that allowed him to continue living as a "self-employed" stay-at-home husband/father/son, since he didn't make a significant effort to support a prospective family at any point during his Love Quest aside from briefly applying for a minimum-wage job for Kacey, from which he was fired not long after. Based on his frustration at the idea of doing any work whatsoever, it's likely that he wanted someone to effectively mother him rather than an equal partner, who he could also have sex with and impregnate with a kid or two.
During the late 2000s, Chris also seemed to be under the impression that they'd live with his parents and their hoard, who he'd presumably leave his sweetheart-to-be to raise his kids with. He was under the belief that his sweetheart would do all of the heavy lifting while he "watched over" the kids.
Qualifications
NOTE:
Be aware that the qualifications listed may not reflect Chris's current tastes.
See Also: Sonichu's News Dash and Attraction Sign It's the one on the left.
In the early years of his Love Quest, Chris spelled out his qualifications on his Attraction Sign, in a personal ad that ran for several issues in the News Dash, and on various other items including a cover for his Nintendo DS. Subsequent experiences would show that many of these TRUE and HONEST criteria could be bent a little, as expedient.

Present situation
This article is still yet to be completed due to stress. We get a lot of stressful torture in our lives that makes us crash into slumber. Given that inspiration is a big variable, and we may have been lacking of it, this article will be completed as soon as possible, at our own pace... HONEST! This article is missing the following:
• Information about the Polyamrous marriage• Everfree Northwest Love Triangle• Lovers Attributes List
As of late, Chris's desire to find a sweetheart has somewhat weakened.

Chris has also used other affectionate terms for gal-pals and potential sweethearts.

Sweetbolt
What's wrong? More than you can possibly imagine.
Sweetbolt is a term of endearment coined by Chris and primarily used by his electric hedgehog characters. He considers it a clever play on the more familiar "sweetheart." The spelling of the word is somewhat fluid – Chris variously spells it "SweetBolt," "Sweet bolt," or "Sweet-bolt."
"Sweetbolt" sounds awfully strange even in the context of Chris's comics, as when Rosechu refers to Sonichu as her sweetbolt. However, it sounds an order of magnitude more bizarre when Chris uses it to describe himself:
“
I understand, and I will NEVER put it against you. Yes, as your SweetBolt. :)
”
Chris, to PandaHalo, concerning her rape at the hands of Clyde Cash
Theoretical Exes
Chris has occasionally called past potential sweethearts theoretical exes.
Zapbud
“
Oh, Rosechu, you are as beautiful as a rose,
though a Zapbud is the flower that heals your woes.
”
[3]
A Zapbud
The zapbud, first introduced in the Wall of Originals, was a part of Chris's half-assed attempt to create lore in his Sonichu comics, being a flower which he had created solely for this reason. In keeping with the comic's notorious lack of subtlety (if the name of the thing didn't give it away already), the flower itself is a generic sunflower design that has four magenta petals with yellow lightning bolts on it, and a blue center with a single yellow lighting bolt. Adding to this, Chris wanted to avoid making it ambiguous that they were supposedly Rosechu's most favorite things, and the chosen design for it, being the same color scheme as Rosechu, made this loud and clear (even ignoring the fact that Chris plastered Rosechu's name on it in one instance). Despite how special they supposedly are in the world of the comics, being Rosechu's favorite flower, and Chris even going out of his way to create a Magic Model mold of one in his Lego recreation of CWCville,[4] they are so generic that the most that Chris could say about them is that they also just smell "nice".[5] Chris's constant use of Zapbuds (despite how utterly generic they were) became a sort of in-joke amongst Christorians and observers, to the point where an OC, Cindy Zapbud, was created and named after it.
Nonetheless, the term "zapbud" was also used in the comics as a term of endearment, which is most noted when Sonichu referred to Rosechu as his "blossiming zapbud" in Sonichu 8.
