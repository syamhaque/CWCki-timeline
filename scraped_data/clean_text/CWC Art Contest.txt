Round 1
A censored example of an email message Chris revealed.
CWC ART CONEST Round 1 is a video uploaded to Chris's YouTube channel on 13 February 2024 which involved Chris screen-recording his gmail screen while opening fanart pictures. Chris carelessly revealed email messages - which includes information such as names and email addresses - while looking through the pictures. One of the artworks has Caden's dox superimposed on it.
A censored screenshot of Caden's info superimposed on fanart.
The video was taken down a few days after uploading "due to a privacy claim by a third party". The original video is mirrored via GhostArchive[2] and catbox.moe.[3]

But right now we're uh taking a look at what we have received so far and uh we're picking some to go into what we will be calling the semifinals... all right.
And then of course we'll do another... another one where uh then they go into the finals later on another video- [Video cuts due to editing]
[Fan art on screen via Google Drive]
We're taking a look at this one first and foremost... I like the art style of this one but obviously... uh the... when we talk- when we go into further details... about later on for- should should this one
make it to the finals but I do like the art style this one has... very very nice-
[Editing cut to a Furry picture of Chris]
Okay now the lovely lady here has presented quite the lovely art style... within her lovely furry correction and I do appreciate the furries and the Furry communities and everybody else as I've
mentioned before... but still this is a really nice art style I like the shading and the rendering... it's not bad I like it
[Edititing cut to a drawn peach with wings]
[Trademark Hmm] Okay so I took a look at these pieces from this particular artist uh... little bit grotesque and out of the way and now obviously we have a flying Peach so go ahead and make your joke references
right now yada yada yada [Blows raspberry] anyway... lovely she did- this one did a lovely bunch of of good styling in her art just very just appreciative and grateful of that...
just kind of an honorable mention at this point.... until further consideration.
[Editing cut to Chris showing a fully uncensored email from a contestant]
[Chris opens a basic fanart of Sonichu]
Alright, simple fan art like this... I mean the art style is there... but obviously... level room for improvement but it is being considered so this is anice little lovely simple art style.
Very... very good.
[Editing cut to a handmade statue of Sonichu]
All right yes this is a lovely... a lovely lovely.... piece of artwork. Though I will mention this Sonichu- Sonichu Prime does not have ch- chromia. I mean his- both his eyes are green.
So it's like I don't know what you were thinking with this one but still this is a lovely artwork I appreciate it... [Sighs and mhms]
I mean really good- really good use of clay and paint.
[Editing cut to a fanart of Rosechu]
Now this individual has a lovely Rosechu OC and the art style is very good- it's actually on par I feel like... I love the 80s aesthetic that this individual put with the background very,
very nice. May give this one a star actually... may!.. Come back to that later.
[Editing cut to a Sonic the hedgehog fanart]
MMk. Okay this individual has a really good art sty- okay has [Mumbles unintelligibly] so Matt's here... did a good job. really good job I love the art style in this.
[Editing cut to Pokemon fan art]
Yeah this is nice...

[Editing cut to comic of Chris' Pepper Spray incident]
Umm... [Blows raspberry] okay yeah nice little... one... nice... one portrayal... but I mean... I mean come on... [Puts glasses on his face] the lenses are clear... don't make them
dark for one thing... and obviously I'm not fat... [Quietly chuckles] [Yeesh, meh'] I like this guy that got the... guy here reminds me of- looks he looks like snively from Saturday

everything [Trademark hm] very very goo-
[Editing cut to Fanta backed, genderbent, Chris Chan Sonichu]]
We don't do Fanta... anymore so... can we stop with that... [Circles his mouse cursor on the Fanta] stupid meme for one thing but other than that, just focusing on the piece... this
is nice, fluffy... textured, I like it. It's decent.
[Editing cuts to AI art of Sonichu]
[Chris is audibly and visually nervous]
Ok, well I mean... obviously... [Laughs at a very buff Sonichu] like I mean shoot... wasn't just chili dogs... but obviously yeah... this is... AI art but...

[Editing cut to Sonichu and gang art]
[Chris has a huge shit-eating grin]
Okay yes... I REALLY like this one. Although why is Punchie looking so angry at Bubbles? [In a high pitched tone:] What did she do? No... B-Bu-Bunchai, you're not angry
at bubbles... what's wrong with you? but still I love this one... this is very nice.
[Editing cut to Bubbles bikini fan art]
Yeah her fur does not turn from... Blue to White when reflected the sunlight but I appreciate the shading that was put into this piece... this uh...
that's a good theme going... even though... um... okay bubbles does surf... but she moreover likes to swim in the- in the oceans and she's a- she can swim REALLY
really fast.
[Editing cut to nightmare-fuel Chris fan art]
okay yes I definitely see it... okay this... High marks. Andron, I can tell... and very lovely colors and vibrant. Why do I look so old? [Scoffs]
That's okay this is still very good... I like this... semi.
[Editing cut to art of Sonichu Voring Chris]
Okay the art style is good on this one... and just... [Sighs]
Okay yeah just... why? Why? Why did you put a Sonichu that's dressed up like me... in there?
I know- I can tell that's not me, that's just someone else... unless you think that's Asperchu [Laughs at own joke]
But yeah... no. Uh... I like the art style is good- just... meh... [Laughs oddly] Um.. [In a nasally voice:] maybe we'll talk, we'll see. The shoes... meh

Doxxing
A redditor warns contestants via email that they have been doxxed.
During the video, while looking through the submissions, Chris revealed private information about some contestants, such as their names and email addresses.
Users of the subreddit r/ChrisChanSonichu commented[4] upon this, saying:
smoodoos1
Chris said he wouldn't dox anyone; however, in his video, he proceeded to not censor several email addresses.
Tigs1112
I bet the weens are going to spam those uncensored emails.
TsukasaElkKite
I politely emailed them letting them know Chris doxxed them and that they should report the video.
Warning Emails
The Reddit user TsukasaElkKite emailed at least two of the doxxed individuals, warning them and encouraging them to report the video for privacy violation. It is unclear if these warnings are what led to the taking down of the video. However, the video was unavailable until the 20th of March 2024 and listed the reason as "This video is no longer available due to a privacy claim by a third party"[5].

14 February 2023
Hi [REDACTED] I know you don't know me but I'm emailing you to let you know that Chris doxxed you in his latest video by showing your full name and email address at timestamp 1:40. I'd highly suggest you report the video for privacy violation.

to clear this as well so Sanu Prime and
I separate individuals as if Sanu Prime

separate from and Son Prime and myself
side by side separate

count should let you know were separate
individuals I'm not San Prime San Prime

necessary at
all
uh speaking of Valentine's Day a love
while ago this is like taking it up and
amping it up even further literally I
mean just I love love love
this so love and tender Embrace so nice
so
authentic now I mean obviously with this
is one example of putting love and
compassion and empathy behind your art
your pieces and your work
the love and compassion that's what I
really do appreciate when it comes to
when it comes to not only art but also
in
stories and other media and chronic
links this is a really good example you
can learn from this love makes the world
go
round well what else can I say about
this
one

Chris: Hey everybody, Hay-Zeus Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu Prime here once again, [Sigh] and yesterday was a very good birthday for me thank you for asking- everybody who was thankful
and all that.
[Stammers] recording this today on the 25th... yesterday was 24th... anyway... aside from that... so.
We're here to announce and display the top F- the art of the top five artists... from the art contest. [Signature hmm]
And of course the lucky 10 will be uh... getting... the top 10 we'll be getting the uh... lovely prizes but at this point uh we're emphasizing on the... top five... but I will offer a few honorable mentions.
As a proceeding for this part so anyway without further Ado...
[Shows Sonic and whale art entry]
Alright so we got to give it up to... [Tired breath] Mr Matts here... give us this lovely piece with the... the whale under Sonic just... very good.
But then what makes this individual does not qualify for even the... top 10...
[Chris changes to unflattering comic entry]
...it's essentially so we- so we appreciate- we really do appreciate those that do their own... comic panels and whatnot but just uh... [Giggles]
This individual I mean caricature- caricaturist appreciate and all just...
I mean you don't exaggerate features I mean... I'm not fat for one thing... and you don't need to do the whole... skin details and all that that's
just out of the way... but anyway so... still this guy put in the effort so that's why he may into the top 20 at least so... thank you very much for that.
[Cuts to Sonichu and Rosechu art]
I love this artist making a Sonichu and Rosechu... making them into Sentai Warriors... at least from an alternate dimension in Universe... very, very, very nice indeed.
So just... very good stuff.
[Cuts to some Dragon-Sonichu Art]
Alright, this individual right here... giving us this lovely yellow steam dragon right here I mean... this guy is capable of like you know just...
If he's capable of drawing a mechanical Dragon like this he... could definitely do like Autobots of Decepticons or whatever so...
very good quality on this and also the fact they put this on a trading card even... just... very good stuff. very very so good top 20 guy right here.
[Cuts to Chris MLP art]
And I got to get- give love to this especially since I thought these glasses... were the mouth at first but then the mouth down there... then just [In an insane voice:] with the ears,
and the quills this just so cute and cool... but then... she also brought-
[Chris shows another piece of MLP art by same artist]
gave me this one within the past week so... very grateful this is very very nice and lovely [Moans in delight] [Nods] I mean... obviously night star is not going to be... that small...
for me... a Pony... but still... this is... really really good... [quietly:] thank you.
[Cuts to the Chaotic Combo art]
Of course right here... with the rainbow and the... five and the five of the chaotic combo with sonichu just... very very nice...
got to give it... really good quality right here I'm so grateful for this... I'm so glad to be able to Hon- honor this as an honourable mention at the least. Congratulations... for being here.
Thank you.
[Cuts to SonichuXRosechu Valentines art]
And of course this lovely piece- now THIS... right here is an example pf playing love, compassion and empathy... into your art, into your creations... and everything... I mean very right, very
on point. I still really, really like this. Thank you. You'll- gotta go very far.
[Cuts to Sonichu art]
And this lovely individual was able to give me Sonichu running on a- on a chaos rainbow... within the- within on a cosmos type- on a cosmos style or otherwise just the whole...
thing here but this still... this is very very nice. Thank you so much.
[Cuts to Godess Chris Art]
[In a WatchMojo-esque voice]
And coming at number five is this lovely piece that came in from the past week... really good quality poster art.
Quite inspiring, this could be a- this could potentially be... a book cover. It's just so very very nice I mean obviously... kind of over-accentuated on the muscles... you don't have to be so much on the face
like that [Laughs] still... very very good. This person even... presented me with a video... of the process they went to into drawing this.
Congratulations being at number five... very good.
[Cuts to Rosechu art]
And coming at number four we we have this lovely- we have this lovely lady who gave us this Rosy Rosechu... [Giggles] I mean qu- obviously this one's quite popular- quite stylized I'm very
grateful- the only note I to give for this is just that the legs being too thick but other than that... very very nice. Congratulations being number four. Within the top five! [High pitched:] Yay!
[Cuts to Roselga art]
And number three this lovely individual gave us this lovely OC... I mean this is an artist that show- that can show like uh... [Out of breath] they could be on par... with the uh...
the St- the uh proportions and the style... of the anthropomorphic individual about... this size... or... you know even the potentially Sonichu or Rosechu. So is very very good... [Breaths hard on mic]
Just fun... congratulations. Thank you.
[Cuts to comicbook styled art of Sonichu]
[Watch mojo energy returns:]
And at number two, I've got to give it to Saaaaage. Gave me a lot of examples- I mean just- I was more than impressed... and then even more impressed with this lovely Recreation of a page
from the book... 12. [Chuckles] and- this is really on par... to book page... style... and everything... which I'm... very grateful to be blessed with this Talent. Thank you so much.
[Cuts to Sonich-esque OC art]
And our lovely number one winner, [Laughs] is... is this- this lovely individual gave us this piece, the same individual that did... the... happy birthday... piece that
I've showed off in the past couple of videos.
And... able to do this with this style and this Love this empathy and compassion... very, very high level, VERY good quality. And just I'm so happy to be able to bless this individual with the uh...
number one spot... and I want to further exemplify... that this... this individual... who's got real good light power righteousness and good... within her...is a one of a very few...
within... a particular part of this world that is literally, mostly, toxic. So obviously... [Catches breath] this individual is going to get saved...
and everything will be good for this individual and the very few... that is about as good authentic and light-powered.
So anyway... [Holds up hand to bless] I personally bless this individual... and of course I personally bless everybody who participates in this-
who participate in this contest... congratulations ALL OF YOU. You have imp- you'all have impressed me... and y'all have done well.
Just thank you all so so much...
[Cuts to Chris front and centre screen]
Alright so yes indeed that was- those top five... with the honourable mentions right before them.
And I have a really great time with this- with this contest and uh I'll be getting in touch with everybody personally. [Ruh-roh]
With a lovely little uh... you know letting them know that they've won. Uh you know... there the other five that's within the top 10... receiving their prizes and all.
And just like the honourable mention here and there any way [Catches breath]. Thank you all so much for your participation your kindness and your devotion...
