================================================================================

Manipulation Disclosure: The views Chris
expresses may or may not be his own. Many of Chris's videos were orchestrated behind the scenes by trolls putting ideas in his head or goading him to act out; the majority of these interactions was never released to the public.
"It's UGH!" is the bizarre name to a video Chris uploaded on 24 July 2009, before removing it a short time later in usual CWC fashion. The video features him begrudgingly singing along to the song "OK2BGay" by Danish bubblegum dance singer Tomboy. At the end of the video,
he curses at Jack Thaddeus (who had made Chris hump his PS3 within the same day) and "Samantha whatever."
Note that Chris, in this video, is visibly disgusted and offended by a tongue in cheek pro-gay song. While the song's message (it's okay to be gay, obviously) is intended to be serious, lines like "pick up the soap" are clearly being sung in a humorous manner. It should be noted that he is not wearing the Sonichu Medallion in either of these videos, indicating that he is not sincere with his endorsement of homosexuality.

[Up until 0:36, the only audio from the video is the opening of the song's video version. Chris is shown grimacing in pain over the chorus of JERKS singing. He starts singing at 0:37, in a very unsettling, yet quite on point Yoda impression. Chris actually talks at 4:04.]
It's okay to be gay, let's rejoice with the boys in the gay way
Hooray for the kind of man that you will find in the gay way
It's okay to be gay, let's rejoice with the boys in the gay way
Hooray for the kind of man that you will find in the gay way
Father figures we are
You're a shooting star you come so far
I was once in your shoes
In a closet like you
I had nothing to lose
Hey man gay man pick up the soap
Get on your knees and pray
Hey man gay man
Release your load
You've got to cease to delay
The gay way
It's okay to be gay, let's rejoice with the boys in the gay way
Hooray for the kind of man that you will find in the gay way
Hooray! For the man!
Ooh, strong man
Queen of the balls
Some brotherly love is a pleasure for all
Come out
Open your eyes
It's a matter of size
Hey man gay man pick up the soap
Get on your knees and pray
Hey man gay man
Release your load
you've got to cease to delay
The gay way
It's okay to be gay, let's rejoice with the boys in the [Chris snickers] gay way [gagging sounds]
(Okay to be gay!)
Hooray for the kind of man that you will find in the gay way [exaggerated groan]
Sing hallelujah (sing hallelujah)
It's getting to ya (it's getting to ya)
Hey! Ho! Mo! Hey! Ho! Mo! Hey! Ho! Mo! Hey, ho...
Now remember
There's a big difference between kneeling down and bending over
It's o-kay to... be... UGH! [unintelligible] let's rejoice with the boys in the gay way
(It's okay!)
Hooray for the kind of man that you will find in the gay way [angry retching noises]
West is where you should go
To San Francisco
I get that you know
Would you gather my face
So united we stand in a gay parade
A human serenade [Chris pauses, then continues to groan]
Hoor-argh, man, man, it's-er grab, in the gay way [retching noises]
It's okay to be gay, let's rejoice with the boys in the gay way
Hooray for the kind of man that you will find in the gay way [groan]
It's okay to be gay!
Ugh. Yech. Ung. Uck. Damn you, Jack Thaddeus slash Samantha whatever.
Remake
Chris thought he would be clever if he made the video by not actually titling the video "It's Okay to be Gay," in addition to having tags "It's a Mockery you damn, dirty homos."
Jack Thaddeus, not satisfied with Chris handing him a video where he sings in a dumb voice and covers himself on camera most of the time, wanted a version of him singing it with more vigor.
It's____, a remake of It's UGH!, was uploaded on the following day, 25 July 2009. Chris sings the song in a more energetic and upbeat manner. He is seen disguised with a Groucho Marx mask, along with the hat of his Officer Nasty sex doll. Note, surprisingly, that Chris looks somewhat thinner in this video which just goes to show that black (especially when paired with stained sex-doll accessories) really is slimming. The YouTube search tags read out, "It's a Mockery you damn dirty homos." He changes some of the pronouns of the lyrics to "she". In the last sentence of the video, he says that it's not okay to be gay, as yet another feeble attempt to "outwit" the trolls.

Altered description
The next day, Chris added a changed description.
I INFORM YOU TRUE,
I was Blackmailed originally into singing that Damn, Dirty Song. Upon Initial Reading of the Lyrics, I FELT QUEASY and GOING TO THROW UP. I expressed that Fully in the FIRST TRIAL of singing it, even though I deleted it, someone else may have Mirrored those Close-Ups of my body and Vocals. I REMAIN STRONG AND TRUE; ONLY Straightness is Rightous; "Gay" IS "Stupid", and DO NOT use the word "Gay" IN ANY SENTENCE, UNLESS you are actually talking to or about a PAPER-CERTIFIED Homosexual (they're already all damned).
I AM A PAPER-CERTIFIED STRAIGHT MAN; I Personally Hold ALL the paperwork.
For the while, with "Stan Bush" at my PSP/PC/PS3 offering me Inspiration to continue on. I required an instance WHY of all human and God-Giving Reason, and if it was AT ALL, that original track ever GOOD and Beneficial for the Cause to Stay Straight. It took an Ex-Troll-Turned-Friend to let me know that TomBoy ORIGINALLY wrote that song as a MOCKERY. That was ALL I need to know and hear to MAKE MY MOCKERY to Gays, and SING ON. I have fulfilled my End of the Deal with Victory and Valour towards the Rightous Cause of Being Straight. I had "From the darkness stumbled into the Light". While it "Seems like it's been Forever", This was the "Last Round" that I had to "Fight for what I Know IS RIGHT". "Everyone may try to Break my Spirits, Keepin' Me Down," But NO MORE.
I, "Christopher" Christian Weston Chandler, of Ruckersville and Charlottesville, Virginia; TRUE ORIGINAL Creator of Sonichu and Rosechu, WITH EYE-WITNESSES back on HIS and HER Dates Of Creation and Birth, AM BACK, and I will not stand idle and be Disrespected with fellow Local Citizens of all Genders and Races Falling in That Disrespect In My Wake.
I thank you ALL to RESPECT and CONTINUE RESPECTING Me, My Friends, My Hometowns, and THESE United States of America. I AM STRAIGHT; CUT YOUR DAMN, DIRTY "GAY" THEORIES THE FUCK OFF THE FACE OF THE UNIVERSE FOREVER.
Thank You.
