================================================================================

Cheerleader is a video leaked on 25 February 2012 in which Chris acts as a cheerleader for Jackie (or "Jacjie"), wearing a tank top and denim skirt.
For reasons unknown, the video is sped up, although this fails to make the process of viewing it any less drawn-out or excruciating.

Transcript
[The whole video is visibly sped up in editing, although not the audio]
[Chris steps out, in tomgirl garb and pom poms. He does some awkward shakes of the pom poms and some knee-kicks.]
Rah rah ree! Kick 'em in the knee! Rah rah rut! Kick 'em in the other knee!
[Chris unsuccessfully tries to spell 'KICK" with his body.]
Just a little warm up!
[He doesn't even try to get the letters right in his movements anymore as he indulges in a series of kicks.]
J! A! C! J! I! E! Jackie! Who's that girl who can't be beat? Jackie! Jackie! Who's that girl who-- she's so sweet! Jackie! Jackie!
[Chris moves toward the camera, his mouth not moving, to reveal that he's either dubbed over his movements or he just can't render a video for shit.]
