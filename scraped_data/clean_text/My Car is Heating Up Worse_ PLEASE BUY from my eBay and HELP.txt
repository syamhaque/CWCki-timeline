A photo Chris posted of the car's dashboard, indicating the car is overheating
My Car is Heating Up Worse; PLEASE BUY from my eBay and HELP! is a YouTube video Chris uploaded on 18 July 2018. In the video, Chris, sporting a Sailor Moon tiara, begs for people to buy items from his eBay listings to pay for repairs to his overheating car.
As possibly the thousandth example of how Chris is bad with money, he had spent over $200 buying Sega Genesis and Commodore 64 consoles less than two weeks before,[1][2] money which could have gone to an emergency fund for situations such as this.
The mechanical issue threatening Chris's mode of transport comes just 9 days before BronyCon - a 137-mile (220 km) trip. It's apparent then that Chris has already recovered from his TooManyGames fiasco and is eager to attend more conventions. Notably, the Chandlers possess another car, Barb's Dodge Caravan, so Chris could ask his mother to borrow it for the weekend instead of risking the trip in Son-Chu.
Throughout the video, Chris's voice constantly fluctuates from his normal monotone to an incredibly ear-piercing shriek. When he's not stretching his voice to almost unlistenable levels, Chris also slurs his words and has heavy bags under his eyes, which makes one wonder if Chris was sober while filming this video; let alone driving around.
Shortly after the video was made, Chris dropped the car off to a mechanic as an emergency case and will have to raise money to afford the bill when it comes due.[3]
In November of that same year, Son-Chu Mk III finally died.

A fan inquired:
Have you had it looked at? My older car used to do this if it was overdue for an oil change, you should wait until the engine is cool and add radiator fluid or water to the radiator. Don't do it when it's hot or it might boil out on you.
Chris answered:
I had it looked at last week for the AC problem; they found a coolant leak or two; figured they would be okay to ride out a while, but, obviously, NO. Refill the Coolant yesterday with 50/50; the reservoir is down 25%! Dropped off the car at the Auto Garage...it will likely be $200 or so in the end; need those BIG SALES Quickly, Please! Or, can I get 90 People on the Autograph Cards for $5 apiece, please?
Subsequently, he raised the price on his autograph cards to $25 each.
