Idea Guy Manipulation Disclosure:
The views Chris expresses are extremely unlikely to be his own. This video was orchestrated behind the scenes by the Idea Guys putting ideas in his head or goading him to act out; not all of these interactions were released to the public.
Chris apologizes to Gwen is a video Chris filmed for Gwen, a character portrayed by Idea Guy Stephen Boyd, during The Bad Beginning chat. The video was leaked by Guard Dog Null as one of the examples of the Idea Guys' manipulation of Chris.
In the video, Chris, under duress, apologizes for behavior the Idea Guys had brainwashed him into believing he had done.
