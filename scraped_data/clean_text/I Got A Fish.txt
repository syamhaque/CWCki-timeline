“
Welcome to the David Lynch movie of your nightmares.
”
WBCN, hitting the nail on the head.
I Got A Fish is a video uploaded by Chris to YouTube on 27 April 2009. In this video, Chris jog-dances in place while a stupid song full of random-access humor that he made up plays in the background. The song is about his apparent possession of a wish-granting fish; despite this claim, he does not actually have one. It should be noted that the video features a voiceover, something he didn't do often. It's also probably the closest that Chris has ever come to carrying an actual tune.
The video is one of the few cases where the mainstream media got in on it.
The audio file included with the Power series of videos is an edited version of this song, with the word "fish" replaced with "dick." According to a text file included with the videos, the audio file was edited by a troll with the username "falsionmkII".
Chris referenced the song in Twelve New and Old Things of Christmas (2015), and again on New Year's Day 2020, where he included it in his first tweet of the decade.[1] In a 2024 Minecraft livestream, Chris offered a live performance of the song with altered lyrics after a viewer donated to request it.
