Chris's old room was cluttered with toys.
Chris's "Work Room" was also cluttered with toys.
Chris has accumulated a grand number of toys over the course of his life, most of which are displayed in his room. He has claimed that he's holding on to them for his future children.[1], though he has also admitted to be still purchasing and playing with toys well into his "adult" life.[2] At one point he revealed that he plays with his toys for around 2-3 hours a day.[3] Many are assumed to have been damaged or destroyed in the 2014 house fire, but some have survived; Chris has purchased new ones ever since and has likely gone and replaced at least some of the lost ones.
In 2023, following the incest scandal, Chris moved to Big Island, VA. Several of his possessions from 14 Branchland Court were seen in the new house within the backgrounds of photographs or shown during livestreams.[4][5]

Background
It is not unusual for adults to play with toys, but when they do, there is a good reason other than just playing with them like a little kid.
For example, adults often buy soft toys to celebrate an occasion such as a birthday or wedding, or to cope with loneliness or trauma. Toys have also inspired innovation: for example, a community of circuit benders buy used battery-powered electronic toys to create new sounds and visual effects. In the 1960s, Monopoly play money inspired a Dutch graphic designer to rewrite the rules for designing money at home and abroad.[6]
Even Lego blocks have legitimate uses in adulthood: Chinese human rights activist Ai Weiwei launched an exhibition that featured the portraits of 43 Mexican students who disappeared in 2014, made entirely of Lego blocks. Ai aimed to convey the “democratic utility” of Lego, specifically to raise awareness of Mexico’s problem with organized crime.[7] CWCki readers from Denmark may also be familiar with a scene in the 1979 comedy film The Olsen Gang Never Surrenders, where one of the gang members created an electronic Lego device to break into a building.
