He really did.
I Pimp My Ride.MOV is a video uploaded by Chris on 5 May 2010.
Some time earlier, the CWCki featured a page with detailed information on how easy it is to place a bugging device in a PS3. Not to be outdone by the trolls who keep stealing Chris's PSN accounts, Chris shows how he has removed the Wi-Fi antenna from his PS3, believing that this makes covert information transmission over WLAN much harder (this claim can not be substantiated by even the brightest of the CWCki geeks).
Chris brags about his technological prowess and virtual victory over the trolls all while wearing a never-before-seen, ill-fitting Pokémon shirt. The shirt reads "Books-A-Million Trainer", a position which he dubiously held back in 2000; the shirt certainly looks that old. He then takes out his PS3 keyboard controller (that has wheels taped on to it) and a Lego car, and proclaims that he has "Pimped His Ride".
Chris's actual ride remains un-pimped.
