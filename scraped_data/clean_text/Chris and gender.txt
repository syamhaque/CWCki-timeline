Chris's gender issues in a nutshell.
Similar to the topic of faith and the topic of morality, Chris's actual beliefs on gender and how it is classified are more complex than his stated beliefs. For someone so preoccupied with gender identity, Chris displays a staggering ignorance of how either gender typically behaves, and his views of both genders are extremely warped due to him taking the stereotypes he is presented with in television and music at face value.

Understanding of Biological Sex
“
Imagine you have a newborn child whose sex cannot be determined. A risk-free surgery performed immediately could provide normal male or female sexual and reproductive function. Which would you choose?
”
An actual question from Chris's OkCupid, asking him about a proposed intersex child.[2]
“
If a Hermaphrodite, I would raise it to be male regardless since it would not have any eggs anyway. Plus big bonus for (him) in sex with all women (lesbians included I would imagine).
”
Chris, answering by opposing the idea of giving his proposed kid a sex-change surgery, often misconstrued for Chris wanting to transition in order to attract lesbians.[2]
The point at which Chris draws the line at someone being "male" or "female" appears to be based on a number of external traits which he notices about them, such as their "attractiveness" and what body parts they have.
This is apparent when he called Bailey Jay a "hermaphrodite", and compared the discovery of her being transgender to scenes from "The Crying Game" and "The Cleveland Show" involving transgender characters, entailing that he believed that all trans people who identify as "women" were either just men in dresses (who he often times grouped together with the homos), or true and honest women that just happened to have a penis. Predictably, his measuring stick in this regard was seemingly based on how "pretty" he deemed them, or how much he liked them, much like with Bailey, who he admitted having conflicting feelings about, and even apologized to after she admitted to being hurt by Chris's comment. Inversely, he refused to show any sort of respect towards Francine's identity, calling her voice shrill, and making comments about how little she did in terms of transitioning.[3] Chris however, never applied this criteria to himself, deeming himself as a sort of paragon of femininity, depicting himself as such when he deemed himself a CPU Goddess, and boasting about his own transition milestones, despite many people noting he didn't look much different from how he did before.[3]
Chris however stated a couple times that if he were to have a "hermaphrodite" for a child, he'd
raise them as a boy.[4] When asked about raising an intersex child, or a child "whose sex cannot be determined", he took this to be referring to his oddly specific definition of the term, saying that he'd also raise them as a boy for not having ovaries, even referring to them by he/him pronouns, in the hopes of them scoring all kinds of women (including lesbians), further indicating he also views biological sex through the lens of a person's genitals.[2] Chris also seems to deem trans women that do get surgery as "fully female", as evidenced by him referring to Rosechu and Sylvana as such after having their penises removed, giving further credence to this.
Despite this, Chris also believes that all bodies, regardless of them being "male" or "female", all have the same physiological functionalities under the correct circumstances, and that someone's sex can be easily changed. He, for example, believed that those with a penis can get pregnant, theorizing that it may be possible by his mate's egg winding up inside him, and getting fertilized by his sperm. Chris similarly proposed the idea that those that are born male may actually have a vagina inside of them, misconstruing the biological fact that human fetuses have "female" organs (such as nipples and developing vulvas) before getting a Y chromosome, leading to the second instance where he mutilated his own taint.[5] Chris had also shared two clickbait articles on Facebook, which stated that one's sex is merely what one is assigned with at birth, to which William Elliott Waterman pointed out was factually incorrect, sharing another article.[6] Chris also believed that trans women can get periods the same way that cis women do, as evidenced by a reply he had made towards the trans influencer LifeofBria, where she conflated getting period-like symptoms as a result of being on hormone replacement therapy with having a full-on period, a process primarily defined by the shedding of the uterine lining in preparing for a potential pregnancy.[7] Chris unequivocally agreed with this, stating his own mood swings were his "period".[8]
Understanding of Gender Identity
Besides his complicated views on biological sex, Chris also had a difficult time articulating his views on gender identity, a topic which he wouldn't explore until he himself tried to experiment with his own gender and presentation.
Terminology
Prior to transitioning, Chris has used a number of pejoratives to refer to trans people. As stated previously, Chris often grouped trans people together with the homos, particularly the ones that he refused to respect the identities of, and referred to them as such. This was because he viewed homosexual men through the stereotype of them being innately effeminate or flamboyant, and even cited them "forcing their flamboyancy" on other people after he had gotten discovered on Tomboys and Tomgirls of Virginia.[9] It was only natural then that Chris would also wind up using the term on people he strictly viewed as "effeminate men", leading to some degree of confusion on what he was referring to in some cases.
While exploring his gender identity, Chris navigated a linguistic minefield of transgender, transsexual, transvestite, intersex, bisexual, hermaphrodite, and his own tomgirl, leading to some confusion as he adapted and experimented. On his OKCupid profile, when asked, "Would you date a transgender person," he replied, "Yes, as long as she was born female and was still female (or a tomboy)."[2] He told Jackie that the fact that he loved wearing women’s clothing did not make him a “transvestite.”[10] He told gal-pal Rebeckah Bentley that the unclit made him “bisexual” when he meant intersex; he promptly flipped his shit when Rebeckah asked if he wanted to fuck dudes now.[11] Chris also used the term tranny to describe himself prior to actually committing to being transgender, which is a can of worms due to its association as a derogatory term against trans people.
Chris also appears to believe that intersexuality is a special condition involving ANY sort of gender non-conformity within a person, including being transgender or having one's genitals changed. As stated previously, Chris has also at a time used the terms "transgender" and "intersex" interchangeably, believing that they both mean the same thing. For example, Chris on several occasions referred to himself as "intersex", due to having a penis, but having a "lesbian soul", failing to understand that the term is explicitly used for individuals that have BOTH male and female gametes, which he doesn't have.
On 14 August 2014, he came out publicly, although as what exactly wasn’t certain, given his garbled and inconsistent vocabulary. The initial announcement was that he was "a Tomgirl, Intersex of Female Soul with Male Body, and a Tranny Cross-Dresser." Apparently unbeknownst to Chris, intersex is a chromosomal condition causing ambiguous genitalia and can present in many forms, none of which appear to be true of Chris. Then he said he was a "Lesbian Identified Man and a Cross-Dressing Tranny." Two weeks later he was telling Catherine that he was a "Lesbian tomgirl transgender male" but also "three-quarters woman." By September he seemed to have settled on "Lesbian Transgender (a Female, Lesbian Soul trapped in a male body)."[12] In April 2015, apparently no longer a "man," he changed his Facebook pronoun to "she" and his name to "Christine".[13] This month also saw the beginning of a flurry of Facebook "likes" for all sorts of progressive transgender issues, such as restroom choice and gay marriage. Whatever he was, he was certainly proud of it, and wasted no time trying to persuade his new L(G)BT personal army to wage war against local manajerks.
Pronouns
Chris tends to use the preferred pronouns of other transgender people that he likes, such as the MTF violet4151[14] and Miss Cherry, and the FTM Lukas of the Teen Troon Squad and Nowacking.
The exceptions to this occurred under troll manipulation, in the case of Jack Thaddeus, who he claimed would never be a part of "femdom" after getting a sex change, and when he flip-flopped between referring to the troll transwoman character Jeff Ouzuo with female and male pronouns.
Cis People and Gender Roles
Females
See also: Women's rights
Chris repeatedly asserts his reverence of women, and seems to have a comparatively glowing opinion of them, stating that he finds women "empathetic". But, as stated at the beginning of the article, the truth is more complicated. While Chris has always preferred female friends, and is known to be far more accommodating of lesbians than gay men, even going so far as to identify as one himself, in truth, Chris has a distinctly sexist view of women. Based on his failed attempts at getting girls at the mall, Chris views females as hyper-sexual, preoccupied with shopping, given to conversing with others for hours, and fixated on getting married and having children. This is highly evident in his female characters in Sonichu. As a matter of fact, In Sonichu #9, he referred to women as another species. This seems to be hyperbole, but considering Chris's abysmal knowledge of the sciences, it is difficult to be sure. His Rosechu character who is a living embodiment of how Chris believes all women behave, has a "personality" which consists solely of the traits listed above, which is considered ironic as Chris constantly tries to show Rosechu with a passion for Women's Rights. Despite trying to portray them as being equal in power to their male counterparts, Chris rarely depicts Rosechus fighting, more often simply leaving them on the sidelines of a battle to wail like damsels in distress, even when their boyfriends are in mortal danger. Even outside battle, they tend to be little more than organic sex toys for the Sonichus.
Males
Main article: JERKS
Chris has harbored a deep hatred for men ever since his teenage years, because he was bullied in grade school (largely because of his bloated ego making him extremely annoying to be around), not to mention the fact that Chris is known to fly into fits of jealous rage whenever he sees a man more successful than him, especially if that man is getting some and he isn't. This gradually blossomed into a general distaste for masculine traits such as body hair; indeed, in his nudes it is apparent that he is surprisingly meticulous in shaving his body hair, certainly compared to other aspects of grooming. He also has stated, as shown in this video, a disgust for "topless men" and encourages men to wear muscle bras so he doesn't have to see their nipples. He even made a (now outdated) short list of the men he doesn't consider "jerks", which included himself, his father and Santa Clause [sic]. Chris's misandry continued after identifying as a "tomgirl"; he has variously referred to men in general as "barbarians" and "Neanderthals", which, coming from him, are rather ironic accusations for a number of reasons.
Chris has since relaxed his former misandric attitude and no longer takes issue with the company of men.
Trans People
Himself
Main articles: Transgender and Gender dysphoria
Chris's Twitter bio as observed shortly before spending nearly two years in jail. As of 2024, the profile matches this description.
It has been speculated for a long time that Chris has gender issues, confirmed in 2016 when he was diagnosed with gender identity disorder.[15] In 2005, he created Crystal Weston Chandler, a female version of himself. In Christian Weston Chandler's FUTURE MESSAGE, he mentioned that you should try out the opposite gender's toys while keeping your original gender in mind, possibly indicating that he may have been in denial about transgenderism long before becoming a tomgirl. He also wondered what he would be like if he were born a female.[16]
In 2014 Chris came out as a "lesbian-identified male" before identifying as a "trans woman". After transitioning, Chris adopted the name Christine to accompany his new gender identity along with the corresponding personal pronouns.
In 2019 Chris updated his Twitter to reaffirm his gender pronouns.[17]
Also, I Am Female; please address and talk about me with the correct Pronouns. She/Her/Hers.
Thank You.
😊
As of 28 September 2020, Chris's Twitter includes a pinned tweet reiterating that he is "Female" and uses she/her/hers pronouns. His twitter biography also refers to himself as Mrs. Christine W. Chandler Sonichu and continues to emphasize the use of she/her/hers pronouns.
[18]
Other Trans People
Main article: Hermaphrodite
Prior to transitioning, Chris had also noticeably had a fairly negative stance on other trans people, particularly trans women. Chris spent many years struggling to articulate his position on transgender topics. Prior to his own exploration of transgenderism, he confessed that he was uncomfortable with the idea of transgender people, and made it clear that he was not sexually attracted to them.[19] “I have given thought about the transgenders and transvesites; I do not feel comfortable with them….[D]icks are dicks, and I do not care about them, except for my own,” he wrote in a January 2009 chat.[20]
He later reiterated: “I Do Not Care Much for Transgender People or Hermaphrodites, but I do not discriminate them as individual people.”[21]
Non-binary genders
“
"I really did not know how many genders there are, but I am not and do not judge. Have a good day."
”
Chris's beliefs on Non-Binary Genders
Given how complicated of a topic gender is to tackle, especially today, people will tend to argue about what classifies as a "gender" and therefore some people might argue that there exists more than two. In Chris's case, believing everything he sees without giving it a second thought, also concluded that there really are more than two genders simply looking at a Facebook post about how Facebook is allowing their users to identify themselves as 58 different genders on September 17, 2016, taking it to mean that there are in fact 58 genders. [22] The next month, Chris is interviewed on the same topic, and is asked how many genders there are, and simply says there are 58 all because of that same Facebook post. [23]

↑ Chris changed the gender marker on his driver's license to identify him as female in 2016. The procedure to do this in Virginia is to have a professional whose "practice includes the treatment and counseling of persons with gender identity issues" vouch for the person's gender identity on this form.
