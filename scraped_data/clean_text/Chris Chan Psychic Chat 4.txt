KwaiiSandbag: Hello.
Chris: Hello!
KwaiiSandbag: Hi.
Lily: Hello.
KwaiiSandbag: How are- how are you doing?
Lily: Can you hear me? Hold on.
KwaiiSandbag: Hello?
Chris: I can hear you.
Lily: There we go. I can hear you now. Sorry, I don’t know what was going on.
KwaiiSandbag: Sorry about that. Sometimes my Discord is weird. Hello.
Chris: Hey.
KwaiiSandbag: Um. How are you?
Chris: Well, I’m faring. I definitely could be better, but you know. Big plus today. I mean, really good birthday present.
KwaiiSandbag: Oh, what’d you get?
Chris: Ah. Fitbit Blaze.
KwaiiSandbag: Very cool.
Chris: Yeah. And it took me a little while to uh… to set it up and obviously swap out the old one. I’m giving it to a friend of mine who’s… can definitely use it. She started running recently.
KwaiiSandbag: Mmm. I see.
Chris: Aside from that… pretty much everything has been... I came back last Wednesday about 7:30 when Sonichu and I fatedly return body swapped and I’m still resyncing with my body and having to deal with my body… and it’s been really bumming me out because it hardly… cause I was unable to get a satisfying relationship in this universe and then it’s jealous of me because while I was swapped in Sonichu’s body, I literally had sex with Magichan, Cryzel, Sylvana, even Mewtwo. So there’s all that and now it’s given me a bit of a pain in the heart like as if I’ve gotten a broken heart all over again and it’s affecting me in the heart and Solar Plexus chakra as well".
KwaiiSandbag: I know it's a little hard right now because of Covid... but have you tried going out into the world and trying to find a relationship?
Chris: Yeah, I don’t have much time to look for a new relationship… since we have everything going on with the merge going on so… unless something fated happens in the near future amongst my local friends who actually I will be seeing again in the near future... Unless that happens then… more likely Magichan will be coming here and becoming fully physical. He'll be coming here to this universe - and I've been guiding him here. My body is fully into this and I'm supporting it obviously because I want him with me as well.
KwaiiSandbag: Yes. Now, tell me about these friends you keep mentioning. I’m very curious.
Chris: Uh… They are our allies at… at this company called Praetor. It's a small business. They've uh… they've been making the medallions on my behalf and we're working on getting the books and even the Shipfic Folder cards for Sonichu up and- up and available and printed and all that.
Lily: Oh wow. That's really cool.
Chris: So business partners and friends with a bit of psyc- with a bit of psychic powers amongst them as well. But as… as my hubby says, uh… it's good to have multiple viewpoints, so it's good to have multiple psychics and we've been trying to get to round up as many psychics in this universe as possible to, uh… help figure these things out on this- on this side of the, uh, dimension rift and all that.
KwaiiSandbag: Mhm. Now, I have- I have a question about your time in C-197.
Chris: Okay.
KwaiiSandbag: Do you have any, uh, notable psychic experiences that happened? I'm- I'm a little bit curious, like, or just any experiences that are noteworthy from C-197.
Chris: Well, even though it was Sonichu's body, I had access to my abilities since I'm just- since I'm essentially the soul. I got the- I got everything within me in general so I was able to manifest that out through Sonichu’s body and hands easily enough. So I end up over the 10 months and 24 days time giving him a bit of psychic power of his own that he's been able to utilize lately that he's still getting used to and feeling pretty positive about that. So yeah just- I mean, what hasn't happened with the, uh, psychic powers over there with me?
10:52 timestamp
Chris: So yeah… Caleb, you have psychic powers… you’ve obviously put some thought into me and my situations recently – I mean, you could have gotten a glimpse of what’s going on I just confirmed it and told you more so… um from your perspective, what do you see in the near future for satisfying my body's need for cuddling and all that?
KwaiiSandbag: It’s very hazy, I would say, um… it has to be proactive. [...] However I definitely see you getting your needs met. [...]
Chris: Alright well I mean, if you all foresee any other more clear details on that, please let me know...
