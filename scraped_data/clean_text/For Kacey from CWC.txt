================================================================================

For Kacey (officially For Kacey from CWC) is a video uploaded by Solid Chris on 3 August 2009, under the guise of being the "real" Chris, Liquid Chris, to Liquid's girlfriend, Kacey. She released the video to the world the following day, after Chris came clean about his ruse. To mask that it's not actually Liquid, Chris used a filter on his PSEye to turn down the contrast. This, however, only succeeded in making it pitch-black and watery, and his attempt at hiding his tracks only makes it more suspicious.
This video documents a rare occasion in which Chris feels sympathy towards his father; however, it might be a lie in order to receive some china.
Chris tries to sing REO Speedwagon's "Can't Fight This Feeling" but falters after two lines.

[The video takes place in Chris's room, obscured by low contrast to conceal his hideous appearance]
Hey Kacey, it's me. I'm sorry my, uh, computer seems to be hackting up. Buh, you know sometimes this will happen but, you know, I'm just giving the shoutout I promised:
I love you Kacey. You're a good girl, and the more I talk to you the more I g- the more I appreciate you very much. And there are so many things ye- you have to learn- you have to learn about me, but it will be learned in the near future when you come.
By the way, my parents will be here when you come by later. So they will be very hap- they'll be very happy to, uh, meet you. Y'know at least my father will. He's a nice- he's a nicer parent nowadays, even though back in the old days he used to be such a stick in the mud, but seriously yeah, he's a good guy. My mom's a good woman too- be bit of a redneck sometime, but you know, you earn her trust, she'll be good to ya. But I welcome you. Lovingly with open arms. I'll see you later. [Blows kiss]
[sings] I can't fight this feeling any moreI've forgotten what I started fighting forIt's ... something driftin' up to the shore
I'll see you later.
