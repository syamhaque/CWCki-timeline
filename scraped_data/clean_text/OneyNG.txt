Mentions of Chris
A Sonichu medallion bought by Oney
At some point, when Chris was put in jail following an incident at a local GameStop, Oney, in response to the Twitter user RubberNinja, posted about a Sonichu medallion that he bought from him on the 28th.[1] In he post, he states he is "so glad" to have bought it now.
Back-Talker List
An excerpt from a list of people Chris "doxed" for being "backtalkers" which shows OneyNG's presence on the list.
Chris has seemingly taken note of Oney mentioning him in videos, as Oney wound up making Chris disgruntled enough to add his handle on his list for "back-talkers". Predictably, this gained the attention of many of Oney's fans.
Despite obviously being peeved by the jokes that Oney has made about him, a notable exception to this is when Chris had made a Twitter post in response to the video "Oney Plays Animated: Chris Chan's new job", created by Walderp which animates one of the jokes on Oney's series. Chris claims in the Twitter post that this "silly" joke had actually made him laugh.[2]
Twitter Voice Clip
On 19 June 2021, Chris posted an audio recording through Twitter's voice function. It is a recording of Chris reciting and laughing at a joke that was made in an OneyPlays video. Chris, for a change, took a joke at his expense in stride.

Chris: Oh man, he made me laugh--they made me laugh. (chuckles) "Why would they call it pepper spray if it's not pepper, hmm?" (laughs) There you go, you got one outta me. (laughs again) I like that joke! "Why would they call it pepper spray if it's not pepper, hmm?" (Chris laughs)
