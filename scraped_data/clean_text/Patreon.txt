Chris, September 2015, on Etsy, after receiving a $1,000 donation for the continuation of Sonichu 11.
“
The only way to see the pages of Book 11 before it is fully completed is to make monthly pledges on my Patreon.
”
Chris, June 2017, going back on his word.
Note his use of someone else's fanart to promote his profile.
Patreon is a website that allows users to make donations to artists, videomakers, musicians, etc. It runs under a subscription-based system where a user can become a monthly or yearly "patron" by purchasing a type of tier, which can allow them to view exclusive content and/or see content early as run by the artist in question. Unlike other websites of its type, it has extremely liberal definitions for fundraising goals and does not impose consequences on creators who fail to deliver,[1] making this the perfect platform for Chris to get paid without doing work.
Chris joined on 30 November 2016. He made multiple mistakes on setting up the account - he set it with a request for $250,000 per month instead of a total goal, he chose to limit big-ticket donations to once per month, he offered redundant gifts for any donors above the $50 mark and he used someone else's fanart of Sonichu and Rosechu for his account profile.
He was "hesitant" to join the site.[2] On 28 November, he said, "I am unable to offer gifts and whatnot, even previews", because he lost his inspiration after Lulu.com banned him from its site for selling fan fiction in December 2015.[3] It was an unusual display of self-awareness from Chris, in that he admitted he would have difficulty meeting his goals. It was in contrast to his time as a seller on Etsy, during which he accepted orders while having a large backlog due to spending too much time on the PS4, which led to the forced closure of his shop for failure to send products.
However, just two days after his initial post on Patreon, he changed his mind after Barb had to pawn a necklace, which she had to sell at a significant loss for $325, due to the Financhu Crisis.
On 2 August 2021, Patreon suspended Chris in light of the incest leaks.[4]

Overview
Honest Content?
The option Chris checked.
When prompted to enter a description for what the account was creating, Chris wrote "Sonichu and Rosechu Official Comic Books and Products." While this was a laughably untrue claim for much of his first year on the site, beginning in June 2017, Chris began to actually draw Sonichu again.
It is marked by Chris as "NSFW", presumably to either keep it from appearing in Patreon's search results, ward off trolls, or both.
Chris embedded Patreon announcement. It was replaced with CLog Special - PATREON & MORE in October 2017.
I am the original creator of Sonichu and Rosechu, Christine Weston Chandler, also known as Christian, Christopher, Chris Chan and so forth among my fan base and many trolls and cyber bullies on the internet since 2000. I have drawn and colored more than eleven books worth of stories, content and so forth, as well as my own official Sonichu and Rosechu figures and merchandise. I am looking to expand, officially, and in person/face-to-face; not long-distant over the internet. (Too many phonies and fakers)
I still reside with my mother and our dogs and cats, and we have a slew of financial problems, alongside a number of being the victim of internet trolls, blackmail and deception, and so forth, that have long emotionally and mentally scarred me greatly. My creativity has been affected, and the only resolve, I feel, is less worries hanging over my head.
And the home finances are a start that I'd like very much to resolve, including the mortgage and debts. And that is why I am here on Patreon, to hopefully free our household of all that financial stress and find better peace of mind for myself to better be able to create again.
The $250,000.00 Goal is the full amount goal; I had not intended to that to be a Montly Amount, but the altogether Goal, in general. My apologies for the confusion there.
The extra $50K in the goal is for allowance for room, and for saving for future rainy day(s).
Goals
$250,000 per month
Pay off ALL of my home's finances, including the Mortgage and Credit Cards, so I can feel better peace of mind and less weight long-time hanging over my head like many hippopotamuses, and will feel better able to draw, color, create and so forth of my very own Sonichu and Rosechu.
In January 2017, Chris edited the goal down to $500 per month.
Rewards offered
For the first seven months, Chris offered a set of rewards which demonstrated his poor understanding of how Patreon works. Beginning in June 2017, he retooled the options to much more reasonable standards.
From November '16 to May '17
Chris's reward section was initially filled with ludicrous stretch-goals, where one will find themselves having more or less the same benefits from pledging $50 a month as pledging $100,000 a month, once again showing Chris's inability to comprehend finances; or he just lazily copy and pasted each of the goals.
Those who pledge should notice just how shit Chris treats, well, everyone. Pledge an incredible amount of money and you will be allowed to make 1 video request, and it must adhere to Chris's strict guidelines. Even someone donating a small fortune every month isn't allowed the freedom to request a video on what they want.
It is also worth noting that donators giving $50 or more every month will be allowed to add Chris on Skype. This will give weens who enjoy burning money to have "direct" contact with Chris, however it is unknown just how frequently he uses Skype, if at all. More likely, his inbox will just be filled up with hundreds of JUUULLLAYYYs and other nonsense that will just be ignored when he signs into Skype.
Prior to revamping his rewards, he had been receiving $28 per month from 4 patrons[5], with two of them subscribing to the $10 tier.[6]

Chris doesn't know how to spell tier.
Chris updates his Patreon reward tiers and added new lower tiers that have no perks. This is likely a move to compensate for the substantial financial loss of his eBay account, which was deleted only weeks earlier after he had consistently failed to send out items. Ironically his Patreon also suffers this same problem, with many patrons leaving comments asking where their perks are and some having not received their rewards in over 9 months.
Chris somehow failed to spell "tier" correctly, on both the Patreon page and his Twitter, despite Patreon spelling the word correctly on his page.

Chris's Patreon growth over three years.
Chris's Patreon started out small, but as time went on, weens threw more and more money at him, not realizing he spends it on frivolities and often fails to send out the rewards promised to patrons, claiming he ran out of money. Patron support continued even during the first few months of the Idea Guy saga, when Chris was too distracted with being trolled to work on the comic. By January 2018, in spite of it having been a full month since Chris's last comic update, Chris's patrons saw fit to award him with his second-highest revenue amount in his time on Patreon, netting him $652 from 24 people[7]. Beginning in April 2018, however, his luck would turn; Chris's backers sharply reduced their pledge amounts, presumably due to Chris's failure to put out new comic pages. On 2 May, Chris whined on social media about it:
I'm feeling a mite upset right now. I just checked my Patreon (All Pledges were processed), it WAS at over $900 total about last Sunday, as said on my Patreon Page; but today, I ended up with $450! UGH!!!
At that point, he had gone for 95 days without updating the comic. Even with the release of Sonichu 12-9 and Sonichu 13 (then known as Sonichu 16), Chris's pledges continued to hemorrhage as he fails to release his contents regularly. To date, his longest dearth of content has been 2,244 days, lasting from October 2019 onwards.
During February 2019, after getting free advertising from a patron's unboxing video, which garnered over 27,000 views during that month, Chris's Patreon rebounded with over a dozen new patrons pledging several hundred dollars, most hoping to receive physical book rewards. However, those patrons were naive, as Chris simply didn't bother to mail out the comics, leading to complaints and donors eventually pulling their support.

Delays on shipping
“
Still very much worth it to go to BronyCon
”
Chris, on why he couldn't afford to ship books during August 2017.[9]
August '17 - Chris took his patrons' money and spent it at BronyCon. After he got back, he posted an update saying shipments would be delayed until September.
18 August
The books have arrived...
But I can't ship them at the while, as local funds are low for us here. I will have them all enveloped and addressed, and later shipped out to y'all on around the first of September. Thank you all for your patience. Still very much worth it to go to BronyCon; I had an awesome time, shared Lots of smiles and memories with new and current friends and celebs alike.
October '17 - Two of Chris's patrons report not receiving their books for the month.[10]
Oct 10
Where my books 😞
When are you going to ship book 2 and 3?? Im two behind 😢😢😢
Luniara, also known as Mellanie Chafe (a commentator/friend on Chris's Facebook since 2015), also complained.[11][12][13] For some reason, she remained a patron, even though Chris failed to answer her concerns.
Nov 1
When will we be recieving our book rewards? =D Do we get tracking numbers?
Nov 28
Hey Christine! Have the books for last month come out? I would prefer to not have to cancel this month for not receiving it. It was intended as a Christmas present.
Nov 28 (on Chris's Facebook)
Huh. By chance, did books from last month go out?
Dec 3
Yeah. Didn't think so. Sneak thief.
Dec 7 (on Chris's Facebook)
Hey Chrissy. Did our books from October rewards get sent out? Mine is a gift for Christmas for one of your biggest fans. Christine Weston Chandler
Months later:
Feb 11 2018 (on Chris's Facebook)
I never got mine from months ago. Probably back in November or October. 😟
Nevertheless, she was still a loyal patron. By May 2018, however, it was found that she was no longer a patron nor following Chris, possibly as a result of Chris getting angry at her over an unrelated matter and blocking her account over Facebook.[14]
November '17 - A patron left several messages on various posts,[15] gradually running out of patience and then cancelling his pledge:
Nov 3
I'm really looking forward to getting my #0 this month. I've been a Sonichu fan for almost 10 years and even own a medallion I bought from Christine, but having autographed books is going to be the crown jewel of my collection.
Nov 15
Hey, Christine. Just wondering when the latest books are going to be sent out. Haven't heard anything since the 4th of November.
Nov 16
Great to hear that you're back to work on the books, Christine. Is there any update on when books for this month are going to be shipped out?
Nov 21
Since Christine has not sent the books and will not answer my questions about when the books are being sent out I have cancelled my Patreon backing and I suggest you all do the same.
Jan - April '19 - Chris stops caring about Patreon entirely, as no pledges have received any rewards.
Jan 21
When does Sonichu 0 arriv?. I donated $20 over a month ago?
Jan 28
yes christina PLEASE ANSWER! DO WE STILL GET SONICHU 0? I KNOW YOU DO NOT CARE ABOUTYOUR FANS BUT YOU CARE ABOUT MONEY RIGHT? I AM PULLING MY PLEDGE IF YOU DO NOT CONFIRM. I DO NOT WANT TO I WANT TO HELP YOU BUT YOU NEVER POST AND YOU DO NOT UPDATE.
Mar 27
can you please send the books? I've sent 40 bucks and I've been basically scammed.
April 2
Hey Christine, I have been backing you for 3 months so far. I am a fan of your art and you even came by my booth at TMG this past summer. We talked for a bit and you seemed cool IRL. I really respect your work and want to support the artist, but I have not received any copied of your comic or heard from you at all. If I do not hear back I will need to revoke my backing.
April 9
i'm sorry christine but i have had to revoke my backing, you have not replied to a single one of my messages and i have not received anything, i would be still backing you every month if you atleast replied to me :/
April 22 (Same user as April 2nd)
I also feel tricked by your actions. After months of payments and no updates or reply I will be revoking my backing.
May '19
May 15
Can I have my comic please
June '19 - Frustrations reached a high point when Chris posted that the merge is the reason he stopped fulfilling rewards.
June 13
Chris, again, I don’t want to be that guy, but if you’re not prepared to commit to drawing full-time, then patreon is not for you. I have my own mental blocks to deal with as well, but I still put 70 to 80 hours a week into illustrations, commissions, and other projects, and often work weekends to make sure I’m continuously putting out content for those who are generous enough to support me. Your patrons are not obligated to pay you, especially if you’re not doing what they’re paying you to do. You can’t disappear for ten months and say that you’re building up strength to create again while you still have people giving you 200 USD a month to create. I know this is what you want to do, and that drawing comics is a passion of yours, but you need to take your position seriously if you want it to be your full-time job. Take care of yourself.
June 13
Stop making excuses and actually grow some balls to admit that you can't fulfil your obligations and terminate this account Chris. Stop scamming people their money because YOU have stress and other dimensional bullshit, that is all fairytale and imaginary. The MERGE won't save you because it doesn't exist, you will still wake up tomorrow a loser, with debt to pay while living in a shitty house. Once Barb dies, you will lose the house and become homeless. GROW the fuck up, and realize that your stupid fantasy won't save you and work for a living.
July '19 - Chris still appears to not be sending out the comics.
July 11 (Same user from May '19)
Please can I have the copy i ordered
July 25
So you're just flat-out ignoring your Patreons? No wonder people troll you. This is flat-out rude.
July 26
im unsubscribing since i cant get any sort of answer on a tier related question.
August '19
August 11
It's a shame to see that Christine is ignoring her patrons. With a 10 dollar minimum pledge, you'd expect her to be a little more active.
August 22
I was about to become a $100/month patron but after seeing all the negative comments, I changed my mind. The chances of getting scammed seem too great.
September '19 - The Dimensional Merge saga continues to escalate tensions between Chris and the patrons.
September 3, David90637947
PLEASE READ THIS IF YOU'RE CONSIDERING DONATING: Do NOT donate to her. She's losing so many subscribers, it was almost 200$ a couple of months ago, plummeting down because she's too lazy and selfish to thank her donors. She'd rather talk to Sockness about the merge stuff instead of raising money and nurturing her own community. I ordered a Medallion from her and she's BLOCKED ME ON TWITTER FOR NO REASON.
I am absolutely heartbroken and, unless she contacts me with a reason as to why I am blocked, I will do everything in my power to make sure she loses more donors. She is a horrible person surrounding herself with horrible people like Sockness and Sarah+Steve, whilst we the community are just brushed aside even though we want the best for her. Do not donate to her. Do not give her any money. DO NOT MAKE MY MISTAKE.
September 4, David90637947
In addition, with all her pleading for money to help her financial situation out, she is BACKING OTHER PATREONS WITH THE MONEY YOU ARE DONATING. She does NOT need your money. She's using you like a cow being used for milk. She is nothing short of a scam artist.
September 25, David90637947
It's been 3 weeks and Christine still hasn't replied to my messages here. She doesn't care about you. All you 14 patreons are fools.
November '19
November 4
I'm a $20 for a few months now and haven't gotten anything :(
2020 - 2021 - Patrons continue to shout into the void despite Chris's last post being in over 2 years ago.
November 9
so are others not receiving their comic's etc.? I payed for this to get a signed copy as a birthday present and now I feel like i'm being scammed here. i've messaged Christine days ago and she hasn't responded but I know she's active on her youtube. if anyone else isn't receiving the rewards posted please let me know so I can file a complaint and get my money back. thank you <3
Banner
The banner for his account is plagiarized from another person's fanart of Sonichu and Rosechu.[16]
Chris tried to rationalize the theft:
“
It’s a lovely piece of art, I am not stealing it, I am using it in full appreciation of the artist that drew it, as much as possible.
And, it doesn’t matter: it has Sonichu and Rosechu; they both, all the others and the city of Cwcville, are mine, regardless.
”

ProjectSNT
Blocked
Began pledging on 4 January 2020.[29] Notably, the pledge came a month after Chris had an autistic meltdown at ProjectSNT over Twitter, suggesting he may be trying to manipulate her into responding to him with money. A perk for pledging is to receive an invite to ProjectSNT's Discord server - which Chris took advantage of, suggesting ProjectSNT ignoring him over Twitter had gotten under his skin so much he decided to throw money at her to try getting his foot in the door via Discord instead. ProjectSNT blocked Chris from being a patron when news broke of his incestuous behavior.[30]

Updates
1 December - Chris added Skylanders products to the gift offerings on the $50-$1,000 tiers. He added $500 as a tier, but screwed up and entered it under the $50 category. He also clarified the Overview section by explaining that he had intended the $250,000 to be a total goal, rather than a monthly one, showing that he still has unrealistic views on how much he can scam out of people. He still did not decrease the 'goal' from $250,000. Finally, he removed the once-per-month donor limit from all tiers.
January 2017 - He edited the Goal down to $500 and added $10 as a donation tier.
June 2017 - Overhaul of the rewards section, offering previews of colored Sonichu pages to patrons.
13 June 2019 - Chris posts his first new update in over 10 months with a long rant claiming the delay on rewards is due to being busy working on the Dimensional Merge and at no point mentions when or if the rewards will be fulfilled.[35]
28 June 2019 - Chris announces that he will resume work on the comic and posts a page of Sonichu 15 along with an announcement that a combination of financial pressures and Merge duties kept comic updates from coming. Also of note is that what was Sonichu 14 is now Sonichu 16, and Sonichu 14 is now The Awakening of a CPU 2. [36]
