On 30 January 2010, Chris tried to show us how it's done.
January was the first month of 2010.
Fueled by a combination of fanmail and his victory over the hardcore gay ads on CWCipedia, Chris started off the year in a rush of almost unrestrained smugness and arrogance. His only setback was the temporary closing of CWCipedia thanks to trademark claims from The Coca-Cola Company and Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, and after a short apology, that, too, was quickly forgotten. Thanks to the swelling in his feelings of self-importance, the more depraved side of his mind was on full display both in the Sonichu comics and in the Mailbag.
Around the middle of the month, Chris's complacency came under fire, when favorite troll comic and Sonichu parody, Asperchu, which Chris was introduced to and already hated because it made his homosexuality-alarm go off back in late 2009, became his number one stress factor due to a takeover of CWCipedia's ad-space and mail from fans who said that they would abandon the Sonichu fandom and go read Asperchu instead. Chris responded by desperately trying to fight the fan-emigration to Asperchu with belittlement and denial, fist-fight challenges, subliminal suggestions and impotent tard-rage. All of these attempts ended up failing miserably. One attempt he didn't try was producing his comic pages with any kind of regularity, as the stress of dealing with Asperchu basically put him into an art coma.
A slightly lesser stress factor was Evan, who used the mailbag to repeatedly push for the death of the Simonla Rosechu character because of its status a bland gender-flip copy of his Simonchu character. This provoked many interesting responses from Chris (at least when he did not outright ignore and delete Evan's mails).
The highlights of Sonichu 10 this month were: Christian and the Hedgehog Boys committing a terrorist attack on the 4-cent_garbage.com Tower, causing the building to collapse, killing 100 people and injuring another 150 in the process, the depiction of Rosechu shifting tampons and engaged in bondage with Sonichu, and the staging and execution of a worldwide holocaust on homosexuality and asexuality. And despite all this, Chris still defended Sonichu as a comic for kids.
Thanks to one of Chris's replies in the Mailbag, we have confirmed that Chris, if given the opportunity, would not hesitate to rob people of their freedom of thought just to make sure that there would be no homos in his perfect world.
In April it became clear that throughout January, Chris, while attending his young adult social group, met a girl nicknamed Damien Antaria, and started building up a friendship with her. Although Chris tried to keep this secret at first, it became impossible for him after a while to hide the relationship, and he started bragging about it on the internet.
