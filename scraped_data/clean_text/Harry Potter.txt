If only Chris had bothered to read it, he would have known how to deal with trolls.
Harry Potter is the protagonist of the popular eponymous fantasy book series written by J. K. Rowling from 1997 to 2007, about a boy with magical powers who attends a secret academy that teaches witchcraft. Despite (or perhaps because of) being a massive phenomenon that rivaled even Pokémon and Sonic the Hedgehog, Chris never got into the series. As a result, it is one of the few mainstream works that never got bastardized in Sonichu. It is also notable that Chris once hated the series with an illogical passion, though his distaste for it waned from 2010 onwards.
Chris and the series
As with his loathing of the HEXBox and Sonic Boom, Chris's dislike of Harry Potter was highly irrational and based primarily on a warped version of brand loyalty. Such hatred grew out of the incorrect assumption that the books had supplanted the Pokémon fad.[1][2] This is highly bizarre, as anyone who was a kid in the late 1990s knows that the mortal enemy of Pokémon was Digimon (which Chris didn't mind).[3][4] One can safely assume that Chris, being highly ignorant of the literary world beyond Goosebumps, did not even become aware of the series' existence until the first movie, The Philosopher's Stone (The Sorcerer's Stone in the United States), was released in 2001.
Another possible explanation for Chris's hatred of the series could be religious doctrine; many Christians have opposed the series since its release for encouraging an interest in witchcraft and the occult. However, given Chris's signature move, this is highly unlikely.
As per his grip on reality, he has personally referred to Harry as a "total Spaz",[5] at one point even threatening to kill him.[6]
Mentions by Chris
Most notable is the "Dark Christian" card from The Wall of Originals, which has a special ability that allows it to instantly win if the opponent likes (or even just seems to like) Harry Potter.
Chris placed a Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone PlayStation game for sale on eBay on 2 April 2008, but failed to sell it.
While attempting to promote his owl-ey collaboration with The Wallflower, Chris put aside his dislike of the franchise to compare the talking owls in his planned story to the non-talking owls in Harry Potter and the non-existent owls in The Lord of the Rings.[7]
Chris and Jackie also discussed Harry Potter; Chris claimed his dislike of the series was "water under the bridge now" and "stupid." He also seemed interested in the Lego Harry Potter game.[8]
Jackie also got Chris to make the video "I put on my Wizard's cloak and magic hat" (she requested the title "i put on my robe and wizard hat"): Chris dresses up as a wizard and states that he is from Hogwarts. He also threatens to use a "spell or two" on those who have cursed his name.
In October 2015 Chris reaffirmed on Facebook, "I hardly cared much for the Potter. I never read the books or seen the movies."
On 12 February 2016, Chris mentions it in his apology video, saying, "Harry Potter is okay, too. He's okay. I got- don't really have much against him except that he was in competition with Pokemon so many years ago."
In December 2019, Chris responded to Rowling's support of Maya Forstater, saying "I heavily and personally disagree: people Can have their physical gender changed; it has been proven and done before. And I, as a legitimate CPU and Goddess, personally know, too. I continue to be proud of being Trans, and for supporting other Trans and everyone else in the LGBTQ+. #TransRights."
Chris's 18 January 2022 jail letter to Kenneth Englehardt lists Harry Potter as being among the fictional characters who are living in C-197.
