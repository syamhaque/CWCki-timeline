Summary
Julie begins by explaining how she got from Molvanîa to America on the 4th and 6th. She apologizes for an unspecified "misdeed," which Chris accepts. He explains how he intends to lose his virginity to Panda, though he and Panda are open to the idea of a threesome as a "consolation" if Julie is on board. He then apologizes for his “flirtatious moments” with Julie, explaining that Panda had promised to come to see him, and that was why he put Julie in second place. Julie notes that sonichu.net isn't working properly, prompting Chris to "work" for days in an attempt to restore it. This fails, and he blames it on Jason Kendrick Howell (though it was actually hacked by Gregg Mays). He then creates a new website, sonichu.info. He asks Julie to pray for “his recovery [of the site] and Jason’s death”. Julie asks for Chris’s e-mail address, but he’s reluctant to give it up.
Quite a bit of the conversation from Chris’ end seems cut out, possibly due to his speaking to Julie instead of typing to her.
4 January
[00:22:18] BlueSpike: Hi!
[00:22:20] BlueSpike: I have news!
[00:22:51] BlueSpike: Rebecca's father, the diplomat, got me an american passport and a green card!
[00:23:04] BlueSpike: And he's flying me out on his jet to Washington DC!
[00:23:07] BlueSpike: :)
[00:24:46] BlueSpike: Then after I land I'll be bussing to where my relatives live in Ohio!
[00:25:17] BlueSpike: I went to DC first so I could get my Green Card.
6 January
[00:26:27] BlueSpike: I'm in America now, Ohio to be exact! I'm with my relatives from Molvania.
[00:31:17] BlueSpike: Are you there?
[00:35:47] BlueSpike: I read the PSN messages..
[00:35:53] BlueSpike: What are you talking about?
[00:35:59] BlueSpike: I didn't join Sonichu Girls.
[00:36:39] BlueSpike: :(
[00:53:46] BlueSpike: And I understand the misdeed I've done.
[00:53:50] BlueSpike: I'd like to apoligize.
[00:54:14] BlueSpike: Though all I did was bring you here like twice.
[00:54:22] BlueSpike: I wasn't there for some times you were here.
[00:54:31] BlueSpike: I was told that someone else was using my name...?
[00:55:11] BlueSpike: Plus my older brother was using my computer, and he's gay...he said he was 'trulling'?
[00:55:25] BlueSpike: He wasn't very clear.
[00:56:45] BlueSpike: OMG! I just asked him about it! He said it was him doing some of this!
[00:57:47] Christopher C.W.C.: I accept your apology.
[00:58:11] BlueSpike: Thank you. :)
[00:59:28] BlueSpike: May I ask who gave you the logs, or would you like to keep it to yourself?
[00:59:38] BlueSpike: Also, I hit my brother upside the head for what he did. >:O
[01:00:06] Christopher C.W.C.: It's okay. it was my Sweetheart, Panda.
[01:00:31] BlueSpike: It was right what she did.
[01:02:27] Christopher C.W.C.: Julie, listen, I've promised my heart and my virginity to Panda, confidentially aka IRL, Sarah Cassandra McKenzie, but if it's any consolation, after our first time, she is willing to do a threesome. Aside from that, I'd still like to meet you, as Guy and Gal-Pals.
[01:02:54] Christopher C.W.C.: I apologize for getting carried away with my flirtatious moments.
[01:03:32] BlueSpike: I accept your apology.
[01:03:46] Christopher C.W.C.: when I found the Sonichu Girls Forum, I had learned that a Sonichu Guy fan went saved up and met Sarah.
[01:05:05] Christopher C.W.C.: I felt uncertain, because of the possible temptations, but Last Friday, she had informed me that she is able to come to me IRL as soon as February (Confidentially), and that she has not had sex with that guy, saving herself up for me. :)
[01:05:56] BlueSpike: Sounds like a true love story to me! :)
[01:06:11] Christopher C.W.C.: Listen, I would like you, not your brother, to get in touch with Panda (I assume you know her e-mail); tell her about him pretending to be you, and proving yourself truthfully.
[01:06:43] Christopher C.W.C.: Yes. :)
[01:06:51] BlueSpike: I wouldn't dare let my brother, also, I actually don't know Panda's email. :(
[01:06:58] BlueSpike: And yes to what?
[01:07:09] Christopher C.W.C.: that it is a True Love Story.
[01:07:16] BlueSpike: Oh. :)
[01:07:47] Christopher C.W.C.: pandahalo@gmail.com. and do not say you got the e-mal address from me.
[01:08:20] BlueSpike: Hmm? Why? And I'll email her.
[01:08:57] Christopher C.W.C.: anyway, she and I have gotten to know each other for over four months now; we've chatted and Talked; heard each other's honest voices, and we've shared a lot between each other.
[01:09:10] BlueSpike: I see! I wouldn't want to ruin that relationship.
[01:09:12] BlueSpike: :)
[01:09:21] Christopher C.W.C.: thank you.
[01:09:37] BlueSpike: Any time.
[01:10:02] BlueSpike: I'll try to email Panda ASAP.
[01:10:03] Christopher C.W.C.: I will repromote you in the Home Club next time I get on there.
[01:10:11] Christopher C.W.C.: okay, and you take care.
[01:10:12] BlueSpike: Thanks. :)
[01:10:14] BlueSpike: Bye!
[01:11:35] BlueSpike: Some people are telling me that they want me to invite you to the IRC, should I tell them you boycotted it?
[01:12:21] Christopher C.W.C.: no, don't tell them that. Just them that after having uploaded the comic, I'm taking a bit of time for myself.
[01:12:38] Christopher C.W.C.: and for Sarah.
[01:12:42] Christopher C.W.C.: :)
[01:12:43] BlueSpike: Okay. :)
[01:12:48] Christopher C.W.C.: Peace.
[01:12:53] BlueSpike: Bye!
[01:12:54] BlueSpike: :)
[01:30:56] BlueSpike: Can I ask if maybe you're talking to your true sweetheart, Sarah, now?
[01:31:15] BlueSpike: Just asking for the sake of asking. :)
[01:33:21] BlueSpike: Oh, BTW. Could you ask her if I got my email?
[01:33:30] BlueSpike: She got my email?*
[01:45:49] BlueSpike: Chris, Panda replied saying that she needs to talk to you by e-mail, she's being harassed by trolls.
[03:34:26] BlueSpike: Hey, I have a question. If Panda had these logs, why didn't she show them to you earlier? I just thought of it, like a Random Access Memory.
7 January
[08:47:57] BlueSpike: Hi!
[08:48:02] BlueSpike: How's it going?
8 January
[10:02:08] BlueSpike: Hey, what happened to Sonichu.net? :(
[10:04:18] BlueSpike: It's acting strange, like it won't load the pictures..
[22:37:05] BlueSpike: Hey. :) I'm enjoying Ohio, and the technolgy it brings to me. But I have a question...I know that people have impersonated you before, how am I sure you're for real? :( Do you think there's a way I could tell you're the real deal? I'd love to be ensured that you're the true Christan Weston Chandler. :)
[22:37:45] Christopher C.W.C.: Hey, Julie. That's no problem.
[22:38:13] BlueSpike: Hi!
[22:38:37] BlueSpike: I have no microphone for my computer at the moment. :(
[22:38:48] BlueSpike: Oh.
[22:38:51] BlueSpike: Let me open the window again.
[22:39:02] BlueSpike: Yes!
[22:39:15] BlueSpike: I see you've been playing your Wii! :)
[22:39:20] BlueSpike: Cool!
[22:39:32] BlueSpike: I've been considering getting a Wii now I'm in the states.
[22:39:43] BlueSpike: Wait, what are you going to update? I didn't catch that.
[22:39:55] BlueSpike: Oh, okay.
[22:40:10] BlueSpike: Ah, yes. That is true.
[22:40:21] BlueSpike: Hmm.
[22:40:29] BlueSpike: Yes.
[22:40:35] BlueSpike: I have not seen him today yet, however.
[22:40:47] BlueSpike: Perhaps.
[22:40:54] BlueSpike: I too have only heard his/her voice.
[22:41:10] BlueSpike: But he's trustworthy.
[22:41:23] Christopher C.W.C.: 434-760-0848, and my address is 14 Branchland Ct. Ruckersville, VA
[22:41:34] BlueSpike: Cool!
[22:41:38] BlueSpike: I'll try to get a car soon.
[22:41:39] BlueSpike: Okay!
[22:41:41] BlueSpike: Bye!
[22:41:44] BlueSpike: Okay.
[22:42:06] BlueSpike: Take care!
[22:42:18] Christopher C.W.C.: u2
[22:48:10] BlueSpike: After looking back at what I said, I think I made a mistake. You see, in my country, we do not refer to people by gender. Sometimes I get confused with he or she, I miss home, I suppose. But yes, Cameron is indeed a female.
10 January
[01:14:48] BlueSpike: Trying to restore your website?
[13:30:35] Christopher C.W.C.: I'm working on it.
[13:31:36] BlueSpike: Cool. :)
[18:00:18] Christopher C.W.C.: Hey, Julie.
[18:01:35] Christopher C.W.C.: I just thought I'd check in; I've just read and replied to Anneke's message on the Sonichu Girls Forum. No offense, but while I was able to comprehend some of what she told me over the phone, I miscomprehended some, but after reading the message, I fully understand what she said now.
[18:02:15] Christopher C.W.C.: I look forward to your visit, and I will treat you well, like a friend. :)
[18:02:47] Christopher C.W.C.: Please call me on my cell when you come into Virginia.
[18:02:58] Christopher C.W.C.: Love and Peace. ;)
11 January
[02:10:36] BlueSpike: What's going on? :)
13 January
[14:49:12] BlueSpike: I miss you, Chris. I haven't talked to you for a short while. :(
17 January
[03:08:34] Christopher C.W.C.: Hey, Julie. well, right now I'm dealing with a change from Sonichu.NET to Sonichu.INFO, because Jason Kendrick Howell, the Troll behind the E.D. page Hacked into my Tripod Account a Second Time. I have created a NEW Tripod account to put Sonichu.info on, and I will close the OLD Tripod account just after I get the Password recovered.
[08:39:52] BlueSpike: Chris, I'm sorry I wasn't able to reply. I was so tired when I got home (After walking around a bit, I like the area near my house.).
18 January
[01:08:41] Christopher C.W.C.: Hey, Julie. the Sonichu & Rosechu Site is down for a count, thanks to that bastard, Jason Kendrick Howell.
[01:08:48] Christopher C.W.C.: I am trying to calm myself down and think this through.
[01:09:28] Christopher C.W.C.: Please pray for my recovery, and pray for Jason's Death.
[01:09:44] Christopher C.W.C.: Love and Peace.
[13:17:18] BlueSpike: I'll pray for your recovery, Chris.
[13:17:20] BlueSpike: :)
[13:17:29] Christopher C.W.C.: Thank you. :)
[13:17:35] BlueSpike: I'll always be there.
[13:18:37] BlueSpike: Is there anything I can do to help?
[13:18:53] Christopher C.W.C.: I'll get back to you on that, and I will keep you in mind on that.
[13:19:00] BlueSpike: Okay. :)
[13:21:46] BlueSpike: Okay, I tried to recover a password for your AOL, chrischansonichu. Try the password rc2296.
[13:21:58] BlueSpike: I hope it's right, it's just what I was able to get at an attempt at cracking the code.
[13:22:30] Christopher C.W.C.: it's cool. I have temporarily closed the ChrisChanSonichu account to discourage the Trolls.
[13:22:34] BlueSpike: Okay.
[13:23:12] BlueSpike: I think they hacked it anyway, I'm not sure. I'm guessing what the heartless trolls would do.
[13:23:25] Christopher C.W.C.: yes.
[13:24:34] BlueSpike: Wait, what email will you use, then?
[13:24:55] Christopher C.W.C.: for now, we can talk on Skype, but I do have a back-up e-mail address.
[13:25:12] BlueSpike: Awesome, what is it? I want to know in case I need to send an e-mail for whatever reason.
[13:25:50] Christopher C.W.C.: I'd rather not at the moment.
[13:25:57] BlueSpike: I understand 100%.
[13:26:01] Christopher C.W.C.: You can still message me on Skype and PSN.
[13:26:05] BlueSpike: Okay, cool.
[13:26:07] Christopher C.W.C.: I GTG, I'll TTYL.
[13:26:11] BlueSpike: Okay.
[13:26:11] Christopher C.W.C.: Love and Peace.
[13:26:15] BlueSpike: Bye!
[13:26:16] BlueSpike: :D
[14:19:06] BlueSpike: Maybe you should make a video telling those mean trolls you won't succumb to their awful attacks! Maybe that'll show them. You need to show them who's boss, put them in their place! You can't let them get away with this!
[16:07:30] BlueSpike: I can't believe Jason is gonna sell the site!
[16:07:38] BlueSpike: I'm going to try to attack his computer!
[16:10:34] BlueSpike: Chris, is that okay with you? Or do you want me to leave him alone for now?
[17:06:38] BlueSpike: Chris, just remember. If you ever need to relax, I could help you.
[23:48:59] BlueSpike: Hey Chris, what's up? :)
