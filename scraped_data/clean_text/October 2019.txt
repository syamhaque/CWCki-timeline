October is the tenth month of 2019. It began with Chris butting heads with Ben Saint, after partially being egged on by the Watchmen into taking issue with Ben's use of his character. Eventually, however, the two's animosity plateaued and Chris would resume his regular actions. At the same time, however, Jacob Sockness would again return to try and influence Chris.
