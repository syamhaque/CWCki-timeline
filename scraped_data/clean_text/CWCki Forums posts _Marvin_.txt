Vivian Was Clyde
31 May 2013[1]
In response to a user's comment, "I don't know who else "Clyde" played, but I think he corresponded with Chris as Vivian Gee in her later, post-white knight e-mails.":
All of vivian was Clyde.
Jackie Was Alec
21 May 2013[2]
In response to a user's comment 'If Marvin is allowed to tell us, was Jackie played by a girl? Was "she" played by more than one person, perhaps by Marvin himself ever?
I know she was trying to meet him, so I wonder what would have happened if it actually went down.'
Uhh, by played, I assume you mean emails. And as far as Jackie emails go, no, that wasn't a girl, usually. Usually one person wrote the emails, but other people might contribute ideas or write up snippets if they have a funny idea.
And I don't think there was any genuine intent on our side to actually set up a meetup. That was just a lure. We could pull off meetups if we really wanted to, but I don't know if there'd be much we could get out of that. I don't know how funny it would be. Well, maybe a little. Maybe if we really put together a really complicated plan, like to put Chris in amusing situations or something.
Double post because it was Alec who was primarily Jackie.
Leaking Chris's Facebook
24 May 2013[3]
[posts thread titled "FACEBOOK LEAK FOR THE AGES"]
Ok, so, someone recently said something in here about "when someone gets into Chris' facebook friends list and leaks everything" or something. I can't find the post and I'm too excited to wait, so whatever.
About a week or so ago, we got a SECRET AGENT ]:(P into Chris' friends list. They managed to get screencaps of all the private posts from 2012 and 2013. They censored their face on the comment box, so we still might have a week or so of more content until Chris just flips out and defriends all the jerks or something. If Chris posts more stuff and has failed to defriend our secret agent, they'll continue to upload stuff to this imgur album, so you can use the same link. If they forgot to censor something, like "unlike post" or anything that might indicate who the secret agent is, please PM me so I can fix it.
Oh, and in any situation when Chris posted some pictures and commented on them, they took a screencap of the original post, but they also uploaded the full size versions of the pictures at the bottom of the album.
The screencaps are in chronological order, from the most recent posts at the top, to the oldest at the bottom. Also, unfortunately, sometimes Chris posted a story over the course of a few posts, so you might need to read up to understand what he's sperging about.
Anyway, enjoy: http://imgur.com/a/1HYJJ
Leaking Chris's Facebook, Chris's Reaction
25 May 2013[4]
Hey kids, Chris made a new facebook post. Our in on his friend's list is still there, so I'm guessing he wants us to see this post.
Anyway:
Leaking Chris's Facebook, June Update
5 June 2013[3]
And... Chris re-added our collaborator. :stupid:
Not much that's new. A few whiny posts. Also Chris joined some psvita social network. Although that's public, because some of the posts about that were public and I accidentally screencapped them. But there are two of the social network posts that weren't, so whichever.

The Black Tape
10 June 2013[5]
Main article: The Black Tape
During a thread in which Marvin released the 7 September email from Jackie E-mails 31, and in response to a user's comment, "As for the rest of the Jackie mails... I hope they illustrate how Chris felt about Bob's death a little bit more. Marvin has said numerous times that Bob's death really fucked up Chris, but it's been hard to see. Even this e-mail could be seen as Chris being angry at the Reaper for BEAKING HIS PROMISE, rather than him being devastated by his father's death.":
He kinda got worse past this point. Hell, he might've been worse before it too and just calmed down a bit to bitch about the broken promise. I don't remember the details. He was sobbing at times though. I do remember that.
The topic was then split to a separate thread by forum administration in which users discussed the unreleased call.[6]
In response to a user's comment, "You heard him?":
Yes.
The other user replied, "The implications! Can we get to know more?".
Another user commented, "I would guess some evil trolls hacked Jackie's skype and listened in. I also doubt any of that would ever be released as there's no humour and I think even OPL gets to have some privacy when he grieves."
Marvin replied:
This. That stuff's not getting out.
Clyde History
29 August 2013[7]
I've known Clyde for a long time, both as Clyde and his former entity, Vivian. He wrote the girl who brought down the world, for example. He was first Vivian, probably because he thought it would improve his chances of getting Chris to listen to him. I think after a while of being Vivian, he wanted to get more involved as himself, so he created Clyde Cash. It enabled him to be able to talk to Chris as a character he better identified with.
Snowfucking
13 July 2014[8]
Heh, well, what I mean is that, sure, we've told Chris to do lots of dumb stuff. For example, Chris sticking his dick in the snow, because we told him to, doesn't mean he's into snowfucking.
