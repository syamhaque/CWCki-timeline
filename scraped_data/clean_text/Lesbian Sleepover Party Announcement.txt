================================================================================

Lesbian Sleepover Party Announcement. is a video released on 6 January 2016 in which Chris is manipulated by the Lady Managers into trying to net himself china by announcing a sleepover at his very own house.[1] Attendees were to engage in "a night of fun and frivolous activities" and have "a sex-y time". Applicants were to email with a "self-photograph" and proof of ID to anightinchristine@gmail.com for a chance at winning a night of a lifetime.
This video also shows that Chris's Sonic Totem from his Graduation survived the 2014 house fire, and it also shows Pollo on video for the first time. Pollo is noticeably more friendly towards Chris than previous cats. Chris, as is now to be expected, uses his unconvincing attempt at a female voice. It's also interesting to note that his room looks a lot tidier than before (although a stack of boxes are clumsily placed in the corner), probably an attempt to lure in da ladies. (Chris's hair is a mess, however.)
Chris's corresponding post on Facebook indicated that a "gal friend" would be co-hosting the event; besides this mystery person, the only woman expected to show up was Barb.
Ten minutes after Chris announced the sleepover, Kengle criticized Chris' decision by pointing out that opening your house to complete strangers is a stupid idea. On January 9, Chris deleted the video, later revealing in his Announcement and update 1/12/2016 video that he decided to keep it "between friends". On October 4th, 2017, Chris later admitted during a Q&A that the party had never occurred at all.[2]
Curiously, propped up on a shelf to the left of Chris is a 1968 record Bobbie Gentry and Glen Campbell by the titular artists. To the left of the record is Chris's Sonic Totem.

Transcription
Chris is seated on his bed, the light shining off the bald pate at the front of his head. The iconic (and creepy) Sonic the Hedgehog totem he constructed during middle school is sitting on a chest of drawers to the left, while Pollo is walking around the bed next to Chris.
