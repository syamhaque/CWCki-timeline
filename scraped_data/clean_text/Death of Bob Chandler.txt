Chris on Bob's death.[1]
On 6 September 2011, Chris's father, Bob Chandler, died of congestive heart failure.
Bob's death marked a significant change in the trolling of Chris, as the vast majority of the trolls associated with the "Classic Era" voluntarily retired from trolling him, knowing that he was deeply depressed by his father's passing, and a trolling renaissance did not begin until later in the decade.

Bob's Final Months
A breakdown of Bob's final months reads as follows:
On 24 March 2011, Bob claimed in a phone call with ThePCAssassins to have cancer of some type.[2] This is the first recorded example of Bob telling anyone outside of his family that he had cancer. His language in the video suggests that he may have been diagnosed on the 24th of March or in the few days prior.
On 23 April 2011, in an email to Jackie, Chris revealed that Bob had received surgery for colon cancer.[3]
On 20 July 2011, it was revealed that Bob knew about Chris's cross-dressing tendencies and, like Barb, vehemently disapproved of them.[4]
On 29 August 2011, Chris mentioned that Bob was an ill and sickly shut-in, and was suffering from "feet-bloatings".[5]
In early September 2011, Bob was rushed by ambulance to Martha Jefferson hospital with heart failure. It was discovered later that Bob had been put into quarantine when he arrived because his body was covered in bug bites and he posed a contamination risk.[6] On the sixth of that month, he died at age 84.[7] Chris and Barbara were present at the ICU at his side, and Chris said that he held Bob's hand during his last fifteen minutes of life.[1] Chris later claimed that his father's last words to him were "All around the world, everyone prays to their own God, but they are all praying to the same God."[8]
Out of respect for him and his family, the CWCki was closed for a week, 12–19 September, with the start date coinciding with the day Bob's funeral service was held. Site visitors were directed to a page which simply read "Robert Franklin Chandler Jr. 1927–2011."[7]
It is said that Marvin and other trolls, using the Jackie identity as a catfish, attempted to contact Chris over the phone shortly after Bob's death for unclear reasons; Chris was noted to be audibly upset as he cried throughout the conversation. While the audio was recorded and archived on what is referred to as the "Black Tape" by some Christorians, the contents of the call were never released publicly due to Chris's miserable emotional state. The trolls who participated in the call realized after the fact that it was simply too soon to try to reach out to Chris in this fashion and, for a change, opted to respect his privacy for once. The Black Tape either still exists in the hands of the trolls who participated in its creation, or it has been lost to time.[9]
Cause of death, according to Chris
In an email leaked on 22 March 2014, Chris claimed that the stress from being targeted by trolls led to Bob's heart attack.
“
AND the total stress KILLED my Father Prematurely; if not for those Trolls, he would still be alive, and would have likely lived beyond 2015.
”
Chris.[10]
Years later, in 2017, Chris revised his claim and said that Bob was killed after hospital staff surprised him with a "Loud Noise." He went on to say that he had more freedom when Bob was alive.
“
I wish I could go back to September 5, 2011 and stop the staff from making the Loud Noise that killed my father with stressful surprise. I had more freedom when he was alive.
”
Chris[11]
Obituary
Both Barbara and Chris collaborated in writing Bob's obituary, which was published in two local papers. Main points of the obituary, apart from the standard birth date, date of death, and next of kin, include:
Text going into unusual detail about what Bob did at General Electric.
The location of the memorial service, "to follow on a later date", at Wesley Memorial United Methodist Church, the church that Barb, Bob and Chris used to frequent together. This is the same church that Rocky Shoemaker counseled Chris from.
A footnote asking readers to not donate flowers, but to donate money to Barbara and Chris.
With Chris taking part in writing the obituary, it's amazing that the writing stayed focus on Bob and did not once mention Sonichu or become about Chris (except for the request for money at the end).
Original text
Robert Franklin Chandler Jr., 84, of Ruckersville, passed away the morning of Tuesday, September 6, 2011, at Martha Jefferson Hospital ICU surrounded by family, pastor and hospital staff.
He was born on September 4, 1927, in Texas, the son of the late Robert Franklin Chandler Sr. and Jean Holloman Chandler. On June 7, 1980, he married Barbara Anne Weston, who survives. And the couple gave birth to a son, Christian Weston Chandler, who survives. Also surviving is ex-wife, Patricia, and their shared children, son, Dr. David Alan Chandler, survives, and daughter, Carol Suzanne Chandler, survives.
He graduated from Auburn University with a degree in Engineering.
He served in the United States Army Seoul Korea in the Signal Corp during the Korean War. He worked for General Electric as an Engineer with Steels, Plastics, etc. He also had patents for the controls for Plastic Molding Machines; without him, we would not have even a simple plastic funnel.
Also surviving are granddaughter, Savannah Chandler, the daughter of David Alan Chandler and his wife, Kimberly.
A funeral service will be held at Monticello Memory Gardens in Charlottesville, Virginia, 10 a.m. Monday, September 12, 2011. A memorial service to follow on a later date at Wesley Memorial United Methodist Church.
Instead of flowers, you may make monetary donations to his widow, Barbara Chandler and son, Christian Chandler.[7]
In memoriam
Bob's final resting place.
Bob is often seen as a gregarious, hard-working man (all things considered) who tried (albeit without success) his best to refine Chris into someone that could at least pass for a responsible adult, giving him mock job interviews and chaperoning him on dates, where he proved (unsurprisingly) more adept at charming the date than Chris, but stopped altogether in his later years, leaving Chris to his own devices.
On the other hand, we have him to thank for some of his son's more backward worldviews. He managed to alienate his other children enough that his daughter didn't attend his funeral or keep in touch while he was alive. He helped Chris to construct bizarre conspiracy theories to justify trespassing and the like, among other things. He, like Barbara, enabled Chris's crippling dependence on them, general immaturity and irresponsibility, and his myriad of other flaws. He bailed out his son repeatedly and never really let Chris experience the consequences of his misinformed life decisions. He never made any serious effort to correct his son's glaring character flaws and shortcomings, even when he caught him masturbating in the kitchen. The few times he did intervene, it wasn't even for Chris's own benefit, but to shake off the trolls and the Health department. He also did not make any real attempt to provide for Chris's future, beyond ensuring the tugboat. He left all of his money to Barbara, who promptly wasted it all on lawyer's fees – a conscientious parent would have anticipated this and put some of the money in a trust for Chris, not that Chris would've handled the money any better. Better yet, he could've given the money to his son Alan, Carol or his own granddaughter.
While some like to remember Bob as a kind-hearted, albeit ignorant old man who tried his best to be a good father, others see him as a remnant of a bygone era who is responsible for molding Chris into the person he is today.
Chris's beliefs on Bob's afterlife
Main article: Robertchu
During the Idea Guys saga, Chris believed that Bob had been reincarnated into CWCville as a half-Sonichu named "Robertchu". He has maintained belief in this since, and sometimes substitutes the Robertchu name when speaking about Bob as a person.
