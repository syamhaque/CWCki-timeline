Title: Jail Letter - Prayer to Kengle

================================================================================

On 27 February 2022, Kenneth Engelhardt posted on the Onion Farms that he had received a twelfth letter from Chris with an attached copy of Chris's "Lord Goddess Blue Heart's Prayer". Kenneth uploaded the prayer to the Onion Farms but did not upload the letter at Chris's request. The prayer is dated 13 January, but the letter was probably written and sent around the same time Chris wrote his third letter to Spamton (i.e. late January), as both letters are postmarked 22 February. As with the Spamton letter, the return address provided on the envelope for this letter is 14 Branchland Court, not Central Virginia Regional Jail. This is presumably because Chris believed he would be released from jail on 3 February.
