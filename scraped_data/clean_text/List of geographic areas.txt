Chris and the rest of Virginia
Fredericksburg
Chris once claimed in a conversation with a fan from the city of Fredericksburg, Virginia that he had passed through his hometown on the way to Corrina's house "a few times".[1] It is not clear why Chris would have had to pass through Fredericksburg on the way to Corrina's, as that city is north of Richmond and nowhere near Red Oak.
Chris has also mentioned Fredericksburg as the place where he and Barbara bought Clover and Snoopy in 2012,[2] and he has stated that the city of CWCville is located "to the north to north-east" of Fredericksburg.[3]
Red Oak
Back when the Chandlers were still on speaking terms with their relatives outside of Ruckersville, they would make occasional trips to Barb's hometown of Red Oak (or, as Chris tends to spell it, "Redoak"), a remote unincorporated community in the Southside region of Virginia, to visit Barb's sister Corrina and her family. It was here that the Chandlers picked Patti out of Corrina's litter. After her death in February 2009, they came to Red Oak to take part in her funeral.[4] In a 2013 video, Chris claims that everyone living in Red Oak after Corrina's death hates the Chandlers.
Despite his later claims about being hated after Corrina's death, Chris visited Red Oak again over the weekend of 27-28 June 2009 to attend the wedding of his cousin Jonathan Carey. This happened to be the same weekend on which BILLY MAYS tragically passed away, hours after being hit on the head during a rough airplane landing.[5] In a July 2009 interview with Guru Larry, Chris mentions this trip as an alibi to prove that he could not have been the one piloting the plane Billy was on shortly before his death.
Chris and Barb visited Red Oak in April 2012 (shortly after Chris lost his virginity) to plant flowers at her father's and Corrina's graves, but they did not visit their living family members as they were all "busy". Instead Chris and Barb stayed at a hotel in nearby Clarksville.[6][7]
Other
Other Virginia cities outside of the Richmond and Charlottesville areas which Chris has visited include Arlington, Bedford, Goochland, Harrisonburg, Mount Sidney, Newport News, Roanoke, Staunton and Williamsburg.

While Chris has rarely left his home state of Virginia, he has occasionally been to other states. In particular, since 2017, he has attended several conventions outside of Virginia.
States Chris has visited
California
Circa July 1989, Chris went on a trip to San Francisco, California for his half-brother's birthday.[8][9] Barbara described the flight as "painful,"[10] but it is not clear if she was referring to the ordinary discomforts of air travel or if Chris's autism presented additional difficulties. Chris expressed an interest in returning to the San Francisco Bay Area for the 2020 and 2021 BABSCon convention, but financial circumstances and the COVID-19 pandemic prevented him from doing so.
In August- September 2019, Chris devised a role-play fantasy about a trip to California to visit Jacob Sockness.[11]
Some of the people who have gotten involved with Chris have lived in California. These include Clyde Cash, Joshua Wise,[12] Jacob Sockness,[13] Naught, and The WCT.[14]
Maryland
Chris attended BronyCon in Baltimore in 2017, 2018, and 2019. He also attended MAGfest, held in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C., in 2018.
North Carolina
In January 2024, Chris attended the Animate! Raleigh convention in Raleigh, North Carolina.
Ohio
Chris made an ill-fated road trip to Cleveland, Ohio to visit Julie in February 2009. The exact route of Chris's trip is unknown, but it likely involved passing through West Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, which would also make it the only time Chris is known to have been in West Virginia.
Pennsylvania
Chris attended TooManyGames in the Philadelphia area. He also drove to Philadelphia on a separate occasion to deliver a package to a carpetbagger and attempt to visit emgo316, a popular YouTuber.[15]
Texas
In May 2024, Chris was spotted alone outside of a boarding gate at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport in Dallas, Texas. [16] In light of his later sightings in Finland (see below), it is likely he in Dallas on a layover from Helsinki back to Virginia, as Dallas Fort Worth has direct service both to Helsinki (via Finnair, Finland's flag carrier) and airports in Virginia.
Washington, D.C.
Growing up in the Richmond area, which is about two hours south of Washington, D.C., Chris would likely have gone to the city at least once for the occasional school field trip to see sites like the National Mall.
On 24 March 2012, Chris attended a MythBusters live show in Washington, D.C.
States Chris has not visited
Kentucky
Stephen Boyd, of the Idea Guys, lived in Kentucky at the time. While under their influence, Chris had mailed items such as video games to a Kentucky address for Gwen Mikoto, an alias used by Boyd.[17] In December 2018, Chris complained over Twitter of how he and his friends had tried to report Boyd to Kentucky authorities but that nothing had come of it.[12]
Massachusetts
In spring of 2009, the Chandler family began seriously planning a trip to Boston, Massachussetts to visit Chris's then-sweetheart Ivy, who allegedly lived there. However, these plans fell through when Barbara discovered that Chris was secretly stealing her money; the dissolution of Chris's relationship with Ivy, caused by Rocky trying to get the police to investigate her, only compounded matters.[18]
Tennesseee
In Sonichu 7, Sonichu, Rosechu, and Wild travel to Clarksville, Tennessee to confront Jason Kendrick Howell at the 4-cent_garbage headquarters. This is in reference to Clarksville being Jason's real-life hometown. The website is headquartered in a 72-story skyscraper, which is implausibly large for a city of Clarksville's size.
Washington
Chris had a chance of getting to go to the Everfree Northwest convention near Seattle, Washington in August 2021, but he was banned from attending after news of his incestuous relationship with his mother came to light.
Chris and the rest of the world
For the first 42 years of his life, Chris never set foot outside of the United States. He did ship items internationally, and he once sent a lock of his hair to a fan in Mexico, but that was the closest he had ever gotten to traveling abroad. When asked which countries he would most like to visit in 2008, he mentioned Japan, England and France.[19] When asked the same question again in 2019, his answer had changed to England, Japan, Canada and "maybe Germany, Scotland and Ireland".[20] In a November 2023 livestream, in response to a fan's question on where he would like to travel, he named London, England.[21] Except for Japan, all the countries Chris has expressed an interest in visiting are places he has ancestors from (or at least believes he does).
Australia
Australia is a country located in the Southern Hemisphere. The troll sweetheart PandaHalo claimed to be from Australia. After she ceased communication, Chris came to believe that she had died in the Black Saturday bushfires, a series of devastating wildfires that occurred in February of that year.
England
England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. Chris and his mother Barbara believe they are descended from Anne Boleyn, the second wife of King Henry VIII. While there is no evidence supporting this claim, Chris often cites it as a point of pride, despite showing little actual interest in English history or culture beyond this.
Finland
Main article: Finland
Finland is a country in Northern Europe. Chris was spotted with Flutter in Helsinki, Finland in April 2024,[22] September 2024 and December 2024, his first known trips to a foreign country.[23][24] The fact that Chris was able to enter Finland indicates that he is in possession of a United States passport, something he has never previously mentioned.
Japan
Main article: Japan
Japan is an island country in East Asia. Chris is a devoted fan of Japanese media, particularly anime and video games, and openly prefers them to their American counterparts. However, his understanding of Japan is superficial, mostly based on anime tropes and stereotypes. He shows strong brand loyalty to Japanese products such as PlayStation and Nintendo.
Russia
Main article: Russia
Russia is the largest country in the world, spanning Eastern Europe and northern Asia. Chris views Russia, as an adversary not due to its often-hostile relationship to America but due to its anti-LGBT laws. He also blames Russia for the 2016 U.S. election and links Russia to My Little Pony Generation 5, seeing it as Russian propaganda.
Ukraine
Ukraine is a country in Eastern Europe and the second-largest in Europe after Russia. Chris has shown strong support for Ukraine in its conflict with Russia, likely influenced by online users he follows who are also pro-Ukraine. He has expressed admiration for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, stating, “Volodymyr Zelenskyy... I like him. He’s a really cool guy.”
