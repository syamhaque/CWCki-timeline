Troll disclosure: This persona was created, appropriated, or otherwise used by trolls to manipulate Chris. Though this identity is contrived, the CWCki may treat it as if it were a real identity because it was to Chris. (It's also funnier that way.)
Sam and Ellen are a lesbian couple who considered Chris as a surrogate father, in reality troll characters introduced to him by the Lady Managers[1] to manipulate him into showing off his frozen semen collection and to film another sex tape with a doll. Their names are a pun on "salmonella." At first, they gave their names as Samantha and Ellie,[2] which were later morphed to Sam and Ellen for the pun effect.
The two of them were conflicted, one wanting natural and one wanting artifical. Eventually, they agreed to both go natural, but were stopped by Johan, a former gay porn star, who also was a canidate for surrogate father. He made Sam and Ellen aware of some of Chris's previous exploits such as the cakefarts video and the Megan Schroeder saga, which cast serious doubts on Chris' viability. Though unclear who put forth the challenge, all parties agreed that Chris and Johan would both make videos to prove their sexual prowess and the winner would be decided through an online poll.[1] Around 7,000 votes were cast, with Johan taking a 16-point lead over Chris, despite the latter accusing the former of having an STD and being a bully. Sam and Ellen have yet to be heard of again since; it's generally assumed they chose Johan to impregnate one of them and lived happily ever after with a child that was not Chris's.
