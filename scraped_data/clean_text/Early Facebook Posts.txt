I am a good man
Chris posts his first Facebook post, complaining about the cyber bullies and wants people to help him.

There are some cyber bullies who have taken my words and feelings out of context, and twisted them into meaningless mockery.
Please do not believe those terrible rumors; I am a good man who needs a female sweetheart to soothe my pains from loneliness, stress of social influences, and heart-aches.
Please help me, so I can help you one day.
The Common Question, "Do I know you?"
Chris posts another post, complaining about the common question "Do I know you?".

When a person asks you, "Do I know you?", it brings up a greater answer. "I'm not a mind-reader, so I can't tell you how well you know me."
The question is dumb in itself; no one is able to answer it. Because no one can read their mind and answer it with full confidence.
Man I am SOOO SHY. "How Shy are you?" I am SOOO SHY, that...
...my autism choked me, literally...
Chris complains about how shy he is in the Alderman Library.

Today, Jan. 24, 2008, I was at the Alderman Library. I was playing Sudoku on my PSP, and I was listening in on this conversation between a couple of cute ladies just to my right. I've enjoyed just listening to them talk about their things; I will not devulge any details, because I am the man who will keep a secret (Plus, I don't know ALL the details). Anyway, after one of the two left, the gal that stayed sittin' next to me, talked on her cell in what sounded like Dutch or German. IT WAS THE PERFECT OPENING for a conversation towards making a new gal-pal. I had it in my head, "Pardon me, I couldn't help but overhear your chat on your phone, but was that Dutch or German you were speaking?" I HAD THE NERVE SET UP, I was raring to say it, but when I started to say it, the tension and my shyness and my autism choked me, literally; I couldn't even open my mouth to say anything. And she left. I am kicking myself now.
Anyway, THAT IS HOW SHY I AM; I am so shy, that I JUST FREEZE OR CHOKE upon starting to talk to a new girl I don't know yet.
What I am looking for in a woman
(Note: Bob died later that day.)
