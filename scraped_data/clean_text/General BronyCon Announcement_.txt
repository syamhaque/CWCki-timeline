Transcript
Hello everybody, Christine Chandler coming to you live from home once again, and yes, I am going to BronyCon this weekend from the Augi- from the August first to the th-fourth, all four days. Gettin' there at Thursday morning, so of course. But let's be real, alright? I mean, I'm not gonna be welcoming of hatred or malcontent and [wags finger] you're going to get reported to security by me personally if you do anything bad.
And I am not going to do anything bad, so don't make any stupid, false stories about me or shit, or try to set me up even, that's plain stupid. Alright?
Anyway, you know me better. I'm more pleasant, I'm more kind, I'm more honest and sincere and everything. So please remember that. Approach me kindly and it's all good. Approach me badly, and... [Chris looks blankly at the camera for twelve silent seconds.]
Anyway. Hope to see all the good people at BronyCon. Be respectful, be kind, be positive to each other. [smiles, looking down and to the side.] Have a good, safe day.
