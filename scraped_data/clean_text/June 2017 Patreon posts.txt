He added finished pages 52-61 for Sonichu 11 - most behind a patreon-only wall, with two left freely available.
Weekend plans, delay on new pages
Jun 10 at 6:14pm
A minor update, my scheduled intentions were to have the pages drawn, written and coloured the past week be scanned, texted and uploaded on Sundays.
This weekend, though, I am enjoying a couple of Pride events in CVille including a Pulse Remembrance party, as well as a Pokémon TCG tourney on Sunday after Church.
I will be colouring the ten new pages for Book 11 tonight, tomorrow evening, and maybe Monday if not finished yet.
The pages will be uploaded here on my Patreon on Tuesday, Plus free bonus: a new poem I've written, with a drawing piece underneath, in honor of Pulse that I will be reading at that party on Monday, will also be uploaded on Tuesday.
Thank you for your patience.
Have a great and safe day.
Also, an honorable mention: Thank You, Adam West.
Na, Na, Na, Na, Na Forever.
Poetic Letter
Jun 13 at 5:03pm
Here is my poetry piece for the Pulse Remembering party at UVA yesterday; I made it a letter to myselves.
It is also a letter, I feel, anyone can put themselves into, easily swap the genders, even for going from straight to gay, or whatever your pleasure.
I read it loud and proud to more than thirty people, with positive receptions.
And now, after this post, Sonichu Book 11, Pages 62-70.
Thank You.

Silly Punchy.
This is Too Funny, what Punchy says here; Pledge Today to find out how this happened after the pages are uploaded Sunday the 18th.
Also, Please also consider directly donating to help me and my mom right now with groceries.
Thank you.

My bad, but this Sunday, I will be attending a Pokémon Card Game tournament after church; the uploading will be postponed until Monday the 26th. Stay Tuned.

Sonichu 11 page 91
Jun 26 at 9:37pm
I couldn't help myself!
I was fully coloured up to page 91, so I'm sharing up to it this week.
While I do have drawn and written pages 92 to 94, they are not yet coloured in.
So, at this point, it is a reminder that if you want to see the post-Slaweel Fight, and what happened to the S-Chu Ball Crystals, you will have to pay up.
And Copies of Sonichu #11 will be the first book distributed to paid Patreon Pledges ever.
Pledge and Pay at least $20 by the end of Friday, June 30, 2017, to be among the very first to receive this book, a Long Time in the making, and delayed due to depression and life problems.
Thank You All!  :)
He replied to a couple of comments.
Roni Bloink:
*Barfs*
Chris:
**I roll my eyes; I smirk back, then laugh at your fake barf.
😄
mkb:
I thought you had decided to not personally appear in the comic anymore?
Chris:
I had said that I would be appearing less often in the stories.
And the stories where I Am the main center of topic will see a Lot of me.
Most of the stories revolve around most everyone else.
Therefore, you won't see me as much in a Sonichu story, or on an adventure in the jungle with Wild and Simonla.

Here is something you will Only Find in the upcoming Flashback, next week.
My Sonichite
Jun 28 at 10:35pm
After I got my Mega Stone, I thought about attaching it to my Medallion. But when the stone touched the medal, it merged in. Now for the long while, mine is more unique than ever. The ChrisChanSonichite sure left an impression; smack-dab in the middle of it.
That ol' Cherokee Magic. Ha-cha!
