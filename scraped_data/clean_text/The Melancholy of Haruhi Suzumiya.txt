“
I, with this body, am filling the role of Haruhi, as the omnipotent one with the deity-level abilities and wish-making type of manifestations.
”
Chris, comparing himself to Haruhi[1]
Haruhi Suzumiya
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is an anime series. Haruhi Suzumiya is the name of its titular character. Chris misspells her name as "Suzumia".[1][2][3] The plot revolves around Haruhi, a teenage girl who unwittingly is the god of her world. Chris watched the anime on his iPad[4] as well as its spin-off series, The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan.[5]
Mentions by Chris
In August 2020, Chris compared himself to Haruhi while reflecting on the failings of his sweetheart search. He wrote that, "And like Haruhi, [I] was unaware for the time of this OP ability of [mine], and that [I] wasn’t the type as aggressive/assertive as Haruhi to push things forward."[6]
In September 2020, Chris compared himself, Barbara, and some Watchmen members to characters from Haruhi:[7]
Chris to Haruhi, being "the omnipotent one with the deity-level abilities and wish-making type of manifestations." Chris also referred to the coincidence that Haruhi is called the "Ultra Director" and Chris had called himself the "Great Director" years before.
Barbara to Kyon (misspelled as "Kion" by Chris), being "unspecial, yet Very Special." Notably in the anime, Kyon has a kissing scene with Haruhi, signifying another piece of foreshadowing for Chris's Affair with Mother.[8]
Lainchu to Yuki Nagato, being "able to reprogram certain data within the micro ness and fabrics of realities, timelines and dimensions, and so on to her great extent and skill set. Also, your respective insight to the present situations and all that."
Bismuth to Itsuki Koizumi, since "his range of abilities being something similar, yet far superior than Koizumi. And in that he has an innate sense, reasoning, logic and intelligence that makes him able to be that who has a better understanding of this body's abilities than I do."
MKRNightVee to Mikuru Asahina, though Chris was uncertain since "she's not exactly moe or shy, but she still has her abilities as well that surpasses that of a typical time-traveler type."
In Jail Letter - 4 October 2021 and Jail Letter - 18 January 2022, Chris listed Haruhi as among the inhabitants of his fantasy dimension C-197.
