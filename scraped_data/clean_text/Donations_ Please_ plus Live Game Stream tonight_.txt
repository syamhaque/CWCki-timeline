Chris begins the video by introducing the viewer to his new body-pillow, "Naru". He states that they've been together for weeks, and
that there's nothing wrong with that. Chris then starts his begging for cash, to help with their "Nutritional Issues". After this, Chris finally lays down the stream info, and tells the viewer he'll be playing Uncharted on his Playstation 4 later that night. Chris thanks the viewers, and ends the video.

[A body pillow sits propped up in a chair to Chris's left.] Mmm. This is my waifu, Her name is Naru. Ch- we've been togevver for a few weeks now, nothing wrong with that. We're still gettin' to know each other pretty much, and it's all in my head, really. Hey, y'all can- y'all are welcome to share your waifus anytime. Anyway... [sigh] Second half of the month. [removes glasses] Gonna need some more donations around here, to help out. Get some more food around here... My mom loves to eat bananas. Quite serious about that. And we could do better- better- better on food as well. Otherwise we end up just... hmm, we're not gettin' everything we n- need nutritionally. So please - donate. Help us, once again. Thank you. And yes, later tonight I'll be playing some Uncharted and streaming gameplay. So y'all can look forward to that in a little while. Thank you. Have a good day.
