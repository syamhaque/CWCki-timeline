What hackers did when the Club Nintendo yearly award was given.
Club Nintendo was a customer-loyalty program that rewarded purchasers of Nintendo video games and hardware. Buyers could register a code on the Club Nintendo website confirming that they bought an item, get a certain number of points depending on the value of the item, and then cash in the points for various prizes. It was launched in North America on 2 October 2008, and shut down on 30 June 2015. Its predecessor was the My Nintendo registration program launched in 2002.
Chris is a big fan of these sorts of giveaways (My Coke Rewards being another example), and so he seems to have diligently registered his new acquisitions over the years. This record of his purchases spans from its early days as My Nintendo all the way through to February 2009, where he quit Club Nintendo to get himself more absorbed into his PS3 and LittlePigBlanket. He later did come back to the website, however, infrequently using it during its twilight years, and even apparently purchasing games he hates to mine for points.
Since the records may not be entirely representative of what he's bought, it's hard to draw any firm conclusions from this information. However, it suggests that Chris didn't download games for his Wii with nearly the same abandon as he did on the PlayStation Network. His Wii downloads as accounted here are actually fairly limited and show pretty decent taste on his part. (This may just be a result of the PSN sucking up every last bit of cash from his monthly tugboat, though.)
Chris spent his My Coke Rewards points almost as fast as he could get them, but for whatever reason, he hoarded his Club Nintendo points. According to the trolls who hacked his account, Chris acquired only one prize: a copy of Game & Watch Collection for the Nintendo DS. Clyde Cash, in his wisdom, chose to spend a few more on a replica of Mario's hat, a gift for Barack Obama. It's unknown if Chris redeemed any more prizes following the hacking; the most recent example of a prize was in several videos released in 2011, where a Giant Mii AR Card is visible on Chris's wall. This particular item was only available to Club Nintendo members, for the price of 300 coins.
In March 2016, Nintendo launched a new loyalty program called My Nintendo (no relation), released alongside the social app Miitomo. It's not fully known if Chris has ever used My Nintendo, though it may be likely since it was confirmed at the time that he used Miitomo.
