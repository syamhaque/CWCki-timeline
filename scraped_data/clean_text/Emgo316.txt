I am having my own fun doing these as well, regardless of my "copying" and referencing Emgo and whatnot.

Chris
Em Gomez, known by the username emgo316, is an American YouTuber based in Pennsylvania who makes in-depth reviews and unboxings of Transformers action figures on Youtube. Chris is a longtime fan of Emgo’s content, having followed his channel since at least December 2016.[1] Over the years, Emgo’s content has served as a source of "inspiration" for some of Chris’s own videos.

Inspirations
Several of Chris's videos reviewing official and customized Transformers figures imitate elements seen in Emgo's videos.
These include Skylanders Imaginators Leader Christine W Chandler: random Review N' Stuff, Son-Chu Review, Alpha Trion/"Young" warrior challenge explained, and Light Powered Cwclight Reviews.
The latter had been criticized by others online, and on 19 May 2025, someone posted on Bluesky suggesting that Chris should develop his own review style instead of copying Emgo. Sounds pretty reasonable, right? Not to Chris. He responded twice, first with a GIF of Sonic pointing his finger, captioned “I do not think so, Egghead.” The second reply was somehow even less of a response. Chris wrote: “Did Emgo have blast effects and action like I've presented? Did Optimus go through the ceiling in Rising with Primal? Did Emgo have the jets in flight in battle in any of his videos, in addition to sliding?” As if that even counts as a real response.
Failed visit
Chris has attempted to make an unsolicited visit to Emgo. On 8 October 2020, Chris drove to Pennsylvania. The impetus for his trip was in dropping off a box of items he had autographed for a customer. As a "bonus", Chris, who had remembered once seeing Emgo reveal a partially censored envelope with Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania visible on it in one of his review videos, decided to try to find Emgo's address online and show up at his house.
Chris hoped that Emgo would sign his custom Son-Chu's packaging, wanted to meet his friend Lori (who Chris decided had psychic powers), and wanted to gift a couple of items to Emgo. Chris found two addresses, both in Philadelphia. The first appeared not to be occupied, and the second was outdated, and Emgo had already moved out by the time Chris arrived.[2]
Emgo's response
As of September 2025, Emgo has seemingly only acknowledged Chris dismissively.
On 1 July 2025, he cleared up misinformation on Twitter:

There was a large moment in time when chris chan would harass emgo to the point of visiting his home irl.
Also a coincidence that a oc design he made a long time ago based on barricade would eventually have a figure come out that slightly resembled his design.
EmGo316
That never happened.

…i am extremely sorry for spreading misinformation, forgive my terrible wording
EmGo316
Even more wrong information here. Never lived in Pittsburgh.

I’m like 99% sure that the reason Chris thought that was because it was the sender address off of a third party figure or upgrade kit’s box you might have shown during the packaging part of a review.
