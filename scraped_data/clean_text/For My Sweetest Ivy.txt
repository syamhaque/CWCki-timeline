Thank you for giving me another colorful character to see in my nightmares.

For My Sweetest Ivy is a YouTube video uploaded by Chris on 1 May 2009. It is an extremely creepy message to Ivy promising smoothies, Gilligan's Island, Family Guy, masses of porn-based sex, Guitar Hero, and romantic walks through the mall and other places with "green and sunlight" for her pet hermit crabs. Throughout the video, Chris speaks in an uncomfortably childish tone that was probably intended by him to be "cute" and "playful".
On 12 May, this video was discussed on Toucher and Rich.

You know, MY MOMMY AND I...

Anybody (especially a male) over the age of 5 who calls their mother "mommy" is a very scary individual.
Transcript
[in a disconcertingly babyish voice] Hey, Ivy! I'm doing this video for yoooou! Oh, we are gonna have so much fun together when you and I are together! Hmmm! You know, my mommy and I, my, my family and I will come and meet you at the airport. And you know, your choice so, take you to your hotel or, uh, bring you back to...my house, hmmm. I mean, uh, you know, we'd be hanging around so much and sharing so many fondful memories.
Hmm. And you know, I few, I know a few good places in Charlottesville, you know, I think it's, you know, I'll take you there, we'll get some good things to eeeeeat, and we’ll hang ooouut. We’ll have so much fun. We’ll, uh, have a good time together, you know. I know a place that serves some great smoothies. Uh, yeah, the cafe, in Charlottesville. Good place. Serves good smoothies! And you know, we can enjoy a movie in the theater, or in, at home, or watch a television rerun. Family Guy! Heh. Family Guy! Or, uh, I Love Lucy or I got some, I got the entire series of Gilligan's Island, hmmm. Hoo-hoo! Hmm, and we can make some music together on Guitar Hero. Hmmm. Well, you can sing, I got a microphone. I'm thinking about getting drums. [Makes a drum sound]
Hmmm, yeah. And you know, I will see you in the, I look forward to the eventuality of, uh, you and me having our sex time together. Hmmm, I'll do you so many, I'll, I’ll do my best to pleasure you and keep you satisfied, my sweetest Ivy, just for you. Just for you! Hmmm! I know a number of good positions and massages, hmm. Hmmm. And, you know, I know a number, uh, places we could walk around at, you know. We could walk about the mall! We could walk about the UVA grounds! Good places where there's plenty of green and sunlight.
Hmm, and wa-, we can walk the hermit crabs together, hmm, talkin’ about, somethin’ like, how you might like to, how you might walk your hermit crabs, hmmmm. Hmmmm, so, you know, wonderful memories! Wonderful memories! We're gonna have lots of fun. We’re gon-, I'll do my best, I'll do my best to keep you entertained, show you a good time, when we're having a good time.
And I promise, I’ll remain your good boy forever and for always. And to get, uh, my friends up I've been talking to uh, between on the Internet, and in real life, my real friends, they can vouch for me on, uh, how good a boy I have been. Being a good boy just for you, Ivy. I love you so much, I love you so muuuuch! [Pretends to hug her] Hmmmm. Hmmm, look at me smile, hmm. It's a nice smile. Because I love you, Ivy! I love you so much. I ran out of details. [Laughs] I don't know. I guess I'll sing you a song.
[Sings a variation of "Jolly Holiday" from Mary Poppins, attempting to imitate Dick Van Dyke's cockney accent]
It's a jolly ‘oliday
With Ivy
Ivy makes my heart so light
When the skies are grey
And ordinary
Ivy makes the sun shine bright.
Oh, happiness is blooming
All around ‘er
The daffodils are smiling
At the doves
When Ivy holds my hand
I feel so grand
My 'eart starts beating
Like a big brass band!
[Mimes waving his hat over his head as he sinks to the floor, with his Playstation controller as the hat]
It's a jolly holiday with Ivy
No wonder that it's Ivy that I love.
You know something else, I should have uh, thought of, of doing this before, you know, to feel more positive, highlight for anybody who, uh, goes back on information. I should recreate, uh, something for MySpace or Facebook with all the positive highlights and all the true details that would not, uh, be, uh, somehow twisted in any erroneous way. I'll work on that. I will work on that. Because it's the honest truth from my head. From my head. I love you so much Ivy. I love you! I love youuu. [Blows a kiss to the camera] Talk to you later, sweetheart.
[Jump cut]
And also to your father the policeman, I salute him with my Cub Scout salute that I have favored for so long.
