Title: The Place chats - Praetor Arrives

Categories: Sonichu Possession, Crystalgate
================================================================================

Delusion disclosure: This article or section takes place during Chris's phase of role-playing as Sonichu. He may refer to his Christine Chandler personality and physical body in the third person by using terms such as "mama".
On 14 October 2020, Chris had a DM with Watchman leader Naught about his and some Praetor members' interpretation of the Disc Dream that he had.
The next day, the Praetor account, owned by Caden, joined The Place Discord server. Naught and Nova immediately start asking him questions while Chris steps away, mostly asking about their business and the finer details to their relationship with Chris. Praetor answers some of these, including tidbits on pricing and their creation process, though they refuse to disclose the split in income between themselves and Chris, claiming that Chris signed a confidentiality agreement. Praetor then asks questions of the Watchmen. Anaxis asks for social medias and they provide him with a Twitter and Instagram handle, as well as a business email. Chris returns and tells the others about him hand-writing the script for his upcoming sermon video, and complains about certain content not being easily found on the CWCki.

14 October 2020
Chris describes four members of the Praetor group. He says two of the members theorized with him on the meaning of his disc dream. Chris also mentions the group's plan to record the Goochland Library Sermon.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Very well.
I'm still waiting to hear of him getting onto our server on Discord.
And, yes, the photos from Instagram are of us.
Naught
ah ok, what's his discord username? I can dm it to him..
Which Instagram photo's?
Chris (as Sonichu)
I am very much focused on the events, especially now that we've got the date to Chaos Control down from the disc details.
I'll share those with photos with you later.
I will also tell you in confidence: the four of them are very much legit.
In the group, Annie is very much psychically able.
Owen is like the magician of the group; among his skill set, he can also make a variety of special teas and such that can be like potions and elixirs.
Cabell is also psychically inclined, but she's the artist.
Caden is very open-minded, and the brains and business.
Unclear Speaker
🤔
Chris (as Sonichu)
Anyway
In the meeting yesterday, Caden and Owen showed and told me about a few of their theories.
They also showed three related discs, one of which did resonate with me with the same scorpion image I saw in that segment of the disc in the dream.
They also theorized a link with the Mayan Calendar, as it was very likely misinterpreted in regards with the 2012 "Doomsday" thing.
The Mayans read and wrote differently, and something about doubling a digit or two (I'm having trouble exactly recalling that statement at the moment), but they theorize that the end of the Mayan Calendar has to do with boosted Spiritual Powers, and the date of which being December 21, 2020.
Not doomsday; Spiritual Power Boost.
Obviously, they can explain it better than I can at the moment.
But the idea is to correlate and estimate the exact date of the Dimension Merge, and this theory does sound very plausible, given the present and upcoming/foreseen circumstances.
But, yep, I definitely feel it very best in y'all talking about all of this together.
Aside from that,
I have another very important to-do that has been made obvious with me.
In regards to my getting the Chris Chan Sonichu Bible rolling,
One project aspect Caden and the group want to do also is record videos of me, or Mama in the future time, to give a sort of sermon type of dialogue.
So, presently, I'm going to be writing up a script, with my own thoughts and feelings, and relaying those of Mama in it as well, in regards of reintroducing the Dimension Merge details and so forth, as well as what we all should do as a community.
Naught
The buisness sounds fanciful.. although placebos and snake oil bring most comfort.
The calendar bit sounds rehashed, every society has some kind of apocalyptic event (often metaphorical not literal)
Are you sure you're comfortable with doing a video?
And was this cadens idea?
(God damn never a dull moment)
Chris (as Sonichu)
I am comfortable with doing this video.
The other questions about the ideas, you will be able to talk with Caden about very soon.
I got to go; I have a deposit to make.
Check you later.
Naught
Ok just make sure it's mutually beneficial and reciprocal

Chris (as Sonichu) 04:11 PM
Hey, @everyone.
I am in the better process of putting together my thoughts in regards to the Dimension Merge details Mama had previously laid out.
I am hand-writing what she had typed up, word for word, because this was long overdue needed to be hand-written.
As opposed to typed up, which is only around three-quarters as effective, but still works.
It’s better to have it written by these very hands, regardless.
I am also making mental notes along the way, as well as using the mechanical pencil to write a few notes.
Kyle 04:12 PM
Why handwritten?
The WCT 04:12 PM
I'm curious to see what you write up.
Naught 04:13 PM
🧐
Chris (as Sonichu) 04:13 PM
After I hand-write all of that, I will have a better idea of what to write up for the portion of the speech that pertains to the community aspect.
Of which, I will include the experiences from the C-197 side and what the people around the Earth, there, have been personally experiencing since then.
Hey, Bis.
Since you’re here, have you found and allowed Caden into our server here?
I’ve texted you his Discord handle.
Naught 04:14 PM
He hasnt responded
Caden's username is Praetor#1330
I sent a friend request
No reply
Chris (as Sonichu) 04:16 PM
He’s messaged me on here; he’s new to the Discord app.
Kyle 04:16 PM
I don't exactly get why handwritten is better, it seems less clear and produced, plus typos and all.
Who is Caden?
Caden Arrives
15 October 2020[1]
Naught 04:18 PM
@Praetor
hello, who might you be?
Chris (as Sonichu) 04:18 PM
Well, I wanted to take a momentary break, anyway.
Kyle, to answer your question, let me refer to the fact that Mama had hand-drawn and written her books and art pieces.
Praetor (Caden) 04:19 PM
@ภคยﻮђՇ Hey there! I'm Caden, a friend of Christine.
[2 SonichuSmile[2] and 1 m_shy[3] reactions]
Chris (as Sonichu) 04:20 PM
There is a greater effect of magic and power directly from the hand with the pen or pencil on paper.
Kyle 04:20 PM
But the text was always typed, in all but the last few.
Naught 04:20 PM
You the one making the medallion?
Kyle 04:20 PM
So is the Bible inherently less interesting depending on the version? As in, any copy ever is less interesting?
[1 ❓ reaction, likely from Chris]
Chris (as Sonichu) 04:20 PM
This only mostly goes through if the new thought or event is typed up by these hands through a keyboard, turned into digital text, and uploaded onto the computer.
Anaxis (Lainchu) 04:21 PM
Hello there Caden, nice to meet you
Chris (as Sonichu) 04:21 PM
Not sure how to answer that question.
Kyle 04:22 PM
If it's mass produced, then typed is better, and also more readable.
Chris (as Sonichu) 04:22 PM
But, yeah, @Praetor is making the medallions, and other additional things as well, including setting up a new shop on Etsy.
The WCT 04:22 PM
@Praetor greetings! it is nice to meet you.
Chris (as Sonichu) 04:23 PM
For now, I’m gonna take a shower, and I’ll return to hand-writing in a while.
Please, go ahead and talk amongst yourselves about the ideas and theories of the Dimension Merge, including that thing with the double numbers on the Mayan calendar, the golden disc, and all that.
Anaxis (Lainchu) 04:24 PM
Speak to you later, then!
Naught 04:24 PM
Ok
The WCT 04:24 PM
alright, have a good day Sonichu. I wish you the best of luck in your writings.
Chris (as Sonichu) 04:25 PM
Speaking of which, here’s what I’ve drawn of that disc so far (still lacking the text on the in-between segments).
Kyle 04:25 PM
Figure out the split yet? Granted the process should not take this long.
Chris (as Sonichu) 04:25 PM
Ice-Breaker for between Caden and you all.
Kyle 04:26 PM
Doesn't look segmented on that one, but 24 equidistant segments?
Chris (as Sonichu) 04:26 PM
Yeah, I’ve drawn the circle and lines on the back for reference.
MKR 04:26 PM
Zodiac?
Naught 04:26 PM
@Praetor
so you own the shop? Or you're on the handymen?
Chris (as Sonichu) 04:26 PM
[1 ✅ reaction]
And I have mentioned Owen and Annie to @ภคยﻮђՇ.
Naught 04:27 PM
It's some ancient Mayan calendar it was hyped up a couple years ago
Owen and Annie are the ones who heavily suggested there's a link between the merge and the calendar
Anaxis (Lainchu) 04:28 PM
It was used to predict the world would end in 2012
Kyle 04:28 PM
When in reality, it just loops.
MKR 04:29 PM
It was a huge hoax I remember that
Naught 04:29 PM
Ive said it's yet another needless addition or a misguided interpretation
Anaxis (Lainchu) 04:29 PM
Which was inaccurate even if it was true, since the Mayans didn't have leap day, offsetting the true date of their "apocalypse"
Kyle 04:29 PM
Granted, less faith in mesoamerican calendars given how much they sucked at intensive agriculture.
Naught 04:29 PM
Exactly
MKR 04:30 PM
Not to mention the sacrifice of children and others
Kyle 04:30 PM
Well, chinampas were a good idea, but that's about it.
Most of the land sucked and they had no idea how to maintain it.
Some areas did have volcanic ash soils, but the concept of fertilizer goes back as far as ancient Greece.
MKR 04:33 PM
Anyway its probably not a great civilization to try to take much from for the lore. That being said, it doesn't surprise me that someone would try to troll you in such a way. It's not cool.
I wish people would stop
Naught 04:34 PM
It's such a tired routine
The WCT 04:34 PM
It’s all tiresome.
Kyle 04:35 PM
Good architecture, but boy did they suck at basically everything else.
Naught 04:37 PM
I'm sure Owen & Annie are lovely people but another couple coming to influence or suggest things are related.. come the fuck on.. just help make the medallion.. keep your conspiracy theories for yourself..
Val 04:40 PM
None of it matters, there's plenty of existing material to go through and put in order.
Praetor Discusses their Role
15 October 2020[1]
Kyle 04:52 PM
@Praetor So for products, what options are there? Have you sorted out the logistics/fulfillment?
Praetor (Caden) 04:56 PM
@Nova We'll initially be only selling Medallions. These act as a trial run, testing market interest. Along the way, we will add more products. These will include but not be limited to comics, cards, and possibly amino figurines.
Chris (as Sonichu) 04:56 PM
*Amiibo
Praetor (Caden) 04:56 PM
Thank you!
Kyle 04:57 PM
If the costs are right, what's the material cost on a medallion, what's the unit cost looking like overall?
Praetor (Caden) 04:59 PM
It costs about 3 dollars per medallion. We sell them for 25 apiece, as to match our competitors. Etsy brand imposters are selling Medallions for 25-30. To uproot them, we must match or go below their prices.
If business is good, we'll increase sales by discounting them, selling them for 15-20
Kyle 05:00 PM
And what percentage is fulfillment? I know there are business accounts available through shipping services.
What's the casting process like?
Praetor (Caden) 05:06 PM
Very simple. In order to emulate Sonichu's original medallion, they are stamped in a mold we made and baked. Then, painted. We mail them from our own company pocket for a while, as it is cheaper then registration with a mailing company. When we get big enough, we can afford to register and get discounted shipping services.
Kyle 05:07 PM
So you have a perfect master to work from.
Really that's the most important part, symmetrical and all that.
What percentage of costs are labor and shipping?
Praetor (Caden) 05:17 PM
We've not shipped any yet, so we only have estimates. It won't be more then a few dollars.
The medallions are not large not heavy.
Kyle 05:18 PM
Also on that, what's the income split you're figuring?
Praetor (Caden) 05:20 PM
We signed a confidentiality agreement with Sonichu, as we are a company. If Sonichu gives her consent, I can disclose profit splits and profit estimates.
Kyle 05:21 PM
Just ascertaining that it's not hopelessly one-sided.
Praetor (Caden) 05:23 PM
Oh no, of course not. We've worked with creative types for about 3 years now. You may recognize a few of my more eccentric clients!
Have any of you ever heard of Molossia?
Kyle 05:23 PM
Oh, that guy.
Praetor (Caden) 05:23 PM
Yup!
Kyle 05:24 PM
What kind of merch do you do for them?
Praetor (Caden) 05:27 PM
We don't only do merch. We helped him find someone to write a dissertation on the micronation's sovereignty.
He's using that to try and officiate his territory as a nation.
More power to him, I suppose.
What do y'all do? I'm excited to be working with this team.
Kyle 05:29 PM
I'm just the guy with answers for things.
Peachy 05:30 PM
Idk how I’d title what I do 🤷‍♀️ cx

Chronicling, as it were
Do you have a website, by chance?
Praetor (Caden) 05:32 PM
So we have research, miscellaneous, bodyguard, and scribe??
Naught 05:32 PM
Yes
{{quoteboxred|speaker = Kyle|time = 05:32 PM|Ever work with Phil?
Praetor (Caden) 05:33 PM
I don't know any Phils. We love reaching out to folks though!
Who is he?
Val 05:34 PM
I do everything.
When did you first learn of cwc?
Praetor (Caden) 05:38 PM
I've always known about Christine. She always struck me as unique in the sense that she is probably one of the most famous people ever who has profitted the least from her fame.
When I heard that she had tried to launch a store before, but been overwhelmed, I knew that there was a chance at profit. I run almost everything I do privately, so I reached out to Christine myself.
Anaxis (Lainchu) 05:39 PM
@Praetor Do you have a website, linkedin, or other business information?
Naught 05:39 PM
Ok and the connection to "Owen and Marie?"
Praetor (Caden) 05:44 PM
I used to have a website, but due to domain costs I took it down. When it comes to clients, I find that it's easier to find eccentric people then to have them find you. If you're interested in partnership or a meeting, I've been transitioning us to social media. We have a new twitter and an Instagram.
Our email is llcpraetor@gmail.com.
Anaxis (Lainchu) 05:45 PM
Social media are the business tools of the future
What are they?
Praetor (Caden) 05:46 PM
@praetor_llc and the Twitter is @praetor[note 1]
With social media, I can find my own clientele. Considering that I'm here, seems like things are working out!
Naught 05:48 PM

Someone owns it you might wanna rebrand
Anyway
Owen and Marie
Anaxis (Lainchu) 05:51 PM
I think it's Annie

Praetor (Caden) 05:53 PM
Oh no, we know about Praetor LLC. They're actually not trademarked, we've talked to them. Their site is a homedone project. The only internationally trademarked Praetor brand is Praetor Technologies.
Naught 05:54 PM
Oh
Praetor (Caden) 05:54 PM
Local trademarks and international ones are different. Local ones are based within a state, and allow for brand witholding within the jurisdiction of a state. They are cheap. The international one is multiple grand.
Naught 05:55 PM
So many people try this I loose track
Praetor (Caden) 05:56 PM
I'm sure you get a lot of unfortunate attention here. Rest assured that it's not the case with us.

Fact.
Kyle 07:30 PM
I don't think they're too far above board, even their listing has inconsistencies.
Or they don't count officers as employees somehow.
Chris Checks Back In
15 October 2020[1]
Chris (as Sonichu) 07:32 PM
Hey.
Just checking in and catching up on the conversation here.
I am half-way through hand-writing what Mama had typed up now; be writing up part 3 shortly.
Another reason for me hand-writing all of it is to further ingrain it into memory.
That is done better via hand-writing as opposed to keyboard typing.
Personally experienced, and proven fact by others.
Peachy 07:33 PM
Handwriting helps me with memorizing
Kyle 07:34 PM
Ya, fine for a draft copy, but it seems like kind of a pain for an e book.
Anaxis (Lainchu) 07:34 PM
I'm more partial to typing, personally. Handwriting for me just takes too long.
Praetor (Caden) 07:34 PM
Agreed. I have bad handwriting anyway.
Kyle 07:37 PM
It's just more readable with a proper font, take handwritten notes, sure. But I really shouldn't have to explain the benefits of it being typed.
Anaxis (Lainchu) 07:38 PM
Yes, writing it down once means it will all have to be transcribed a second time to typing, doubling the work
Kyle 07:54 PM
For the planning stage, that's fine, but it would be a poor stylistic choice to have the whole thing handwritten.
Chris (as Sonichu) 07:56 PM
@ภคยﻮђՇ, I thank you very much for texting me the links earlier; apparently in Mama’s third tweet set, as I was going from the direct source on Twitter, a bunch of her tweets in that set got removed.
Freaking haters.
I am going from the page at this point.
Kyle 07:58 PM
So how would it be laid out, if it's just rehashing twitter, that really doesn't help add depth.

Chris (as Sonichu) 10:13 PM
I have just finished writing out all of Part 3 of Mama’s tweet sets; the Longest one among them all.
The WCT 10:14 PM
can you let us know when you post them?
Chris (as Sonichu) 10:16 PM
Also, on Twitter, a bunch of the tweets were made Hidden from my view for some odd reason, and I’ve had to go with a link from Bismuth with a webpage capture on it, but it left out the last few tweets of that set, and I’ve had to log into Mama’s old Twitter account to get them.
AND, I’ve even tried looking on the Cwcki for the Tweet sets as well; They do not have them on there, or they are very difficult to find.
I will say this now, even though I have written it as a note on the paper page as well:
WHY was all of this NOT on the Freaking CWCKI?!!!!!!!!! (edited)
*sigh and *groan
Kyle 10:18 PM
Advanced twitter search any use, they might have a date sort?
Ya, they allow a date range.
Chris (as Sonichu) 10:18 PM
Regardless, this highlights yet another reason why I am hand-writing all of this: to ensure all of it is on one source that can be referenced personally any time.
Yeah, these tweet sets were made mid to late October and early November, 2018.
Kyle 10:19 PM
But that's equally possible with text, and easier to index.
Chris (as Sonichu) 10:19 PM
Presently beyond our skill set.
Kyle 10:20 PM
Although, aim higher than Twitter: The book (The movie)
Chris (as Sonichu) 10:20 PM
This is also for that Bible as well.

Yeah, but I was talking about part 3: You and Your C-197 Self-Counterparts
Kyle 10:21 PM
In a bottle, this doesn't elucidate much if its all just a rehash of a Twitter feed.
Chris (as Sonichu) 10:21 PM
Taking a breather before I tackle Part Four.
Thanks

If this is structural, it's a small percentage of actual content.

@everyone, Woof!
I’ve finished hand-writing all four parts of what Mama had typed up nearly two years ago.
Dedicated this whole day to do it; Worth It.
The WCT 11:57 PM
Can't wait to see it.
Chris (as Sonichu) 11:57 PM
Tomorrow, I, Sonichu (Prime), will write up my own personal addition to all of that, talking about what the communities should be doing during these present times, as well as my experiences and witnessing some of these events.
Kyle 11:58 PM
I have to say, at least the level of knowledge I have on what actually happened, how much is there extra?
Chris (as Sonichu) 11:58 PM
But, all of that which Mama had typed up, hand-written into a compsition book: Seventeen Pages worth.
ROFL, Kyle!
Kyle 11:58 PM
Well everyone who knows knows that much, whats the hook like?
Chris (as Sonichu) 11:59 PM
If it were to be written, the number of books that would be written would be into the Billions of pages’ worth.
Kyle 11:59 PM
So we distill.
