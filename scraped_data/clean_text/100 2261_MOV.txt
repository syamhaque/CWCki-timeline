100 2261.MOV is a video Chris uploaded on 1 October 2010. In it, Chris expresses remorse for various actions including blaming Michael Snyder for having been banned from The GAMe PLACe. As with most things, Chris blames video game-induced stress as the leading cause of his behavior. Chris was of course only doing this to try and please Jackie, and has publicly called for the death of Michael Snyder at least twice since making this video.
"That message on the cardboard box" to which Chris refers was "Michael loves the Fiddlesticks out of Mary Lee Walsh".[1]

[The scene is briefly bathed in a golden hue as Chris switches on the camera. After a second, the room returns to its customary drabness.]
[Mutters, eyes to the heavens] Uungwah listen it's October first, two thousand ten, and we're going to go a good- change of pace here. I have, uh, come to, uh, g'bwl I have come to... terms and realization, with the help of my gi- of- with the help of my sweetheart, Jackie... [Sighs blissfully] ...
Anyway, I want to apologize to...
for bl- to Michael Snyder and everbody at The GAMe PLACe
for blaming them, for... well all the troubles because, y'know. Uh, things have, things have perspired, that led up to me getting kicked out... was very much my fault, er - but most of the time, uh, but most of the time I was just being, er, super stressed out and I only, just, I only shouted a loud outburst twice. [Wags his finger at the camera, looks disgruntled] Twice! Ever. And yet even, eeh, even that shocked, er, Michael.
And I apologize for, er, writing that- for writing that message on the cardboard box that Michael knows- is aware of- out of anger in response to- not being allowed to hook up the Wii so I could distribute the Electivire [pronounced Ee-lek-TEE-ver] to Magmortar, Surfing Pikachu to the other League Me- to the other Pokémon League Members for- towa- toward their Di- Diamond and Pearl games.
But anyway, uh, I do not blame any of them, uh... I am to blame for— my getting kicked outta there. And... I am sorry. [Dramatic pause befitting the gravity of this statement.]
Have a good day.
[He deactivates the camera]
