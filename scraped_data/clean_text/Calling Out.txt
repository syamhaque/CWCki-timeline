Chris during the Calling Out videos
Calling Out refers to a series of videos Chris uploaded from the 6–23 August 2011, following an eight-month hiatus from YouTube. The series focuses on Chris's efforts to expose the identities his various trolls, most likely based on information given to him by the users of the Tomboys and Tomgirls of Virginia troll forum.
Each confrontation consists of Chris decrying the apparent traits of his trolls, such as Thorg's atheism and Jack Thaddeus's sexual interests, followed by demands for apologies and other instances of blackmail. Chris gives them deadlines to meet his demands, many of which are idiotic; e.g. asking Tito to send cash in the mail, or impossible, e.g. asking BlueSpike to stop random people all over the Internet from making prank calls. Some of the trolls actually played along with Chris's demands as part of the joke.
Chris's gullibility is highlighted in the series as the "identities" of the trolls he believes he's acquired are really fellow lolcows (and in Thorg's case, the source of an image macro template) who lack the motivation and intelligence to troll Chris, as well as having completely different voices from the trolls they're supposed to be. Even if Chris did possess the actual identities of the trolls, it wouldn't have made much of a difference because he takes no direct action against them. Instead, Chris just exposes people's personal information and expects the Internet to do the work for him of tormenting his foes. He seems to believe that if a troll's identity is revealed, all of the other trolls will turn on him and troll him instead of Chris. This is not likely.
These videos also showcase Chris's Tomgirl look, where he attempts to make himself look feminine. Chris is sporting new earrings in these videos, two on his right ear and one on his left. His glasses are also absent. Chris's camerawork in this series is exceptionally shitty, opting to hold the camera with his hand instead of propping it up on a surface. This results in a very shaky, Cloverfield-like viewing experience. Oblivious as always, Chris makes the videos while failing to realize that the obese horrific "tomgirl" delivering the messages overshadows the message.
The Calling Out series came to an abrupt end after Bob's death in September 2011, a mere five days after the last video Chris posted in the series.
