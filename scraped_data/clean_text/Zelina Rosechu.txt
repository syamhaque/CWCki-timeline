Zelina Rosechu (pronounced [zɛ'liːnə] "zel-LEE-nuh"; born 21 August 1988[1]) is a Rosechu from the distant land of RuleCWC. Together with Darkbind Sonichu, she has a convoluted and idiotic backstory that has never substantially contributed to the plot of Sonichu. She somehow manages to be even more useless and irrelevant than Darkbind, owing to her unforgivable crime of being a female in Chris's Mary Sueniverse.
Zelina rips off:
Amy Rose and Raichu, as with all the Rosechus
Princess Zelda
Additionally, Zelina looks exactly like Crystalina Rosechu with nothing but a wardrobe change, which goes to show how quickly Chris ran out of variations on "Amy Rose with a Raichu tail" and was forced to rip off one of his own characters.

Biography
Backstory
This backstory, written to The Wallflower, appears to be largely ripped off from the plot of the NES game Zelda II: The Adventure of Link.
Also, just to make it clear, Zelina and Darkbind, of the kingdom of Rulecwc, are Rosechu and Sonichu respectively. And Clawdorf is a kind of warlock monster character; all I have of him is a 3 or 4 finger hands and a black cloak and hood, but he can be a combination of all of the enemy creatures we have come up with so far.
What I have so far on that can be read in some of my comic pages. But in short, Darkbind Sonichu and Princess Zelina Rosechu have been sweethearts. In a cave in Rulecwc forest one day, Clawdorf released the power of the seven Chaotic Crystals (A.K.A. Sonichu Ball Crystals); he turned to stone and Zelina fell into a deep slumber. A few years later, the original Sonichu donned the power of the 7 Crystals and reawakened Zelina (Clawdorf was also destoned in the process).
The King and Queen of Rulecwc have no biological children. But from the Chaotic Rainbow of Sonichu and Rosechu's Origin, many Sonee and Rosey (baby Sonichu and Rosechu) eggs were released throughout the world, time and space. One egg landed in the audience of their highnesses, and Zelina Rosey hatched out; they adopted her and dubbed her successor to the throne. The egg with Darkbind Sonee landed somewhere in Rulecwc Forest; after evolving to Darkbind Sonichu, he was found by a rogue master swordsman (sort of like Link from Legend of Zelda) and trained under his guidance, also with later guidance from our owl, King Alistair.[2]
Sonichu #3
Darkbind shows up in the "McAttack" Sub-Episode, helping to defeat Merried Seinor Comic.
Sonichu #4
In part two of "McAttack", Chris explains that Darkbind "left after the battle to continue his quest for his Princess Zelina Rosechu's re-awakening."[3]
Sonichu #6
DB makes his first appearance in the main storyline, introducing the Sonichu Chaotic Ball Crystals. According to Darkbind, the Balls were unleashed from an ancient tablet by the evil wizard Clawdorf. Clawdorf used the power to curse Darkbind's gal-pal Zelina Rosechu into a magic sleep. In the process, however, Clawdorf was turned to stone, leaving Darkbind to gather the Sonichu Balls and use them to break the curse. Zelina only appears in flashback. On top of all that, Darkbind was just about to propose to Zelina when she succumbed to the curse.
Sonichu #10
Ultra Sonichu uses the Anchuent Power of the Seven Crystals to revive Zelina, and she is reunited with Darkbind. This entire storyline is vintage CWC writing, in that it is resolved by one of Chris's stand-ins acting as a deus ex machina, while neither Darkbind nor Zelina have to actually do anything and the main villain (Clawdorf) doesn't even make an appearance.
Sonichu #12
Zelina attends the SLGBTQ festival along with Darkbind. They would pass by and greet Chris, now in his new Tomgirl form.
Future Issues
Chris has said that "Darkbind and Zelina will be fighting Clawdorf with great sword and bow/arrow battles."[4]
