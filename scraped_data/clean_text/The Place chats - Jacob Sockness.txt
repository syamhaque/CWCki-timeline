Defending Sockness, stress, and CALM supplements
4 October 2019 (partially leaked during the 2020 Discord leaks)
Delusion disclosure: This article or section takes place during Chris's phase of role-playing as Magi-Chan. He may refer to his Christine Chandler personality and physical body in the third person by using terms such as "wife".
Chris defends Sockness while Kyle and MKRNightVee criticize Sockness and MKR says Sockness should not visit with Chris. Chris also discusses CALM supplements he is taking in an attempt to alleviate stress.
[12:24 AM on 4 October]
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
Ah.
I see the context of @Deleted User’s text.
I shall repeat, copy and paste, what I just told him:
Again, Christine was falling and feeling heavily stressed into falling ill; her psychic senses, vibrations and all went off a LOT on Wednesday.
And at about 5:00 pm, here, both her main soul and body soul were called and summoned for active duty in C-197; her body became a breathing, almost mindless shell.
Mewtwo had to temporarily possess to relocate the body into the bedroom, where it fell asleep for about three hours.
And after that, both soul parts had returned, and Christine was feeling really roughed up while taking with our ally and friend who informed her of this detail.
She was unable to think fully clear.
From that, alone, she subconsciously knew she was unable to house a guest, while taking the news impulsively conscious.
Kyle
Could you describe it in more detail?
Like the feeling?
Any progress on the parapsychological book?
Deleted User
V-Smile: all shall be fine in the end. can you tell me how you felt when this sensation hit magi chan or is this mewtwo?
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
When Christine made that voice chat recording, she was working from her stressed feelings, separate from the fright of the “liver-eating” from the voice chat of the 21st of September, she was feeling under ailment.
It is I, Magi-Chan Sonichu.
Deleted User
Oh its nice that everything has subdued from you and @Deleted User
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
She made the statement to share, because she was concerned for Jacob’s being had he continued and did not have somewhere to go to.
She was making efforts to make positive he was on his way back home safely.
And I will personally vouch for Jacob’s statements from tonight.
Deleted User
V-Smile: weather it be magi chan Mewto or cwc no one is judging them. Everyone needs to be careful.
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
That is understandable.
Kyle
VC maybe?
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
I will answer the lingering question (I do so hate it when a new topic is introduced while I am discussing another topic; I feel super interrupted.
Kyle
Theres a lot of specifics
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
No, let me type this out.
MKRNightVee
Magi-chan, with all due respect, Jacob is irredeemable and evil. I don't think he should ever be allowed to visit or it will just turn into a murder-rape scenario.
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
Noted.
Moving On.
When Christine has a psychic sense, or a CWC-Sense, she gets a forced pause in her head and then a vision of a local event, even at an instant-flash.
OR, like Pinkie Pie, her body, or a part of, will feel something or tremble.
Hold your questions until I tell you all I am finished, please.
A Vibration is complicated.
To describe it from this perspective: it is very much like the feeling of going through a Magical-Girl type of transformation.
Mainly, the Aura GLOWS, and the physical form change can happen, as that is what the aura is trying to accomplish for the summoning or call need at the moment.
At the present, while Christine is working diligently and hard as possible to transition my body from C-197 into 1218, here at home, I have been working on not only healing her body, but also transitioning her body to go fully from 1218 to C-197.
In this, there is a fluctuation in blood pressure; this is also similar to how a body feels when it is glowing with the aura.
Regardless, her mind has to be as clear and calm as possible, so meditation and deep breathing is best, and she, both soul and body, have become more diligent in that.
Also, I looked into and bought some potassium supplements, I have some CALM supplement mixture for water or tea, and when needed the melatonin helps invoke sleep for the night.
And her body is constantly numb in feeling, as it needs to be in order to be better sensitive to the events and everything.
I’m not finished
When Christine gets the feeling, it is in linking to a relative and crucial event in either C-197, 1218, or both simultaneously, and even more so in the Dimension Merge events that still continue.
My body will be back to full visibility here in 1218 very soon; she and I do not switch back until after that fact.
Okay, for the moment, I have finished, and will take questions and responses now.
Kyle
Side note, I'd be interested in reading whats in the mixture, moving on from that
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
Ah, let me get the bottle.
Kyle
Googling it real quick
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
Kyle
Probably cheaper magnesium supplements
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
Regardless, we have and are using this, and it works.
Kyle
And magnesium deficiency is quite rare
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
She is not deficient in magnesium.
Kyle
Then why does it need supplementing?
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
She was prescribed Paxil at about seven years old for Anxiety.
Kyle
Magnesium is common in a lot of vegetables
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
She stopped taking it when switched to paroxetine at the adult age, and then after Barbara read of its newly-found side effects, switched to fluoxetine. (edited)
Because she is soo stressed
That is why we are exploring these blood-pressure-stabilizing and calming methods.
Kyle
If any of this is relevant to some of the anxiety, it might not be the right medication
Because you still seem anxious about a lot of things
Don't mind me saying, but it is my job to pick up on anything, I'd rather not miss any avenues
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
Fairly, but not totally so.
I am not so anxious-prone
Kyle
Of course, being in med school does get a lot of people asking me stuff
But I don't mind as much
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
Do note, please; my body has become very much used to dimension-traversing, the hard way, but for Christine’s body, this is its First Time doing so.
It is versatile and durable, but still has accustoming to make within itself.
Kyle
Thats kind of why I wanted to recommend some works on parapsychology and research on
similar phenomena
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
Oh, how I wish the first time from this “Reality” Dimension into C-197 was instantaneous, rather than slow.
Kyle
If you can visit in a semi-corporal form, maybe thats more efficient?
Deleted User
https://mobile.twitter.com/wkbh1983/status/1179983714807189504 Jacob just tweeted
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
It is not.
I need to be fully-corporal and tangent to do things here.
Kyle
Hm, not my specialty, thats why I recommend you reading up on parapsychology here to understand this end better
Deleted User
@Deleted User What is this about The Merge being a side quest?
MKRNightVee
He just wants sex and the merge isn't important to him...
Kyle
If Christine gets a blood-test I can sort out some recommendations for best quality of life
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
It is not a side-quest; he is using the term loosely.
He is focusing on his self-improvement at this time.
He’s impulsively talking as he usually does at this time of night with his “sexy”-sona.
MKRNightVee
No he isn't, he just wants to possess Christine like an object, a sex toy. This is not improvement Magi-chan. There is no "sona" it's just Jacob.
Kyle
Instability is dangerous, what if something bad happens?
MKRNightVee
Something bad will happen if Jacob is involved...
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
Don’t be cynical.
MKRNightVee
I'm not, I'm being logical
Kyle
But if he's not responsible for this, what else could he be "not responsible" for?
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
Because We Have Foreseen his self-improvement and expunging of the remaining Darkness and Evils within him for Light Power.
And may I remind you all that he is set to sacrifice Himself in a battle between Christine and Jakoba.
And he is making his own sacrifices at the present time as well.
You all are not seeing it.
MKRNightVee
The future isn't set in stone and all paths with Jacob lead to ruin. But I'll leave it at that.
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
I am feeling tired right now, and need some rest before I impulsively feel worst insulted and I say something really awful.
Kyle
Sacrificial behaviour isn't exactly held as a positive factor
Chris (as Magi-Chan)
Do not doubt our premonitions.
That is all I will leave it at for now.
Good night

Merge priority
4-5 October 2019
What appears to be multiple Deleted Users chat with each other. One Deleted User role-plays as Jubali, an OC associated with Jacob Sockness. A Deleted User makes a comment dismissive of the Merge, and Chris replies the next morning to say the Merge is the highest priority.
Deleted User
@Deleted User type @here nice to meet you.
Jubali: Okay?
@Deleted User
hello.
What are your findings?
I'm intrigued.
Jubali: My findings is that nothing ever happened that links Jacob to any crimes. No legal course.
Ok.
This is a unique situation.
Nightvee is interesting although you on the other hand seem to weild exceptional power In a way I found unique.
How are you going to go about bringing the merge. I do not care for the merge I find there's more immediate issues that need to be attended to.
[5 October at 08:47 AM]
Chris
The merge is highest on the priorities.

Argument over Sockness, Iron Curtain clue
27-28 October 2019
MKRNightVee
@Deleted User
The game isn't about battling, if you paid the slightest bit of attention you would have seen that. You say you're interested in Christine yet you only care about pushing your OWN lore and creepy fetishes on her. Even lieing about her soul being in love with you to further manipulate her. If you really cared you wouldn't be so damn pushy. The rokat are disgusting, putrid, backwards, race of fictional monkey people I've ever encountered. These disgusting, rape apes have no place in Sonichu history. Jakoba is a useless leader who still advocates for slavery. So stop acting all high and mighty because from where I stand your the saddest excuse for a human being I've ever seen! And yes, you are human, the rokat arnt real and have no place in c-197 lore. As for the book, I can share excerpts from it, that's within my right and perfectly legal as the fair use laws state that copyrighted information can be shared for the purposes of critique and education. (edited)
Don't worry, you'll be cited as the author ;D
Christine, for the love of Emanuel don't you dare defend him.
Chris
I’d hate to argue, but I have a friendly meeting in Ruckersville with Jojo and Haichi to give them their cards.
But, just to be informative with no intention of arguing: Jakoba, the Rokat Empire and all that are very much real, and everything is happening in the sequence of Dimensional Merge events.
I will check y’all later.
Deleted User
Have a good day.
MKRNightVee
If they are real then they shouldn't be, they're disgusting.
I hope you have a good day
Chris

Firstly, that emoji response was I.
Second, 🙄 I agree on how gross their culture presently is.
But it is what it is.

Which book?

Chris
Hey, @everyone.
I continue to feel the massive incoming energies, magics and effects of the Merge.
I also have a discovery to inform y’all about.
I may have a clue on the frequency of the Iron Curtain.
Proumss had a dream last night of being in an empty area; able to be seen by me, but not by Princess Celestia, and she was able to read things from the visible objects.
And I quote, "A "Pm Am" a "8/12" stores".
I gather it may have to do with Time, being 8:12 AM and PM.
Maybe even something with the 7/11 stores as well.

@Deleted User
It is 100% fair use, showing the whole book would be copyright infringement. People can draw their own conclusions and if your worried about your reputation, maybe you should not have published the book for people to buy.
Kyle
@Sonichu982 Its like how super 8 motel used to be 8$ a night
Chris
Anyway, the signs are showing and everything is progressing as it is.
Even Proumss has personally verified after seeing the image of 8/12 that it was the very same thing she saw in her dream.
Aside from that, though, I got some more of my Promo cards in the mail today, and I was able to make another example Shipping grid.
Kyle
I mean, I've seen pictures of a lot of shops in China

Art request for Sockness lore
12 December 2019
Having thrown a tantrum over ProjectSNT's redesign of Wild Sonichu, Chris concludes that he had been bothered because he believes the character looks similar to a Rokat (a character invented by Jacob Sockness).
AquaDiamond8, concerned over Chris bringing up Sockness's lore, tries to persuade him not to elaborate on it. However, Chris then role-plays as Aqua's OC Val in an attempt to manipulate her into drawing artwork of Sockness's lore, requesting scenery of the Rokat and Kidasuna. Aqua stands her ground and refuses to draw the art. Chris relents and ends the role-play.
Chris
Hey, @everyone.
Just a revelation that really matters.
I have just figured out WHY Wild Sonirisu was giving me Triggered Vibes from looking at his face and tail.
He reminded me of one of the many individuals under the Rokat Empire (definitely looked like one of the grunts).
Reference the following cards.
The fact that I can look at Sonirisu without wincing also confirms it.
It was a note of a premonition.
Anyway...
My soul has been working and exploring in Dimension CS-89 to find the problem and resolve it.
I even met up with SNT who was whisked into the dimesnion from C-197 by Fated event.
We found that appartently the Rokat Empire has been importing from the D&D Dimension as well.
We just found them the short while ago.
I recognized their VR-Projected group working there.
Which makes sense as to Why they were undetectable before now.
Because of the number of MMORPG players who log in and access CS-89 all over, having their troops log in as well pretty much cloaks them.
This also explains some of the fated imports into C-197 and 1218, as the Rokat removed from CS-89, the dimension is having to naturally remove its own resources to save its enviroment.
AquaDiamond8
On the subject of the rokat and kidasuna i think it would be smart of not add them into the game, or speak about them. We know they are bad and that bringing them up and talking about them only gives them power. Plus Val would much less like to forget they ever existed, instead of being constantly reminded.
Chris
As Much as I would like to do the same, they are a force to be reconed with, and everyone will end up fighting them at the fated future event, regardless.
Chris (as Val)
Val - Aqua, I know I have stated that before, but I have witnessed and shared the details with both Magi-Chan Sonichu and Magi-Chan Sonola, as well as everyone else here.
Determined from our combined premonition powers in determining the better sequence of events, among which would certainly prevent this set of dimension of yours to stay safe and not destroyed at all.
Pokécord BOT
Congratulations ChrisChanSonichu1982!
Your "Inuyasha" is now level 43!
Chris (as Val)
We are taking advantage of Christine's abilities to turn this around in our favour.
John Bowed
Christine. for your role in the server, is there any color you would like?
Chris (as Val)
My apologies, but she will get back to you shortly on that question.
Anyway, We have a plan to make this work out.
AquaDiamond8
And whats the plan?
Chris (as Val)
using what has already been assembled by everyone between these local dimensions, as well as Christine's part of the Secret Shipfic Folder game, we actually can progress the Merge on a more suitable fated event to be.
We will still need the Kidasuna and Rokat sceneary imagery from you, Aqua.
But Christine is also integrating her local tools into the expansion pack to help out.
AquaDiamond8
Well about that, i dont feel comfortable with those drawings, as youve said, youd rather forget them, and im respecting your wishes Val
Chris (as Val)
She will also be including the temple's gazebo.
Oh, Please.
Even spirits deprived of their original body can still make an error or two.
For the better course of events, we do need to continue onward with this.
You have seen the Rokat have even intruded into the other local dimensions as well.
This is a moment where it is most appropriate for you to question my past decisions, Aqua.
For fated events can even supersede the most fortitude of minds.
I assure you this dimension will not fall apart in explosions or the sort.
AquaDiamond8
Ive made up my mind, ill be happy to draw other things, but i will not give them the recognition they dont deserve
Chris (as Val)
Hence the Sceneary.
You need only draw the sceneary; you do not need to draw the individuals occupying them.
Pokécord BOT
Congratulations ChrisChanSonichu1982!
Your "Inuyasha" is now level 44!

"The Rokat is like a vile virus that had spread throught this world. Please Aqua, as my oldest dearest friend, i beg you to cease this drawing of the rokat" Your words exactly
Pokécord BOT
Congratulations Aqua 2 Hydrated Boogaloo!
Your "Alucard" is now level 81!
Chris (as Val)
Quite.
Drawing the Rokat, personally.
The Sceneary and layouts of the Andromeda Galaxy, and their ships and planets are not the Rokat.
AquaDiamond8
As ive said ive made up my mind, and as you know once i do so i wont change it, i care alot for Val and i respect his wished
Chris (as Val)
Your heart remains as strong and fortitous on this, I see.
Very well, we shall work around this variable.
AquaDiamond8
It is, seeing and hearing what they did to your home i have no sympathy for beings like that, and how it stresses you out deeply affects me.
Chris (as Val)
I am grateful and humbled for that of you.
You realize there will be the head-on fated moments where even I will have to put aside my past and fight for the preservation of our future together.
I know this, and so do you.
Anyway, you may return to drawing what you like as you will, or what you will do.
I need to be here to help set things up with everyone else for the next fated event.
Meanwhile, Christine's soul remains working with SNT in CS-89 to take down their operation there.
AquaDiamond8
PLease remember that you are not bonded to Christine but to me, i know you have work, but your my partner not hers
Chris (as Val)
And her body is still here in central command, so to speak.
I shall return to you, Aqua.
I shall never leave you.
This is a temporary arrangement, and I will always have an eye on you.
But, as most other Magi-Chan Sonichus do, I must go out and work with others as well and seek what I need to for the better answers towards the better appropriate futures for all of us.
You know I was humbled and same in my old body.
You drew me in the sweater smiling, with that mug of hot drink.
I just took a moment to enjoy Christine's hot green tea with lemon, equal, and a hint of the PlayersGuide Daisy, from her father's favourite mug.
It is humbling and comforting.
I will also mention, in observation: the cold virus does suck, indeed.
This nasal feeling.

At least, not these physical viruses.
We shall see to her and Cryzel's swift recovery.
AquaDiamond8
well i hope they fell better soon
Chris (as Val)
I shall leave Christine's Body for now and allow her to resume for herself.
I will always care mainly for you, Aqua, but I must make positive I save and preserve the Prime Chris Chan Sonichu for the sake of all others and everyone else.
I love you.
Chris
Christine - Every time I get possessed, it does get a bit wild.
AquaDiamond8
Love him too
Chris
@John Bowed, Blue for my colour, if you would, please.
I will not press on you for any more art that you do not feel at ease drawing.
All things considered, you have done very well, indeed, Aqua.
As you will, please continue to do your best.
Meanwhile, my tasks and paths continue to become more clear and obvious.
AquaDiamond8
Thank you Christine. im more than happy to draw anything else
Chris
🙂
Free-Draw as you will.
I look forward to all of your art pieces.
I'm going back to my work.
I'll check back with y'all later.
Thank You All.

Marvin blocks Sockness, fated Pokemon card
23 December 2019
Chris
I see @Marvin has sought
opportunity to block Jacob’s @PKidasuna account on my Twitter on my behalf.
Jake has just texted me telling me that his account was blocked by me, which I had not done.
And his resulting texts were what we were trying to avoid.
Looks like this was Fated; now he will be more unlikely to post his and Jakoba’s activities online for surveillance. (edited)
I did not reply to his texts, but they were quite menacing as ever.
Jakoba must be getting desperate.
MKRNightVee
But with our psychic powers shouldn't we be able to see what he's up to with that?
Chris
He’s stupidly claiming he has greater power and shouting at me.
I’m not going to let him get to me.
More or less; these abilities have yet to be fully perfected with me, but are getting there.
AquaDiamond8
Thats very good of you Christine. together we wont let him win, and hes only screaming cause he knows hes lost
Chris
Yes.
At least my adventure into C-197 is better apparent.
The One Card I have been waiting to find and acquire at random from a Pack has finally appeared unto me.
It was foreseen and told to me over a month ago that when I receive my first copy of this card, the merge will further progress.

What does it mean, Christine?
Chris
The Art is not the topic, but it is the same art as I had foreseen as well in out of the four variants I would pull.
Simply Put, though:
Kyle
Stuff like the Drake equation, I've wanted to draft an inverse of that for coincidence and some idea of predestination.
Chris
I will be crossing into C-197, fully, safely and alive, with my body, very soon, likely along with this house and property, mom, and all critters within.
Kyle
Thing is, the Drake equation is flawed from the get go.
Chris
Also, magic levels will have reached an optimal minimum level in 1218 for our needs.
Kyle
Optimal minimum seems like an odd way of describing it, requisite minimum?
Chris
And everything will be in better progression.
Fine
Whatever terminology, Mister Grammer-Check.
Deleted User
Does that mean you'll be leaving us?...
Chris
Pardon, but it is annoying.
Kyle
My whole life is incessant terminology.

Logic as a field of study, thats my favorite thing.

Anyway, that is all of the update I have for now; I will check in again later.

Delusion disclosure: This article or section takes place during Chris's phase of role-playing as Sonichu. He may refer to his Christine Chandler personality and physical body in the third person by using terms such as "mama".
Unblocking Sockness
17 November 2020
Chris chatted in response to criticism from Watchmen members over his decision to unblock Jacob Sockness's Twitter account. Chris had still wanted validation from Sockness, saying "his tweets do need to be personally monitored at times," though insisting he was not talking with Sockness. In response, Kyle offered to monitor Sockness's Twitter instead, and Chris agreed to reblock Sockness.
MKRNightVee
Just a quick question but, why the heck would you unblock Jacob?
Val
Hmmmm
Kyle
...
Chris (as Sonichu)
We felt need to keep the better tabs on him from the main account on Twitter. He is muted to us, and we are not following him. We continue to have no direct contact or communication with him and his allies.
Kyle
I can do that well enough, delegate.
Chris (as Sonichu)
It is a more crucial time right now that we are able to find him in the search bar; while he was blocked, he did not come up in the search results.
I do realize the drawback of him now refollowing us.
Kyle
And that fucking idiot won't say anything interesting in 100 years.
Naught
I am dissapoint
Chris (as Sonichu)
Well, I am sorry. You need not worry. I am having absolutely nothing to do with him at this time.
But his tweets do need to be personally monitored at times.
And you need not be disappointed, Bis.
Kyle
Which is why I said I'd do it.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Yes, and I do appreciate that work, Kyle,
I suppose I can reblock him.
There
Kyle
Not exactly aware of what kind of tabs would be relevant, suffice to say he's the least relevant person to have ever lived.
Val
Nova speaks the truth
Chris (as Sonichu)
We would agree
But you all are aware of the time over a year ago when Jake tried to summon Christine to his place in California with that doll as a sacrifice?
Kyle
Works in cycles, trying to solicit hookers for free, threatening the governor, threatening Chris and sockpuppeting as his own rapist.
I remember any of the 20 "ghost" photos he uses at any given time to mean different things.
Val
You mean the household objects with bad photography and filters?
Kyle
^ Always.
Chris (as Sonichu)
While he did not summon her nor this body, he ended up summoning a massive number of Chris Chan doppelgängers from distant and blank timelines, and they all were born into this dimension on the same day of February 24, 1982.
Val
Interesting, explain
Chris (as Sonichu)
Hereto, all of them slowly dying out during this time in favour of the OG soul and body, here.
Kyle
The threshold must be really low.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Why do you think there are many people with similar features in the face, at least, in comparison to her.
Kyle
Given he has absolutely 0 knowledge of literally anything, I doubt that happened on purpose.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Even Liquid Chris was one of them.

Kyle
Uhm, could the facial blindness mean you're perhaps not the best judge of that?
Chris (as Sonichu)

Naught
I've dealt with Jacob I've given you his non-answers.
Kyle

Val

MKRNightVee
Jacob is a loser
Chris (as Sonichu)
Good grief.
MKRNightVee

Chris (as Sonichu)

Kyle

Kyle
Well as long as its done forever.
Chris (as Sonichu)
Yeah, it was a bad impulse.
MKRNightVee
Its ok
Chris (as Sonichu)
I wish to change the subject.
