NOTE: Chris was not directly involved in this drama.
This article is still yet to be completed due to stress. We get a lot of stressful torture in our lives that makes us crash into slumber. Given that inspiration is a big variable, and we may have been lacking of it, this article will be completed as soon as possible, at our own pace... HONEST! This article is missing the following:
• Formatting, merge in info from Naught, The WCT, MKRNightVee, The Place
This page summarizes Watchmen infighting drama that occurred within the Watchmen group. Most of this drama primarily involved the members Anaxis and The WCT. This made Chris alienate himself from what he called "the toxic trio" (consisting of Naught, MKRNightVee, and Kyle), and made it easier for the WCT to convince him to leave the Place.
Banning of Anaxis
In November-December 2020, MKRNightVee, upset upon discovering she had been demodded from the Official CWCki Server, threw a tantrum at Anaxis, then-owner of the server, attempting to goad him into returning the role to her. Anaxis declined to do so, explaining she had been demodded by his predecessor for lack of activity in the server.[1][2]
Another factor of this came from Anaxis disagreeing with other Watchmen about Christubers.
Doxing of The WCT
“
I doxed Sean since he asked me to use his Logan account on kiwi farms, and I said no.
Yet, when I was banned from kiwi farms he said no, so i doxed him it didn't help he kept blaming me for striking his video's as he worked with lolcow.org to make a thread on me.
”
An actual edit from Naught, admitting to have doxed The WCT.[3]
On 28 June 2021, in the wake of more infighting between Naught and The WCT, which stemmed from Naught posting The WCT's dox for declining to share his Kiwi Farms account,[3] the former Watchmen member Spunky wrote an account on the website lolcow.org alleging that Naught had used her Kiwi Farms account for his own purposes and that she was consistently belittled by both Naught and MKR in their server.[4]
After being banned from the Kiwi Farms for socking, Naught had asked The WCT to make use of his Logan account, which The WCT had declined in doing. Before this, The WCT had asked Naught to use his account, which he declined. Both of these followed in Naught obtaining WCT's dox from both lolcow.org and /cow/.[3] In June 2021, The WCT was doxed on Kiwi Farms by a Kiwi Farms account named Nightmare. An account on the Kiwi Farms splinter site lolcow.org had also joined under a VPN under the screen name "WCT Hate", whose sole purpose was to dox The WCT. Signs pointed to fellow Watchman and group leader Naught as the person behind both of the accounts.[5] Though Naught initially denied being behind Nightmare, he later admitted to it.[3]
When The WCT confronted Naught in a voice chat during the group’s movie night on 21 June, Naught denied the allegation, then threatened to further dox The WCT in an attempt to silence him. Kyle and MKRNightVee took Naught's side in the dispute.[6] From there, a conflict arose between Naught and The WCT.
Following a Lolcow.org thread on the ex-member of the group, an audio voice clip of Chris saying “Fuck Bismuth!”[7] suggested that Chris sided against Naught in the dispute. The WCT had also encouraged Chris to cut ties with Naught, Kyle and MKR.
On 6 July 2021, The WCT's eponymous YouTube channel received a strike. He accused Naught of being behind the strike, both to Naught[3] and to Chris.[8] WCT provided an image to Chris saying that Naught "basically admitted" to being behind the strike, although the image has been lost.[8] Naught has claimed that he believes WCT's accusations provide him justification for doxing him (even though the dox took place weeks prior).
On 20 July 2021, The WCT collaborated with Bella in an attempt to dox Naught back.[9] Naught had admitted to doxing The WCT on the Onion Farms on 30 August 2021,[10] and again on 29 November 2021 via an edit on his page, providing details about the dox.
