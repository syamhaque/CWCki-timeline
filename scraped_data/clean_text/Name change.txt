Chris has changed his name twice officially. The first change of name was in late 1993/early 1994 when following an encounter with the Godbear. The second change of name was in May 2016 when he officially transitioned from Christian to Christine. In between this Chris has gone by dozens of different monikers and post-Idea guys his various aliases have only grown. It can be noted that Chris will incorporate characters from his comic book, Sonichu and LARP as them in real life as a form of escapism, or maybe as a symptom of mental breakdown.

Christopher to Christian
Main article: Christopher's name change
It was by the almighty grace of the Godbear to inspire young Christopher to get his True and Honest name. Chris revealed this information in CHRIS!!! CHANDLER!!!. In a news article run by the Richmond Times-Dispatch[1] following his name change at the age of 10, Robert reveals that he had wanted to name his son Christian, but was too chicken.
The story goes that when visiting the Regency Mall Chris and his parents came across a performance of the Bearstein Symphony Orchestra. The Orchestra features an anthropomorphic bear as it's conductor, which with human control is designed to be fully interactive with the audience. The bear can speak to the audience and receive questions, engaging in conversation. Chris became enamoured with the bear and started talking to it. It is most likely that a combination of Chris' mumbling, poor microphone/headset quality and the human operator mishearing him resulted in the Godbear addressing Christopher as Christian. It's unknown to anyone besides Chris why he latched onto this new name, but it couldn't help that his parents went through with a legal name change at the request of their 10 year old son.
Christian to Christine
Court record approving the name change.
In May of 2016, after roughly 5 years of exploring his feminine side Christian decided to officially transition from male to female. Christian submitted a name change request which was approved, officially and legally changing his True and Honest name to Christine. Chris has at times become annoyed with people referring to him as "Chris" or "Christian", even though his twitter username contains "Chris Chan". He has also paradoxically claimed that he doesn't mind what people call him[2], although he contradicts himself almost immediately.
Unofficial name changes
Chris has gone by dozens of unofficial names, for a more complete list check out this page. Below are some of the funniest/most notable.
Ricardo
Ricardo Weston Chandler is Chris' Spanish nom de guerre. During Chris' Spanish classes through high school he used the name Ricardo whenever speaking or writing in Spanish. It is common that foreign language students may adopt a native translation of their own name, but it is not common for students to pick an entirely new name like Chris had done. Chris continued to use the name Ricardo whenever speaking/typing in Spanish for years after high school, and sometimes used it as an alias during the classic era.
JenkinsJinkies
JenkinsJinkies was a persona that Chris adopted in 2010 in order to infiltrate the Trollin' Train forum in order to investigate the plans of infamous trolls such as Clyde Cash, Billy Mays, Jack Thaddeus and other members of the Miscreants. Using this persona Chris tried to make members of the Trollin' Train forum believe that JenkinsJinkies was a bi-curious teenager who lived across the street from Chris at 14 Branchland Court. For bizarre and unknown reasons Chris included graphic details of JenkinsJinkies being raped at 7 years old, and details of homosexual encounters between himself and two gay friends. None of this actually happened to Chris and the assumption is that he included these details because he believed every troll was a homosexual teenager. Chris abandoned the online alias after he got scared that the police would arrest him for being a troll, since he had association to the forum. A completely retarded notion.
"The master of disguise, Chris as JenkinsJinkies"
Ian Brandon Anderson
Ian Brandon Anderson is a name given to Chris (it is important to note that he did not choose this name for himself). In late 2009 Chris' YouTube account CChanSonichu had been hacked and he was forced to create a new account, which he named IBAChandler as a play on words (I-Be-A-Chandler). Trolls quickly picked up on this and accused Chris of being an imposter, named Ian Brandon Anderson for the IBA at the beginning of his YouTube username. The troll Liquid Chris compounded on this by declaring himself the one TRUE AND HONEST Christian Weston Chandler. Chris went into a rage over this and harboured a grudge against that damn
Ian Brandon Something for years after Liquid Chris stopped trolling him.
Carlos Chantor
Looking for some more cash to supplement the monthly tugboat and seeking to end the Love Quest Chris briefly advertised his services as a male escort between April and June of 2010 under the alias of Carlos Chantor. At first he tried to sign up for the Charlottesville "Naughty and Nice" escort service but was rejected for obvious reasons.
"Experienced for Her Pleasure. Chris as Carlos Chantor."
He created an account on Escorts.com and advertised himself as "Experienced for her pleasure". In an astounding display of retardation Chris distributed business cards advertising his services in the Charlottesville area, apparently oblivious to the fact that prostitution is illegal in Virginia. Chris dropped the Carlos Chantor alias by summer 2010 when he shut down his Escorts.com profile, having pleased no clients.
CPU Blue Heart
CPU Blue Heart is a CPU Goddess of the nation of Cwcville and the Commodore computers. This autistic alias was implanted on Chris' naive mind by the Idea Guys in November 2017. The alias is inspired by an anime Hyperdimension Neptunia which the Idea Guys adopted many concepts from. Chris uses this alter-ego to spout prophecies for the Dimensional Merge, a fictional belief that our universe and one containing all the "OC's" (Comic book characters, Chris' custom characters like Sonichu and movie characters) will collide, resulting in anthropomorphic sonic-pikachu mutants roaming the streets.
Chris sometimes roleplays on Twitter in-character as CPU Blue Heart, mostly posting nonsensical ramblings about the incoming merge as a coping mechanism, or praising his devotee's.
Mama
"Mama" is a creepy alias that Chris uses for himself in third-person when he claims he is "possessed" by one of his OC's. Chris most commonly uses this in Discord messages or Twitter posts where he LARPS as a fictional character, and praises himself.
Sonichu/Magichan
Sonichu is one of Chris' fictional characters, and the titular antagonist of the Sonichu Comics. Chris will, on occasion, jump on his computer and LARP online about being possessed by this character. As aforementioned he will creepily refer to himself as "Mama" and will talk about the happenings in Dimension C-197. Magi-chan is similar, being a fictional character that Chris created for his comic. After being manipulated by the Idea Guys Chris now believes (or LARPS) that the character is real, and acts as if Magi-Chan is his real life friend and husband. This can be seen most notably during the Incest Arrest where Chris warns police officers that his husband Magi-Chan is punching them.
Jesus Christ Chan Sonichu
In a phone call from jail in January 2022 Chris referred to himself as Jesus Christ Chan Sonichu. He attempted to induct members of the public into his religion and professed his innocence in connection to the incest charge he faced.
Jesus Christine Weston Chandler Sonichu Prime
In a long and boring livestream from November 2023 Chris refers to himself using this extremely long-winded and self-important title. Notably Chris delivers blessings unto his loyal devotees while playing Tetris.[3]
