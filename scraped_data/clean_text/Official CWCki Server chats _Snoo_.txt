Rolling Away Drawing
23 August 2020
Fiona shares a drawing that she made of Chris in the Hedgehog-defensive state, which she then uploads on this website under the alias "Chris Chan's Chris Fan".

Nikocado Avacado
23 September 2020
Klop asks Fiona if she watches the content from Nikocado Avacado, likely due to him being a grotesque, overweight male; a kink that Fiona has expressed on the server on multiple ocassions. Fiona explains that she's repulsed by Nikocado, but yet she does not have these same feelings towards Chris, despite their similarities. This implies that she views Chris as a special case for this sort of attraction, though Fiona also attributes her repulsion to Nikocado to how he handles food in his videos.
Klop
you watch nikocado?, snoo
Snoo (Fiona)
@jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj no I don't
Klop
you should
Snoo (Fiona)
I feel actually repulsed by Nikocado
Klop
perfect content for you
Snoo (Fiona)
I know about him and his scandals
Klop
"scandals"
Snoo (Fiona)

Klop

Deleted User
@jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj like him crying and losing his sanity overtime
Deleted User
@jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj didn't Nikocado post an ass pic online in a failed attempt to get fans?
Klop
he posted everything
everything
multiple times
Snoo (Fiona)
For some reason Chris Chan doesn't gross me out like Nikocado does.
I think it has to do with food. Like when I see people being exceptionally gross with food like Nikocado, I can't stand it

Chris Chan Copypasta

Fiona creates a copypasta that's meant to be read in Chris's voice, and posts it on the server.

Fiona's Departure
30 October 2020
Two days after Fiona left the CWCki server, a group of server members discuss her departure. One of the server's former mods (Santa Claws) explains that Fiona leaked both her DMs and those of Anaxis publically to a trolling group, which made both of them upset with her. Fiona and some of the other members of the group had left the server before they got banned.
captain torres
Is snoo still in the server?
I cant @ her
Abaddon
no she is not
captain torres
What happened? Lol
Abaddon
I don't know, I DMed her but she's not online
captain torres
I just tried too
Think she blocked me tho rip
Deleted User
Are you on her friends list?
SantaClaws
She left here
captain torres
Why tho?
SantaClaws
She posted private DMs from 2 mods publically
Then she chose to leave
She thought the mods were overracting
Being angry she leaked DMs
She leaked mine, very personal ones
It hurt a lot
captain torres
Why did she leak em anyway?
SantaClaws
I dont know
She knew it was a shitty thing to do
Yet she did it anyway
She left the server
And hasnt contacted me
Since
captain torres
Well i hope she realizes how shitty that is
Abaddon
dang that's weird and not very cool
captain torres
Im not cool with people leaking my DMs
So i understand
Abaddon
I'm into humiliation as much and probably more than the next guy, but you gotta ask permission before doing something like that
SantaClaws
Yes, it sucked because i was very paranoid at the moment, and i was upset by some things i had heard about her...so i dmed her personal stuff
And she leaked it
Without asking me
She leaked private dms from anaxis on here too
He felt very betrayed i think
He didnt say that, but he was hurt by it
He liked Snoo
So did I
Then she did that

Alt Account
13 December 2020
After getting banned from the CWCki server, Fiona, seemingly unaware of her ban, returned under an alt and posted the following in both the #general and #spam-zone channels. She @'d the entire server when posting in the #general channel.
Fiona
Hello, it's me. SNOO.
Remember?
I kinda scroll through here at times and it seems like y'all are still interested in talking about me, whether it be mean spirited or not.
It seems like a month after I left this server you guys seemed to really miss me.
Currently I am actually 18, so I'm not a minor anymore.
But I'm sorry for the ill will I have sent towards you guys, and I know that the leaked messages were a big deal for you, and I didn't realize it at the time.
Just saying I'm still here
