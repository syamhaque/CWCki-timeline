Chris's response.
June was the sixth month of 2017. This month saw Chris re-appear on TV (yep!), and finally finish an issue of Sonichu after a seven-year gap.
Highlights
2 June - Chris is spotted at a Wal-Mart by a Reddit user.
3 June - Chris uploads a drawing of himself as an MLP character and replies to a couple of fan questions. Later, he uploads a fanart of his OC mingling with MLP characters and tweets it to a voice actress for the show. He also gets mad at trolls who sabotaged his shot at the Best of C-Ville poll.
4 June - Chris revamps his Patreon rewards and uploads eight Sonichu 11 pages as patron-only.
5 June - A Kiwi Farms user leaks the Sonichu 11 pages Chris had set as Patreon exclusives.
7 June - Chris promotes his revamped Patreon on video and does another drawing livestream.
10 June - Chris announces a delay in new comic pages and comments on his weekend plans to attend an LGBT event and play Pokemon.
11 June - Chris solicits fan ideas for Sonichu.
12 June - Chris attends UVA Remembers Pulse, reads a piece he wrote on his transgender identity, and is quoted by news media.
13 June - Chris posts Sonichu 11 pages 62-70 to Patreon.
16 June - Barb begs for food money, while wearing both a $400 gold necklace and a pearl necklace. Shortly after, Chris posts an in-progress Sonichu page to Patreon and begs on that platform for grocery money.
30 June - Nearly eight years after beginning the project, Chris completes Sonichu 11.
