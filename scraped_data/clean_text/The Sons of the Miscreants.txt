NOTE: Chris was not directly involved in this conversation.
Group description.
The Sons of the Miscreants was a troll Discord server active somewhere between 27 December 2018 to 21 January 2019. It is named after The Miscreants, an earlier group of trolls led by Clyde Cash during the Classic Chris era. In the server's "the-sons-of-the-miscreantscult-of-clyde" channel, MKRNightVee (using a Discord account named thepixietailartist) recruited users to pose as CPUs to chat with Chris and discussed some of her interactions with Chris. The dates of most of the chats are unknown but occurred prior to 21 January 2019 when screenshots were uploaded to Kiwi Farms.[1]

EVERYONE GO ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS
Tenno
Pixie, I apologise about my tweet earlier (I'm UchihaBorn3665 on Twitter)
MKRNightVee
Nights is the hottest clown
offline
i feel like we should bring in a new twitter
Megan
MKR describes how Chris had wanted to use her to get in contact with Megan Schroeder but MKR declined out of concern for Megan.
MKRNightVee
Chris asked me to "befriend" her and help him resume communication. I politely declined. That poor woman has been through enough of chris's bullshit
pathetic
doesnt she have an etsy store? (edited)
MKRNightVee
She has a Facebook?
Vamponetta
How'd you make proper contact?
MKRNightVee
I didn't, I wasn't going to try and put megan through that
Vamponetta
No I mean with Chris
MKRNightVee
Oh, twitter
Motives
MKRNightVee
A little bit, but I also was very kind to Chris, a friend found his number online and to my surprise he answered my texts
Vamponetta
Ah
MKRNightVee
My goal isnt to feed into his delusions so much as it is to gently offer kind advice and be there as a shoulder to lean on for moral support
I'm trying to help him better himself
Delusions
[cutoff]
Tenno
S.O.M?
Vamponetta
Sons of the Miscreants. We're keeping to the metal gear theme of Christory
Tenno
Ah
Vamponetta
Cuz Clyde had the Miscreants which were the Patriots. The Patriots were succeeded by Sop, Sons of the Patriots
Tenno
Ah
Vamponetta
Yeah
MKRNightVee
Knowing chris, he will likely ignore that it exists and block those that bring it up. These days, if he doesn't like it, and it doesn't come from an idea guy, he wont put it in his imaginary world
Great New Content
MKR shows photos of Chris's custom Lego Sonichu minifigs.
MKRNightVee
I've got some great new content for you
Vamponetta
Oh?
MKRNightVee
All sonichu minifigs
Vamponetta
Ah
MKRNightVee
Beautiful arnt they
Chris Access
Server members ask MKR (thepixietailartist) to get Chris to accept their friend requests.
offline
I just had an idea
pixie is on the inside
she can get Chris to accept our friend requests
Tenno
I was gonna say. I better not be mercy.
But no, I also sent him a friend request
I may hate him, but I'm great at acting
offline
@thepixietailartist think you can pull this off?
she's CWCSonichu, 6540 right
Tenno
@thepixietailartist can you draw like some random sonichu fan art or some shit for me? I don't think if he does end up accepting, he'd accept me.
I would but...
I'm legit shit at drawing
offline
so is Chris
Tenno
"hey guys, this is stickachu of the stick sonichu world"
[posts a drawing]
This is something I drew in middle school for an anime I like

Take a picture of sanic, tape it to a window, put another piece of paper over it, and follow along the lines.

Tenno

MKRNightVee

offline

MKRNightVee
Try posing as a girl with big titties
Tenno
Okay!
I'll do that!
Don't judge me!!
offline
I am a girl with big titties, but I'm not using my body for Chris
that's an insult to my body
Tenno
Wait what the fuck
pathetic

Tenno
I gotta stop assuming people are guys at first I fucking swear
pathetic
back pain can go fuck itself.

MKRNightVee
It's kinda flattering I guess?
He had me make a medallion, by crystals that he uses and started answering my text faster than before
Tenno

Will Chrisu ever love me
offline

Promethean

offline

pathetic

MKRNightVee
Medallion
offline
that has way more effort than necessary
MKRNightVee
As for the friend thing, I just made lots of fan art and white knighted chris's twitter
Yeah, but I love doing arts and crafts ^-^ so I had fun making it out of Crayola fucking model magic
offline
is it made out of Crayola Fucking Model Magic
MKRNightVee
Yes
offline

gas, gas, gas!
chris hasn't mentioned the treadmill in a while
MKRNightVee
He called me when he gave me his new number
Bragged about doing three whole minutes on the 300 setting
Chris Chat Rules
MKR guides server members on how to use Chris's CPU delusions to chat with him and lays out basic rules.
offline
ok I'm gonna run my plan by you
as someone who knows Chris better than anyone here tell me if we can put this in action
MKRNightVee
Ok?
offline
I'm going to pretend I'm CPU green Heart, long story short, I have a story drafted about how Arfoire gained interdimensional power when the merge started, and because of Chris's ties to it neptunia was one of the first dimensions affected and then Arfoire killed vert, the original green heart, sealing away her powers until Chris defeated her in the body of Jessica Quinn and the powers passed to me
offline
what do you think? would she believe it
MKRNightVee
It could work, except for one thing... Chris has a "direct" contact with vert, so you'd probably be dismissed as a troll. I can get you into a discord server with chis however I have some rules
offline
alright, how do I work around that then I've done like 5 minutes of neptunia research, how do I explain away the direct contact
MKRNightVee
1. Do not directly try to troll chris, I know it sounds fun to mess with him, but please don't.
2. You must create a CPU, for a color pick something other then the following: magenta, turquoise, green, blue, red, maroon, white, black, purple.
Promethean
I want yellow
MKRNightVee
3. You must play along with the CPU thing
gas, gas, gas!
CPU lavender?
offline
really all I have planned is the cpu part
offline
I have no clue what I'll do after that, so we're good,
MKRNightVee
4. You must get some sort of fanart ready of your chosen CPU sona and make an "original", pokemon/sanic abomination
Tenno
Add my troll Twitter: @DarekaScott
MKRNightVee
gas, gas, gas!
i'll just use weebfriend's shitty blake belladonna ripoff oc or create something else
gremlin knows who i'm talking about
offline
I do
MKRNightVee
This is my discord, verify here with me before I will add you to the Chris server
offline
can the fanart come later? I don't have any means to draw at the moment
Tenno
I'll look for a sonichu fanart online...
MKRNightVee
Yeah, just get at least a general description going for it
pathetic
hyper dimensional neptunia (edited)
Writing Lore
Server members continue to write backstories for their personas to use in being enablers to Chris.
MKRNightVee
Also you will need a console, I advise you find an obscure one, or just make shit up
gas, gas, gas!
blake bellaripoff's actual name is irene but i might make a tweak to it
gas, gas, gas!
to seem weebish i might name her kokomi
offline
I'm gonna be the Soulja Game
gas, gas, gas!
funny thing is im actually drawing irene for weebfriend for her stupid youtube channel icon

Tenno

MKRNightVee
If "nightvee" will work, I think just about anything could
MKRNightVee
It's up to you gas
Just be sure to make a separate discord for your own safety
Tenno
I'll be cpu PinkPetal
MKRNightVee
Spots are limited, there are 18 more CPUs to "find"
gas, gas, gas!
ima make up one anyway even if i don't do this
CPU Lavender, or Kokomi Rosaline, Age 19 because i'm not a creep like chris, she's a angel-demon- werewolf hybrid oh and she's also half-android because i said so
Tenno
im on my chromebook rn typing this, im logging out and creating the cpu account
gas, gas, gas!
her pokemonsona is Mr Mime (edited)
offline
and I'm CPU Gold Heart, also known on Earth as Nanami Tezuka; age 23, possesses the memories and experiences of all former CPUs
gas, gas, gas!
and since alot of chris's oc's have anime references tacked on to this, her namesake is Kokomi Teruhashi from Saiki K, she has some distant relationship to Botan from Yu Yu Hakusho and can do the rose whip thing Kurama can do
offline
calls herself "The Guardian" to sound cool; says everybody else does as well, but it's really just her (edited)
MKRNightVee
[posts a drawing of Sonic and Nights]
offline
has a strange love for saltine crackers and an irrational fear of the color beige, presumably from the memories of CPU Beige Heart, who died in 1983 when the realm of Ataria, the one he controlled, crashed to the earth

You think he'd notice if a character was traced from Sonic Boom Sonic but the arms weren't blue?

MKRNightVee
Yes

Eh not really
I just trust owls judgment better than my own and hes more helpful at the dos and don'ts of chris
XD
Tenno
I'm just flat out smart.
I know what to do and what not to do without being told. Plus I'm good for laughs with how well
my acting is.
Block Theories
Vamponetta
So woke up and checked Twitter. The hell was Chris doing at 4 AM tweeting about getting blocked by somebody? Is he turning into Trump?
CPUPinkHeart (Tenno)
He ranted about getting blocked by Doopie DoOver. I haven't slept a wink so I'm watching Naruto
⊕αdrïαx
How is Chris getting blocked so much
Vamponetta
Well Doopie blocked him because he was harassing her through her business e-mail and on Twitter. As fir the others, allegedly Chris either says something creepy to them or people let the creators know what kind of person is following them
They, in turn, block him to avoid being the next target
⊕αdrïαx
Don't see why Chris would be that threatening
Vamponetta
They don't want him creeping on them
The 3rd reason, and this is according to Chris after Nowacking blocked him, is that trolls bully and harass people he admires until they agree to block him
⊕αdrïαx
There's a lot of creeps out there though
Oh damn
Vamponetta
I'm convinced Chris was being annoying and trying to get Nowacking to be a heartsweet since they're both trans and Chris was a pain at Bronycon
My personal theory on that particular block
And there is proof he's like that since that's part of why Tabitha St. Germain blocked him
⊕αdrïαx
So Chris is acting dumb and innocent
Vamponetta
More or less.
Doesn't change how he has nobody to blame but himself most of the time
Vamponetta
So just found this out, but apparently if you email Chris at his new email address you can get flagged as spam. GiBi lost a junk Gmail for sending 1 email to Chris
⊕αdrïαx
Weird
Vamponetta
Idk if it was Chris reporting it or just Google's algorithm, but just a heads up
CPUGoldHeart
no sorry, nobody picked mercy
