This article, like Chris's pickle, is a bit small. You can help CWCki by expanding it.
An orbiter wave refers to a period in Christory where there is a sudden surge in new followers and orbiters, typically as a result of something particularly shocking or notable he did.
Soon after chunks of the incest call were leaked on 30 July 2021, the affair became the 4th trending hashtag on Twitter. As a result of this and the following mainstream media coverage, thousands of people were exposed to Chris for the first time. Out of this new infamy an orbiter wave arose. It is dubbed as such due to the sheer volume of new people following Chris's life story. These people can be roughly broken down into three groups:
Those who were curious to see what went wrong in his life leading up to the alleged fucking of his own mother.
Those who saw him as nothing more than another deranged sex pest, blissfully unaware of Christory.
This page will primarily focus on the more notable examples of these people, most of whom either wanted to take full advantage of the growing awareness of Chris and his life story and used their platform to attempt to profit off of it, or indirectly found themselves involved in Christory through their actions, all of whom do not have enough material for their own article otherwise.
Examples
